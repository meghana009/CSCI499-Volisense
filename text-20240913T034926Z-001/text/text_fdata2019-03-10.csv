the explanation for the sudden halt in global economic growth is found in the coincidence of peak credit combining with trade protectionism the history of economic downturns points to a rerun of the 1929 32 period but with fiat currencies substituted for a gold standard government finances are in far worse shape today and markets have yet to appreciate the consequences of just a moderate contraction in global trade between new issues and liquidation by foreigners domestic buyers will need to absorb 2 trillion of us treasuries in the coming year so qe is bound to return with a vengeance the last hurrah for fiat currencies however china and russia have the means to escape this fate assuming they have the gumption to do so introduction it may be too early to say the world is entering a significant economic downturn but even ardent bulls must admit to it as an increasing possibility financial analysts both bovine and ursine face a complex matrix of factors when judging the future effect of any downturn on currencies and of the prospects for the dollar in particular some will take the view that a global downturn will continue to drive foreign currencies to be sold for dollars because dollars are perceived to be less risky and required to repay debt some will point to the tension in the euro from the extra twist an economic downturn gives to the debt crisis forced on italy and the other three pigs compared with the relative stability of the hanseatic nations some analysts will expect china to get her comeuppance when her debt fuelled economy implodes into crisis as a recession progresses it is conventional to think of the dollar as a safe haven for a brief time relative to other currencies this might be true but what then those that succeed in their analysis beyond the short term will do so by discarding all bias they could then observe that in the event an economic downturn gathers pace a split could emerge in relative outcomes between east and west the effect of a downturn on the asian bloc led by china russia and now joined by india is likely to differ from the effect on america and europe it is the new versus the old asian mercantile states that provide minimal welfare differing from the more mature welfare heavy nations when we consider these two groups we tend to analyse the situation through the lens of our own prejudices remove this predisposition and it should become clear that whatever the starting point in terms of debt to gdp and other metrics the prospects for welfare light nations are considerably better in a global economic downturn than they are for nations burdened by extensive welfare obligations china and other asian states will not face the same degree of debt escalation as america japan the uk and the european nations furthermore asia has far more dynamic economies with the potential for a continuing industrial revolution government finances will be central to outcomes given that all government finances deteriorate during economic downturns the starting point and the pace of debt escalation are what should concern us china s overall debt to gdp ratio at approximately 260 compares with that of the us which is around 360 so on that score china s total debt is significantly less the us government s debt to gdp stands at over 100 while china s is estimated to be under 45 yet western analysts perceive china to be in a weaker debt position than the us america s principal strength which everyone cites is the reserve role of her currency everyone needs dollars all countries without sophisticated financial markets in their own currencies borrow in dollars which must eventually be repaid everything from commodity prices to global financial markets is referenced in dollars the dollar has also become weaponised the means of enforcing america s foreign policy it is the king rat of the currency world so long as the world enjoys continual economic growth the dollar is difficult to challenge when the economic tide turns everything becomes different in this article i explain why the global economy is heading for a crisis which could be similar in scale to the great depression if this analysis is correct then the dollar s prospects as the global reserve currency even its continuing existence will be threatened and must be reassessed in that light peak credit is coinciding with trade protection in a previous article i pointed out the catastrophic danger of combining trade protectionism with the top of the credit cycle this combination was devastating when the smoot hawley tariff act was passed by congress in october 1929 particularly when compared with the relatively minor consequences of the fordney mccumber tariffs of 1922 the difference was fordney mccumber was introduced early in the credit cycle and smoot hawley at its peak this dissimilarity was the principal driver behind the viciousness of the wall street crash and the subsequent global depression we have a situation today so similar to smoot hawley and its coincidence with the top of the credit cycle in 1929 that we should be deeply concerned what is particularly alarming is that international trade appears to have already stopped expanding almost as if it has run into a brick wall a comparison with the 1929 experience suggests this result as extremely likely that precedent warns us today s international trade may be rapidly sliding from expansion into severe contraction with dire consequences for the whole global economy smoot hawley and the top of the credit cycle in 1929 combined into the motive force that made the great depression unnecessarily deep global and intractable the impact on government debt funding will be immense the question then arises as to how a top of the credit cycle event combined with an escalation of trade protectionism will impact the us economy today particularly with regard to funding an increasing budget deficit when americans have become used to foreigners buying the bulk of new treasury bonds to appreciate the full implications we must revisit the connection between trade and budget deficits under the recessionary assumption that the budget deficit will rise while trade volumes contract but before examining the consequences we must set the scene by explaining why and how the twin deficits are linked the easiest way to do so is to imagine a world of sound money where the total of money and credit is fixed and the preference for holding money relative to goods does not alter if the quantity of money and credit is constant all imports must be paid for by exports in other words trade imbalances cannot arise if there are no changes in the total of circulating money if credit is extended to an importer it must be sourced from savers prepared to defer their spending instead of being created out of thin air as is the case with fractional reserve banking at the same time the government can only finance its spending by raising taxes and borrowing from private individuals the banking system in our sound money example can only act as intermediaries and cannot increase the quantity of money or credit to pay for government spending nor can it expand credit to finance trade therefore the sound money condition that makes a trade imbalance impossible is the same one that makes a budget deficit impossible it follows from this that if the quantities of money and credit are allowed to expand imbalances develop for trade or government budgets or both one deficit does not have to lead to the other but to the extent it does not then the difference must be reflected in a change in the savings rate savings must be spent in order to increase the consumption that leads to trade deficits alternatively they must be invested or spending deferred in order to reduce them if a government spends more than it receives in taxes and the resulting budget deficit is not reflected in a similar deficit on the balance of trade it is because individuals defer their spending and increase their savings by buying government bonds their spending on consumer items thereby becomes curtailed restricting demand for imported consumer goods obviously there are other investment media such as corporate bonds and new issues which attract savings which is why the twin deficits will never be exactly equal but generally if there is no change in the savings rate both trade and budget deficits will approximate with each other in today s world of fiat currencies a budget deficit still has to be financed in the absence of an increase in savings the two sources of non saver finance are the purchase of government debt by the banking system and the reinvestment of surplus dollars accumulating in foreign hands mainly as a result of the trade deficit so long as foreigners are willing to reinvest their dollar surpluses instead of selling them the twin deficits are not destabilising the trouble comes when that condition ceases which is most likely to happen when the credit cycle turns and tariffs are imposed or threatened furthermore government finances deteriorate rapidly when an economic slump develops table 1 below is an idealised illustration of how the government funding requirement increases during a relatively minor recession due to a changing combination of the twin deficits our starting point is the us fiscal year to october just ended us residents and banks would only have had to find 184bn in fiscal 2018 to fill the federal government s funding gap this is the domestic funding requirement assuming the changes listed in the notes to table 1 apply to fiscal 2019 the domestic funding requirement rises to over a trillion dollars an increase of more than fivefold crucially this assumes capital surpluses accumulating in foreign hands from the us s trade deficit are fully recycled into treasury bonds an escalation of domestic funding requirements will be repeated in all other countries that habitually run trade deficits and face rising welfare obligations these dynamics are certainly not factored into market expectations because bond yields have yet to reflect the increase in supply and the price of gold has not suggested the inflationary implications of the quantitative easing certain to be reintroduced in all the advanced economies returning to our analysis of the us position the increase in the domestic funding requirement implies capital imports would have to rise sharply even in a moderate recession if a funding crisis is to be avoided that is unlikely to happen assuming that global trade is beginning to contract as our thesis suggests it is more likely foreigners will be repatriating funds into their own currencies instead of investing them in dollars earlier bullish assumptions by foreign corporations about trade expansion will inevitably lead to a downwards reassessment of their dollar requirements rising budget deficits and the emergence of malinvestments in their own jurisdictions will require funding as well the potential for a government funding crisis to go global is very real until only recently foreign investors have continually increased their investments in us treasury bonds expecting uninterrupted growth in cross border trade this has changed with america s new protectionist policies and the chinese and european responses to them we saw evidence of this in the us treasury s tic data for december when foreigners were recorded as net sellers to the tune of 91 4bn representing nearly twice the previous month s trade deficit this may be early evidence that capital flows are already reversing out of us dollars without capital inflows it will be the american banking system and private investors that will have to fund the whole budget deficit and absorb further dollar liquidation from abroad just to be clear table 1 above tells us the domestic funding requirement will switch from 184bn last year to financing the whole budget deficit of over 1 500bn if foreigners stop buying additionally there is the prospect of extra capital outflows if december s tic figures are any guide at that rate foreigners will liquidate a significant portion of their existing dollar investments which includes the disposal of treasury bonds these dollar sales are likely to be significant and could easily take total required purchases of us treasuries by domestic sources to well over 2 000bn foreigners have accumulated substantial dollar investments over the years and at the last date of record end june 2018 they totalled 19 4 trillion to which we can add cash funds held through correspondent banks and short term money instruments totalling a further 5 2 trillion as at last december at over 110 of gdp the total of 24 6 trillion in investments and cash is the highest dollar exposure ever recorded in foreign hands we must also mention the feedback of contracting international trade on other economies because that will undermine us exports even more as well as their import export trade with each other countries with an exporting surplus will therefore take a hit on their trade from a general contraction but as countries such as japan and germany have consistently proved the savings habit which is part and parcel of their trade surpluses will otherwise limit their difficulties to considerably less than those faced by the welfare spendthrifts who have euthanised their savers britain france and the mediterranean states are at particular risk and the prospects for currency dislocation from the additional strain on the euro system can be expected to escalate into a european currency and banking crisis in a short time the negative feedback from these chains of events is likely to further undermine state finances everywhere by deepening the trade contraction reducing tax income and increasing welfare commitments table 1 above will reflect just the opening salvo in a deepening slump an outcome that is likely to become impossible to avoid with serious consequences for currencies as central banks respond with an increasing pace of monetary inflation the demise of unbacked fiat currencies the coincidence of smoot hawley tariffs and the top of the credit cycle in 1929 occurred under a gold standard the mythology of that experience has left the gold standard blamed for the depression and fed into the inflationist policies we see today in truth it is a confusion of effect with the cause and few economists appreciate the destructive role tariffs played at the peak of the credit cycle nevertheless everyone knows what the policy response from central bankers this time will be they will fund their governments deficits in conjunction with increasing the reserves of the commercial banks by the tested expedient of quantitative easing the precedent of qe for resolving difficulties of this type was the policy response to the great financial crisis it is impossible for american and other savers who are all but euthanised anyway to fund escalating budget deficits when they are personally in debt becoming unemployed and their financial investments are suffering from vicious bear markets the neo keynesian dictum is to encourage spending to the exclusion of saving driven by the belief the great depression was exacerbated by a tendency to save instead inflationism will replace savings accelerating the destruction of personal wealth in short the central banks see no alternative to throwing the inflationary dice just one more time despite repeated failures to achieve anything positive in the past other than their states survival while politically there appears to be no alternative to squeezing the last drops of blood from the productive private sector to support governments and the international banking system the escalation of monetary inflation could finally destroy unbacked fiat currencies instead of repeating the gold induced collapse of commodity and raw material prices in the 1930s eventually prices will rise as fiat currencies sink giving only a brief appearance of price stability so after an initial financial shock it is likely that residential property values mining stocks and the share prices of businesses that can survive a currency collapse might begin to recover measured in devaluing currency terms if so it resolves nothing the most pressing problem besides the economic slump and the currency collapse is the continuing crisis in government finances it is commonly assumed that the devaluation of existing government obligations favours government this naã ve view does not take into account the cost escalation of future legally mandated obligations on governments to provide continuing welfare and other services it is difficult to envisage welfare driven governments having the authority to reverse the socialising legislation of the last ninety years sufficiently in order to stabilise their finances however an increase of the quantity of base currency by the central bank through qe and the accompanying expansion of bank reserves will continue to be seen as a practical monetary policy it is only later the horrors for the general price level will become fully apparent by then it will be too late if it is not already to address a growing loss of public trust in the currency s purchasing power in the case of the dollar as soon as foreigners overexposed to it become aware of its trending direction they are likely to accelerate their selling on the foreign exchanges realising their losses on us treasuries this particularly applies to the chinese and japanese america s largest creditors whose focus will have shifted from kowtowing to america s trade policies to supporting their domestic economies with a falling dollar measured in yuan yen and even euros if that currency still exists by then the general price level in america will begin to rise at an accelerating pace which can no longer be concealed through statistical management and so the difference between the collapse that started in 1929 and the current hiatus is gold ninety years ago through the medium of the dollar prices were measured in gold at one ounce for 20 67 it led to a 40 devaluation of the dollar in january 1934 today while the actual tariffs proposed are less than those of smoot hawley and not yet fully implemented the monetary inflation behind the credit cycle has been considerably more extreme if the combination of the two in 1929 remains a valid precedent for what is going to pass in the next year or two today s unbacked fiat dollars face a full frontal challenge not only to financial asset values but also to international and the american public s faith in the dollar as a viable currency escaping the fiat collapse from the foregoing it is clear that a series of events has now commenced that threatens to spark a worldwide cyclical credit crisis centred on that king rat of currencies the dollar other currencies face similar problems twin deficits a lack of savers escalating government welfare commitments and a decline in tax income these currencies are threatened with the same fate as the dollar but perhaps not concurrently this will not come as a surprise to followers of austrian business cycle theory but western central banks vaguely understanding another credit crisis is likely have tried to seal off the escape routes they have largely persuaded their populations that gold is no longer money they have instructed banks to limit cash withdrawals they have protected their governments from a future systemic crisis by tightening regulations and enacting legislation for bail ins to replace bail outs the effect of these measures in a crisis can only be guessed at but they are likely to accelerate the destruction of a currency s purchasing power if instead of encashing deposits meaning people exit the banking system but not the currency people are forced to exchange bank balances for physical goods and perhaps cryptocurrencies in order to escape systemic risk you might argue that small depositors are protected by deposit insurance but it is not the small depositors that will start a stampede into alternatives to bank deposits it will be larger depositors and holders of bank bonds who will protect themselves from bail ins currencies issued by nations which have retained a saving culture and whose governments are not obligated to provide expensive welfare for their citizens can survive if they take appropriate action undoubtedly they will face persuasion by their own neo keynesian inflationists to keep their currencies competitive at least initially when this leads to escalating domestic interest rates these policies are likely to be abandoned in favour of sound money in the form of gold backing and the inflationists sidelined the currencies most likely to end up with gold backing are likely to be the chinese yuan and russian rouble both china and russia have embraced gold as the time honoured money superior to ever expanding fiat currencies besides stabilising the pan asian monetary situation for the benefit of eurasian trade a credible gold exchange standard introduces monetary discipline and reduces interest rates towards those mutually agreed between lenders and borrowers of gold while we cannot forecast this outcome with certainty we can see that the opportunity to escape currency destruction for asia will be available we can go even further and say there will be no credible alternative and that there are today specialists in the russian and chinese establishments farsighted enough to understand the point after all russia has already sold her dollars for gold and china deliberately moved to control the global market for bullion furthermore the last three months reports on the status of her reserves show china appears to have stopped accumulating dollars and instead is selling them for gold importantly now she does not mind advertising it china and russia are in a similar position to britain following the napoleonic wars following the formal reintroduction of the gold standard in 1821 the gold sovereign had been introduced in 1816 the value of government debt in private hands rose as interest rates fell and the government s financial credibility improved the wealth creation from this simple act of securing sound money was a major contributor to the success of the industrial revolution which propelled britain into her global preeminence china has similar ambitions for the industrialisation of asia furthermore she understands it is only by allowing her citizens to accumulate personal wealth that her economic objectives can be achieved she would be stupid not to follow

currency overvaluation or undervaluation can have advantages or disadvantages depending on a country s circumstances as part of negotiations for a trade deal with the chinese the donald trump team seeks assurances that the government will not devalue the yuan or renminbi but currency valuations are relative and fluid and governments lack full control currencies may become undervalued for natural reasons when political crises increase wariness about that country s assets or currency as has happened in brazil and turkey since 2013 in other cases governments deliberately keep the currency undervalued to encourage export sales the united states and other countries allege the people s bank of china has consistently undervalued the renminbi since the early 1990s a currency s value can appreciate or devalue against other currencies in multiple ways market sentiment deliberate government actions direct buying or selling in the foreign exchange market or by fiat in extreme cases when the government dictates the exchange rate currencies may become overvalued when foreigners desire that currency in the exchange markets and seek to hold assets in that nation currencies can also become temporarily overvalued if the country s central bank raises internal interest rates foreigners seeking to earn higher interest then demand that currency in the spot market in other cases especially in the emerging world countries like india may deliberately keep their currency overvalued for political reasons advantages of undervaluation from china s point of view china s exporters receive a boost as dollars earned convert into more renminbi than they would otherwise foreign direct investment is less costly and more attractive to outside investors as their currencies convert into more renminbi for buying factories or local assets investment and jobs pour into china s export sector turning it into the factory of the world due to the expectations of consistent undervaluation by the central bank imports headed into china are more expensive in renminbi thereby protecting domestic chinese firms from import competition and retaining investment and jobs in the country overall investment and jobs increase crucial for a population of 1 4 billion people the drawbacks of undervaluation for china effective protection against imports reduces competition which can also reduce efficiency and competitiveness of local firms excess demand for jobs is created escalating wages in a country with a limited labour supply which in turn could increase inflation this did not happen in china initially because of its large population however due to the one child policy reports of labour shortages have emerged with costs escalating sharply overvalued currencies are more likely found in emerging countries although examples of overvaluation also occur in developed economies such as norway and switzerland advantages of overvaluation for emerging economies such as india thailand egypt or nigeria as of early 2019 include imports are cheaper in the local currency this can be crucial for import dependent populations where local markets rely on imports for basic necessities like food medicines or energy political stability increases to the extent that the government handles or subsidises imports of necessities devaluation poses political consequences for incumbents because basic necessities like energy may have to be imported anyway increased costs can contribute to unrest and protests importing at the overvalued exchange rate is cheaper than local production especially in import dependent economies keeping inflation under control drawbacks of overvaluation exports may be reduced because companies converting foreign currency earnings say us dollars at the overvalued exchange rate do not earn enough local currency say indian rupees or nigerian naira to justify their costs imports may appear artificially inexpensive compared with local substitute products thereby dampening investments and jobs in sectors that could produce locally to compete against imports foreign direct investment coming into a country with an overvaluated currency is somewhat reduced foreign currencies like the us dollar convert into fewer units of local currency like rupees with which to buy local assets such as land the difference between the inflation rate of the rupee and that of the us dollar averaged 4 15 but the rupee devalued more slowly suggesting overvaluation source niranjan rajadhyaksha livemint complicated calculation comparing currency values is complicated because comparisons involve converting moneys into one reference currency such as the us dollar which fluctuates in value too also living standards and the cost of living vary dramatically across nations complicating analyses however the theory of purchasing power parity or ppp provides analysis for the long run the theory s main idea is simple money as such has no value and is merely odd pieces of metal paper or phantasmal electronic entries under the theory money has value depending on what holders can do with it what and how much consumers can purchase with that currency the exchange rate for a currency in the long run according to the theory is based on the comparison of its purchasing power versus that of another currency in the simplest example if a basket of goods and services can be purchased for rs 78 000 in india and the same basket of goods and services can be purchased for 1 000 in the united states then the theoretical purchasing power parity exchange rate should be 1 rs 78 as of february 2019 this rate was 1 rs 71 suggesting that the rupee is somewhat overvalued unfortunately all currencies eventually lose value through the strange process of inflation erosion of any purchasing power over time a number of socioeconomic factors spur inflation depending on the country a complication is that currencies lose purchasing power at different rates in short the currency that has a higher inflation rate such as the indian rupee should and indeed will in the long run according to ppp theory devalue against a reference currency such as the us dollar that suffers lower inflation a simple way of calculating this take the difference between the inflation rate of the rupee and that of the us dollar as reference currency over a suitable period according to a calculation by niranjan rajadhyaksha the indian rupee should have devalued at a rate proportionate to the difference in the inflation between india and the us calculated as an average annual 4 15 difference if so the rupee should have devalued by 4 15 each year on average however it did not the rupee devalued more slowly less than it should have according to ppp theory that means the rupee is somewhat overvalued inflation in the indian economy has moderated recently but remains higher than that in the us if this continues in the long run the theory says economists should expect the rupee to continue to devalue against the dollar governments and multinationals worldwide study ppp theory assessing whether currencies are overvalued or undervalued to determine the best timing for portfolio or foreign direct investments for example a country s interest rate may appear attractive to foreigners but once the foreign bank deposit matures value depends on the exchange rate when proceeds are converted or consider the fact that many companies in brazil turkey and elsewhere in the emerging world finding us interest rates irresistibly low from 2011 to 2013 borrowed heavily in dollar denominated debt when the loans had to be repaid say in 2018 after the dollar strengthened companies found their cost of repayment in local currency so high that it strained finances forcing some to fail for governments ppp theory is useful in deciding how much to devalue or revalue their currencies for example the vietnamese government gradually devalues the dong based on ppp calculations ppp theory is far from accurate and works best in the long run calculated over several years yet it gives executives investors and governments guidance and insights

looking through all the financial market news last week the message was rather unified that is 2019 will be a year of slowdown globally economic data central banks governments and independent organizations are all reinforcing this message while ecb s pre emptive dovish turn triggered wild market reactions it was just the nail for the case the question now is whether the markets are pessimistic enough on the outlook judging from the technical developments we see that there are conditions in place for bearish reversals in stocks in us germany and japan but none of these indices confirmed reversal instead late buying on friday showed much underlying resilience we believed the panic buttons weren t hit yet a lot will depend on upcoming developments in us china trade negotiations and brexit in the currency markets yen emerged as the biggest winner on risk aversion and more so from reversal in global treasury yields us 10 year yield hit as high as 2 759 on march 1 but closed just 2 625 last week lowest since early january german 10 year hit hit as high as 0 21 also on march 1 but closed the week at 0 071 new zealand dollar was the second strongest us dollar the third on the other hand sterling was the weakest ones as crucial brexit votes approach euro followed as second weakest on ecb a quick recap on oecd china ecb boc rba and nfp let s have quick recap on some important happenings last week oecd lowered global growth forecast by 0 2 to 3 3 in 2019 and by 0 1 to 3 4 in 2020 in the interim economic outlook it s noted that chinese and european slowdown and weakening global trade growth are the principal factors weighing on the world economy for china while policy stimulus should offset weak trade development risks remains of a sharper slowdown that would hit global growth and trade china lowered 2019 gdp growth target to 6 6 5 the lower bound at 6 would be the slowest pace of growth in nearly three decades china plans to cut around cny 2t in taxes and fees for companies in particular manufacturers budget deficit is expected to climb 0 2 to 2 8 of gdp shockingly poor february trade data reinforced that china is facing tough struggle and serious impact from trade war february alone exports contracted 20 7 yoy decline since february 2016 imports also dropped 5 2 yoy the picture was better if we take out the distortion by chinese new year january and february combined exports dropped 4 6 yoy while imports dropped 3 1 yoy these figures were not disastrous but still weak zooming into trade with us the deterioration was rather drastic total trade with us dropped 19 9 yoy exports dropped 14 1 yoy but imports dropped 35 1 yoy trade with eu wasn t too bad still recorded 3 7 yoy growth in total trade 2 4 yoy rise in exports and 5 7 rise in imports european slowdown is another drag to global economy as noted by oecd ecb s statement press conference and policy actions showed policy makers are in deep worry firstly ecb changed the forward guidance and now expects to keep interest rates at present levels at least through the end of 2019 prolonged from summer of 2019 tltro iii is announced quarterly from september 2019 through march 2021 it s aiming at preserving favourable bank lending conditions and smooth transition of monetary policy in the post meeting press conference ecb president mario draghi said weakening in data points to a sizeable moderation in growth extends into 2019 impact from slowdown in external demand and country sector specific factors is turning out to be somewhat longer lasting gdp growth was revised down substantially in 2019 and slightly in 2020 gdp is projected to grow by 1 1 in 2019 1 6 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 they compare to december s projection of 1 7 in 2019 1 7 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 risks surrounding outlook are still tilted to the downside due to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets talking about central banks after leaving interest rate unchanged at 1 75 boc acknowledged that as recent data suggested global economic slowdown has been more pronounced and widespread than previously anticipated the most surprisingly change comes from the monetary policy stance boc judged that the current economic developments warrant a policy interest rate that is below its neutral range moreover given the mixed picture that the data present it will take time to gauge the persistence of below potential growth and the implications for the inflation outlook in short boc has take a rate hike off the table at least for now another central bank rba sounded confident after leaving interest rate unchanged at 1 50 rba maintained the central scenarios of growth inflation employment outlook and continued to expect the gradual progress of reducing unemployment and inflation returning to target governor philip lowe later said that wage growth is expected to offset negative impact from fall in house prices however q4 gdp released at just 0 2 qoq was way worse than expected after the release more economists are forecasting two rba cuts this year including westpac macquarie jp morgan ubs nomura amp capital economics market economics talking about rate cuts traders are not back betting on a cut by fed by the end of the year fed futures now imply around 20 chance of that happening it was practically at 0 chance a week ago and more than 20 chance a month ago but judging on the fact that the chance just rose little on friday non farm payrolls report didn t have too much impact yet after all the 20k job growth in february was undoubtedly poor but a month of data could distorted by many factors like weather we may have some upward revision in the data next month also unemployment rate dropped back to 3 8 while average hourly earnings accelerated to 0 4 mom it s overall not too bad a set of data us china trade talks could drag on to april while tariff damages continue no additional progress is reported regarding us china trade talks instead there are rumors that the march 27 trump xi summit in mar a lago is called off there are some speculations some noted the agreement is better signed in a third country some said xi is concerned trump will walk away from a deal in florida just like what he did to kim in vietnam but most likely reason is the two sides are still far away on some core issues the ne got at ions could drag on to april meanwhile we d like to point out that the phrase trade truce is an incorrect description of the current state admittedly we used it too according to cambridge dictionary truce means a short interruption in a war or argument or an agreement to stop fighting or arguing for a period of time if us and china are engaged in a trade war the cannons are the tariffs such tariffs are still flying every single day they just stopped escalating but the war is still on if the punitive and retaliatory tariffs since last year damaged global trade growth and economy they re still doing it hence the longer the talks the longer the impacts would be ip theft forced technology transfer and unfair trade practices are also happening everyday in china before a deal is made and enforced besides it should be reminded that the steel and aluminum tariffs are still on and there is no end in sight it will remain a drag in eu s economy as well as others eu s offer rejected by uk brexit votes loom the crucial votes on brexit from march 12 to 14 are approaching but there is no clear breakthrough as a somewhat last ditch effort eu chief negotiator michel barnier reveal through his tweets new package of concessions to the uk firstly the arbitration panel can give uk the risk to a proportionate suspension of its obligation under the backstop as a last resort if eu breaches its best endeavours good faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions more controversially barnier said eu commits to give uk the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border uk will not be forced into customs union against its will that means the uk can choose to apply the backstop just to northern ireland rather than the whole of uk this idea was rejected by the uk long ago the idea drew heavy criticism from the uk government cabinet minister andrea leadsom rejected the idea and said she was absolutely astonished she also warned that if the eu doesn t enable us to resolve this issue issue about the permanent nature of the backstop then in effect what the eu is pushing us towards is leaving the eu without a withdrawal agreement at all chairman of the ruling conservative party brandon lewis also said we are not going to have an agreement that compromises the unity of the united kingdom without any fundamental change regarding irish backstop there is practically no chance for may to get her brexit deal through the parliament on march 12 next tuesday a vote on no deal brexit will then be held on march 13 to see if there is explicit consent on this path if not there will be another vote on article 50 extension on march 14 as for sterling s reactions it should be noted that its recent rally was built on fading chance of no deal brexit there was no positive development on the deal to push the pound higher last week s decline just put sterling back to where it was risk sentiments turned sour but no panic yet s p 500 s decline last week confirmed short term topping at 2816 88 after hitting 78 6 retracement of 2940 91 to 2346 58 at 2813 72 the index then hit as low as 2722 27 we re viewing rise from 2346 58 as a leg inside the medium term consolidation pattern from 2940 91 thus we re expecting such rise to complete between 2813 72 and 2940 91 and reverse however the late buying on friday argues that spx could be trying to form a bottom around 55 day ema now at 2712 82 thus there is no confirmation of near term reversal yet there could still be another rise through 2816 88 before reversal though sustained break of 55 day ema will add to the case of reversal and target 38 2 retracement of 2346 58 to 2816 88 at 2637 22 and below dax s decline last week indicates short term topping at 11676 86 it is totally possibly for the rebound from 10279 20 to complete around 11726 62 key support turned resistance this level is close to 55 week ema at 11752 90 too but so far despite the pull back dax is held well inside near term rising channel as well as 55 day ema thus there is no clear indication of reversal yet the rebound from 10279 20 could still extend to trend line resistance now at 12350 comparing to the spx and dax the outlook in nikkei looks more dangerous as it closed below 55 day ema it s also reasonable for rebound form 18948 58 to complete around 50 retracement of 24448 07 to 18948 58 at 21698 32 which is close to 55 week ema at 21564 12 but then nikkei is staying inside near term rising channel thus there is still prospect of extending the rebound from 18948 58 to 61 8 retracement at 22347 26 though firm break of the channel support should bring deeper fall to retest 18948 58 low the decline in china shanghai sse on friday after poor trade data might look steep but it should be noted that it came after the index surged to 3219 93 on government tax and fees cut the index just closed the week down 0 81 and it s natural to have a set back ahead of 61 8 retracement of 3587 03 to 2440 90 at 3149 20 it s also close to 55 month ema at 3144 61 there is prospect for the index to gyrate lower in near term but we d expect strong support from 38 2 retracement of 2440 90 to 3129 93 at 2866 72 to contain downside 2440 09 is seen as a long term bottom that completes the long term correction from 2015 high at 5178 19 thus further rally is expected to 3587 03 resistance in medium term in the currency markets usd jpy despite the sharp fall from 112 13 is holding well above 110 35 support as well as near term channel support eur jpy also recovered just ahead of 124 23 cluster support 38 2 retracement of 118 62 to 127 50 at 124 10 aud jpy was held well comfortably above 77 44 support cad jpy is still holding above 82 26 support there is so far no confirmation on bullish reversal in the japanese yen more evidence might come this week as the above levels are broken but for now the declines in yen crosses are generally viewed as corrective first position trading we ve switch from aud jpy short to aud usd short last week then there it went the turn in market sentiments and sharp decline in global treasury yield we re admittedly trapped by prior week s rally in yields as we ve given up the expectation for yen to rebound though the bearish view on aussie still holds so we d stay short in aud usd entered at 0 7050 stop will be held at 0 7120 0 6722 low is the first target but we re actually looking at long term down trend resumption to 0 6008 and below eur usd weekly outlook eur usd dropped sharply to 1 1176 last week and breach of 1 1215 low indicates resumption of down trend from 1 2555 as a temporary low is formed initial bias is neutral this week for some consolidations first upside of recovery should be limited below 1 1419 resistance to bring down trend resumption on the downside break of 1 1176 will target 100 projection of 1 1814 to 1 1215 from 1 1569 at 1 0970 next in the bigger picture down trend from 1 2555 medium term top is still in progress bearishness is affirmed by sustained trading below falling 55 week ema 61 8 retracement of 1 0339 2017 low to 1 2555 at 1 1186 is met sustained break there will pave the way to retest 1 0339 on the upside break of 1 1569 resistance will now indicate completion of such down trend and turn medium term outlook bullish in the long term picture the rejection from 38 2 retracement of 1 6039 to 1 0339 at 1 2516 argues that long term down trend from 1 6039 2008 high might not be over yet eur usd is also held below decade long trend line resistance firm break of 61 8 retracement of 1 0339 to 1 2555 at 1 1186 should at least bring a retest on 1 0339 low this will remain the favored case as long as 1 1569 resistance holds

it is never comfortable to give up long held beliefs and connections but the impending climate crisis makes that a burning necessity and the fact that scientifically it s possible to avoid the worst of this climate disaster gives a positive incentive to do so it is with this attitude that we must consider the green new deal as proposed by representative alexandria ocasio cortez the idea of a green new deal has been around for quite a few years over ten years ago new york times columnist thomas friedman called for it as did van jones former short lived member of the first obama administration in fact jones wrote an entire book on the issue in ocasio cortez s plan the u s would be weaned completely off of fossil fuel by 2030 so far so good this goal is possible the question is how as the graph on the left shows the top four emitters of greenhouse gas mainly through the burning of fossil fuel are transportation electric generation industrial production and agriculture let s consider them one by one transportation the main cause of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in this sector is from the internal combustion engine and reliance on individually owned cars the second half of the pamphlet the environmentalist manifesto explains how this was inherent in the development of us capitalism itself transformation to reliance on mass transit and electric engines would only be accepted if it were accompanied by a massive reduction in the work week with no loss in pay and to making it affordable to live near the average worker s work place the main cause of greenhouse gas

raised in feed lots even the us government demands this through their requirements for farmers to be eligible to receive price support subsidies the alternative is use of non ploughing seed drills use of cover crops and allowing animals to graze on open fields among other things this would enrich the soil and allow it to massively capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere according to michael pollan omnivore s dilemma adoption of these methods would remove 14 billion pounds of carbon from the atmosphere per year overall reduction in emissions from one of these sectors is interlinked with the others for example reduction in manufacturing emissions cannot be accomplished without a transformation of the electricity sector what is required is a general plan organized managed and controlled by the working class itself ocasio cortez s green new deal does not deal with the specifics here s what it proposes to understand whether this plan can succeed we have to start with the current state of global warming global climate change her plan calls for the house of representatives to establish a super committee called a select committee to develop legislation to accomplish that end her plan would create millions of new well paying jobs in the renewable energy field while phasing out all use of fossil fuel she explains that a massive of investment is necessary to really kick start the industry which means that simple tax incentives for private business is insufficient as she puts it the level of investment required will be massive her plan proposes that the government could raise the money through traditional debt tools i e federal deficit spending as well as creating new public banks she also calls for the government to take an equity role in projects in other words public private partnerships the select committee would act as a quarterback in working through and resolving any comments or issues brought up by the other house committees the fifth report of the main scientific international panel on climate change the international panel on climate change ipcc explains how great the danger is as the extreme cold in the midwest united states this winter 2019 shows what we re really facing is global climate disruption extreme cold in some areas heat in others flooding in some areas drought in others overall as the earth warms though this warming will tend to feedback on itself for example as the tundra in the north thaws it releases the greenhouse gas methane which then causes even more warming despite this all the ipcc report raises are very moderate changes such as only reducing industrial output of greenhouse gas by 25 by 2050 an article in the guardian newspaper reveals the reason they write that to reduce carbon pollution to down to zero by 2050 would require fuel prices that are three to four times higher than for a 2c target there is no chance whatsoever that there would be popular support for such price increases surely the yellow vest movement in france has proven that to its credit ocasio cortez s green new deal proposal does not call for workers having to pay she proposes basically two steps first is government financing of private investment through increase in public debt in effect this is a return to keynesian economics the keynesian strategy died in the united states under threat of runaway inflation in the late 1970s this signaled a new world situation it means that keynesianism cannot be raised from the dead the second aspect of her proposal is for government to take an equity role in projects this means public private partnerships in the past this has always amounted to the government putting up tax dollars for a company controlled by private investors even on its own terms without considering the necessity of transforming the profit addicted and anarchic free market based economy the green new deal cannot be accomplished through ocasio cortez s party the democratic party here s why one alternative would be to try to make the working class pay for it as has french president macron we see the results there workers simply cannot afford to do so the other is to make the capitalists pay but they will never give up their profits voluntarily even more important the entire issue of global climate disruption directly leads to the issue of the free market and production for profit in a planless economic system to quote r2d2 danger danger how can the capitalist controlled democratic party ever push through a green new deal given these political realities and so the issue of preventing an all out climate disaster is political not scientific that is the lens through which we must look at ocasio cortez s green new deal fdr s new deal for starters what was the original new deal first coined by fdr it was nothing but a happy phrase that made people feel better as art preis quoted fdr s own labor secretary frances perkins in his preis s classic u s labor history labor s giant step similar to the bank bailout after the 2008 collapse preis explains that fdr s first step was to bailout the big banks at the expense of the depositors and the small banks whereas by 1945 fdr was spending over 100 billion per year on war his emergency relief act spent only 0 5 of that amount 500 million on jobs and jobs at a pittance as far as wages were concerned in fact fdr s new deal did little to nothing to relieve unemployment it was the coming of world war ii that lifted the u s economy out of depression and what a cost that was it is no accident that from van jones to ocasio cortez the solution to climate disaster is phrased in the tradition of fdr s new deal nor that this proposal comes from the liberal wing of the democratic party an alignment of forces similar to in fdr s time is backing ocasio cortez s green new deal the reform wing of the democrats the justice democrats who were the ones who recruited ocasio cortez to run in the first place show this those they thank for endorsing ocasio cortez s green new deal include long time mainstream democrats like jim mcgovern and dutch ruppersburger and establishment liberals like jackie speier and ro khanna these representatives all get donations from major corporations like yahoo google and facebook for some examples see the appendix at the end of this article and as for the union donations they are arranged through the union bureaucracy which will ensure that she does not move away from the democratic party fate of select committee central to ocasio cortez s strategy is the proposal of a select committee that would act as a quarterback as she puts it this committee would centralize and coordinate all the legislation aimed at eliminating the use of fossil fuel by 2020 initially nearly the entire progressive caucus of the house democrats opposed the formation of this select committee if pelosi outright refused to create this committee she risked completely alienating the newly active young voters who put the likes of ocasio cortez into office however she could not oppose the wishes of the real powers that be in the party which include herself her solution stands as a symbol of what the democratic party represents she established this committee but without the power to subpoena witnesses and without the power to propose legislation in other words this compromise represents the drawing in of the impatient and agitated mainly middle class youth represented by the sanders ocasio cortez tlaib insurgents with the more established liberals like jackie speier d ca and the even more mainstream democrats like mcgovern khanna and ruppersberger 40 house democrats in all corbin trent spokesperson for ocasio cortez commented that on this basis this committee is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine he is wrong however it is enormously useful it creates the illusion of change without really doing anything military spending there is also a glaring absence in the green new deal proposal there is no discussion as far as shifting budget priorities most particularly there is the 716 billion in the 2019 budget slated for the military this is nearly ¼ of the total federal budget for 2019 many of these mainstream liberals would strongly oppose any significant reduction of this part of the budget but as long as the u s spends that sort of money on war it s hard to see how there is room for any other sort of priority natural gas the history of the democratic party in relation to fracking and natural gas development is central to understanding the orientation of that party in general this history is intimately tied in with the recent history of the democratic party in the state of colorado there a group of four multi millionaires known as the gang of four organized to take back power in the state from the republicans they were connected with the oil and gas industry in the state and they were so successful that the democratic party nationally formed an equivalent group of multi millionaires called the democracy alliance basically it is the story of how the use of natural gas came to be the democrats fallback position on energy development this history is intimately tied in with the recent history of the democratic party in the state of colorado the mineral extraction interests have always been central to that state s political and economic history the power of that sector has not waned in 2018 the denver post carried an exhaustive series of articles on how the democrats retook power from the republicans in that state those articles available here are well worth reading in and of themselves what happened was that a group of four millionaires later branded as the gang of four were unhappy about the republicans reactionary social cultural agenda they got together in 2002 3 to plan to retake power in the state by 2005 they had created a democracy alliance which according to the denver post article was a secretive collection of approximately 100 of the wealthiest democrats in the nation and with a requirement of at least 1 million expenditure per year this democracy alliance linked up with some of the major environmental ngos such as the sierra club whose beyond coal campaign then morphed into a campaign for low carbon substitutes and clean fuels and renewables these and similar terms have become dog whistles for natural gas in 2006 the democracy alliance secured the election of a democratic governor and in 2010 that governor was replaced by the out and out oil representative john hickenlooper democrat natural gas has been branded as the bridge fuel by the industry and their democratic party representatives this implies that it is a bridge to transitioning to renewable fuels in fact it is the opposite that s because by cheapening the use of fossil fuels it has discouraged investing in renewables in the 2018 elections colorado governor john hickenlooper was replaced by jared polis one of the members of the gang of four in that state a truly slimy character polis made his first millions speculating on the privatizing of the state monopolies in the former soviet union he made something of a public reputation in colorado after he got involved in the opposition to fracking when the gas industry moved to frack some gas wells right near his multi million dollar vacation home in weld county co a case of a nimby if there ever was one however his turnaround was rapid and he became known as a sell out by the fractivists despite this history bernie sanders spent several days touring colorado prior to the 2018 elections campaigning for polis in 2012 the obama administration made dependency on natural gas the semi official policy of the democratic party they issued a report on the need for clean energy that term is often linked with the call for energy independence and taken together they mean nothing but the increased use of natural gas that use is inescapably linked with increased fracking which is massively environmental destructive for example fracking is linked with damage to the development of the brain and the immune system in young children also due to the release of methane gas in this process fracking may be even worse than coal as far as global warming is concerned some could argue that the union leadership and the non profits upon which ocasio cortez s green new deal relies also will push the democrats to the left will they the political program of organized labor is completely controlled by its leadership who represent the democratic party from start to finish and the non profits are not much different for example the afl cio supported the keystone xl pipeline while the major environmental nonprofits and groups like the millionaire s club the democracy alliance are linked with the major environmental non profits the conclusion is inescapable what ocasio cortez proposes will be inadequate compared to what is needed to prevent climate catastrophe even the limited steps she proposes cannot be accomplished through the democratic party not even with the pressure of the leadership of the unions and the environmental ngo s upon which she and her proposals rely potential solutions there are potential solutions as explained in the outline at the start of this article regarding electric generation transportation manufacturing and agriculture nothing less than the complete socialist transformation of society is necessary bernie sanders and his liberal wing of the democratic party often point to the scandinavian countries as an example of socialism proof that these countries are no solution lies in the fact that both denmark and norway rely on oil production for a major portion of their economies no what socialism means is taking the commanding heights of the economy out of private hands and planning production under the democratic control and management of the working class itself this cannot be accomplished through the present capitalist controlled state in fact the founding fathers drew up the u s constitution in order to structure the government in such a way as to prevent the working class from controlling it what is necessary is a new form of government that can arise in the course of the struggle of workers themselves reformists and liberals will claim that this means an all or nothing approach they call this letting the perfect be the enemy of the good that is nonsense if we are not clear on the necessary destination of the journey then we will inevitably be led down one cul de sac one dead end road after another we do of course also have to be clear on how to start working class party in 1886 karl marx s co thinker frederick engels wrote the first great step of importance for every country is always the organization of workers as an independent political party no matter how so long as it is a distinct workers party the masses must have time and opportunity to develop and they can only have the opportunity when they have their own movement no matter in what form so long as it is only their own movement the same applies today bernie sanders the entire political basis of the green new deal as outlined here shows that this plan is inextricably linked to the capitalist class and its representatives it cannot provide a start towards building a movement of by and for the working class the central figure of the progressive wing of the democratic party bernie sanders is a perfect example according to craig unger s book house of trump house of putin the chief campaign strategist for sanders 2016 presidential bid tad devine was formerly employed by none other than paul manafort and his infamous torturers lobby the rest of his top staff including michael briggs michaeleen crowell jeff weaver phil fiermonte scott goldstein and others are all democratic party operatives sanders entire political history has been based on an electoral and legislative alliance with the democratic party leadership as sanders support for multi millionaire jared polis in colorado shows nothing has changed since then sanders will not and cannot lead a break from the democratic party and lead in developing a working class party he and others like him including ocasio cortez may break from the democrats after a working class alternative is already well under way but that leaves us with the question how can that alternative be started u s working class tradition of struggle from the great uprising of 1877 to the west virginia teachers strike of 2018 the u s working class has a tradition of moving first by striking and otherwise mobilizing in the streets and at the work places there is every reason to think that tradition will continue despite the fact that the liberal progressive wing of the democrats is constantly trying to divert the working class into electoral and legislative support for them and despite the fact that the leaders of the working class the union leadership represent these democrats and are complicit in this attempt we might look to the french yellow vest movement for an example of what could happen here there had been a series of strikes over the summer of 2018 in france similar to here the union leadership there did everything in their power to limit the scope of these strikes they successfully prevented these strikes from becoming the springboard to a wider working class movement against the attacks on french workers living standards what is known as austerity measures here we have seen a similar trend first and foremost in the teachers strikes from west virginia to los angeles as in france the union leadership here were unwilling to build these strikes into a movement for higher wages for all and for a restoration of all the cuts in all government services similarly the union leadership was more or less passive in the face of the federal shutdown and what little they did do failed to link the issue of federal workers pay with the defense of immigrant workers including asylum seekers the leadership of the only nominally socialist group with any real presence the democratic socialists of america was equally complicit dam will burst sooner or later though something will happen for the dam to burst for a more generalized movement to develop in the streets it may be some political crisis including a possible international crisis such as a u s military assault on iran or a particularly egregious case of police violence and racism on a scale not seen up until now or an environmental disaster far greater than anything we ve seen up until now it could be voter suppression on a scale unseen since the days of jim crow or it could even be some accidental event that just strikes a raw nerve but whatever it is it is hard to see how the present period of tense calm can last very much longer when that calm shatters then all hell will break loose that could even lead to the calling out of the national guard in cities throughout the united states workers movement will be coordinated whatever happens however it happens a renewed mobilization of the u s working class will be the basis for the beginnings of the formation of a mass working class party in the united states the tendency to organize and coordinate that mobilization on a national scale in fact possibly even internationally can develop what will be necessary will be a democratic organizational structure in fact it can only be through such a clear structure that real democracy can exist without representatives and a leadership elected on the basis of what they stand for then inevitably the decisions will be made behind the scenes by a small unelected group that is exactly what happened in occupy oakland but what is such an organizational structure but the beginnings of a working class party not a party born through some academic like plan but one born through the actual real life struggles of hundreds of thousands possibly of millions of workers and youth in the school of life in time and maybe a fairly short period of time that working class party in the making will have to determine its orientation towards elections even though it might not be born through participating in elections supporting the left leaning democrats would be the death of this working class party in the making ignoring elections would have the same effect since it would cede the ground to the democrats it would have to run its own candidates maybe first at the local level it is in this unplanned chaotic tumultuous and even violent road that the solution to the global climate crisis is to be found political conclusions some argue that while a working class party is necessary until we have one we should support the likes of bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez aside from the fact that this has always been the argument of those who in reality are trying to avoid building a working class alternative to the democratic party this argument leads us down a dead end street support for this wing of the democrats has always led to adopting their methods those methods can be most clearly seen in the response to the 2019 federal government shutdown all sanders could do was propose sending a letter of protest to republican senate leader mitch mcconnell in fact what was needed was mass protests at federal offices and at airports around the country protests that linked the nonpayment of 800 000 federal workers with the recent raise that all federal workers were supposed to get but that trump vetoed and the need for a substantial raise for all workers this should have been linked with opposition to the wall and the demand for release of all asylum seekers instead aside from a few small protests at a few airports the union leadership was passive following their lead so was the only socialist group which has any influence democratic socialists of america instead of orienting to the progressive democrats and adopting their methods we should take the following approach as every new issue arises we have to be sure not to be passive again build the mobilization of workers and working class young people in the streets and working class communities and schools help rank and file union members build opposition caucuses inside their unions support and help widen strikes and other actions of workers within all of this help to clarify what capitalism has in store for our planet and how only the working class through its conscious and independent activity can avert the looming capitalist disaster

on march 5 2019 federal reserve chairman jerome powell sat down for an interview with correspondent scott pelley in the special library at the federal reserve headquarters in washington d c below is the transcript of that interview and of their conversation in the fed s board room scott pelley s interview with mr powell aired sunday march 10 2019 scott pelley have you stopped raising rates fed chair jerome powell well that s a good question we see the economy as in a good place we think that the outlook is a favorable one inflation is muted and our policy rate we think is in an appropriate place so what we ve said is that we would be patient as we watch to see how global economic conditions evolve and how our own economy evolves pelley what does patient mean powell patient means that we don t feel any hurry to change our interest rate policy what s happened in the last 90 or so days is that we ve seen increasing evidence of the global economy slowing down although our own economy has continued to perform well growth abroad if it slows can be a headwind for us in addition there are things like brexit and slowing in china and europe that can be headwinds so what we ve done is we ve said that we re going to wait and see how those conditions evolve before we make any changes to our interest rate policy and that means patient pelley what would it take to raise or lower interest rates powell we ll be looking at a range of data for here domestically we ll be looking at growth we ll be looking at the state of the labor market job creation wages and that kind of thing we ll also be looking at inflation of course and abroad we ll be looking to see how foreign growth is evolving particularly in china as i mentioned and in europe we ll also be watching events such as brexit and we ll be putting that all together and deciding when it will be appropriate to change our policy for now though we re to be patient and allow things to evolve pelley the chinese growth rate has been dropping the chinese recently announced they were expecting about 6 growth how big a problem is that for the united states powell well chinese growth is important for world growth it s important for european growth as well there s a lot of trade between europe and china and between the united states and china so a healthy global economy can be a tailwind for the united states as it was in 2017 and a little bit in 2018 if it slows down the global economy then we ll feel that as a headwind so we don t actually believe that very negative outcomes are the most likely outcomes there the chinese authorities have been deploying many measures to support growth in china and we also think that europe is more likely to have a positive growth rate this year so overall we think the u s outlook is a positive one pelley you think the european growth rate is going to be positive despite the fact that the british in some form or fashion are going to be leaving the european union powell yes growth in europe has slowed substantially over the last year or so and we re watching that very carefully but we still think that it s likely that there ll be materially positive growth this year but again it s something we re watching carefully and of course we re watching the brexit situation quite carefully as well pelley we have seen big swings in the stock markets in the united states and i wonder do you think the markets today are overvalued powell we don t comment on the valuation of the stock market particularly and we do though we monitor financial conditions carefully our interest rate policy works through financial conditions so we look at a very broad range of financial conditions that includes interest rates the level of the dollar the availability of credit and also the stock market so we look at a range of things and i think we feel that conditions are generally healthy today pelley generally healthy one of your predecessors back in the 90s famously said that the market in those days was irrationally exuberant you don t see that today powell we don t see much evidence of that today there as always in our very highly developed and large capital markets there are places you can point which are let s say hotter than others but generally speaking credit spreads which is the compensation you get above risk free rates for taking credit risk are at relatively normal levels by some measures the stock market valuation is closer to its sort of normal levels over long periods of time there are pockets though there are things for example the leverage lending corporates we ve seen high growth in leverage lending to non financial corporates and that s something we re watching carefully pelley why so powell so whenever there s a lot of borrowing perhaps because of an excess of optimism there s a risk that later on borrowing will have been too optimistic or too excessive and that goes for households that goes for businesses what we re seeing now is some companies borrowing fairly large amounts of debt and the sense of it is that if there were a downturn having highly leveraged companies would be an amplifier could be an amplifier to a downturn i don t think it s the kind of thing that we saw in the financial crisis where you had you know the subprime mortgage crisis it doesn t seem to be like that generally but at the same time it could be an amplifier to a downturn pelley and this is something that concerns you today powell it s something we ve been actively monitoring for some time and we ll continue to do so pelley where do you see weakness in the u s economy powell generally speaking the u s economy is coming off a very strong year last year we had growth just a touch higher than 3 and that strength was pretty widespread you know we have high levels of employment low levels of unemployment wages are moving up consumer confidence is high business confidence is high we ve seen a bit of a slowing but still to healthy levels in the u s economy this year so the u s economy does seem to be favorable the outlook for the u s economy is favorable i would say the principal risks to our economy now seem to be coming from slower growth in china and europe and also risk events such as brexit pelley a record seven million americans have fallen behind on their car payments never happened before what do you make of that powell well if you so take a step back and look at the broader consumer credit picture which is generally a healthy one mortgage credit is in good shape default rates are low and as i mentioned wages have moved up significantly so the consumer s in a pretty good place what s happened with automobiles is that the car sales have been quite high for a number of years so the whole body of outstanding auto loans is much larger than it was auto default rates have actually not moved up they ve actually been fairly stable but the number of people who are experiencing you know auto defaults has gone up because the number of borrowers has gone up i think it also though shows that not everyone is experiencing this widespread prosperity that we have and that s something we pay attention to as well pelley retail sales declined in december the fastest pace since 2009 are these things taken together suggesting that the system is blinking red powell well we look at a wide range of data we never focus too much on one month s report on one series and i think generally the outlook for the u s economy remains a favorable one you point to the retail sales number and it was surprisingly weak and we re of course watching that we ll be watching the next month retail sales the reason it s a surprise is that we had lots of other reports of relatively healthy levels of spending over the holidays and that comes from a number of different channels and so we ll be looking to see there s also evidence by the way that spending has popped back up in january but that s a surprisingly weak reading and we ll be watching the next month s reading shortly pelley but the overarching question is are we headed to a recession powell the outlook for our economy in my view is a favorable one it s a positive one i think growth this year will be slower than last year last year was the highest growth that we ve experienced since the financial crisis really in more than ten years this year i expect that growth will continue to be positive and continue to be at a healthy rate pelley you mentioned growth last year being slightly over 3 that was with the tax cut and with unemployment in this country at a rate that we haven t seen in decades is that the best the economy can do now 3 slightly over are the days of 4 growth over powell so growth really amounts to you can break it down into a couple of things one is how fast is the labor force growing and the other part is how fast is productivity growing the labor force back when we used to have 4 and 5 growth years the labor force was growing quickly 2 5 3 in some cases back in the 60s and 70s we have an older population now and our labor force is growing more slowly it s growing less than 1 a year so it s not likely that we could sustain the kinds of growth rates that we had when population and the labor force was growing more quickly nonetheless we can grow at a healthy rate and last year was a good year pelley so 4 is something we shouldn t expect in the future powell there will be years of 4 growth but it would be challenging to see sustained 4 growth again because of the slow growth of the workforce our workforce is growing at a trend rate of about 0 5 a year to get to 4 headline growth you would need 3 5 productivity growth we don t have any modern experience of productivity which is just the increase in output per hour worked running at those kinds of levels for a long period but you know who s to say what s possible with productivity pelley will you allow your inflation target to drift up above 2 powell we have a 2 inflation target and we say that it s symmetric and what we mean by symmetric is that if inflation is below target or above target we look at it symmetrically in the sense that we ll always be trying to get back to 2 but that we won t be trying to do that any differently if we re a couple of tenths above 2 or a couple tenths below 2 pelley so over time you want to average 2 but if the inflation rate goes above 2 that doesn t mean you re going to slam on the brakes powell we haven t actually said that we want to average 2 inflation what we ve said is something a little bit different which is that we look at errors above and below 2 symmetrically honestly though inflation has mostly been below 2 we haven t had inflation above 2 and so it has averaged less than 2 and that s something that is worth thinking about because we want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 and we have to reach 2 sustainably and symmetrically we think for that to be the case in the long run pelley want to make sure i understand if the inflation rate rises something over 2 for a limited period of time that doesn t mean the fed s going to jump on the brakes powell i think we wouldn t overreact to inflation modestly above 2 any more than we overreacted to inflation modestly below 2 i think we ll always be moving inflation back to 2 with our policy but i think we do that in a symmetric way pelley were the recent rate increases wrong the president called the fed crazy and out of control powell i feel and our committee feels that our interest rate policy is in a very good place right now it s roughly neutral in a sense that our interest rate is in the range of estimates of a rate that is neither urging the economy to go faster nor trying to slow it down and we think that s an appropriate place for an economy that has the lowest unemployment in 50 years that has inflation right about at our 2 objective that has returned significantly to good health pelley traditionally presidents don t criticize the fed when you heard president trump call the fed crazy and out of control what did you think powell i don t think it would be appropriate for me to comment on other elected officials or on the president pelley you have a rule about speaking about president trump powell i don t think it s appropriate for me to comment on the president pelley and therein lies the rule you don t do it powell no i don t i don t think it s appropriate i really don t pelley isn t it your duty to respond when the president calls the fed a much bigger problem than china powell my duty is one that congress has given us which is to use our tools to achieve maximum employment and stable prices and to supervise and regulate banks so that they treat their customers fairly and so that they re strong well capitalized and can perform their critical function in good times and bad that s my job and i think for me to get into responding to any elected official would be a distraction from that job pelley do you listen to the president powell i don t comment on the president or any elected official pelley can the president fire you powell well the law is clear that i have a four year term and i fully intend to serve it pelley so no in your view powell no pelley you were raising interest rates at the end of last year and just in the beginning of 2019 the president sounded off on that and you stopped raising interest rates was it because of pressure from the white house and the president powell not at all not at all and it s very important that the public understand that we are always going to make decisions based on what we think is right for the american people we have a very wide network of contacts throughout american business and american life we talk to them regularly we listen to diverse perspectives and then we make a decision and that decision is the best one we can make in real time to serve the interests of the american people we will never ever take political considerations into effect this is a strong institution which has a strong culture which is as i ve described it pelley help the audience understand how this was constituted by the banking act of 1935 how independent is the fed who do you answer to powell we answer to the american people and to their elected representatives in our system of government so when we say we re independent what does that mean what it means is that we serve long terms that are not at all synced up with the election cycle and it means that we are directed to execute policy in a strictly non political way serving all americans and that s what we do we are independent in that sense our decisions on rates can t be reversed by any other part of government so of course congress created us and could un create us but nonetheless that s what independence means for us but the other side of independence is accountability that independence is a precious thing it enables us to better serve the public it s critical for our service to the public but it brings with us a duty to seek and embrace accountability and thereby democratic legitimacy and in our system of government our accountability runs through the elected representatives and the oversight committees in congress pelley your fed is apolitical powell strictly non political pelley where are you taking us what is an ideal economy in your view powell well i think of the direction i d like to see us keep going and that is right now unemployment is at a 50 year low and we re at a pretty good we re pretty close to price stability as well but we have longer run issues and it would be important for us as a nation to address these issues in particular you re not counted as unemployed if you haven t looked for a job in the last four weeks and we have an unusually large number of people in their prime working years who are not in the labor force the united states has a lower labor force participation rate than almost every other advanced country that is not our self image as a country it s very important that we bring people back into the labor force so that they can contribute to our shared prosperity and reap the benefits of doing so the economy will be stronger and the country will be stronger if we can do that not all of the tools to accomplish that are the fed s many of them are in the hands of congress pelley where did these people go who are no longer looking for work powell they went a lot of places many of them are discouraged from finding work there are a range of causes really and part of it is evolving technology so as technology evolves it requires rising skills on the part of the people u s educational attainment has not moved up as rapidly as it has in other countries globalization s also a factor for many advanced economies manufacturing to some extent has moved into developing countries and so the manufacturing employment and the manufacturing base is smaller than it was so for whatever reason and the opioid crisis is related to i think to those other factors there are just are quite a few people who are out of the labor force particularly young males who would be better off in the labor force and the country would be better off for it as well pelley many people lost a great deal during the great recession wages are now increasing at around 3 are those people going to be made whole ever powell well the financial crisis did a great deal of damage to many people s lives and of course not all of them will be made whole people lost their houses they lost their livelihoods lost their jobs and there s no way that they re all going to be made whole so i think what we can do is learn our lessons from that crisis that was the worst financial crisis in 75 years we tried very hard to learn the lessons of what went wrong and to build a much stronger more resilient better capitalized financial system so that it will be more resilient to the kinds of shocks that happen in the economy pelley what went wrong was that american banks let the country down are american banks safe today powell american banking system is much much stronger and more resilient than it was before the financial crisis particularly the largest banks have double or more the amount of capital which is to say resources to absorb losses they re far more liquid it s often a lack of liquidity that causes a financial institution to fail so they have far higher levels of liquidity because of stress testing they also have a much more forward looking sense of what the risks are that they re actually running and the ability to manage them is much higher in addition we ve required them to undergo resolution planning in case they do fail there s a plan for what to do which doesn t involve a taxpayer bailout so overall there s no question that not just the banks but various aspects of the financial system are in a much stronger place we never declare victory on this we are still working on it and we will continue to be vigilant because people s lives can be permanently damaged by that kind of event and we really want to avoid that pelley but in 2007 the fed missed the reckless criminal banking that was happening throughout our banking system how do you know today that the banks are safe powell well as i said we spent ten years analyzing understanding what went wrong and trying to correct it and we ve done a great deal as i say we don t declare victory on this we never will we are going to keep our vigilance high on this but overall there s no question in my mind that the financial system is much stronger and better able to perform its critical function in good times and bad pelley a collapse of the financial system like we saw in 2008 cannot happen again powell cannot is a strong statement you know i would say that our system is vastly more resilient and strong than it was before the financial crisis pelley how concerned are you about either criminals or more importantly hostile nations attacking our banking system through the computer system powell so cyber risk is a major focus perhaps the major focus in terms of big risks i think the kinds of risks that happened to us in the financial crisis we ve worked hard to build up resilience against those cyber risk is a constantly evolving risk we devote very large amounts of time and resources to protect the fed but also to protect financial institutions and the financial markets and private corporations do the same thing the banks we supervise are required to have plans in place and state of the art you know technology and the like i would say for cyber risk though i ve never felt a time when i think we re doing enough we just have to keep running hard to keep up with the risk pelley i have the sense that i just hit on the thing that keeps you up at night powell i would say of the risks that we face that certainly is the largest one pelley what s the worst case scenario that you worry about powell well what you worry about one case that we think about a lot is if there were a successful cyber attack on an institution or a financial market utility a payment system which managed to take down that institution or that utility for an extended period of time how do we build the resilience the redundancy in case that does happen and even more how do we do everything we possibly can to make our institutions and our utilities resilient against that activity so that kind of an attack so that it doesn t succeed pelley according to federal statistics the upper half of the american people take home 90 of income leaving about 10 for the lower half of americans where are we headed in this country in terms of income disparity powell well the fed doesn t have direct responsibility for these issues but nonetheless they re important and in particular i would point to a couple of things one is just relatively low mobility we think of ourselves and we ve always been a country where anybody can make it to the top but the data show now that actually the chances of making it from the bottom to the top in the united states are lower than they are in many other comparable countries this is not our national self image and i think that comes down to better education better training getting people into the labor force and putting them on the path to prosperity the other issue is related to that and that is the relative stagnation of incomes for most people for a long time we saw rising incomes generation upon generation that process has slowed down and i think it s important that we do those things we can from a public policy standpoint to give people the tools to take part in the economy and also to create an environment where productivity can go up it s really rising output per hour what we call productivity that allows real wages to rise over time it allows living standards to rise over time pelley adjusted for inflation this generation of middle americans have not done better than their parents what one thing can we do to get the economy for those people unstuck powell well there s no silver bullet there s no one thing here but i would say right at the top of the list would be education people need the education and the training to be able to compete successfully in a global economy where technology is driving so many things and that s a key thing that as a country we need to continue to focus on and do better there really is no substitute for your workforce having the skills and aptitudes to compete in the global markets our workers are the best in the world but we re leaving some people are being left behind pelley i had the opportunity recently to speak with one of the world s leading experts on artificial intelligence who told me quite matter of factly that 40 of all jobs be wiped out by automation and ai is that something you re looking at powell we do pay attention to not just to ai but to evolving technology generally i think you have to start with a longer perspective which is over time technology has tended to raise living standards and also over time prosperity from technology has tended to be spread broadly but that doesn t necessarily hold over short periods of time and there s no law of nature that says it will continue to hold i think what we can do as a country is try to be leaders in technology but also make sure that our workers have the education and the skills they need to benefit from advancing technology pelley the federal reserve back during the great recession added something like trillion worth of mortgages that the rest of the economy really didn t want in order to make lending begin to happen again in this country with the benefit of hindsight was that the right thing to do and is it the kind of thing that the fed would do again if another big sector of our economy collapsed powell when the financial crisis hit the fed cut our interest rates to near zero effectively as low as we could and that wasn t enough the economy needed more support so we went and bought longer duration bonds both treasury securities and mortgage backed securities because that would ve lowered and did lower longer term rates and provide support to the economy since that time there have been countless studies of the effect of those purchases which we refer to as quantitative easing or qe and most studies say conclude that those programs did provide meaningful support to the economy there s a range of perspectives but i would say that s most studies so that s an extraordinary tool that one wouldn t use in the ordinary course but we have said that if needed we will use all of our tools to give the economy the support that it needs pelley so the lesson that the fed learned was that was an effective tool and is now part of your toolbox powell quantitative easing is certainly in the toolbox our first order of business in a downturn would be to cut interest rates to support economic activity if we needed to resort to our other tools including forward guidance including quantitative easing if we needed to do that we would certainly do it pelley no one seems to talk about the national debt anymore have you noticed that powell well it s not our job fiscal policy is not the fed s job but when something threatens the overall economy i feel that we have a duty to speak up pelley does the national debt threaten the overall economy powell in a long run sense u s debt is on an unsustainable path and what i mean by that is that the debt is growing faster than the economy that cannot go on indefinitely i wouldn t want people to think that we re on the verge of a debt crisis or anything like that i don t believe that is the case but what happens is you borrow more and more and you re going to be spending more and more taxpayer dollars on servicing debt rather than investing in the things that we need to succeed as a country better education things like that so it is important that we get our hands around the debt and ultimately we will there won t be any choice in the end but again we don t do fiscal policy we don t give congress advice on particular fiscal policies but i will say that it s important that we address this issue pelley what do you mean we won t have any choice in the end powell well the record is if something is unsustainable and cannot go on indefinitely it will stop so ultimately countries and businesses and people who borrow excessively have to face that they ve borrowed excessively again the united states is a long way from any such event the problem is more that we re spending more and more of our precious resources on servicing debt rather than investing in the things that we really need to succeed as a country pelley the bleeding will stop one way or the other powell in the long run yes pelley congress has been raising the debt ceiling steadily do you think that s something that should continue to happen for the economy powell the debt ceiling is really just something that allows the federal government to borrow to pay for the programs that congress has already authorized the real point is that congress has to better match spending and taxes tax revenue the debt ceiling is something that only the united states has they have a separate vote in effect on whether to raise the debt ceiling to allow the money to be borrowed to actually pay for the programs that they ve approved so again we don t do fiscal policy here at the fed but when something threatens the overall economy i feel an obligation to speak up and in the debt ceiling the idea that we would somehow come to a place where we re not honoring all of our obligations is something that could threaten the economy pelley a large bank merger has recently been announced and i wonder whether we still have banks that pose a systemic risk to the economy that they are too big to fail that was a big problem in 2008 it cost taxpayers 700 billion aren t we still in the same place powell we re in a very different place so we have identified eight banking institutions in the united states as systemically important and we have focused the highest expectations and regulation and requirements on those eight institutions and that s not going to change they re very highly capitalized they have high amounts of liquidity and just in general high requirements for banks below that level though as we move down into smaller more traditional banks that present less of a threat to the economy we think it s appropriate that they not be subject to quite the same high level of expectations as we impose on those banks pelley but the eight banks that you just mentioned are still too big to fail and your answer to that is to watch them not break them up powell no i think in the sense of too big to fail no that s not the case the fed doesn t have the authorities that we had before the crisis to do some of the things we did during the crisis and what we have instead is a resolution mechanism so that if a large financial institution does fail it can be addressed in what amounts to a bankruptcy kind of a format pelley it can be unwound over time it doesn t have to be powell yes pelley a collapse powell we didn t have a means of allowing a large financial institution s fail before the financial crisis we have that now and we ve spent many years building up a framework around it and requiring the banks to have higher levels of liquidity and capital and to have plans i think we ve made a great deal of progress that s not to say that the failure of a large bank wouldn t be a very challenging event for the economy and for the financial markets but i think we ve made a great deal of progress in addressing that problem pelley any of these eight large banks in your view can be unwound in an orderly way powell i believe that is right certainly that is the goal that we ve been working for a decade now and i think we ve made tremendous progress toward it pelley what is the biggest threat to american prosperity that no one is talking about powell that no one is talking about i would point to our longer run challenges so the u s economy right now is in a pretty good place unemployment is at a 50 year low inflation is close to its target we are growing at a reasonable rate but we face longer run challenges and i would like to see a stronger national focus on for example labor force participation there are plenty of prime aged people who are not in the labor force and who would be better off in the labor force and i d like to see us find policies that can support and reward work provide training and education and generally try to raise u s labor force participation so that we re no longer at the bottom of the league table among advanced economies i think that s a win win that gives us faster growth it gives us more widespread prosperity these people can contribute to our shared prosperity and they can also benefit from doing so pelley this may not be a fair question so let me kind of ask it as a sidebar do you know how many of those people there are what s the number of people who are working age but are unattached from the workforce powell well the number is very large but a lot of people are doing so by choice really the question is so our labor force participation rate right now is 63 2 if it were to go up three or four percentage points that would be very good that would be very good because some people in their prime age working prime age labor force participation is much higher than that but still lower than in other countries really i could get you a number but i don t have one off the top pelley that s powell off my head pelley that s why i asked because i didn t know whether this was top of mind and right off the top of your head or powell it s a complicated answer pelley well of course it is all of this is pelley you had dinner with the president recently and you took your vice chair with you did you feel like you needed a witness powell it would not be appropriate for me to talk about private conversations like that i will say that that we had at the president s invitation we had dinner secretary mnuchin vice chair clarida the president and i had dinner we talked about the economy but i wouldn t want to get into talking too much about the contents of a private meeting pelley without getting into the contents did you feel like the president was listening to you powell i try not to comment on the president i just don t think it s appropriate for me to comment on the president or frankly any other elected official if i do that i think it s a distraction from the important job that we have pelley this builds on a conversation that we were having a short time ago you mentioned the opioid crisis it s that big a problem in the labor force powell yes it is the opioid crisis is millions of people they tend to be young males and it s a very significant problem and it s part of a larger picture of low labor force participation particularly by young males pelley i mean you seem to be talking about part of this generation being lost unattached from the rest of the economy powell that is the issue when you have people who are not taking part in the economic life of a country in a meaningful way who don t have the skills and aptitudes to play a role or who are not doing so because they re addicted to drugs or in jail then in a sense they are being left behind and there are too many of those people and i think bringing them into the labor force would enormously benefit our country we d grow more strongly and i think it would be good for the economy and good for the country pelley many people seem to believe that the american dream is dying to them you would say what powell well i have a more optimistic view than that i do believe the united states has very strong institutions it is the world s leading democracy we still have the strongest economy in the world and we have longer run problems as is always the case with an economy and it s important pelley but the middle class is getting left behind mr chairman powell what s happened is that incomes for sort of the median family have gone up at a much slower rate than they had in generations over the last century let s say and that s not a good thing and i think as a country we ought to be doing those things that will enable people to succeed whatever part of the economic world they come from and i think that s about our workers having the education and the skills that they need to capitalize on the great opportunities that are presented by technology pelley you mention education a lot what is missing powell well u s educational attainment led the world for a long time we were the first country in the world to have gender blind secondary education and what you see from that period of our history is technologies evolving very quickly but living standards are rising and on a broad basis in the 1970s around about that time you saw educational attainment flattening out for the united states and you saw it rising all around the world in emerging market countries and also in the other advanced economies and just about that time you also see median incomes middle class incomes flattening out and you also see lower mobility for people at the bottom end so i think at the top of the list of things that we could do to improve living standards improving the education system is right at the top of that list it s very very hard to do it pelley i spoke to a gentleman who was at the time the president of caterpillar the company that makes heavy mining and construction equipment and he told me that he wanted to build a new manufacturing plant in the united states but he couldn t find enough american workers who had the education to operate computerized machine tools powell we hear that all the time from our business contacts and it is very disturbing i mentioned these people who are out of the labor force or on the fringes of the labor force and you hear all the time of lack of skilled labor even carpenters electricians plumbers factory workers who can operate you know computerized equipment there s a great need for those people and we absolutely can match up the people we have with those jobs it s just something we need to focus strongly on as a country pelley a recent gallup poll showed that more young people in america believed in socialism than capitalism that s got to be hard to hear for a guy who used to work in private equity and is now chairman of the fed powell i think that our market based economy has served us very well over time very well and i think it ll continue to do so let s remember that the u s economy is the strongest in the world let s remember that having a market based system where private actors make decisions about allocating capital and things like that has served us well pelley finally let me just nail this point home most people remember 2008 and the great recession can you tell me in this interview that our banking system is safe and sound and that can t happen again powell what i can tell you is that our banking system is incomparably stronger and more resilient than it was before the financial crisis particularly our largest banks have far higher levels of capital to absorb losses they re far more liquid often financial institutions have problems because of a lack of liquidity our banks have much much more liquidity than they had our banks are far more aware of the risks that they re running and better able to manage them and if they do fail we now have a system for resolving them in bankruptcy so we are in a much better place than we were we will never declare victory on this we re always going to be vigilant about emerging risks and we re going to be vigilant about not backsliding and perhaps inadvertently allowing the financial system to weaken again pelley in those days the fed did not see the great recession coming i wonder what has the fed learned from that lesson powell well i think we ve learned a wide range of lessons one of which is that to our surprise the financial system was not strong enough to withstand the shock that hit it we really did think and i think broadly experts thought that the system was strong enough and it turned out not to be so the crisis exposed great weaknesses not just in the banking system but all across the financial system we ve spent a decade building higher resilience as i mentioned we will never declare victory on this we ll always be remaining vigilant pelley but the fed won t be fooled again powell well we are determined to remain vigilant and to continue to monitor for emerging risks and to sustain the gains in resilience that we have you know fought for and won pelley one more follow up do hostile nation states have the ability to take our banks down through cyberspace powell the part of it that we control is to have our banks be as resilient as they possibly can and also our government institutions like the fed we spend a great deal of resources and time on cyber resilience and so do our banks and we actively cooperate with other government authorities on this and it s just something where i think you can never sleep well with this new risk and just do everything you can to stay ahead of it and that s going to be what we do pelley yeah but that is the question are we ahead of it powell what we can do is focus on analyzing the latest threats playing the best defense making sure that our institutions are resilient and won t be successfully attacked and also if they are successfully attacked having a backup plan having redundancy and so we do all of those things there s a great focus on this at all private institutions also public institutions at the fed we have a particular role in making sure that our banking institution is resilient to cyber risks we take this very seriously i d say in a sense it is our top priority but i think it s just something where we re going to be working hard to stay ahead of the threat for a long time pelley it s become your top priority powell in a sense it s the biggest risk you know the kinds of risks that we faced in the financial crisis are very real but we know i think generally what to do there we raised capital standards we raised liquidity standards the banks are taking much less risk now so we addressed all of those things that happened in the last crisis cyber is a relatively new kind of a risk with nation state actors and it s one where the playbook is still being developed in real time and yes it is a very high focus for many aspects of government and the private sector pelley too many unknowns powell many unknowns and it s an evolving situation it s you know the threats evolve and develop and we do everything we can to stay ahead of them pelley the dollar is strong which to most people sounds like a good thing but of course that limits imports if american goods become too expensive the president said recently i want a strong dollar but i want a dollar that s great for our country not a dollar that s so strong that it makes it prohibitive for us to do business with other nations and take their business are we now in danger of having a dollar that s too strong powell so the fed doesn t have responsibility for the dollar that is a responsibility that lies with the administration and with the treasury department so we don t comment on the level of the dollar i would say that it is one financial condition among many that we monitor pelley are you concerned about it powell i think financial conditions broadly continue to be in an appropriate place and supportive of a favorable outlook for the united states at this point the interview moved to the federal reserve board room pelley that federal open market committee that sits around this table is the committee that makes the decision about interest rates you ve had four interest rate increases in your tenure i wonder were any of those unanimous powell they were all unanimous pelley all four powell yes pelley no disagreement about raising interest rates powell no it s not at all unusual to have a dissenting vote about monetary policy that s traditionally happened with great frequency it has not happened yet on my watch that s not to say that we don t have vigorous discussions and a range of perspectives and i think one of the great benefits of the system that we have is we have 12 reserve banks and they bring different perspectives to our discussions and that s to me a very healthy thing you want to hear disagreement around issues before you make a decision i think mistakes get made when everyone agrees and no one tries to explain why the decision is incorrect pelley well tell me what are these meetings like around this table as far as i know no television camera has ever been in here during an open market committee meeting powell well they go something like this we all sit around this table and there s lots of staff sitting around and we begin with a briefing on the economy and of changes in financial conditions and then participants have a chance to offer their own commentary on the state of the economy we take a break we have dinner and the next morning we come in and we talk about monetary policy as a follow on to what we discussed the day before about the economy we discuss monetary policy there s a presentation by staff individual participants contribute what they want to contribute to that discussion then generally the chair offers a proposal and then there s a vote on that proposal pelley how lively is the discussion how often are there dissenting views powell dissenting views are very common but really it s more though different perspectives not every different perspective leads to a dissenting vote we always have a range of perspectives on every issue so you re guaranteed that with a committee that has as many as 19 members right now we have 17 participants on the fomc you re going to get a range of perspectives on essentially everything and that s very healthy i think pelley and the various bank presidents are coming from various places in the country you have someone coming from the bank in san francisco somebody coming from the bank in dallas somebody coming from the bank in minneapolis so you get a really good look around the country that way powell you really do one thing the presidents can do is they report on what s happening in their district so each of the 12 reserve banks now has a very highly developed network of contacts that reaches far beyond the business community deep into the business community but also into academe and all different walks of american life and they pretty systematically get the perspectives of people through surveys and conversations and they accumulate that they come here and they talk about what s going on in their district so you gain just listening to what s going on around the country i think you gain an understanding of what s happening which is superior to just looking at the national numbers if you re just looking at the national level numbers you re going to miss a lot of nuance in my opinion so it s a good system and i think it s served us well served the public well pelley how much do you think the average american understands about the federal reserve powell i think it is understandable that most people would not pay a lot of attention to central banking they have other things to do in their lives that is very understandable it is central banking and the fed are important things in our society but they re not things that are widely understood and i frankly think it s our obligation to be as transparent and explain ourselves as clearly as possible because what we do affects all americans and any american who wants to understand what we do should be able to do so straightforwardly pelley everybody s got a mortgage or a car payment powell that s right no our interest rate policy affects everyone and so does financial regulation indirectly so that s why i say we have an obligation to be as transparent as possible to explain ourselves to the american people and to their elected representatives in congress pelley well when the committee does decide to raise interest rates how does that affect people powell well we raise one interest rate called the federal funds rate and when we raise that rate other short term overnight interest rates so borrowings that are a day long or a month long or a few months long those will be affected by our change in policy pelley so the banks pay a higher rate once you increase powell when consumers who have floating rate debt will pay a modestly higher rate we move rates up quite gradually so you might or might not notice it but generally speaking borrowers will pay a slightly higher rate when we raise our federal funds rate pelley why are the rate increases so gradual powell well we think that s what the economy has needed we held our rate our policy rate near zero for almost seven years that s something that s without precedent and i think we were wise to do so and then about three years ago when the economy had really begun to return to health we very gradually raised rates to a level that s more normal in a healthy economy rates are still quite low but they re closer to a normal level for a healthy economy pelley is it sort of an attitude of wait and see you raise the interest rate a quarter of a point and see what happens and then if the economy can take it you raise another quarter just tiny little steps at a time powell so looking back i think we ve been very careful to give the economy every chance to recover and return to growth and return to health and that s one reason why we ve moved so gradually i think today we actually think our policy rate is in a good place and we ve said that we re going to be patient and wait to see how events evolve before we make any change to our policy pelley we had the boom and bust in the 90s we had the boom and bust in the mid 2000s are you trying to avoid another boom and bust cycle powell well yes a boom and bust cycle s not something we want well you know we re using our tools today to try to sustain this long expansion the economy s been expanding now for almost ten years and we want to use our tools to allow the economy to continue to expand to continue to keep the labor market strong job growth strong the economy growing and also keep inflation close to our two percent objective pelley this is the longest expansion in american history how long can it last powell it will be the longest in a few months if it continues i would just say there s no reason why it can t continue pelley for years powell you know eventually expansions come to an end the business cycle has not been repealed but i would say there s no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand pelley this expansion s not worn out yet powell i don t think so i think there s every reason to think that this expansion can continue to expand

survey tomorrow rba deputy governor guy debelle speaks tomorrow about climate change and the economy today the rba will release a research discussion paper on a model of the australian housing market wealth within chief analyst dale gillham said this year s rally in australian bank stocks has him questioning whether this is the start of a longer term move up or if the market has jumped the gun speculators have definitely come into the market believing that the banks are cheap given they have fallen over nearly 4 years and lost 30 to 40 per cent from their previous highs mr gillham said among challenges he sees for the banks are tighter lending conditions the potential for a rate cut by the rba a potential change in government and an already declining property market advertisement it s no secret that the banks make most of their profits from lending which means they may struggle to grow if people are not willing to borrow to pay top dollar for property mr gillham said and with asic set to bring civil and criminal charges this short term move up could be over quite quickly so is now the time to be buying the banks in my opinion it is good to make hay while the sun shines but it is more important to not fall in love with the banks and be prepared to sell if they start to fall away again mr gillham said the asx 200 is really defying logic and he sees heavy resistance at

when libertarians dole out blame for the growth of government perhaps we should take a look in the mirror is it possible that our arguments correct and widely accepted though they are about government inefficiency ineffectiveness and incompetence have had the unintended consequence of fueling government s growth for 50 years reason writers and other libertarians have preached that government at all levels is bad at what it does a view that virtually every poll finds to be widespread among americans of all political persuasions in his first inaugural address in 1981 ronald reagan famously declared that government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem that s a tight summary of what not just a majority of libertarians but most americans believe these days but has all this declining trust in government actually led to smaller government with some meaningful exceptions the answer is no the government spends more controls more and does more than ever a respectable and growing body of research shows that as societies move from relatively high to lower levels of trust citizens counterintuitively call for greater and greater levels of government involvement in their lives individuals in low trust countries want more government intervention even though they know the government is corrupt summarize the authors of a 2010 quarterly journal of economics paper the history of the libertarian movement is a decadeslong monologue inveighing against virtually every aspect of the federal government from nation building to the drug war to the post office should we pause and like the ss men in the mitchell and webb comedy sketch who notice for the first time that they have skulls on their uniforms ask ourselves are we the baddies and if we are what might be some strategies worth exploring to win over more people to the side of you know wanting to shrink government understanding that the relationship between trust in the state and the growth of the state is much less straightforward than it seems is awfully important if we actually want to persuade people that society would be better off with less government we don t trust the government like we used to first the nearly complete evacuation of trust and confidence in virtually every part of the federal government is worth documenting in some detail it seems inarguable that libertarian arguments about the general inefficiency ineffectiveness and incompetence of most government action have won the public debate in 1964 according to pew research 77 percent of respondents agreed with the statement that they can trust the government in washington always or most of the time by 2015 that figure stood at just 19 percent last august gallup released a survey in which 21 percent of americans a plurality named dissatisfaction with government poor leadership the most important issue facing the country a different gallup poll conducted regularly since the 60s asks respondents whether big government big business or big labor is the biggest threat to the country in the future big government has always been the top response but the margin of fear has grown far wider over time in 1969 the fraction picking government was around 30 percent by 2016 it had leaped to 67 percent the overall decline in trust of government is not surprisingly reflected in attitudes toward specific functions or parts of the government since the early 1970s gallup has been asking poll questions aimed at ascertaining how people feel about various institutions in america respondents are asked to tell the pollster how much confidence you yourself have in each one a great deal quite a lot some or very little the results are stark when it comes to congress for instance 42 percent of americans had either a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in our national legislature in 1973 throughout this article i ll use that combined figure as the basic measure of high trust or confidence in 2018 only 11 percent of respondents did the last time that number cracked 20 percent was in 2005 the presidency has taken a similar beating in 1975 the first time gallup asked the question just a year after president richard nixon s resignation in the wake of the watergate scandal 52 percent said they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the white house in february 1991 72 percent did reflecting the popularity of the first gulf war by october 1991 though the number had fallen to 50 percent and it has mostly remained in the low to mid 30s ever since the last time a majority of respondents had high levels of trust in the white house was in 2009 barack obama s first year in office imagine more americans trusted the presidency a year after watergate than do now the other major branch of the federal government the supreme court has also seen a slide albeit a less dramatic one in the mid to late 1970s 45 percent to 49 percent of americans expressed confidence in the high court during reagan s second term that number grew reaching a high of 56 percent in 1988 the year after robert bork s nomination hearings electrified the country the survey from 2018 by contrast found just 37 percent had high confidence in the court and that poll was conducted before extremely contentious hearings over the brett kavanaugh nomination so it s likely that the next iteration will reveal even less confidence in the institution while not directly part of the federal government other major institutions tracked by gallup reflect what might be considered negative spillover effects public schools banks and the nation s health care industry are all heavily subsidized regulated to a substantial degree or both in the mid 1970s up to 62 percent of americans had high confidence in the nation s k 12 system over the last decade it s been rare for that number to pull out of the high 20s or low 30s about half of us had confidence in banks for most of the 1980s but following the savings and loan crisis of the late 80s and early 90s and the housing collapse and financial crisis of the late 00s the percentage with high confidence in banks has also been stuck in the high 20s and low 30s something similar happened to the health care sector in 1975 the first time gallup asked about the medical system 80 percent expressed confidence by the early 1990s as bill clinton proposed a much larger role for the government in delivering health care the confidence level was down to the mid 30s to low 40s where it remains in 1964 according to pew research center 77 percent of respondents agreed with the statement that they can trust the government in washington always or most of the time by 2015 that figure stood at just 19 percent not all parts of the government are losing trust gallup started tracking attitudes toward the military in 1975 when 58 percent expressed high confidence during the last decade that number has never dipped below 71 percent and has climbed as high as 82 percent in 2009 it currently stands at 74 percent similarly confidence in the police has remained at or above 52 percent since gallup first asked about it in 1993 it s currently at 54 percent confidence in the criminal justice system has actually improved since the early 1990s when it clocked in at under 20 percent on a regular basis it was 27 percent a year ago and now stands at 22 percent these anomalies are all the more striking given the relative unpopularity of military action in the middle east and afghanistan the series of highly publicized recent cases of police brutality and increasing calls for sentencing reform it s always government s fault who s responsible for this decline in trust and confidence as with assigning responsibility for an overtime loss a group project gone wrong or a global financial crisis this isn t easy and any given accounting is likely to be incomplete and contested demographic changes world events religious belief long term economic growth and status relative to other countries are all factors note also that we don t just trust government less than we used to we trust each other less too in 1972 according to pew 46 percent of americans agreed that most of us can be trusted by 2015 even after a decadeslong decline in crime that number had dipped to 31 percent but the most powerful reasons for collapsing trust in government are surely the actions of government consider even a smattering of revelations and developments going back to the late 60s the u s failure in vietnam was bad enough on its own but the pentagon papers a secret report commissioned by the defense department that concluded our involvement was doomed from the start revealed a government that was incompetent at best and duplicitous at worst the watergate scandal and revelations of widespread corruption in the nixon white house led to the unprecedented resignation of a president who had won re election by the largest electoral college margin up to that point in history what suckers we were giving a crook 61 percent of the vote high profile government commissions issued reports showing that intelligence agencies and the military had engaged in illegal surveillance of american citizens and tested would be mind control drugs on unsuspecting soldiers and civilians even as the economy grew in significant ways and many consumer goods became more widely available there was in the 1970s a pervasive feeling of economic malaise especially because the federal government seemed incapable of reeling in double digit inflation and unemployment wage and price controls were tried along with the rationing of gasoline that most basic of commodities none of these interventions worked as intended by the time inflation was tamed and unemployment brought down the iran contra scandal was casting the ronald reagan administration in a terrible light and the savings and loan crisis was beginning to erupt in 1989 rep jim wright d texas became the first speaker of the house forced to resign in the wake of a financial scandal the clinton years seem distant and quaint now but they were marred by never ending scandals only some of them sexual in nature and only some of them involving the president and first lady largely forgotten the discovery of corruption involving the congressional post office which functioned as a bank for members contributed mightily to the gop winning the house and senate in 1994 almost two dozen congressmen were singled out by the house ethics committee for kiting checks and abusing various privileges afforded them the fallout was bad enough that speaker tom foley d wash who had himself replaced wright was bounced from office the first time a sitting speaker had lost a re election race in more than 100 years the rise of cable and online news in the 90s meant that this sort of thing crawled along the bottom of our screens every time we flipped through an ever growing array of channels or refreshed our web browsers the 21st century brought its own set of highly publicized scandals and other ugly revelations false accounts of weapons of mass destruction underwrote the u s invasion of iraq more broadly we ve been waging inconclusive and increasingly unpopular wars for virtually all of this century secret mass surveillance programs were exposed under both republican and democratic administrations even if most people don t understand all the nuances of the banking and housing industries they understand that the federal government was intimately involved in inflating a housing bubble that helped cause the biggest financial crisis since the great depression perhaps more important they have a sense that the government s responses to the great recession bank bailouts auto bailouts stimulus spending mostly had the effect of shunting money to well connected industries and firms it s bad enough that government can t be trusted it may be worse still when it s impotent often when the state waves its wand at the middle east at health care at the economy its magic is weaker than a first year student s at hogwarts government is getting a lot bigger and yet cynicism about government hasn t diminished government over the last few decades washington s size scope and spending have metastasized per milton friedman federal spending is the purest or at least the most easily grasped measure of the size of the federal government because we eventually have to pay for it all in inflation adjusted dollars the government spent about 1 3 trillion in 1968 vs a record high 4 1 trillion in 2018 over the last 50 years federal spending on a per capita basis nearly tripled reaching about 12 000 in 2018 in 1970 federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product was 18 percent since 2008 it has never sunk below 20 percent a level typically reserved for periods of major wars in the final budget year of george w bush s presidency and the first of barack obama s washington responded to the financial crisis by jacking spending up to what seems to be a permanently higher level the congressional budget office estimates that over the next decade federal outlays will average 22 4 percent of gdp annually within a few years interest payments on the national debt 22 trillion and growing will be larger than annual payouts for medicaid and the pentagon two of the largest single items in the federal budget when it comes to spending it s onward and upward why loss of trust leads to growth in government counterintuitively the less trusting of government we become the more likely we are to call for more regulation by that same government when individuals distrust others they prefer government officials to regulate and control even when they know that these officials themselves cannot be trusted observed philippe aghion yann algan pierre cahuc and andrei shleifer in the aforementioned quarterly journal of economics article their paper drew on the world values survey which has collected data from 50 countries for decades one example they cite involves relative levels of regulation on starting new businesses high trusting countries such as nordic and anglo saxon countries impose very few controls on opening a business they write whereas low trusting countries typically mediterranean latin american and african countries impose heavy regulations a similar pattern occurs when it comes to setting wages residents of low trust russia slovenia east germany and bulgaria exhibit the strongest support for government control of wages approximately 92 of russians and 82 of east germans favor wage control respondents in mediterranean countries also strongly favor wage control by the state 78 of the spaniards and 60 of the french agree that the government should control wages meanwhile in anglo saxon and nordic countries less than half the population agree similar patterns obtain for the support of government control of prices but why do people in low trust countries turn for protection to governments they know are at best incompetent and at worst corrupt i talked about this dynamic with one of the paper s co authors andrei shleifer who grew up in the old soviet union moved to the united states as a teenager in the mid 1970s and now teaches economics at harvard when people perceive that their world is out of control and unpredictable shleifer says they want order to be restored the faster the better they want regulation they want a dictator who will bring back order often he adds the rules and restrictions create a negative feedback loop in response to loss of trust governments set up new regulations that make it harder to start businesses those policies tend to lead to fewer businesses and less employment which in turn leads to slower economic growth which leads to calls for more redistribution and yet more regulation weak or nonexistent economic growth is the deep background for the loss of trust throughout society according to the george mason university economist alex tabarrok like shleifer tabarrok is an immigrant in his case from canada up through the early 70s he explains annual economic growth averaged about 3 percent a year in the united states since then it has become both more volatile and weaker overall for most of the 21st century it has averaged around 2 percent when everyone is getting wealthier and the economy is humming along and things are improving it s easier to trust other people tabarrok says if the economic pie is relatively fixed you distrust other people more because you know the only way someone can get ahead is by screwing you and vice versa then there s the populist rhetoric coming from politicians as different as donald trump and bernie sanders that accuses american leaders of selling out their own citizens while furthering the interests of the european union russia china and other foreign powers the idea that the system is rigged is far more widely represented in retail politics than it was a few decades ago that s both a cause and an effect of the loss of confidence in government shleifer stresses that while things in the aggregate are getting better for virtually everyone in the united states the standard of living keeps ticking up the situation is more volatile you don t get a job until later in life he says and when you do it seems less secure than the one that your parents or grandparents had shleifer points to the economic expansion that has been underway since 2009 this economy has bounced back tremendously from the great recession and much faster than japan or europe he says yet there s still a widespread perception among many people that getting and keeping a job are beyond their control that palpable lack of agency orients people to push for government intervention don t expect pols to change their behavior if trust and confidence in government have declined mostly due to the behavior of politicians then the country s political class should do most of the heavy lifting in restoring people s faith right good luck with that during the last election season the gop challenger to pennsylvania s democratic governor released a facebook video declaring he would stomp all over his opponent s face with golf spikes donald trump s m o which is clearly taking root in the republican party is to alienate and polarize real and imagined adversaries and trump and the republicans are nearly matched in intensity and frequency by leaders of the democratic opposition rep maxine waters d calif has called for partisans to harass republican officials in restaurants and other public places while campaigning for democrats former attorney general eric holder said to great applause when they go low we kick em that s what this new democratic party is about you can t be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about former democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton told cnn last fall she added that civility will return to politics only if and when her party takes control of congress if confidence in government has declined mostly due to the behavior of politicians then the country s political class should do most of the heavy lifting in restoring people s faith right good luck with that this sort of discourse is not conducive to increasing trust and confidence in government it s also a sign of a government that already inspires low levels of faith shleifer and his co authors rely on research that shows a causal link runs not only from beliefs to policies but from policies to beliefs as well which suggests a sort of infinite loop tabarrok is generally pessimistic that political trust can be regained any time soon especially in a climate where candidates explicitly use the lack of trust as a means to gaining power he says donald trump is exemplary in this regard castigating his primary and general election opponents as crooked and lying and threatening not to abide by the election outcome if he didn t win but trump is not alone in questioning the legitimacy of the government as evidenced by the fact that hillary clinton has herself repeatedly questioned the results of the 2016 race just a few weeks before election day she tut tutted trump for refusing to say that he d respect the results of this election if he lost by doing that she added he s threatening our democracy yet in the wake of her loss she told mother jones that there are lots of questions about legitimacy she pointed to russian troll accounts on social media and what she claimed were widespread voter suppression efforts there are some odd ducks such as rep justin amash the libertarian leaning republican from michigan who seem to speak a different language amash has the distinction of being openly reviled by the two gop speakers of the house under whom he has served john boehner famously cursed him out for forcing votes on national security agency domestic surveillance and amash says paul ryan literally refused to acknowledge his presence on multiple occasions judging from his twitter feed amash s relationship with new democratic speaker nancy pelosi may not be much better last year for instance he called her out for working with her predecessors to weaken privacy protections writing every time i brought rs and ds together to protect americans personal data and 4thamendment rights you teamed up with speakerryan or speakerboehner to defeat us you spearheaded the democratic charge against two separate amash amendments on the patriotact and fisa702 alone among members of the house and senate amash entered office in 2011 pledging to explain on his facebook page every vote he makes during an interview with reason last year he outlined a transparent approach to politics that certainly would inspire more trust if widely adopted i think that if you go and you put yourself before them as i do at town halls and other things and you explain yourself people will connect with you they ll appreciate what you re doing they may find that they agree with you on so many things that they didn t think they agreed with you on they ll find that you share the same principles that they share you just have to put yourself out there and be open but to expect the political class writ large to change its behavior is surely asking too much if trust is to return to government the process probably won t be led by politicians other routes to restoring trust a revitalized sense of national purpose might help to tamp down distrust of course the one reliable cause that unites the nation is war and even that unwelcome unifier has its limits since at least 2004 most americans have considered the conflict in iraq to be a mistake tabarrok suggests that national purpose might come not from government but from figures such as elon musk the entrepreneur who has underwritten private rocket launches new ways of creating and storing power and transportation projects such as the hyperloop a vactrain that theoretically can move people and freight far more efficiently than traditional modes of ground transportation the most likely path to increasing trust in government is economic growth that s not only robust but widely understood to be sustainable from 1994 to 2001 pew data show upticks in the number of people who trust the government to mostly do the right thing that was a period of partisan rancor nearly as intense as the current moment when a republican congress led by newt gingrich engaged in bombastic rhetoric and bill clinton s democrats often gave as good as they got the increase in trust was surely partly an artifact of years of strong though not uninterrupted growth it also coincided with a flattening of spending using inflation adjusted dollars the feds spent about 250 billion more in clinton s last year than in his first a small increase compared to the spending surges seen under ronald reagan and george w bush viewed as a percentage of gdp federal spending fell significantly during that period in 1991 it equaled 21 percent by 2001 it equaled just 17 5 percent since 2008 it has never been less than 20 percent of gdp the u s economy has been growing consistently for nearly 10 years and the two most recent quarters have seen relatively high annualized growth rates of 4 1 percent and 3 5 percent respectively wage growth over the last year clocked in at 2 9 percent the biggest increase in a decade while forecasts are often off there is a broad consensus that growth in 2019 will be slower than it was last year but there is an interesting disconnect in public opinion with two thirds of americans believing that the country is headed in the wrong direction and about the same fraction saying that the economy is headed in the right direction according to a poll conducted by cbs news in january during the monthlong partial shutdown of the federal government the top reason people cited as evidence that we re going the wrong way is the state of politics and government 64 percent while attitudes toward the current economy are positive there is a feeling of longer term gloom with 42 percent of respondents saying they believe life will be worse for the next generation compared to just 30 percent who said it will be better deregulatory initiatives at agencies such as the food and drug administration and the environmental protection agency could help keep the economy humming as could recent tax cuts for individuals and businesses especially provisions that allow profits made overseas to be brought home without being subjected to taxes but when you add in trump s trade wars and a general sense of paranoia about the country being invaded by immigrants and foreign goods a staple of the president s rhetoric the effect is a sense of uncertainty not sustainable growth and the swelling national debt fueled significantly by those republican tax cuts is a looming iceberg that moves ever closer threatening to either sink the economy or put the country through a wrenching reduction in entitlement spending two full years into his first term donald trump maintains historically low approval ratings he has been less popular at every point of his presidency so far than any president since the end of world war ii which is hardly likely to make people relax and believe that the relatively strong economy is going to last add to that the change of power in the house of representatives with democrats promising to investigate the hell out of trump while pushing for massive expansions in spending medicare for all the green new deal etc and the future looks increasingly volatile and partisan yet there are potential ways forward local and state governments have always inspired significantly higher rates of confidence than the feds in 1973 according to gallup the percentage of people saying they had a great deal or a fair amount of trust in their local government was 63 percent it currently stands at 72 percent state government inspired the same 63 percent in 1973 after going as high as 80 percent in the late 1990s and as low as 51 percent in 2009 it s back to 63 percent today if voters are more comfortable with government that s closer to home shifting decision making out of washington and back to state capitals and city halls might help restore confidence that means more work is needed putting together serious detailed policy plans that give more autonomy to individuals and communities highlighting examples of markets and voluntary organizations succeeding in building trust self regulation and common purpose and appealing to a broad positive vision of a strictly limited government whose goals revolve around ensuring basic fairness equality of opportunity continued economic growth and rising living standards parents of children who attend charter schools or other public schools of choice report higher rates of satisfaction than parents whose children attend traditional public schools based on residential assignment for instance according to a 2012 education next study using department of education data 65 percent of parents with a child in a charter school reported being very satisfied with the school for other forms of public choice schools the response was 61 percent for traditional residential assignment schools it was 56 percent libertarians should be championing policies that increase local control and individual autonomy the various regimes that have surrounded the legalization of marijuana provide a wealth of outcomes that are better and worse for the most part colorado the first state in the country to fully legalize recreational pot has managed to get things right by allowing municipalities to opt in or out of allowing weed to be sold by setting taxes low enough to discourage black markets and by tracking use rates to alleviate fears that teenage consumption would increase after legalization it hasn t that experience can and should be compared to places such as california where regulation is more onerous a black market flourishes and other problems abound it may seem odd that loss of trust in government would give rise to calls for more government odder still it may fall to libertarians to identify and promote government policies that give people enough breathing space to imagine a world where we ask the state to do less for us
venezuela s economic situation is unthinkably bad especially for what was once south america s richest nation hyperinflation plunging oil production and unpayable debts will confront whoever wins the current struggle for control between nicolas maduro and juan guaido both of whom claim to be president but recovery plans are already being drafted inside and outside the country here s a look at how venezuela fell and at some of the ideas for getting it back on its feet declining oil production crude accounts for 98 percent of venezuela s exports and funds the social welfare programs that once formed the core of the government s agenda a decline in output that started under previous president hugo chavez has accelerated in the past few years with production falling to a seven decade low of 1 3 million barrels a day in 2018 from about 3 million barrels a day when chavez came to power in 1999 this collapse has helped sink the broader economy which is estimated to have shrunk by about half over the past five years venezuelan oil production dwindles how did we get here the initial fall in output was caused by insufficient investment in and poor management of the oil industry resulting in shortages of equipment and supplies corruption that siphoned off resources and a brain drain of skilled workers especially after a two month strike that ended in 2003 output took a precipitous downturn in august 2017 in part because u s sanctions restricted venezuela s ability to borrow from american investors or access u s financial markets in january new penalties effectively blocked venezuela from exporting crude to the u s its biggest customer those sanctions also barred u s companies from selling venezuela the petroleum distillate it needs to dilute its heavy crude further hindering its ability to export what can be done the u s presumably would lift its sanctions if maduro chavez s chosen successor were to be ousted and guaido the head of the national assembly to assume real power guaido has announced his picks for new boards for the state oil company petroleos de venezuela sa and its u s refining arm citgo they include industry veterans whose credibility could help attract the investment needed to expand exploration and production an investor friendly venezuela could expect to tap financing from the international monetary fund and world bank wall street foreign oil companies and venezuelans moving money back into the country to achieve economic stability in the longer term venezuela would need to reduce its vulnerability to boom and bust commodity cycles by using oil revenue to invest in other industries inflation the nation s inflation rate is running at an eye watering annual rate of 373 000 percent according to a bloomberg index that tracks the price of a cup of coffee in caracas soaring prices are producing hunger leading thousands to flee venezuela every day with 3 million already living abroad hyperinflation in venezuela how did we get here annual inflation averaged 23 percent under chavez but the 2014 crash in oil prices made things much worse unlike many petrostates venezuela hadn t used the go go years to create foreign reserves or a sovereign wealth fund to fall back on rather than increase taxes or cut spending the maduro government has financed itself by cranking up the central bank printing presses that has ballooned the supply of the national currency the bolivar which has lost more than 99 percent of its value since 2013 and is virtually worthless and it s ignited ever accelerating inflation the government has imposed price controls but the rules have discouraged local production venezuelans are forced to turn to a burgeoning black market for basic consumer goods food and medicine at many times the government set prices bolivar s plunge venezuela s currency has tumbled in recent years and is virtually worthless what can be done among the top priorities is reducing the budget deficit no plan will get inflation under control unless this is accomplished because the government stopped providing statistics several years ago no one knows the true size of the deficit estimates range but the cia put it at 46 percent of gross domestic product in 2017 venezuelan economist ricardo hausmann of harvard university an informal adviser to guaido has proposed that the imf loan venezuela more than 60 billion over three years a loan of that magnitude would allow the central bank to stop printing bolivars to restore incentives for saving and investment one approach would be to replace the

new york the world economy risks remaining weak for a while longer on friday alone reports showed the slowest us hiring in more than a year a slump in chinese exports and an unexpected decline in german factory orders with economies already undershooting expectations by the most since 2013 and the oecd slashing its forecasts worries are mounting that the recent slowdown will last for longer although recession fears for now remain limited the soft patch puts the u s and china under pressure to settle their trade war which has bludgeoned sentiment and leaves central banks needing to keep monetary policy looser than they were planning into this year chairman jerome powell said late friday that the federal reserve could be patient after pausing its interest rate hikes such forces may still prove enough to drive a pickup and next week witnesses further health checks ranging from retail sales data in the u s to industrial statistics from china and the euro region the trends in the global economy have certainly concerned markets said philip shaw chief economist at investec in london it s material enough to make a difference to the policy outlook the week ended with news that u s payrolls grew just 20 000 in february way below the 180 000 median forecast in a bloomberg survey of economists deutsche bank is already warning the u s economy could grow less than 1 percent this quarter and the bout of labor market weakness will sew worries about the spending power of consumers on monday in washington the government will release retail sales data for january after december witnessed the worst slump in nine years elsewhere exports from china tumbled almost 21 percent in february the most in three years while german factory orders unexpectedly dropped 2 6 percent in january the most since june that was just one day manufacturing purchasing manager indexes are in contraction territory in china japan and the euro area where there s mounting concern that the bloc s economy and markets risk repeating japan s lost decades of growth there are caveats u s wage gains were the fastest of the expansion in february and jpmorgan chase co predicts salaries in rich nations will start advancing by more than 3 percent this year financial conditions have also turned more relaxed after tightening into the end of last year with the msci world index of stocks up almost 9 percent in 2019 there s a case that as we move through this that growth will pick up in the second half of the year said david hensley director of global economics at jpmorgan in new york there are supports to keep things from getting too weak much will depend on whether presidents donald trump and xi jinping can resolve their trade dispute clearing a fog of uncertainty that s stopping businesses from investing and hiring if the u k can avoid tumbling out of the european union without a divorce deal that would also help trump postponed an increase in tariffs that had been scheduled to be imposed on china this month but no date has been set for the two leaders to meet and much remains unsettled confidence that differences will narrow is one reason morgan stanley economists say this quarter will mark the trough of the global slowdown another case for optimism that the worst may soon be over is that some governments and central banks are starting to dole out aid the problem there is that they will then have less firepower to deploy if growth really falters china s government this week announced a cut to its value added tax of as much as 800 billion yuan 119 billion as it lowered its goal for growth to a range of 6 percent to 6 5 percent for 2019 that s down from about 6 5 percent last year and the european central bank became the first of the major central banks to unveil more stimulus in the form of new cheap loans for banks which came alongside a commitment not to raise interest rates until 2020 in the u s powell said late friday that he and his colleagues are in no hurry to adjust rates as economic growth slows and inflation stays muted we have seen some cross currents in recent months he said with nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures the committee has adopted a patient wait and see approach

published monday 11 march 2019 print disqus social security is not enough is that all there is the indexing problem in retirement accounts double problem cleveland eye surgery new york and more cleveland i have long said i don t want to retire i enjoy my work it s not too physical other than the travel which is finally beginning to wear on me also my savings are not yet sufficient to sustain the retirement lifestyle shane and i want i could retire now but would rather wait fortunately i have the choice of continuing to work and adding to those savings i realize many americans don t have that luxury some have to retire because of illness or because their work requires more physical ability than their age allows many others don t retire because they just can t afford to tv commercials suggest a financial advisor is key to a leisurely retirement a good one certainly can help but only to the extent you ve saved enough cash to give them something to invest and as we ll see many americans haven t my readers tend to be conscious of these things you probably have above average income and savings maybe your retirement plan is on track but that doesn t mean you can rest easy we all exist within a society and an economy its problems are ours too as we may find out when taxes rise to help pay for others to retire today we ll look at the state of retirement in america updating some data i shared a couple of years ago then we will look at some strategies to keep your plan realistic and on track social security is not enough how much money will you need to retire and how much will you have answering those questions is one reason a good financial advisor is worth every penny you pay them but let s talk about some generalities say you want to stop working at 65 you re in good health and your family tends toward long lives you expect to reach 90 having been retired for 25 years will social security alone be enough if you spent most of your life paying as much as legally possible into the system and you retire in 2019 at age 65 your monthly benefit will be 2 757 which is then indexed for inflation at least under current law it jumps to 3 770 if you delay retirement until age 70 since i am not yet 70 for another eight months i really haven t paid much attention to what i will get when i start my social security i assumed like the charts that i ve seen below that it would be a couple of thousand a month i was surprised to learn i may get significantly more considering how much i ve contributed over 50 working years it s probably not that great a return yet most people get less here s the distribution a solid majority of social security recipients receive 2 000 a month or less and many less than 1 000 the average benefit is 1 413 according to social security s latest fact sheet if that s all you have your retirement lifestyle is not going to include many cruises and golf tournaments of course it shouldn t be all you have social security was never supposed to be a complete multi decade retirement plan it was designed to keep retired workers out of poverty at a time when lower life expectancies kept retirement much shorter for most if they lived to 65 at all now we live longer and we have higher expectations which political leaders have done little to dampen often they ve done the opposite bottom line social security probably won t give you much security you need more is that all there is ideally people should avoid relying on social security and accumulate other savings as well many perhaps most do not the reasons vary i suppose some just spend their money unwisely and neglect to save anything but income data says many americans can t afford to both live a typical middle class lifestyle andsave enough to finance a 20 year retirement here s a doug short chart to illustrate source advisor perspectives in constant dollars and adjusting for hours worked average weekly earnings for non managers are now 779 and that s an almost 40 year high millions of those now approaching retirement age spent their entire lives earning the equivalent of 40 000 a year at most little surprise they don t have six figure retirement savings the simple fact of the matter is it takes enormous discipline to save even 6 for your 401 k at that income level in a country of 330 million people shockingly few have enough retirement savings to support the stereotypical leisurely golden years dennis gartman shared some disturbing numbers last week firstly we note that there were 133 800 millionaires late last year with sums of more than 1 million in their retirement accounts which on its face sounds like a large number but that is down from 187 400 at the end of third quarter of last year according to fidelity investments according to the federal retirement thrift investment board which oversees tsps as of the end of last year there were 21 432 millionaires compared to 34 128 at the end of september in those tsp accounts the 4th quarter of last year was a disaster to those solely involved with equity investments it was merely horrible for those with a more balanced investment portfolio but these are not really our focus this morning our focus is that the average balance in 401 k s 403 b s or iras fell to 95 600 at the end of last year from 104 300 at the end of the 3rd quarter for 401 k s to 78 700 from 85 100 for 403 b s and to 98 400 from 106 300 for ira balances it was not the drops in value that caught our attention it is the fact that the averages are only at or near 100 000 forcing us to wonder what sort of retirement can the average retiree look forward to with this minimal sum of money set aside is that all there is really is that really all there is if so we are in very real trouble the average ira balance is not necessarily indicative of retirement savings generally as many other vehicles exist but it s probably a good proxy and an average of around 100 000 won t yield much of a supplement to the monthly social security benefits described above i found this chart on cnbc which also refers to the study dennis quoted many of our parents and grandparents had defined benefit plans and other guaranteed retirement benefits from the corporations they worked for those are increasingly an endangered species in the private sector while 401 k s iras and social security aren t giving the average person enough to retire on anything close to a comfortable lifestyle average household savings for the bottom 40 are under 30 000 median household savings for the bottom 40 are zero dollars clearly the top percentiles and especially the top 1 skew the average note the bottom lines in the chart below is not the top 20 but the top 1 and the top 1 10 of 1 don t make me giggle source cnbc com the point is that the 80 of households have less than 100 000 in savings that is not enough for even a minimal retirement let s make the very aggressive assumption that you can take 5 a year from your savings plan if you have 100 000 that s 5 000 yearly or about 417 a month on top of your social security and if you don t have your house paid off or car the indexing problem in retirement accounts nearly every article i read on this topic talks about the fourth quarter s losses but something else leapt out at me back of the napkin math and a rough napkin at that says these retirement accounts are at least 50 invested in equity index funds some of you are now asking what s the problem all those index funds have come back everybody is back to where they started not so fast jack as i have said until readers are probably tired of it bear markets which the last little bump in december barely qualifies for that are not accompanied by a recession have v shaped recoveries which is exactly what we got bear markets that are accompanied by recession take a very long time to recover and will likely be in the 40 to 50 loss range a 50 loss requires a 100 gain to breakeven that took about five years from the bottom of the last bear market now let s look at the chart from the s p 500 for the last 10 years courtesy of macrotrends note that the s p is up well over 3 5x give or take in the last 10 years but the 401 k s and iras did not even double some of that is due to investors getting out at the bottom and back in later some is maybe due to high bond allocations in 2009 bond funds had done very well and we know people chase returns but nonetheless retirement funds have not performed as well as you might expect source macrotrends further when that next recession and bear market hit it will take even longer to bounce back the recovery will be even slower than this last one as the research i ve shared in previous letters shows large amounts of debt slows recoveries very large amounts create flat economies we are approaching large amounts in the us think what that large debt and recession did to japan what s that song turning japanese by the vapors the official 1980 video is not politically correct by 2019 standards but has some interesting historical tidbits along with the wwii propaganda silliness in any event the next recession will shortly cause a 30 trillion debt for the us government soon to be followed by 40 trillion will that much debt turn us japanese that s not entirely clear since we have the world s reserve currency and a unique role in global commerce and finance but i think the recovery will be much slower at a minimum a double dip recession is clearly possible making those stock market index fund losses even worse you must have some kind of strategy for dealing with market volatility i don t know how many times i can say that but that s the case only if you have savings to lose millions don t which means they have an even harder challenge double problem i speak at a variety of investment events every year some are for high net worth investors but others draw a broader crowd lack of retirement savings both their own accounts and those of their neighbors and the rest of the country is by far the most common worry i hear at those events sometimes it verges on panic even among people who spent decades earning good incomes and saving all they could the baby boom generation that is now reaching retirement age has a double problem first many of its members didn t save enough cash to support a comfortable retirement second those many who did save enough could see it evaporate when we get into another bear market which we certainly will at some point what can you do some suggestions first whatever your age save as much as you can stash it in your ira 401k defined benefit plan or whatever other tax advantaged vehicles are available to you then save more outside them if you look at your income and expenses and think i just can t do this think again start saving something even if it s 20 or 50 a month get in the habit and it will become easier a personal note if you have a small business you should at a minimum have 401 k s and business employment retirement plans if you re making a relatively good income you should think about getting your own defined benefit plan db plans are not just for monster corporations they can work extremely well for small very closely held businesses you can put away over 2 million of total contribution over your lifetime if you start your plan and your age is 60 those can be some hefty annual contributions just another reason a good financial advisor can be useful second invest in programs that give you at least a chance to dodge bear markets buy and hold works in theory but not for most people because we are humans with emotions we should recognize that and take steps to control it as i continually say we should invest in trading strategies and not buy and hold index funds in this environment and of course fixed income strategies like actual bonds real estate private credit and so on third forget about retiring at 65 unless you are in truly dismal health in which case financing a long retirement is probably not your top worry keep working a few more years even if you have to find a new career that better fits your circumstances this will let your capital accumulate longer and you ll get a higher social security benefit by waiting until 70 to start collecting fourth take care of your health it will both reduce your medical expenses and keep you in shape so you can work and produce income longer further staying physically active will keep you healthier if that physical activity is involved in a job that counts there are studies that actually associate retirement with lower life and health spans but gym time and a healthy diet are still important i m personally doing all of the above and i m still concerned it won t be enough laugh if you want to but that concern for me is real relaxing is not in my personal makeup i know a lot of people like me i can only imagine the panic of those less fortunate and prepared their problems are yours and mine too because an economy with so many low income elderly people has less opportunity for everyone while i think socialist and progressive policies are terrifying they are spot on when talking about wage and income disparity corporate profits are at their highest level ever percentage wise yet labor is back to great depression levels that is not healthy for our society i am not going to start singing 1930s union songs but this is a problem we must address it is only going to get worse and the longer we wait the more expensive the solution is going to be those of us with a libertarian bent may just have to suck it up and become part of the solution cleveland eye surgery new york and more cleveland shane and i fly to cleveland on monday i will speak to the cfa society for lunch and then rush to the cleveland clinic for a bunch of exams prior to having cataract surgery on my left eye on wednesday friday we fly to new york where mortgage guru barry habib is taking us to an afternoon broadway show and then dinner shane and i will have brunch on sunday with suze orman and k t both meetings are big personal thrills for both of us then some business meetings monday morning and back to cleveland to do my right eye the next week i am told that cataract surgery is not that big a deal for the vast majority of people and i am going to cleveland simply because of the quality of the surgeon dr edward rockwood i expect the procedures to go well and to be able to write a letter next week but of course things don t always work according to plan if you get no letter from me next week it will be because the recovery is taking a little longer i finish this letter at home in puerto rico for whatever reason the electricity went off here and the generator didn t immediately kick on it turned out to be out of diesel fuel problem quickly fixed candidly i didn t pay as much attention to the generator process as i should have i am glad the power went out on a beautiful day rather than in a hurricane i am being trained tomorrow to deal with it where i will pay very close attention and then will set up regular maintenance just one of the pleasures of living in paradise well that and an extra two hours of flight time to get anywhere as opposed to being in dallas but it is worth it shane and i are extremely happy to be living where we are and now after a fabulous sushi dinner with friends we are back at the house and the electricity is on have a great week i am looking forward to having at least one eye

reuters china s central bank on sunday pledged to further support the slowing economy by spurring loans and lowering borrowing costs following data that showed a sharp drop in february s bank lending due to seasonal factors the central bank is widely expected to ease monetary policy further this year to encourage lending especially to small and private firms vital for growth and job creation advertisement advertisement the central bank s prudent monetary policy will emphasise on counter cyclical adjustments said people s bank of china pboc governor yi gang using a phrase that implies the need to fight an economic slowdown the global economy still faces some downward pressure and china faces many risks and challenges in its economy and financial sector yi said at a press conference on the sidelines of the country s annual meeting of parliament there is still some room for the pboc to cut reserve requirement ratios rrrs although the amount of room is less compared with a few years ago yi said the pboc has cut the amount of cash that commercial banks need to set aside as reserves five times in the past year to spur lending to small businesses in the private sector the rrr for big banks is now at 13 5 percent and the ratio for small to medium size banks is at 11 5 percent advertisement advertisement yi said lending rates for small firms are still relatively elevated due to higher risk premiums and the central bank will forge ahead with reforms to lower such risk premiums high risk premiums on loans to small firms reflect commercial banks traditional reluctance to extend credit to the sector because of concerns about their creditworthiness story continues pboc data on sunday showed new bank loans in china fell sharply in february from a record the previous month but the drop was likely due to seasonal factors while policymakers continue to press lenders to help cash strapped firms stay afloat a pull back in february s tally had been widely expected as chinese banks tend to front load loans at the beginning of the year to get higher quality customers and win market share chinese banks made 885 8 billion yuan 131 81 billion in net new yuan loans in february down sharply from a record 3 23 trillion yuan in january when several other key credit gauges also picked up modestly in response to the central bank s policy easing yi said combined january february

from a year earlier respectively advertisement advertisement debt defaults analysts say china needs to revive weak credit growth to help head off a sharper economic slowdown this year but investors are worried about a further jump in corporate debt and the risk to banks as they relax their lending standards corporate bond defaults hit a record last year while banks non performing loan ratio notched a 10 year high pan gongsheng a vice governor at the pboc told the same briefing that china will control the amount of bond defaults in 2019 using both legal and market means pan conceded that bond defaults increased last year but the level of defaults was not high compared with china s average bad loan ratio advertisement advertisement premier li keqiang told parliament on tuesday that monetary policy would be neither too tight nor too loose li also pledged to push for market based reforms to lower real interest rates chinese policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns sources have told reuters the central bank is not ready to cut benchmark interest rates just yet but is likely to cut market based rates yi said the downward trend in tsf has been initially curbed and broad m2 money supply growth will be more or less in line with nominal gross domestic product growth in 2019 yi added advertisement advertisement central bank data showed growth of outstanding tsf a rough gauge of broad credit conditions slowed to 10 1 percent in february from january s 10 4 percent versus a record low of 9 8 percent in december m2 money supply grew 8 0 percent in february from a year earlier missing forecasts the central bank data showed yi said china s macro leverage ratio or the amount of debt relative to gdp was at 249 4 percent at the end of 2018 a fall of 1 5 percentage points from a year earlier yi said

real solutions boosting the center left s case for free trade as dartmouth college economist douglas irwin masterfully documents in his most recent book clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy trade politics have been contentious since the country s founding the clash generally has been between those who seek greater market access abroad and domestic industries that yearn for protection from foreign competition despite the challenging domestic politics u s policymakers largely have gotten the policy right since the disastrous smoot hawley tariffs of the early 1930s until recently that is the basic backstory is this since world war ii in particular the united states used its status as a global superpower to establish institutions write rules and negotiate treaties to facilitate the free flow of goods and services while minimizing potential for the spread of protectionism the goal was to serve economic and geopolitical interests trade liberalization hasn t been perfect but it has been reasonably successful in promoting those twin aims and it earned support from leaders in both major political parties to be sure there were fringes on both the left and the right that opposed this consensus in favor of trade liberalization but every president since franklin roosevelt republican and democratic has been broadly supportive in many ways the 2016 presidential campaign marked a turning point in the long arc of bipartisan support for u s trade leadership as both major parties presidential nominees rejected prevailing policy orthodoxy using misleading inflammatory nationalist and racially tinged rhetoric donald trump promised to tear up trade agreements and destroy valuable institutions like the world trade organization he argued the united states was continually taken advantage of by trading partners and that if elected he would restore a bygone era with shuttered factories reopening as corporations begin reshoring supply chains meanwhile the rhetoric and policy proposals on trade in the democratic primary were nearly as bad longtime trade critic sen bernie sanders d vt harangued trade liberalization as a vast conspiracy of elites aiming to enrich themselves at the expense of the working class sensing vulnerability on her left flank former secretary of state hillary clinton once a champion of the trans pacific partnership tpp a promising trade pact between pacific rim nations reversed course she publicly opposed tpp and criticized the prevailing trade consensus after a bruising primary clinton would eventually capture the democratic nomination for president trump narrowly defeated secretary clinton to capture the presidency and quickly embarked on the most ambitious protectionist agenda since herbert hoover within days of his inauguration president trump withdrew the united states from the tpp in 2018 the president hit close allies with steel and aluminum tariffs citing dubious national security grounds and ignited a tariff tit for tat with china ostensibly designed to confront beijing over its mistreatment of american intellectual property though the tariffs have imposed unnecessary costs on the economy and ensnared unrelated industries into trade conflicts it has not yet spiraled out of control to date the president has not attempted to withdraw the united states from the wto but his administration continues to undermine the geneva based organization by crippling its adjudicatory function it remains to be seen whether congress will support president trump s rewrite of the north american free trade agreement nafta with our canadian and mexican allies if it does not many predict the president will try to terminate nafta for supporters of trade liberalization on the center right and center left it is a bleak time many are trying grapple with what went wrong and how to jumpstart the vital task of rebuilding support for trade against this backdrop comes kimberly clausing s excellent new book open the progressive case for free trade immigration and global capital as the name implies open is an unapologetic center left defense of globalization clausing a reed college economics professor translates complicated trade policy nuances concisely she slays some common misconceptions that animate much of the anti trade rhetoric on the left and the right she ably explains that the primary drivers of manufacturing job losses in the united states are technology and productivity gains not imports likewise clausing explains why trade deficits are not the result of trade policy and why the fixation on them is a distraction she also does a nice job explaining why import restrictions will not help struggling workers these are all important points for trade skeptics on the left to understand the book is not perfect toward the end clausing lays out policy solutions for how to reinvigorate the middle class and create a more equitable globalization though she touches on the need for international cooperation to address climate change clausing missed the opportunity to explain how trade liberalization itself can help address climate change during the obama administration the united states and a subset of wto members were negotiating the environmental goods agreement that would have cut tariffs and non tariff barriers on clean energy products the trump administration has unwisely put the talks on hold likewise i am unpersuaded by clausing s call for more stringent antitrust enforcement these however are minor quibbles with an otherwise extremely valuable contribution with democratic hopefuls beginning to announce their 2020 presidential candidacies clausing s book arrives at a pivotal time it is a fool s errand for democratic presidential hopefuls to run on a more protectionist platform than trump s for disaffected centrists and conservatives who understand the value of international trade a pro trade platform from democratic contenders would be a welcome addition to the race if the united states is going to regain its status as the world s leading defender of globalization it will take another bipartisan consensus for this urgent task the center left should start with open

editor of hazlitt in the wake of actor luke perry s death this week along with the many nostalgic tributes to his sideburns and his simpsons cameo there was some confusion on where the former nineties heartthrob was supposed to have stood on participating in the beverly hills 90210 reunion scheduled to shoot this year according to several news outlets mr perry had insisted he had no interest in revising his role as the show s sensitive bad boy dylan mckay but in a public appearance last october in support of the show riverdale on which he had revived his career by playing archie s dad he said he would love to do it the premise of the 90210 reunion purportedly comes with a twist catching up not with the show s characters all these years later but quasi fictionalized versions of its real life actors as they try to get a reboot of the show off the ground which doesn t seem like a particularly original move these days such deliberate blurring of fact and fiction being a signature feature of both popular culture and our politics but it might also possibly open the door to a more nuanced and self aware look back at the culture of a decade the nineties which the show helped to define it s a decade we have a hard time remembering right we live in a moment already oozing with nineties nostalgia this weekend s release of the new captain marvel superhero movie set in 1995 and

thankfully rolling stone magazine was still around to explain it all in the article why 2018 was a year of nineties obsessions that obsession is likely to reach another pinnacle next month when the 25th anniversary of kurt cobain s suicide will be marked no matter how well or harshly you judge the decade s music films fads or fashions this recycling is largely to be expected given nostalgia s tendency to follow something like a 20 year cycle though it also feels increasingly like we re living through the decade s revenge the nineties put through a black mirror random story generator pundits may wax on about how unprecedented our current political times might seem but they re not without their moments of woozy déjà vu signal events and moments of the nineties recast and remade the recent u s government shutdown over funding for donald trump s theoretical border wall backfired just as badly on the president as it did when newt gingrich then the republican house speaker first pioneered the tactic in the mid nineties in his budget battle with president bill clinton prior to that in late september there was christine blasey ford s testimony before the u s senate judiciary hearings on brett kavanaugh s confirmation to the supreme court alleging a sexual assault by the nominee when they were both teenagers and how it recalled anita hill s 1991 appearance before the same committee then weighing the nomination of clarence thomas despite landing in the middle of the metoo moment the result was the same with ms ford s testimony discounted and mr kavanaugh winning confirmation as the journalist danielle tcholakian put it those who lived through both hill and blasey ford s testimonies would be forgiven for feeling that time is a flat circle one leading back to the nineties open this photo in gallery oct 11 1991 law professor anita hill testifies before the senate judiciary committee about allegations of abuse against clarence thomas then a nominee for the supreme court anonymous the associated press so much of that decade s politics decisions made issues unaddressed haunt our current times more than any other from societal issues of race and gender to the global economics of trade from the radical transformations of the internet to the corrosive effects of growing political polarization so many of the destabilizing forces that mark this current period in the united states and much of the west were either incubated unleashed or amplified during that time the list could go on whether it s our inability to address climate change as the urgent threat it is or the west s troubled relationship with post soviet russia north korea s attention getting over its missile and nuclear programs is an ongoing saga almost as old as the simpsons and nearly as ridiculous for going on for so long having begun in 1994 when mr clinton secretly considered launching a pre emptive strike on the yongbyun reactor all that was missing from the latest trump kim summit in vietnam was some bunting announcing the 25th anniversary of this show the ultimate revenge of the nineties is probably that the man now occupying the highest office of the united states was through much of that decade its most notoriously failed businessman bankrupt and abandoned by his lenders his name reduced to a punch line on late night talk shows and yet north americans tend to take a rather rosy view of the nineties with some pronouncing them as the last great decade that was the title of a three part documentary tv series that aired on the national geographic channel in 2014 the following year a new york times commentary written by kurt andersen an alumnus of spy magazine another fixture of the nineties zeitgeist wore the headline the best decade ever the 1990s obviously mr andersen went so far as to suggest that the decade provoke a unique species of recherche du temps perdu that puts it apart from the usual cycles of nostalgia ooking back at the final 10 years of the 20th century he wrote is grounds for genuine mourning it was simply the happiest decade of our lifetimes mr andersen seems to make a compelling argument on the nineties behalf for much of the decade annual economic growth in the united states averaged around 4 per cent a number it s only since come close to matching now unemployment he wrote shrank to new lows median household incomes grew by 10 per cent and stocks quadrupled in value here in canada the decade got off to a rougher start economically with the country going even more deeply into recession than the united states in 1990 91 and then mid decade enduring a period of severe restructuring that saw dramatic cuts to social spending thanks to ballooning federal and provincial budget deficits by the last years of the decade however canada s economy was in a similarly healthy position in time to enjoy such other fruits of the nineties as viagra and the internet with all its democratizing utopian promise it was the decade too when we first became tethered to our mobile devices with market penetration of cellphones nearing 40 per cent by 2000 and the way we consume culture and interact with politics began to evolve to the point we re at now after decades of staying more or less the same mr andersen neglects to acknowledge how income inequality would spike during the decade or that some combination of technological change and newly signed trade agreements would contribute to the hollowing out of the north american manufacturing base that working people depended upon near the end of his essay he allows that the decade was not without its problems noting the failure to heed the growing danger presented by climate change and how passage of the financial services modernization act of 1999 with bipartisan majorities in both houses of the u s congress and the support of president clinton would help pave the way for the financial crash of 2008 of these problems however mr andersen blithely remarks but they weren t obvious so we were blissfully ignorant which is entirely the point in the introduction to his 2008 essay collection reappraisals reflections on the forgotten twentieth century the historian tony judt argued that in time we would come to regard the period between the fall of communism 1989 1991 and the u s invasion of iraq in 2003 as the years the locusts ate a decade and a half of wasted opportunity and political incompetence on both sides of the atlantic quite suddenly mr judt argued we fell under the notion that history could have little to teach us except in the most narrow triumphalist sense with too much confidence and too little reflection we put the 20th century behind us and strode boldly into its successor swaddled in self serving half truths the triumph of the west the end of history the unipolar american moment the ineluctable march of globalization and the free market it s never very hard to find things to mock about what we once believed or enjoyed even in the not so distant past what s uniquely striking about the nineties is just how deep our delusions went how preposterously confident we were in our suppositions jettisoning much of the history that the 20th century had taught us rather the eternal rightness of market economics the nation state s declining relevance the end of battles over ideology and the unipolar american moment all were accepted as faits accomplis by much of the political and media class as though it were the new permanent state of things instead two decades later the liberal democratic ideal appears more fragile and fractured than most of us imagined even billionaires are questioning the viability of market capitalism and much of the 20th century s baggage is washing back ashore since mr judt s death in 2010 his appraisal of the nineties only appears ruinously more so everything that seemed possibly bright and good about the decade may have just been a mirage open this photo in gallery the nineties in film

in the west owe much to the impression that its epochal political changes and drastic redrawing of maps occurred with so relatively little bloodshed few could have predicted that the fall of the soviet union and its client regimes in the eastern bloc would be so anti climactic coming not after some decisive military confrontation but instead imploding out of internal malaise few expected germany s reunification to happen as swiftly as it did nor could many have foreseen the non violent end of apartheid in south africa or a democratically elected nelson mandela as its president the notion that the decade represents some interregnum of relative tranquility however sandwiched between the last gasp of cold war proxy conflicts and the conflagrations yet to come in afghanistan iraq and sudan not to mention the most endless and ill defined of all wars the one against terrorism would be false the nineties in fact were plenty bloody while some of the decade s conflicts captured the west s attention such as the civil wars in rwanda and the balkans and russia s brutal anti insurgency campaign in chechnya millions more would die in the nineties than in the decade following 9 11 though largely in africa and therefore off stage from the west s direct concern with fewer wars to fight abroad in the nineties and its superpower status seemingly uncontested america s atavistic energies and antagonisms turned inward if there was a war to follow it was the one playing out in washington between mr clinton and republican house speaker newt gingrich who with his populist tinged contract with america led the gop in 1994 to seize control of the house for the first time in 40 years mr clinton ultimately got the better of that rivalry but in retrospect it was mr gingrich who had the more lasting impact on the tenor and style of u s politics open this photo in gallery june 11 1995 house speaker newt gingrich and president bill clinton share a laugh at a q a session in claremont n h jim bourg reuters since arriving in congress in 1978 representing a suburban district in georgia mr gingrich had made it his mission to rebrand the gop in his own more militant image with an uncompromising approach to politics as total war calling himself the most serious systematic revolutionary in modern times he challenged his party s leadership for its civility and acquiescence toward democrats and in the cover letter to a memo from 1990 entitled language a key mechanism of control he endorsed a call for his republican colleagues to brand their democrat rivals as traitors pathetic corrupt radical and of course socialist while his tactics and rhetoric often annoyed his senior gop colleagues with his disrespect for decorum and collegiality they couldn t argue with the fact he was getting results by the time of the 1994 midterms and two faltering years of the clinton presidency the republican party was all in with newt what followed wasn t pretty the clinton gingrich battles defined by rancorous squabbling partisan brinksmanship and the floating of conspiracy theories of course mr gingrich had an elevated sense of his motivations once saying people like me are what stand between us and auschwitz i see evil around me every day according to a recent study tracking trends in the partisanship of u s political speech going as far back as 1873 the republican takeover by congress led by newt gingrich was the country s inflection point toward the entrenched partisanship and polarization we see in america today calling the 1994 midterms a watershed moment in political marketing it cites two contributing factors the influence of consultants like the republican pollster frank luntz who helped mr gingrich craft the most hot button language that would resonate with voters and changes in the media landscape that intensified the ambience of hyper partisanship the decision by the federal communications commission in 1987 to stop enforcing the fairness doctrine which required the holders of u s broadcast licences to cover issues of public interest in a manner that was honest equitable and balanced had unleashed a boom in conservative talk radio by 1991 rush limbaugh was already the most syndicated radio host in the united states and mr clinton s rise to the presidency provided the format with the perfect fodder to boost it to new heights the founding of fox news channel in 1996 only added to the feedback loop of hotheaded fulminating then the internet it was the drudge report website that in january 1998 first published an item saying that newsweek was suppressing a story by one of its reporters about the president s relationship with a white house intern and lo the right wing blogosphere was born open this

uncannily still the brutal videotaped beating of african american motorist rodney king at the hands of four white los angeles police officers and the riots that ensued following the officers acquittal in april 1992 set off national dialogue about the unequal and often violent treatment of minority groups by u s law enforcement time machine ahead to the riots 25th anniversary in 2017 and the country would find itself in the midst of another reckoning over the police killings of african americans further out on the fringes the new polarization would explode into violence at an even more frightening scale with the april 1995 bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city okla by timothy mcveigh a gulf war vet turned anti government extremist mr mcveigh had connections to the then emerging patriot movement a mostly informal collection of right wing militias hard core survivalists and white identitarians that would serve among the forerunners of today s alt right in the wake of the oklahoma city bombing u s law enforcement upped its tracking and infiltration of right wing extremist groups that is until 9 11 came along and the entire national security apparatus became exclusively focused on the threat of foreign sourced jihadi terrorism as a new york times investigation revealed last fall by the time of the alt right rally in charlottesville va at which one counterprotester was killed there was a dearth of useful intelligence on the movement it s illustrative of just how narrowly the al qaeda attack on sept 11 2001 and the subsequent wars in afghanistan and iraq would come to consume america s attention to the detriment of growing systemic fissures until with first the 2008 economic crisis and then the recent populist backlash those

shrill or severe though it s also possibly just delayed the patterns since the 1990s have not been dissimilar just as mr gingrich s ascent to the republican leadership signalled a more rightward socially conservative and populist shift in u s politics so did the splintering here of the federal progressive conservatives into the reform party which stood candidates nationally for the first time in 1993 while stephen harper s time as prime minister effectively purged any remnants of red toryism from the conservative movement at least canadians can attribute some of the change in tone and civility to a shared cultural space and media spillover across the border how did polarization also come to afflict so many countries across europe as well as democracies as far apart as the philippines and brazil mostly paving the way for right leaning autocrats and parties to win or consolidate power the strain of reactionary populism we see from mr trump brazil s jair bolsonaro viktor orbán in hungary and poland s law and justice party would seem to thrive in today s volatile environment of diminished social cohesion and rising economic uncertainty shouting simple answers to complex problems memories of the 2008 financial crisis and the perception that elites despite causing the crash ultimately prospered from it while the rest of us struggled through austerity or at best a sluggish recovery provide today s populists with ample grievances to exploit which many adulterate with a host of other resentments whether over immigration cultural identity or the pace of technological and demographic change and here again the nineties are instructive both in cause and effect the neoliberal economic policies toward increased trade financial deregulation and cuts to social spending first adopted by conservative governments in the united states and britain in the eighties would in the nineties through institutions like the world trade organization and world bank establish much of the framework for post cold war globalization open this photo in gallery conservative commentator pat buchanan shown in 1992 dennis cook the associated press in the united states the dislocations wrought by the decline of the industrial base and growing income disparities would gradually give opposition to globalization and an ambient suspicion of international entanglements military and otherwise fertile ground for expansion on the right pat buchanan a former adviser to presidents richard nixon and ronald reagan and one of the original cable tv pundits anticipated this shift with his insurgent candidacies for the gop presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996 creating a space on the conservative right for a more militant candidate on immigration abortion and other social issues but one who also against republican orthodoxy opposed trade deals like nafta and globalization generally which he blamed for stealing american jobs mr buchanan might be considered the spiritual godfather of today s trumpists brexiteers and anti globalists but he and his heirs were helped along by the so called triangulations of mr clinton and tony blair who largely abandoned their parties traditional support of labour and implemented policies that embraced the neoliberal trend rather than challenging or redressing it fast forward to 2016 and the trump campaign s last television ad before election day in which the candidate accused a global power structure of having robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities it s the kind of thing you might have heard the anti globalization protesters predicting at the 1999 wto meetings in seattle the same year as those seattle protests mr trump briefly mooted a run against mr buchanan for the reform party nomination in the upcoming presidential election mr trump agreed with mr buchanan that trade deals were a rip off for american workers and that elites were to blame but he was appalled he said by the nativist tone of mr buchanan s rhetoric calling him a hitler lover and that white nationalists like former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke were flocking to the party mr trump bowed out in the end while mr buchanan would go on to take only 0 4 per cent of the popular vote in the presidential election fifteen years later under the influence of steve bannon you could have accused mr trump of plagiarism for how closely his winning campaign resembled mr buchanan s in 2000 so much so that david duke voted for

the media and political class at the time the anti globalization protesters in seattle would turn out to be right about many things principally their fears about job losses and downward pressure on workers incomes while capital able to circulate more freely across borders would enjoy increasingly higher returns exacerbating the trend toward greater income inequality the environmental contingent warned that wto policies would not only increase pollution and emissions in the developing world but pressure the west to lower standards as well which did not exactly happen at least not until mr trump took office and likewise doug ford in ontario to be fair the protesters did not foresee how trade would lift millions out of poverty outside the west including in china which as a result of decisions made in seattle would be granted accession to the wto in 2001 putting it on the path to becoming the world s largest economy but if you were to hand out score cards the protesters instincts proved more accurate than much of our political and media class who assured us that the world would become a less volatile more peaceable place as economic integration replaced rivalries both ancient and modern with mutual self interest and countries worked multilaterally toward addressing chronic problems of poverty and insecurity a fanciful thought in retrospect we still have a form of globalization just not the one then imagined with the west in a position to preach policy to the rest rather we have something more fragmentary multipolar and episodic based not on universal principles or high minded values but mutually reinforcing political or economic interests and shared antipathies the reunification of hong kong with the mainland in 1997 had many respected china watchers predicting that the openness and dynamism of the former british colony would eventually help loosen the reins in beijing a new york times columnist called hong kong a colossal trojan horse that could destabilize the regime and hong kong or not it was argued increased wealth and living standards among the chinese would anyway lead to more demands for democracy and personal freedom the argument s flip side was that a lack of liberalization and openness would put a ceiling on china s development and aspirations to global leadership it s only now under the autocratic control of xi

press ap lost decade one of the quainter predictions made in the nineties no doubt influenced by the post cold war mood when the west thought it had triumphed over authoritarianism was that the internet would inevitably lead to more political freedom around the world it would be all but impossible for a repressive regime to censor or surveil its people so the argument went when they could communicate and co ordinate peer to peer circumventing traditional or state controlled media for a good while that appeared to be the trend of things from the early online mobilizations of primarily left movements to the infant years of social media facebook b 2004 twitter b 2006 the internet and mobile technology empowering dissident and rights based groups giving them platforms on which to co ordinate actions and build global alliances autocratic leaders would be held more closely to account even possibly toppled such as the 2011 tahrir square protests that brought down egyptian dictator hosni mubarak instead as zeynep tufekci wrote last year in an article for the mit technology review digital technologies have gone from being hailed as tools of freedom and change to being blamed for upheavals in western democracies for enabling increased polarization rising authoritarianism and meddling in national elections by russia and others even if the internet strengthens the ability of social movements to organize and co ordinate it has likewise amplified the power of other actors governmental and not foreign or domestic to target opponents for abuse spread misinformation or stage distractions thereby weakening social trust to the point that everyone is too fractured and paralyzed to act or in the case of china and increasingly russia they are simply sealing off their internet from the rest of the world behind a firewall a draft bill currently under debate in the russian parliament would require all internet traffic move through servers physically based in the country and increase funding for the office responsible for monitoring it as for facebook and twitter who were not long ago celebrating their roles in facilitating the toppling of dictators seems they were meanwhile solidifying their technical chops for deeply surveilling their own users ms tufekci writes and then selling the data it s hardly the wired world imagined by john perry barlow in 1996 when he wrote a declaration of independence of cyberspace arguably the internet s foundational ideological document especially among the budding disruptors of silicon valley extolling his vision of a self regulating internet free from government intrusion or control while omitting conveniently it was largely built with government money mr barlow s manifesto was soon republished on some 40 000 websites what s most perplexing rereading the document today aside from being awash in premillennial techno utopian hokum is its exclusive focus on the threat of government rather than say private corporations such as the ones who would come to dominate the internet when it s the latter at least in the west which have proved an equal if not greater threat to citizens privacy and online security open this photo in gallery john perry barlow shown in 2002 authored a declaration of independence in cyberspace jack dempsey one could forgive mr barlow s omission and like kurt andersen say hey it was the nineties how should we have known except that the manifesto s profound influence on silicon valley s image of itself gave justification to tech platforms long standing resistance to regulation of any sort attempts at government intervention or oversight they argued would stifle innovation as though it was the worst of all secular sins only now after much damage done have governments in the west begun to contend with the myriad ways that the internet has distorted or imperilled our political discourse later in his introduction to reappraisals mr judt anticipated how the emerging architecture of globalization in the nineties technological disruptions and erosions to the welfare state in the west would give rise to today s wave of populist autocrats writing that its most avid proselytizers may be in for a surprise as populations in search of economic and political security turn back to the political symbols legal resources and physical barriers that only a territorial state can provide he foresaw too how fear is re emerging as an active ingredient of political life in western democracies and warned that the combustible politics of insecurity and polarization created the conditions for a turn to authoritarianism rather than the end of ideology as famously suggested by francis fukuyama s 1992 book the end of history and the last man the nineties were instead afflicted by an ideological tunnel vision a growing consensus in the west around a set of ideas about economic integration governance technological progress and the deregulation of finance that betrayed a rather blinkered or selective understanding of history as a historian what seemed to bother mr judt most was the idea that we live in a time without precedent that what is happening to us is new and irreversible and that the past has nothing to teach us but something always happens next history never trends only one way forever because just like the individuals who people it each historical moment comes freighted with its own blind spots delusions and internal contradictions to wit mr trump wins power by attacking elites then grants the wealthy the largest tax break in u s history if history is anything it s ironic sometimes happily but more often painfully with some new correction just around the corner which should give us some cause for optimism about the current moment while one must be clear eyed about the challenges we face indeed multilateral co operation would seem to be collapsing just when it s most needed especially on the climate change front we hardly need resign ourselves to the apocalypse the repudiation of trumpism in the u s midterm elections in november surely augurs that something is afoot but neither is it inevitable autocratic populists may yet gain more strength perhaps in some countries and not others though it s also possible they merely represent the noisy last gasp of a receding world view a final pushback against even larger gathering trends as for the nineties and what to make of them in the present ambience of nostalgia these days the expression lost decade is most often used to describe japan s experience of those years the onset of a prolonged period of stagnation just as some were predicting the country would soon eclipse the u s as the world s largest economy but the west would prove no less lost in both its delusions and opportunities missed
ludicrously expensive even if congress implement a green new deal lite the package would still add many trillions in government debt while making energy and transportation more expensive for american households and businesses the outrageous cost of the green new deal both fans and foes of the so called green new deal gnd agree that it is a wildly ambitious set of proposals which by design will

proposals which by design will involve the federal government spending boatloads of money in fact the gnd is so expensive that rep ocasio cortez has cited the inflationary doctrine of modern monetary theory mmt to deflect the issue we don t need to worry about the cost so the argument goes because the federal reserve can create an unlimited number of dollars even so more sober minded policymakers as well as the general public should be aware of just how ludicrously expensive the gnd really is a recent analysis by the american action forum puts the initial 10 year cost at a staggering 93 trillion although the reader might understandably assume that this is an inflated figure designed to discredit the gnd it actually rests on a few conservative assumptions the figure of 93 trillion is admittedly absurd but that s only because the planks of the gnd are absurdly expensive the american action forum estimate is entirely fair the major components of the green new deal the american action forum is headed by douglas holtz eakin who among other positions was the director of the congressional budget office cbo from 2003 to 2005 one can of course disagree with his team s analysis but their approach to budget scoring the gnd is entirely conventional in dc circles for their analysis the aaf team focused on six major planks of the gnd that they considered tractable for quantification the table below summarized the various cost estimates for each of the six items notice that there are many items listed in the gnd documentation that are not included in the table above this is one reason that i have called their cost estimate conservative another important point is that the absurd 93 trillion figure is not driven by one particular modeling choice on the contrary five of the six components studied by the team have a 10 year cost exceeding 1 trillion so even if it turns out that say the aaf team is totally wrong on the cost of universal health care and guaranteed green housing then the cost would still exceed 50 trillion for the first decade because of the other components source american action forum the american action forum is headed by douglas

stress some of the components of the green new deal are oddly redundant as the authors explain for example a costly retrofitting of every structure in the united states seems considerably less environmentally beneficial once the electricity grid is completely transformed to use 100 percent clean energy than it would be if undertaken with today s energy mix such a retrofit would have no impact on emissions similarly the gnd promises to ensure that every person has a guaranteed job a family sustaining rate of pay and benefits such as paid leave and paid vacations if everyone has good pay with good benefits why is it simultaneously necessary to provide targeted programs for food housing and health care some of these objectives appear to be redundant american action forum bold added in my view the particular observation i put in bold is especially poignant it shows just how shallow the thinking of the green new deal proponents really is what i think clearly happened here is this it is standard in the fight against climate change to agitate for energy efficient buildings which have for example well insulated windows to reduce heating and air conditioning expenses in the context of our current grid where most electricity comes from coal and natural gas this makes sense at the same time climate activists have been clamoring for subsidies mandates and taxes in order to force the grid to rely more heavily on wind and solar therefore since i claim the aaf analysis points out something that i haven t seen others stress some of the components of the green new deal are oddly redundant as the authors explain in my view the particular observation i put in bold is especially poignant it shows just how shallow the thinking of the green new deal proponents really is what

subsidies mandates and taxes in order to force the grid to rely more heavily on wind and solar therefore since i claim the green new deal is simply a wish list of standard progressive social goals rather than an actual blueprint for fighting the technical problem of alleged human caused harmful climate change it shouldn t surprise us that both of these long standing goals namely refitting buildings and pushing the grid to zero emissions are featured prominently in the green new deal yet as the aaf authors explain in the block quotation above this doesn t really make any sense if the electrical grid doesn t emit any greenhouse gases then there s no reason to retrofit every building in america you would think the proponents of the gnd would be overjoyed to hear this but i m guessing they won t drop their plans for trillions of dollars in construction work being shoveled to unions explaining the estimate of converting the grid in the remainder of this article i ll run through two of the calculations by which the aaf team arrived at their enormous estimates first consider the move to a zero emission grid this is the opening of their analysis of this component we estimate that to transition to a power sector that has net zero emissions of greenhouse gases in 10 years would require a capital investment of 5 4 trillion by 2029 in addition the annual operation maintenance and capital recovery costs would be 387 billion we consider this estimate to be conservative in two respects first we assume that a low carbon electricity grid is feasible with only 4 hours of storage available for renewable resources academic estimates have said a reliable grid requires 12 hours second we assume no new construction of transmission assets is required even though efficiently siting new renewable assets will require significant transmission infrastructure american action forum endnotes omitted in addition their analysis is also very conservative because they assume that states without nuclear moratoriums build approximately 50 percent of their needed capacity with nuclear power but as i explained in in the remainder of this article i ll run through two of the calculations by which the aaf team arrived at their enormous estimates first consider the move to a zero emission grid this is the opening of their analysis of this component in addition their analysis is also very conservative because they assume that states without nuclear moratoriums build approximately 50 percent of their needed capacity with nuclear power but as i explained in my earlier ier critique of the green new deal they have clarified that their plan does not involve an expansion of nuclear also although the aaf analysis gives an estimate that electric bills will rise by 22 percent in the scenario they study a glance at the original table shows that this cost to households in the form of higher electricity prices is not included in the headline estimates in other words when the quoted cost of 5 4 trillion is just capturing the out of pocket expenditure necessary to build the new plants to replace the capacity currently provided by coal and natural gas fired plants the figure does not include the opportunity cost to the economy as a whole from relying on less convenient forms of energy making energy more expensive for families and businesses costs a lot not just conventionally in the form of foregone opportunities but also in social discord owing to government mandated energy price increases the ongoing weekly riots in paris initiated by opposition to a modest carbon tax illustrate the phenomenon explaining the job guarantee cost estimate in this final section i ll explain the aaf estimate of the cost of the federal job guarantee here is the relevant table source american action forum here the calculations are pretty mechanical and this is why they re also very conservative as i will eventually explain the calculations assume that the federal government as part of the green new deal offers jobs paying at least 473 per week and 625 per week on average now then if we first ask how many people would normally be unemployed according to the standard u 6 measure and then we want to instead limit that unemployment rate to 1 5 we come up with the figure of 547 billion in the year 2019 specifically the aaf authors assume that the average outlay per job is 56 000 a figure derived from a in this final section i ll explain the aaf estimate of the cost of the federal job guarantee here is the relevant table here the calculations are

unemployment rate to 1 5 we come up with the figure of 547 billion in the year 2019 specifically the aaf authors assume that the average outlay per job is 56 000 a figure derived from a pro job guarantee study published by the center on budget and policy priorities then using the number of unemployed according to the u 6 measure which includes those who are part time for economic reasons in january 2019 they calculate that a little under 9 8 million americans would need to be given a federal job in order to reduce the u 6 unemployment rate down to 1 5 the cost thus works out to the 547 billion expenditure shown in the first row of the table the second calculation includes not just the officially unemployed and those who are working part time for economic reasons i e the u 6 measure but also includes the fact that the labor force participation rate lfpr would presumably increase if a federal job paying at least 473 per week were now on the table since more people would have come into the labor force it presumably would cost the government more money to maintain the official u 6 unemployment rate at 1 5 and hence the cost jumps to 598 billion in 2019 and so on in the next two lines the study includes the consideration that many people who are currently working full time might quit their current jobs and try to receive the federally guaranteed jobs which pay to reiterate at least 473 per week and pay 625 on average naturally if we assume that people with current jobs start switching over the cost explodes leading to the enormous estimates shown in the table yet there is another consideration that the study s authors haven t included as millions of people become employed by the federal government doing busy work and yet getting paid an average of 625 per week it will necessarily be the case that the living standards of everyone else on average go down for example if a million people go from being unemployed to earning collectively 625 million per week then they will naturally consume much more than they used to but these million people are obviously not going to be producing 625 million in additional output boosting total gdp by that same increment if they could do that then the federal government wouldn t have needed to hire them private companies would have done so so if these million people are now consuming much more than they used to but their newly offered labor because before they were unemployed isn t itself producing the goods and services being purchased then it must be the case that other people s paychecks aren t going as far as they used to the specific way this outcome will manifest itself would depend on how the green new deal is financed but it would probably be a combination of a the other workers having smaller after tax incomes because taxes have gone way up to finance the green new deal b interest rates have risen to finance the higher deficits and c the prices of the goods they buy have gone up more than their paychecks because of the extra inflation from the fed needed to help finance the gnd yet in this environment with the federal government offering a guaranteed job with a floor salary more and more workers will quit their original jobs and take the federal one depending on the numbers a vicious spiral could develop in which more people flock to the guaranteed federal job whose wages are ultimately paid for by the ever shrinking remnant of workers in the genuine private sector to use a biological metaphor if a parasite grows too rapidly it could end up killing the host and thus its own source of sustenance 1 conclusion the green new deal contains a wish list of progressive social and economic goals that come with a staggering price tag a recent estimate from the american action forum puts the 10 year cost at an incredible 93 trillion yet as we have explained above this estimate is conservative because it leaves out many practical considerations it s difficult to be precise however because the plan s authors have been deliberately vague on the details in reality the congress will not be so foolish as to attempt an undertaking so ludicrously expensive yet even if they implement a green new deal lite the package would still add many trillions in government debt while making energy and transportation more expensive for american households and businesses the biological metaphor aptly demonstrates the possibility of a vicious spiral but is not meant to condemn the participants it is prior rounds of government intervention in the form of shoddy schools

beijing reuters new bank loans in china fell sharply in february from a record the previous month but the drop was likely due to seasonal factors while policymakers continue to press lenders to help cash strapped companies stay afloat analysts say china needs to revive weak credit growth to help head off a sharper economic slowdown this year but investors are worried about a further jump in corporate debt and the risk to banks as they relax their lending standards chinese banks made 885 8 billion yuan in net new yuan loans in february according to data released by the people s bank of china pboc on sunday that was down sharply from a record 3 23 trillion yuan in january when several other key credit gauges also picked up modestly in response to the central bank s policy easing but february s tally was still 5 5 percent higher than 839 3 billion yuan a year earlier analysts polled by reuters had predicted new yuan loans of 975 billion yuan in february a pull back in february s tally had been widely expected as chinese banks tend to front load loans at the beginning of the year to get higher quality customers and win market share broad m2 money supply grew 8 0 percent in february from a year earlier missing forecasts the central bank data showed analysts had expected a 8 4 percent rise in m2 unchanged from january outstanding yuan loans grew 13 4 percent from a year earlier matching expectations and unchanged from january s rise further easing seen on cards china s central bank is widely expected to ease policy further this year to spur lending and lower borrowing costs especially for small and private firms vital for growth and job creation but policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns corporate bond defaults hit a record last year while banks non performing loan ratio notched a 10 year high premier li keqiang told parliament on tuesday that beijing will step up targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio rrr for smaller and medium sized banks with an aim to boost lending to small companies by large banks by more than 30 percent he also said monetary policy would be neither too tight nor too loose li also pledged to push for market based reforms to lower real interest rates the central bank has already cut rrr the amount that banks need to set aside as reserves five times over the past year most recently in january further cuts are widely expected sources have told reuters the central bank is not ready to cut benchmark interest rates just yet but is likely to cut market based rates growth of outstanding total social financing tsf a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy slowed to 10 1 percent in february from january s 10 4 percent versus a record low of 9 8 percent in december tsf growth is a rough gauge of credit conditions tsf includes off balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system such as initial public offerings loans from trust companies and bond sales in february tsf fell to 703 billion yuan from 4 64 trillion yuan in january analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better and there is a risk that more firms are borrowing merely to refinance existing debt rather than for fresh investment needed to fuel an economic turnaround past credit spreads have also invariably led to speculation in property and financial markets the country s banking watchdog has punished two lenders for illegally channeling money into the stock market the official securities times said on friday china s economic growth is expected to cool to around 6 2 percent this year a 29 year low according to reuters polls most economists expect a rocky first half before conditions begin to stabilize around mid year as support measures begin to have a greater impact growth slowed to 6 6 percent last year with domestic demand curbed by higher borrowing rates and tighter credit conditions and exporters hit by the escalating trade war with the united states
published monday 11 march 2019 print disqus by david haggith let s review this past devilishly whacky week to see if we can divine the way the world is turning and why the markets are churning it was 2019 s worst week in stocks and well just about everything economic all across this crazily spinning planet volatility lifted its head back out of the water like loch ness s monster while the citizenry took flight to treasury safe havens bringing treasury yields down again to the five year s lowest point of the year north korea s rocketman returned to his rocketry and the chinese threw up their hands and ran as far from mar a lago as they could or maybe they just threw up from too much chocolate cake the china syndrome is back most notably all over the world bad news finally moved back to just being bad news even as it arrived in cloudburst after cloudburst gold popped as money dropped and china flopped chinese exports fell 20 outstripping the worst prediction four fold the central bank of the billions of people of china mainlined major yuan jolts into the xi dynasty s tiring economy and yet the sino stock market fell off the mountain taking a full panda bear plunge in one week apparently the nouveau riche chinese ghost city dwellers are wising up to all this easing and just realized talk of more of the same as far as the eye can see simply means the economy is finished more than it means refreshed hope waits on some distant horizon trump talked and china walked the best boast trump could biggly bluster from his tweet blaster was that the stock market would rise again if china would only deal china chose instead to cancel chairman xi s second coming at mar a lago most market makers are saying the chinese trade wars now have more downside than upside markets have priced in trump s repeated wafting of wistful hopes that a deal will be struck any day his twittering about had the lightness of ether this week if it happens that china does sign a grand bargain the market money is already riding on that deal so it won t bring a lot more lift if it doesn t happen on the other hand the table cloth gets pulled out from under the mar a lago gold settings and one can only hope all the crystal doesn t shatter as xi xings away without his chocolate cake central banksters on parade the european central bank joined all other major central banks in twirling away from the tightening it had just promised and rushing back to renewed rounds of easing via mega loans to banks because it got schooled in a hurry to the awakening that it cannot ever unwind its balance sheet it made this stunning pivot when reality forced it to admit the european economy is stalling the ecb forecast prerecessionary growth of just 1 1 for 2019 to finish the dance reports came in after chairman draghi s announcement that some ecb thinksters didn t think their central bank downgraded the economy far enough and so the bank that once promised it would do anything to save the franco german empire will return to doing what hasn t worked so far as happened in china this new round of promised profligacy was not greeted with the now customary market ecstasy exasperated european investors dwelled instead on what the ecb s flash reversal revealed about europe s economy and so the old regime returned in which bad news is just bad news it was almost as if exhausted investors felt central bankster draghi s sudden ankle twist indicated central bankers are clueless since only a couple of weeks ago draghi was boldly certain his central bank needed to torque up financial tightness suddenly he and his bankster troop were break dancing on their bonnets in the streets of belgium how appropriate that this carnival took place in the same week as mardi gras in the us speaking of which the fed goose stepped to the same tune singing from sea to shining sea its reiterated message that tightening is over now boston fed head eric rosengren indicated the fed is dead in its tracks saying it could take many meetings before the fed recaptures a sense of where this spinning economy is now going in order to figure out what to do with interest rates it may be several meetings of the federal open market committee before fed policymakers have a clearer read on whether the risks are becoming reality and by how much the economy will slow compared to last year said rosengren in his speech he added that patiently watching is the best policy for now seeking alpha notice the shift to figuring out how much the economy will slow rather than worrying it may start to run too hot which required full blast quantitative tightening up until december these guys know what they re doing the st louis fed head piped in that he was in favor of holding interest rates at the present level with the same focus on how things are falling apart vice chair richard clarida stressed cross currents and head winds are strengthening the dallas fed head harmonized with everyone else substantial growth in bbb and lower rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the u s which sort of reinforces for me why i feel we should be taking no action for some period of time fed governor lael brainard and bank of canada s deputy governor lynn patterson also joined the chorus of cbers singing refrains of a new season of easing patterson said the canadian economy looks like it will be weaker through the first half of the year than it appeared it would be in january and the bank of canada toned down its convictions over future rates hikes so the central choristers sang as the high stepping fed heads joined draghi to spin in the streets of their financial capitals but the citizens watched in stony silence at their odd and globally united parade all this market hopium gave no high anywhere stocks did nothing but fall fall fall which would seem to confirm jerome powell s candidly stated concern last month that people are losing faith in big institutions by which he seemed to mean central banks is there anyone who would ever have thought more rounds of quantitative easing would be less effective this time around because the law of diminishing returns still rules oh yeah me right here all along numbers fell from the sky like rain to cap this capricious week of chaos and carnival one of those once a year flukey jobs reports cruised in under the radar at a mere 20 000 new jobs smashing far below the lowest expectations of the gloomiest doomiest prognostications of 150 000 as if that were not enough rain on the parade all hail broke loose that same day when the us budget deficit took a rocket ride to the moon that is to say it was reported that day that the us deficit vaulted into the heavens in a whopping 77 ascension in the first four months of this fiscal year another trump triumph he ordered the tax cuts and he ordered the spending increases so he gets to own it with the greatest revenue boosters now receding in the rear view mirror and gdp fading smaller and smaller each of the last two quarters it doesn t look like those tax cuts will ever be paying for themselves the fed made that definitive by forecasting an even bigger gdp plunge this quarter to a 0 3 0 8 lowland that makes europe look great again so we can reverse the trump tax cuts to restore fiscal responsibility too or just spend ourselves into oblivion because the interest alone is now pushing half a trillion dollars half a trillion here and half a trillion there and pretty soon you re talking real money don t worry the debt drifters will say it s only money we can always print more the new money theory of the nuevo socialista democrats that i ll be attacking into in new articles soon with socialists rising all over the nation to preach infinite money creation sanders aoc warren and the fed which socialized all the losses of the capitalists with nuevo money and with democrats voting to give illegal russian aliens the right to vote in us local elections if the locals so choose even as they decry russian interference in us elections and with an habitually anti semitic congress woman in hijab now being excused by ranking and just plain rank democrats for her relentless rants about benjamin seeking jews i think the world is doing a whirling dervish on its axis right now my country has become crazy like an asylum on parade but hey the end of next week brings us into the ides of march when all debts were settled the roman pantheon was worshipped and caesars were killed ending the crisis of the roman republic and triggering the civil war so let s raise a glass of italian whine to the fact that even when things are this crazy they can get worse carmageddon and the retail apocalypse soldiered on general motors mothballed one of its ohio factories this week and dollar tree announced it will be closing several hundred stores even as clothier charlotte russe announced closure of all of its stores with immediate liquidation of all inventory the gap said during its earnings report it will be shuttering 230 stores victoria s secret said it will be stripping off 53 of its north american boutiques two top execs of america s largest mall landlord simon property group said this trend is acclerating using phrases like i don t want to scare you and we have many more that are in the pipeline and yet there are idiots out there who keep crowing that the good times are really on a roll now after all we just had a fantastic bear market rally now ended how could it be better let them dance over the cliff with their bankster band leaders stocks couldn t stop stumbling if you re looking for the reason stocks fell relentlessly this week how about all the above the quants can have their numbers the chartsters can charter away but reality carries the day the s p 500 slipped back under its 200 day moving average the nasdaq nodded the same the s p buyback index which tracks all the stocks that are rising in the s p due to buybacks actually fell harder than the overall index the nasdaq faangs fandangled below their 200 day running average too intriguingly perhaps ominously the s p continued its relentless retracing of its 1939 crash pattern i wouldn t make any prediction based on an eery chart coincidence any more than i d claim ivanka trump s husband is the antichrist just because his business address is 666 fifth avenue but it s still fascinating especially in a world gone weird twain said history rhymes today we might say it is comprised of fractals of peculiar coincidence the wide reality gap however appears to be closing best case scenario the two lines converge in the middle at 2350 where the s p last found its bottom the dow transportation stocks matched an ancient record of badness this past week their eleven day fall paired up to their worst losing streak since watergate if you re a gen x er you may never even have heard of that there was this guy with a shoe shaped nose named nixon well never mind suffice it to say it was a bad time far in the rearview mirror that looked well increasingly like the present time the fall of a president shook the nation to the core of its being important to note the dow transports are not stocks that merely reflect how the rest of the stock market is falling this 135 year old index is the canary in the coal mine the trannies as they are lovingly referred to by gender neutral marketeers reflect the entire condition of the industrial world in america the trannies go down when the closing of thousands of stores reduces shipping and when trump tariffs drag imports and exports down to stall speed and when housing construction slows which slows the movement of all kinds of materials and when global economies start lurching like an auto out of fuel they go down when the economy stops moving because they are the movers of all things real and not virtual and boy have they gone down hitting their worst path in half a century 2019 also is turning out to be inspite of all its market madness the year of capital flight from us stocks well i guess that is the mark of its madness yes you heard that right even though stocks were bid toward their former heights throughout the first two months of the year more money flowed out of the us market than flowed in throughout that same time apparently nobody with big money believes in this rising market it s a great paradox but as the market punched skyward day after day knocking holes through the clouds nearly wiping out its major 2018 losses investors were lightening their ships by sending their treasures on lifeboats to nearby islands where i don t know but here is a map of the journey money kept leaving at the same pace even though the market returned to rising when the market finally reached the s p s triple tested 2800 ceiling for a fourth attempt and skidded along the bottom of the ceiling to finally lose lift and drop back away the fleeing investors proved right exactly how the market rose so much with so much money fleeing i never found a good explanation for prices going up almost equal and opposite to the money going out but like i said it s a weird and whacky world the big bear rally now appears to have fallen from the lucky stars above to examine its nether regions each of the last three bear rallies rose to this same height and each one dropped lower than the one that preceded it if this one should find its rest along that trajectory of deeper bottoming bottoms it has an exponential distance to descend that would take us back to 2014 while the bears prey let the bulls pray that the s p 500 s last 2400 bottom holds because the next sturdy stop for chart dwellers is between 2200 and 2100 taking out the entire trump rally and below that it s no man s land no that s not a prediction but it is where this thing could fall for the simple reason that rallies based on hopium and the euphoric high it delivers when mainlined to the moon have very little support stops along the way back down either simple chart support or real fundamentals especially real fundamentals and those are my basis for saying this market has no support a wild and wacky whirled when the entire world is margined into the stratosphere on corporate debt individual credit card debt mortgages including millions still hunkered in from the 2008 crash stock margin debt delinquent student debt sovereign debts all in a world of rising interest falling earnings and falling stock buybacks you can find as much downdraft as the sinking titanic or everything could go right just like the donald says it will all hail the chief well it could maybe this was just a week of blips not of freudian slips that are showing the true nature of the debt addled economy through all the holes in the lacy veil that covers its stinking corpse maybe all is as golden as the donald s showers and china will give us a deal that makes the trump tariffs salutary and the ecb will finally save the euromess with reinforced rounds of easing and brexit will exit as smoothly and gracefully as the most refined englishman can hope for and the us stock market s last bottom will hold like a rock foundation as steady hands in the market hoist from that stronghold again the federal flag of hope maybe housing will find a second wind and the retail apocalypse will hit a brick and mortar wall that stops it from mauling all of americas malls and automakers will retool to produce fleets of electric dreams turning the auto market around in just a year to a future as bright as an led headlight maybe everything will go like your most golden dream and maybe the beatles will regroup for a reunion from the land of the gratefully dead in a great yellow submarine piloted by a young elton john to float across strawberry fields forever maybe maybe the world will turn a new page this long tiresome trip to nowhere will end and the troubles we never dealt with will just dissolve away in an opiated haze maybe it s a wonderful whacky world so anything can happen good luck with that david haggith digg this article published monday 11 march 2019 e mail print source

by lawrence h summers special to the washington post we ve seen this movie before there is widespread frustration with the performance of the economy traditional policy approaches are not delivering hoped for results a relatively unpopular president is loathed to an unusual extent by a frustrated opposition party that lost the previous presidential election while running a pillar of its establishment and altered economic conditions have led to the development of new economic ideas that reflect a significant break with previous orthodoxy and now these new ideas are being oversimplified and exaggerated by fringe economists who hold them out as offering the proverbial free lunch the ability of the government to spend more without imposing any burden on anyone during the late 1970s this was the story of supply side laffer curve economics it began with the valid idea that taxes had important incentive effects and that in conceivable circumstances tax cuts could raise revenue it grew into the ludicrous idea that tax cuts would always pay for themselves and this view was then adopted by a frustrated extreme wing of a major political party george h w bush was right during the 1980 presidential primary campaign to call such thinking voodoo economics in the decades following that doctrine did substantial damage to the u s economy modern monetary theory sometimes shortened to mmt is the supply side economics of our time a valid idea that traditional fiscal policy taboos need to be rethought in an era of low real interest rates has been stretched by fringe economists into ludicrous claims that massive spending on job guarantees can be financed by central banks without any burden on the economy at a moment of economic and political frustration some in the more extreme wing of the out of power political party are seizing on the possibility of a free lunch to offer politically attractive ways out of economic difficulty modern monetary theory is fallacious at multiple levels first it holds out the prospect that somehow by printing money the government can finance its deficits at zero cost in fact in today s economy the government pays interest on any new money it creates which takes the form of its reserves held by banks at the federal reserve yes there is outstanding currency in circulation but because that can always be deposited in a bank its quantity is not controlled by the government even money financed deficits cause the government to incur debt second contrary to the claims of modern monetary theorists it is not true that governments can simply create new money to pay all liabilities coming due and avoid default as the experience of any number of emerging markets demonstrates past a certain point this approach leads to hyperinflation indeed in emerging markets that have practiced modern monetary theory situations could arise where people could buy two drinks at bars at once to avoid the hourly price increases as with any tax there is a limit to the amount of revenue that can be raised via such an inflation tax if this limit is exceeded hyperinflation will result third modern monetary theorists typically reason in terms of a closed economy but a policy of relying on central bank finance of government deficits as suggested by modern monetary theorists would likely result in a collapsing exchange rate this would in turn lead to increased inflation increased long term interest rates because of inflation risk premiums capital fleeing the country and lower real wages as the exchange rate collapsed and the price of imports soared again this is not just theory numerous emerging markets have found contrary to modern monetary theory that they could not print money to cover even their domestic currency liabilities the same is true of industrial economies the mitterrand government in france in 1981 and the schroder government in germany in 1998 began with mmt type approaches to policy and were forced to reverse course the british and italians both had to call in the international monetary fund during the mid 1970s because of excessive reliance on inflationary finance supply side economics was an unreasonable extension of valid ideas few today advocate the top corporate tax rate of 46 percent and rates above 50 percent for a substantial swath of taxpayers that prevailed in the late 1970s so too in a new era when the fed chairman thinks that neutral real interest rates are well below 1 percent we can approach federal borrowing with much less trepidation than we have traditionally but for neither the right nor the left is there any such thing as a free lunch it s the responsibility of serious economists whatever their political party to make this clear summers is a professor at and past president of harvard university he was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to president barack obama from 2009 through 2010

unprecedented in terms of their length and sustainability their geographical spread throughout the entire country and the remarkable coalition of youth groups civil society organizations and opposition political parties that have joined in these protests now still ongoing in their third month khalid medani the slogan tasqut bas just fall that is all has become one of the signature refrains of demonstrators who have been returning again and again to the streets of sudan even after more than 60 killed by security forces hundreds arrested and a state of emergency declared in february while no one can predict when and if long surviving dictator omar al bashir will follow the demonstrators advice many observers note that the regime is much weaker and the opposition stronger than in earlier similar protests sudan s precarious economic situation among the catalysts for the protests also weakens the regime s capacity to survive and international pressure is also increasing including uncertainty about support from the gulf states which have in the past bailed out the regime saudi arabia united arab emirates and qatar who have been among the patrons of khartoum are hesitant in part because of sudan s reluctance to take sides in the bitter dispute of saudi arabia and uae with qatar the remarkable persistence and breadth of support for the demonstrations is leading even longtime supporters to question bashir s capacity to survive this time this africafocus bulletin contains two articles on the recent protests one by khalid medani providing an overview

current updates end editor s note the new mobilization dynamics of sudan s popular uprising the virtue of learning from the past by khalid m medani jadaliyya feb 23 2019 tasqut bas fall that is all for over two months wide scale protests in sudan have continued unabated calling for president omar al bashir to step down and pave the way for a transition period ushering in multi party democracy not surprisingly as with similar protests in the past the bashir regime has sought a military solution to quell the protests deploying the police and paramilitary security forces against peaceful protestors in khartoum and throughout the country at the time of writing over sixty people have been killed many as a result of torture in the government s ghost houses more than two thousand anti government activists are still held in detention despite the regime s repeated insistence that they are intent on releasing political detainees the government has frequently pronounced that the protests are relatively small and are having little impact on the regime or that the demonstrations are essentially sponsored by saboteurs thugs or foreign elements despite such claims the popular intifada has not only produced significant policy changes on the part of the regime it has clearly undermined the rule of omar bashir in ways that have threatened to topple his thirty year authoritarian rule over the last week in the wake of continued and sustained demonstrations strikes and sit ins across sudanese civil society bashir has been forced to postpone a constitutional amendment that would have allow him to run for a third term in office he also declared a state of emergency in khartoum disbanding the federal government and replacing local governors with senior army officers in a desperate attempt to maintain his power however these policies of both appeasement and repression appear to have emboldened anti government protestors further the state of emergency is clearly designed to give carte blanche to the security forces to use greater violence against the protestors to further restrict political and civil liberties and to crack down even more on activists and opposition political parties immediately following bashir s announcement of a state of emergency protestors went back on the streets in over fifty neighborhoods throughout the country and particularly in khartoum and omdurman they called once again for bashir s removal they chanted among other slogans one of the most uncompromising and popular refrains of the current uprising tasqut bas fall that is all the periphery as catalyst of the intifada the recent protests erupted on 19 december 2018 in the workingclass city of atbara in river nile state approximately twohundred miles north of khartoum they were sparked by a three fold increase in the price of bread they began with protests led by secondary school students they were very quickly joined by thousands of residents in the city of atbara within days antigovernment demonstrations expanded across a wide range of cities and towns throughout the northern region and in the capital city of khartoum chanting slogans such as the people want the fall of the regime inspired by the arab uprisings of late 2010 and 2011 in tunisia and egypt respectively the demonstrators quickly expanded their demands in ways that reflect deep seated and wideranging political as well as economic grievances with the thirtyyear authoritarian rule of omer al bashir and his ruling party the national congress party ncp however despite the fact that political grievances and demands are now at the forefront of the uprising there is little question that these particularly protests were first sparked by economic grievances that date back to the consequences of the secession of south sudan in 2011 as is by now widely noted this led to the loss of seventy five percent of oil revenue for khartoum since two thirds of the oil resources are in the south and consequently approximately sixty percent of its foreign currency earnings as a result the bashir regime implemented austerity measures beginning in 2012 which resulted in similar anti austerity protests at the time although these were mostly centered in khartoum and hence more centralized than the current protests similarly one of the main factors for the current demonstrations is the implementation of imf backed austerity measures which led to lifting of bread and fuel subsidies and quickly sparked the first of the demonstrations on 19 december 2018 what is important to emphasize however is that these protests are not only rooted in opposition to economic austerity measures they are crucially a result of a widely understood opposition to decades of rampant corruption including privatization policies that transferred assets and wealth to the regime s supporters and the theft of gold as well as billions of dollars of profits from the period of the oil boom in the country a new pattern of mobilization and protest following the lead of cities in the periphery in khartoum the protests also began in opposition to a deep economic crisis associated with the rise in bread fuel prices as well as a severe liquidity crisis but these demands quickly evolved into calls for the ouster of bashir from power importantly the sudanese professional association spa which has taken the lead in organizing and scheduling the protests initially marched to the parliament in khartoum in late december demanding wages increases for public sector workers and the legalization of professional and trade unions however after security forces used violence against the peaceful protests these demands quickly escalated into the call for the removal of the ruling national congress party the structural transformation of governance in sudan and a transition to democracy these demands are similar to those associated with previous popular protests against the regime including those of 2011 2012 and 2013 however what is most important to note with respect to these protests is that they are unprecedented in terms of their duration and sustainability now ongoing in their third month their geographical spread throughout the entire country and the remarkable coalition of youth groups civil society organizations and opposition political parties that have joined equally important is that the coordination of these demonstrations has followed a remarkably new innovative and sustained process this is important to highlight because it clearly shows that just as the dictatorial regime of omer bashir has prided itself in weakening the opposition in order to prevent any threat to their regime by dismantling labor and trade unions establishing a wide range of paramilitary militias linked to the state and putting down armed opposition as well as antigovernment activists in civil society these demonstrators have also learned from the unsuccessful anti regime protests of the past led by the newly established sudanese professional association the ongoing demonstrations have been coordinated scheduled and strategically designed to emphasize sustainability over time rather than sheer numbers spread throughout middle working class and poor neighborhoods and coordination with protestors in regions far afield from khartoum including the eastern state on the red sea and darfur to the far west of the country in addition the slogans promoted and utilized by the protestors also have been purposefully framed to incorporate the grievances of the wider spectrum of sudanese and not just those of the middle class and ethnic and political elites centered in khartoum and the northern regions of the country these slogans are essentially framed in ways designed to mobilize support across ethnic and racial categories emphasizing that the only way forward is to oust omar bashir and the ruling regime from power in doing so they highlight the endemic and unprecedented level of corruption of the regime and its allies the decades of human rights violations against civilians in the country by a wide range of security forces and the brutal wars waged by the regime in darfur the blue nile state on the border of south sudan and the nuba mountains in south kordofan anti regime demonstrators in omdurman sudan january 2019 indeed perhaps one of the most notable aspect of these protests which distinguish them greatly from previous uprisings is not only the sheer regional scale of the demonstrations but the hitherto unprecedented high level of solidarity across class lines in the country youth activists and members of the professional associations have not only challenged the political discourse of the state they have played a significant role in engineering cross class alliances in the context of these demonstrations over the last week strikes work stoppages and sit ins have been held not only on university campuses and secondary schools but also among private sector and public sector employees and workers among the most important examples are the ongoing strikes by workers of port sudan on the red sea demanding the nullification of the sale of the southern port to a foreign company and several work stoppages and protests led by employees of some of the most important telecom providers and other private firms in the country scenarios the prospects for a peaceful transition to multi party democracy equally important with respect to evaluating the prospects of the uprising leading to a transition to democracy has to do with the evolving and increasingly sophisticated nature of the demands of the demonstrators as the protests have continued unabated the initial aims of the protestors were to simply oust omar bashir and his regime from power the level of grievance and anger among the population made this the most important priority at the very beginning of the protest however as the coordination of these protests became exceedingly more sophisticated particular under the leadership of the sudanese professional associations the objectives of the majority of the protestor is now not only to end omar bashir s dictatorial regime which remains a priority but to also prepare and pave the way for a transitional period consisting of four years that would usher in a multi party democracy in the country at the moment sudanese activists the political party opposition and a broad swath of civil society organizations are engaged in discussing a variety of possible scenarios including the prospects of the sudan armed forces saf taking the side of the protests and overseeing democratic transition as in the past an internal coup within the armed forces that would essentially consolidate authoritarian rule under a new leadership or the falling apart of the center and state disintegration as in for example libya and somalia ultimately the outcome of these protests will not surprisingly depend on the continued unity and sustainability of the protestors and demonstrators the power and force of the national intelligence and security services and the para military militias and the extent to which external regional powers especially in the region support the regime in khartoum out of fear that their regional interests may be undermined following the removal of bashir from power this balance between domestic anti government activists and civil society organizations the state s security apparatus and external patronage is of course critical in devising any scenarios in the future and is well known what is interesting is the actions of bashir more recently that have signalled that these demonstrations have altered internal regime dynamics and calculations as a result of the rise of protests in the regions bashir traveled to regions he never visited before as a consequence of protests against the continued torture and violence against demonstrators he has made some tepid overtures such as releasing some political prisoners and as the demonstrations continue unabated loyalists within his own parliament have very recently proposed that he formally declare he will not alter the constitution and run for president for a third term there is little question that this reflects the view of some in his inner circle of devising a way out for bashir in ways that would quite the protests work stoppages labor strikes and sit ins that have now transformed the initial protests from so called streets protests to essentially a social movement that has altered sudan s political and cultural landscape for decades to come central to this shift has been the pointed critique and even abhorrence of the activists to the islamist project of bashir s ruling national congress party ncp and his islamist supporters that has made the regime of bashir in the eyes of most sudanese nothing short of a ruling military junta composed of tujjar al din traders of religion reportedly the wide scale opposition to the regime has expanded to such a degree that bashir s own ministry has acknowledged that the opposition is now in every home not to mention in many mosques in khartoum and throughout the country at the time of writing deep divisions appear to be further emerging within the regime itself early on the morning of 22 february the powerful head of the sudan national security and intelligence services niss salah gosh announced that bashir will step down as head of the ruling national congress party ncp and that the constitution will not be amended to allow for his 2020 re election but in a televized address later the same evening bashir contradicted his intelligence chief s statements and affirmed that while he will postpone the parliamentary vote to amend the constitution he would remain as head of state and declared a state of emergency for one year there is now little question that these demonstrations have already registered remarkable success in ways that few would have predicated before 19 december specifically there is a remarkable reinvigoration of civil society in sudan despite decades of authoritarian rule and a policy of division across ethnic racial and class lines however in this regard we must be specific it is not the emergence of a strong civil society in a vague sense but rather the reinvigoration of independent trade labor and professional unions at time when most would have predicted and affirmed their demise we also see the remarkable empowerment of youth activism and their utilization of social media to assist in the coordination of demonstrations across class regional and racial lines rather than to simply express a particularly middle class and elite and narrow political sensibility which is a critique that has been leveled at youth activism throughout the region the bravery and courage of youth activists in sudan and in the region is of course never in doubt what we see in sudan however is that in addition to this display of remarkable courage is the close coordination among activists across middle and working class neighborhoods repeated campaigns to support the reef or rural areas and remarkable cooperation across the gender divide which has underpinned the political and cultural shift that these demonstrations have accomplished when bashir in recognition of the prominent role of women in the demonstrations recently called for changes in the public order law that has brutalized and demeaned sudanese women for decades female activists quickly responded that their struggle is not just about the public order law it is pointedly centered on the removal of an authoritarian regime and working towards the expansion of political and civil liberties for all sudanese the wide scope and sustainability of sudan s uprising is unprecedented in the country s history more specifically the coordination and linkages between formal professional associations trade and labor unions civil society organizations and youth activists with the popular and working class segments of the population who are essentially workers in the informal economy is one of the most important reasons for the durability of the protests ultimately it is the success in organizing across the formal informal social spectrum that has sustained the protests the idea that professional and trade unions should engage more closely with street activists and workers in the informal economy was not one that had been vigorously envisioned or promoted by many political actors involved in previous popular protests this development has played a key role in sustaining the protests and in undermining the bashir regime in ways that could not easily have been predicted when the uprising first erupted in atbara the city of al hadid wa al nar steel and fire in the river nile state sudan s doctors treating the political ailments of the nation africa is a country march 2 2019 by abdulrazig s hummaida and khalid m dousa direct url as sudanese continue to chant just fall that is all against the regime doctors pay a hefty price for standing with them since the december 2018 demonstrations against the 30 year rule of president omar al bashir began sudanese doctors have been on the frontlines of the public movement that has shaken the regime it s unmistakable to anyone following the demonstrations which started in atbara central sudan on december 19th that this time is different it is a continuation of an ongoing protest movement fighting for freedom which has escalated in recent years most prominently in 2013 when over 200 peaceful protestors were shot down in three days it has been more than 60 days since the sudanese people took to the streets and the death toll has exceeded 50 as a result of the government using excessive force and live ammunition at protestors hundreds remain in political detention and dozens are injured and disabled professionals have been one of the largest constituencies of this movement as the entity calling and guiding the protests is the sudanese professionals association spa a group reportedly formed after the september 2013 protests but formally introduced in august 2018 with a goal to campaign for raising the minimum wages doctors who are trying to save lives with the scarce medical supplies they are afforded continue to be targeted dr mohamed al asam who is one of two sudan based speakers for the spa was arrested by the security agencies just 24 hours after his first appearance on a live video on spa s social media accounts on the 2nd of january 2018 the 28 year old remains detained and his whereabouts are unknown at least 27 other doctors remain in detention on january 15th 2019 dr babiker abdelhamid was shot dead by security forces while treating wounded demonstrators in burri a neighborhood in eastern khartoum a number of doctors were also shot or wounded on the job as security agents raided and tear gassed a number of hospitals in khartoum and north kordofan states on january 9th security forces stormed into omdurman teaching hospital where some injured and routine patients were receiving care and fired tear gas canisters and live ammunition rounds they then went on to beat and arrest doctors protesters and their families and bystanders indiscriminately commenting on this incident the world health organization stated that they are extremely concerned about attack on a hospital in sudan while patients might be not injured they are traumatized this is in direct violation of medical neutrality and human rights principles health facilities staff and patients are notatarget other accounts have circulated through social and mainstream media where doctors in the demonstrations have reported that they feel targeted and were in fear of severe punishment or even execution in detention such fears were materialized since dr alfatih omer elsid manager of tuga private hospital was arrested after his announcement that the hospital will provide free medical care to injured protesters medical students have also been on the receiving end of some of the most vicious government crackdowns on protests this occurred on several occasions in different university campuses in the capital khartoum among the universities attacked were sudan international university siu and the university of medical sciences and technology umst security forces entered the umst campus on sunday february 24 fired tear gas into classrooms beat up the peacefully protesting medical students and arrested dozens of them this attack came only two days after president omar al bashir declared a national state of emergency all these intimidating actions by the government led the sudan doctors committee a parallel popular union to the governmentcontrolled doctor s union to immediately issue a statement which stated that if the government does not stop its unlawful and unethical acts and abide to a list of five demands within a 48hour period it would announce a nationwide strike from nonemergency cases in all hospitals these demands included the formation of an investigation committee for the abuses incrementation of the acts carried out by the security forces against doctors and other hospital staff in the line of duty the immediate release of all detained doctors that doctors on strike should not negotiate with hospital administration without the presence of head of police or locality and the protection of hospitals and staff by military police and the armed forces this continuous aggression against doctors has not deterred their resolve to stand up for their rights and to support the uprising while continuing to fulfill their hippocratic oath and provide medical care this balance despite being difficult has been carefully executed as doctors are still providing emergency care services in government hospitals and private institutions not linked to the regime or financed by its supporters they have however taken a specific stance against hospitals running under the leadership and management of the security and defense forces since january 18 they called on all the doctors to stop working in these hospitals and instead volunteer to work in other government and private facilities some doctors have since faced countless threats of discontinuation of training and even legal action due to failure to provide care sudanese doctors in the diaspora have also played a major role in the protests since the beginning of the uprising they quickly began and contributed to fundraising initiatives through several social platforms including facebook and paypal these initiatives were made possible by the sudanese american physicians association sapa in the us and the sudan doctor s union in the uk and ireland sdu uk i amongst other diaspora associations these funds have helped in the delivery of care on the ground where the money was used to finance health care service needs to the injured protesters and sometimes the immediate families of those who were martyred in the revolution these included two cases to date both of which lost one of their eyes due to contact with shrapnel or a tear gas canister both were sent abroad for surgery and further rehabilitation another initiative was called for by sapa to fund the payment of salaries for the doctors on strike since their salaries and benefits had ceased sudanese diaspora demontrators in washington dc call for support for opposition to regime in sudan february 16 2019 one of the pivotal roles the sudanese doctor s central committee sdcc and sudan doctor s syndicate has been playing in this uprising is the documentation of injuries and deaths that occur during the demonstrations the reports given by the official media outlet the sudan news agency suna have been misleading and the committee has countered this by providing ground verified reports while the last report given by government agencies puts the casualties at 29 deaths the sudan doctors syndicate have reported 57 deaths as of february 8th 2019 the sdcc continues to report casualties and fatalities related to the protests regularly on their social media accounts the aforementioned patriotic acts of doctors towards the injured in the protests and their defiance against the government and its atrocious acts have led the demonstrators to refer to them as the white army in reference to their white coats to date the sudanese armed forces have sworn to protect the regime and its leader something the protesters see as a betrayal to the peaceful demonstrations and rightful call for freedom they feel however that the strong role doctors are playing is akin to what a military would do which is to side with the people against a dictatorship with the absence of the sudanese armed forces the poor coverage of the december 2018 uprising by the media and the weak denouncement of the oppression of the government by world leaders and heads of states protesters see doctors as their only protectors doctors have taken it upon themselves to both physically and metaphorically treat the wounds of the nation doctors in sudan have historically played a significant role in the country s uprisings in october 1964 and april 1985 they did their part and doing so now even in the face of bullets financial hardships and detentions as the people continue to chant just fall that is all doctors continue to pay a hefty price for standing with the people and they need the international community to protect them africafocus bulletin is

the u s economy is in excellent shape a disappointing february job growth report notwithstanding the unemployment rate is only 3 8 percent inflation is under control both real wages and productivity growth have recently improved the number of people in the united states working in manufacturing is 12 8 million up 1 4 million from its great recession low point meanwhile the united states merchandise trade deficit hit 891 billion in 2018 many greeted the news by noting that it was a defeat for president trump s policy of tariffs and threats of tariffs and it certainly was however the coexistence of a huge trade deficit with robust job creation was more than a refutation of mr trump s policy in practice it debunked the theory behind it there is simply no necessary connection between the size of the trade deficit and the general level of prosperity in the context of relatively strong growth it is no surprise that americans would spend more disposable income on imports thus swamping the impact of tariffs ironically mr trump s massive tax cuts were part of the reason for this a trade deficit is the necessary flip side of negative net national savings for which today s huge budget deficits are partly to blame lesson large economic forces such as federal fiscal policy currency fluctuations and the like have as much or more to do with annual trade deficits that puts the current trade policy debate in proper perspective the apparently impending deal between mr trump s negotiators and china s reportedly features chinese promises to buy more u s grain and natural gas along with pledges of greater equality for u s businesses operating in china it could help reduce but cannot seriously dent what is now a 419 2 billion merchandise trade deficit with that country advertisement a similar point applies to the u s trade deficit with mexico which also grew last year and to the pending u s mexico canada agreement usmca mr trump s ballyhooed replacement for the north american free trade agreement the usmca usefully cracks open canada s protected dairy market and updates digital trade rules while adding some unnecessary and possibly counterproductive wage and north american content requirements for auto manufacturing in mexico ratification is desirable not because the usmca is a good deal but because the alternative mr trump s threatened pullout from nafta would be worse follow this author editorial board s opinions follow yet the politics of the deal have changed since nov 30 when the three nations leaders signed the usmca the democrats run the house of representatives and are not eager to abet a trump political win they demand more changes to the trade deal as their price for democratic votes meanwhile both canada and mexico have announced their legislatures won t ratify it unless mr trump agrees to lift separate tariffs he imposed on their steel products with november 2020 just around the corner mr trump s threat to blow up nafta looks more and more like a threat to blow up his own reelection i e a bluff cooler heads on mr trump s trade team if any should counsel patience the safest thing the president can do for himself nothing would also minimize harm to the economy

beijing march 10 new bank loans in china fell sharply in february from a record the previous month but the drop was likely due to seasonal factors while policymakers continue to press lenders to help cash strapped companies stay afloat advertisement analysts say china needs to revive weak credit growth to help head off a sharper economic slowdown this year but investors are worried about a further jump in corporate debt and the risk to banks as they relax their lending standards chinese banks made 885 8 billion yuan rm538 6 billion in net new yuan loans in february according to data released by the people s bank of china pboc today that was down sharply from a record 3 23 trillion yuan in january when several other key credit gauges also picked up modestly in response to the central bank s policy easing advertisement but february s tally was still 5 5 per cent higher than 839 3 billion yuan a year earlier analysts polled by reuters had predicted new yuan loans of 975 billion yuan in february a pull back in february s tally had been widely expected as chinese banks tend to front load loans at the beginning of the year to get higher quality customers and win market share advertisement broad m2 money supply grew 8 0 per cent in february from a year earlier missing forecasts the central bank data showed analysts had expected a 8 4 per cent rise in m2 unchanged from january outstanding yuan loans grew 13 4 per cent from a year earlier matching expectations and unchanged from january s rise further easing seen on cards china s central bank is widely expected to ease policy further this year to spur lending and lower borrowing costs especially for small and private firms vital for growth and job creation but policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns corporate bond defaults hit a record last year while banks non performing loan ratio notched a 10 year high premier li keqiang told parliament on tuesday that beijing will step up targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio rrr for smaller and medium sized banks with an aim to boost lending to small companies by large banks by more than 30 per cent he also said monetary policy would be neither too tight nor too loose li also pledged to push for market based reforms to lower real interest rates the central bank has already cut rrr the amount that banks need to set aside as reserves five times over the past year most recently in january further cuts are widely expected sources have told reuters the central bank is not ready to cut benchmark interest rates just yet but is likely to cut market based rates growth of outstanding total social financing tsf a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy slowed to 10 1 per cent in february from january s 10 4 per cent versus a record low of 9 8 per cent in december tsf growth is a rough gauge of credit conditions tsf includes off balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system such as initial public offerings loans from trust companies and bond sales in february tsf fell to 703 billion yuan from 4 64 trillion yuan in january analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better and there is a risk that more firms are borrowing merely to refinance existing debt rather than for fresh investment needed to fuel an economic turnaround past credit spreads have also invariably led to speculation in property and financial markets the country s banking watchdog has punished two lenders for illegally channelling money into the stock market the official securities times said on friday china s economic growth is expected to cool to around 6 2 per cent this year a 29 year low according to reuters polls most economists expect a rocky first half before conditions begin to stabilise around mid year as support measures begin to have a greater impact growth slowed to 6 6 per cent last year with domestic demand curbed by higher borrowing rates and tighter credit conditions and exporters hit by the escalating trade war with the united states reuters
last month rep alexandra ocasio cortez tweeted workers are often paid far less than the value they create that is essentially a restatement of karl marx s labour theory of value which suggests that economies run into trouble when workers can t afford to buy the products they re making investment bank analysts at citi hsbc and macquarie are worrying over the same issue there are so few rich people and so many people sharing a declining portion of wealth that the next recession might actually be exacerbated by the inequality that low pay has created these analysts argued you can t

because people want to work for what they get so i think this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want she said ocasio cortez responded a living wage isn t a gift it s a right workers are often paid far less than the value they create that caught my eye because it is essentially a restatement of karl marx s labour theory of value and it s not often you see that discussed in the mainstream media advertisement read more alexandria ocasio cortez just revived a classic argument by conservative economist milton friedman about who pays for pollution if all workers are paid less than the value they create then there will never be enough workers to buy the things they make before marx the value of any product was regarded as pretty much the same as its price in the marketplace it s how much you would pay to avoid making the product yourself according to adam smith 1723 1790 the reason you might spend 100 on a pair of shoes is that even though 100 is quite expensive it s a lot easier than making a pair of shoes by hand yourself smith said marx 1818 1883 who was a big fan of smith was more interested in how products acquire value as they come into existence a cow doesn t slaughter itself and magically transform into a pair of leather shoes that happens only because workers apply labor to the cow s corpse turning its skin into leather and then sewing that leather into shoes only after labor has been applied do shoes have any value it s the labor that creates the value not just the fact that the shoes can be traded for cash if you accept that then it becomes immediately obvious that what ocasio cortez said is correct workers in a shoe factory are paid far less than the value they create they have to be if 100 of the money from shoe sales was paid directly to the workers then the factory would go out of business there would be no money left to pay for electricity and there would be no profits to invest in more efficient shoe making machines to help the factory compete in the future advertisement but that raises a contradiction if all workers are paid less than the value they create then there will never be enough workers to buy the things they make let s say our shoe factory has one worker who each day makes five pairs of shoes which sell for 100 each the factory makes 500 a day in sales the worker s wage is 10 an hour for a 10 hour day so the worker is paid 100 a day the worker can afford to buy only one pair of shoes even though they have made five at first this doesn t feel like a problem because obviously there are billions of people on the planet who need shoes the factory can sell those other four pairs to someone somewhere what concerned marx was that ultimately every single worker on the planet in every office and factory is paid less than the value of the goods they create it is not possible for all the goods being produced to be bought by all the workers making them additionally there is almost always a reserve army of unemployed people who can t afford to buy anything exacerbating the problem the tendency is for the system to collapse marx believed the tendency is for the system to collapse and for recessions to destroy shoe factories whose customers are too poor or not numerous enough to buy all the shoes marx believed this collapse can be staved off he argued if the shoe factory goes to great lengths for instance by investing in new technology allowing that shoe worker to double their productivity and make 10 pairs of shoes a day or maybe the same number of shoes at a lower price advertisement but the collapse is only pushed into the future new technology will also be acquired by all the competing shoe factories squeezing profits and squeezing some factories out of business and if the factory buys shoe making machines instead of hiring new workers it still faces the problem of producing more shoes than can be bought by the workers making them by an amazing coincidence ocasio cortez also tweeted a chart of workers pay increases compared with their productivity increases to make the point that even when labor becomes more valuable it does not share the rewards it is impossible for capitalists to pay workers the full value of their labor without going bankrupt that is a vast oversimplification of marx s analysis but you get the gist related stories marx thought capitalism was inherently unstable precisely because workers are not paid the full value of their labor and precisely because it is impossible for capitalists to pay them the full value without going bankrupt it s one of the internal contradictions that capitalism cannot resolve advertisement of course not all profits are invested in new equipment factory owners take a slice for themselves and it tends to be a much bigger slice than the workers get there are reasons for this of course it was the capitalists money that brought the factory into existence and the inevitable collapse can be avoided if the profits are diverted into a new venture like a hat factory that might create new jobs for workers who can then buy shoes whatever they do the bosses get richer than the workers now you have two sets of people both doing the same thing making shoes but being paid wildly unequal sums for doing so which is another way of saying that workers are often paid far less than the value they create as ocasio cortez tweeted aoc and the investment banks are on the same side of the debate she isn t alone in worrying about what workers are paid over the past few years a surprising number of investment bank analysts at citi hsbc and macquarie have published research finding that inequality and low pay may lead to recessions or at the very least hold back economic growth which ironically even makes the rich poorer advertisement these people are not marxists obviously though like marx they are economists but also like marx they are concerned that inequality in the us and the west is becoming so extreme that ordinary people won t have enough money to keep the economy going the charts in this story all show the same thing the share of national income going to the top 1 of earners is increasing while the share of income going to the bottom 50 of people is declining the rich are getting richer and the rest of us are sharing an ever smaller slice of the pie the bottom 50 of people in the us and europe now share just 13 of national income hsbc what if we run out of rich people the top 0 1 own close to 20 of all household wealth in the us according to a paper by gabriel zucman an economics professor at the university of california berkeley this is a problem the investment bank people say because there aren t enough people with money to keep capitalism ticking over advertisement income inequality is cited as another factor in the stagnation process as a few wealthy individuals cannot drive an economy by themselves the citi analysts tobias m levkovich and lorraine m schmitt told their clients in 2015 two analysts at macquarie viktor shvets and perry yeung said something similar last year they cited work by moritz kuhn and moritz schularick published by the federal reserve bank of minneapolis and by emmanuel saez and thomas piketty which said the bottom 25 of households had a negative net worth i e they are in debt the population between 25 and 50 owned only 2 of national wealth the share of the middle class between 25 and 75 had dropped to about 8 from 15 in 1989 the top 10 controlled about 77 of national wealth over time the top 1 increased its share to about 40 in 2013 from 27 in 1989 hsbc in other words wealth has not just accrued to the top 10 but it went almost entirely to the top 1 they told clients the middle class creation in 1950s 70s has clearly been replaced by a middle class compression over the last three decades certainly since late 1980s advertisement if the west goes into recession the fortunes of the rich might make it worse janet henry an economist at hsbc told clients in 2018 that the accumulation of wealth by a tiny minority might actually hold the economy back income inequality suppresses consumption given the lower marginal propensity to consume of higher earners and can be negative for growth if the savings of higher earners do not push up productive investment spending but get parked in property or government bonds she wrote income inequality which often goes hand in hand with a lack of social mobility also creates disparities in life expectancy education skills levels and labour mobility that will impact on future productivity and growth potential she added this has implications for government revenues and their ability to fund public services and future liabilities given the huge structural factors from demographics to technology that are contributing to the growing income polarisation it is not something that will miraculously dissipate on the back of one or two years of robust growth worse if the west goes into recession then the fortunes of the rich will make it worse she said because the poor don t have enough money to withstand it advertisement the depth of any downturn when it finally happens could be amplified by this income and debt distribution she told clients in a note late last year in other words the richest 1 might buy a lot of shoes but they cannot possibly buy enough to keep all the shoemakers employed you need workers with enough money to buy shoes too and that means as ocasio cortez tweeted last month and as investment bankers have been worrying about since the 2008 financial crisis and as marx wrote 200 years ago that it is very important to consider what workers are paid in relation to the value they create
beijing march 10 china s top central banker on sunday signalled that beijing and washington were getting close to reaching a currency deal as part of their continuing negotiations to settle a yearlong trade battle both sides have reached consensus on many crucial and important issues people s bank of china pboc governor yi gang told the media here on the sidelines of the nation s annual legislative session as part of the accord yi said china won t engage in competitive devaluation to give chinese exporters a leg up in foreign markets a commitment chinese officials have also made in multilateral agreements such as those among the group of 20 g20 industrial nations how china manages its currency has been a point of contention between washington and beijing for years us president donald trump was vocal throughout his election campaign in saying china manipulates the yuan to gain an advantage in trade by making its products relatively cheaper trump repeated the charge last year when the yuan s plunge aroused suspicion that beijing was pushing down its value to offset us tariffs on chinese products in the recent trade talks us negotiators pushed their chinese counterparts to keep the yuan stable and to improve transparency in currency market interventions by china s central bank during a congressional hearing last month us trade representative robert lighthizer said we have spent a lot of time on currency and the agreement will be enforceable still how the currency deal if reached will be enforced remains unclear both sides are haggling over an enforcement mechanism for the broader trade agreement yi said both sides have discussed how they should disclose information when they buy or sell in foreign exchange markets according to rules set by the international monetary fund another point of discussion he said involves how both nations should respect the autonomy of each other s monetary policy that latter issue is of deepening concern to the pboc because it doesn t want a pledge to keep the yuan steady to tie its hands in supporting economic growth by loosening credit policy letting more yuan funds flow into the economy could pressure the value of the yuan the pboc mainly looks at domestic factors when setting monetary policy yi said the exchange rate isn t a major factor in domestic monetary policy yi also sought to temper investors expectations for more aggressive monetary easing to prop up the slowing economy a neutral monetary stance he said means that china will keep its overall leverage ratio stable in the past year the central bank cut the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve five times in a bid to unleash more funds for lenders to make loans there is still room for such reserve requirement reductions this year mr yi said though the room has narrowed he also said the central bank will continue to foster competition among banks as a way to lower lending rates but he gave no indication that any reduction in benchmark interest rates are in the cards at the end of last year credit amounted to 249 4 per cent of china s gross domestic product he said which was 1 5 percentage points lower than the level as of the end of 2017

factory has one worker who makes five pairs of shoes per day and these sell on the market for 100 each the factory makes 500 per day in sales the worker s wage is 10 an hour for a 10 hour day so the worker is paid 100 per day the worker can only afford to buy one pair of shoes even though she has made five at first this doesn t feel like a problem because obviously there are billions of people on the planet and they all need shoes the factory can definitely sell those other four pairs to someone somewhere what concerned marx was the fact that ultimately every single worker on the planet in every office and factory is paid less than the value of the goods they create it is not possible for all the goods being produced to be bought by all the workers making them in addition there is almost always a reserve army of unemployed people who can t afford to buy anything exacerbating the problem the tendency is for the system to collapse marx believed the tendency is for the system to collapse and for recessions to destroy shoe factories whose customers are too poor or not numerous enough to buy all the shoes marx believed this collapse can be staved off he argued if the shoe factory goes to great lengths for instance by investing in new technology allowing that shoe worker to double her productivity and make 10 pairs of shoes per day or maybe the same number of shoes at a lower price advertisement but the collapse is only pushed into the future new technology will be also be acquired by all the competing shoe factories squeezing profits and squeezing some factories out of business and if the factory buys shoemaking machines instead of hiring new workers then it still faces the problem of producing more shoes than can be bought by the workers making them by amazing coincidence ocasio cortez then tweeted a chart of workers pay increases compared to their productivity increases to make the point that even when labour becomes more valuable it does not share the rewards it is impossible for capitalists to pay workers the full value of their labour without going bankrupt that is a vast over simplification of marx s analysis but you get the gist marx thought capitalism was inherently unstable precisely because workers are not paid the full value of their labour and precisely because it is impossible for capitalists to pay them the full value without going bankrupt it s one of the internal contradictions that capitalism cannot resolve advertisement of course not all profits are invested in new equipment factory owners take a slice for themselves and it tends to be a much bigger slice than the workers get there are reasons for this of course it was the capitalists money that brought the factory into existence and the inevitable collapse can be avoided if the profits are diverted into a new venture like a hat factory that might create new jobs for workers who can then buy shoes whatever they do the bosses get richer than the workers now you have two sets of people both doing the same thing making shoes but being paid wildly unequal sums for doing so which is another way of saying that workers are often paid far less than the value they create as ocasio cortez tweeted aoc and the investment banks are on the same side of the debate she isn t alone in worrying about what workers get paid over the last few years a surprising number of investment bank analysts at citi hsbc and macquarie have published research that says inequality and low pay may lead to recessions or at the very least hold back economic growth which ironically even makes the rich poorer these people are not marxists obviously although like marx they are economists but like marx they are concerned that inequality in the us and the west is becoming so extreme that ordinary people won t have enough money to keep the economy going advertisement the charts in this story all show the same thing the share of national income going to the top 1 of earners is increasing while the share of income going to the bottom 50 of people is declining the rich are getting richer and the rest of us are sharing an ever smaller slice of the pie the bottom 50 of people in the us and europe now share just 13 of national income what if we run out of rich people the top 0 1 own close to 20 of all household wealth in the us according to a paper by gabriel zucman an economics professor at the university of california berkeley this is a problem the investment bank people say because there aren t enough people with money to keep capitalism ticking over income inequality is cited as another factor in the stagnation process as a few wealthy individuals cannot drive an economy by themselves citi analysts tobias m levkovich and lorraine m schmitt told their clients in 2015 two analysts at macquarie viktor shvets and perry yeung said something similar last year they cited work by moritz kuhn and moritz schurlarick published by the federal reserve of minneapolis in 2018 and by emmanuel saez and thomas piketty which said advertisement the bottom 25 of households has a negative net worth ie they are in debt the population between 25 and 50 only owns only 2 of national wealth the share of the middle class between 25 and 75 dropped from 15 in 1989 to only about 8 the top 10 control about 77 of national wealth over time the top 1 increased its share from 27 in 1989 to about 40 in 2013 in other words wealth has not just accrued to the top 10 but it went almost entirely to the top 1 they told clients the middle class creation in 1950s 70s has clearly been replaced by a middle class compression over the last three decades certainly since late 1980s if the west goes into recession the fortunes of the rich might make it worse janet henry an economist at hsbc told clients in 2018 that the accumulation of wealth by a tiny minority might actually hold the economy back income inequality suppresses consumption given the lower marginal propensity to consume of higher earners and can be negative for growth if the savings of higher earners do not push up productive investment spending but get parked in property or government bonds she wrote income inequality which often goes hand in hand with a lack of social mobility also creates disparities in life expectancy education skills levels and labour mobility that will impact on future productivity and growth potential this has implications for government revenues and their ability to fund public services and future liabilities given the huge structural factors from demographics to technology that are contributing to the growing income polarisation it is not something that will miraculously dissipate on the back of one or two years of robust growth she said worse if the west goes into recession then the fortunes of the rich will make it worse she says because the poor don t have enough money to withstand it the depth of any downturn when it finally happens could be amplified by this income and debt distribution she told clients in a note late last year in other words the richest 1 might buy a lot of shoes but they cannot possibly buy enough shoes to keep all the shoemakers employed you need workers with enough money to buy shoes too and that means as aoc tweeted last month as investment bankers have been worrying about since the 2008 financial crisis and as marx wrote 200 years ago that it is very important to consider what workers are paid in relation to the value they create advertisement this story is part of business insider s series on inequality in britain
ocasio cortez responded a living wage isnt a gift its a right workers are often paid far less than the value they create that caught my eye because it is essentially a restatement of karl marx s labour theory of value and it s not often you see that discussed in the mainstream media if all workers are paid less than the value they create then there will never be enough workers to buy the things they make advertisement prior to marx the value of any product was regarded as pretty much the same as its price in the marketplace it s how much you would pay to avoid making the product yourself according to adam smith 1723 1790 the reason you might spend 100 on a pair of shoes is because even though 100 is quite expensive it s a lot easier than making a pair of shoes by hand yourself smith said marx 1818 1883 who was a big fan of smith was more interested in how products acquire value as they come into existence a cow doesn t slaughter itself and magically transform into a pair of leather shoes that only happens because workers apply labour to the cow s corpse turning its skin into leather and then sewing that leather into shoes only after labour has been applied do shoes have any value it s the labour that creates the value not just the fact that the shoes can be traded for cash if you accept that then it becomes immediately obvious that what ocasio cortez said is correct workers in a shoe factory are paid far less than the value they create they have to be if 100 of the money from shoe sales were paid directly to the workers then the factory would go out of business there would be no money left to pay for electricity and there would be no profits to invest in more efficient shoe making machines to help the factory compete in the future but that raises a contradiction if all workers are paid less than the value they create then there will never be enough workers to buy the things they make let s say our shoe factory has one worker who makes five pairs

the legal marijuana market could be on its way 200 billion in 15 years according to beer wine and spirits giant constellation brands nyse stz if their projection is anywhere near close to correct then marijuana stocks could offer investors a shot at investing in an emerging market that could rival tobacco or alcohol someday the potential to pocket profits from pot is massive but that doesn t mean every cannabis company will be a winner many will be losers and more than a few could wind up in bankruptcy to improve the odds of picking the right cannabis stock to buy you should make sure that you know whether the company s on solid financial footing whether marijuana production is climbing whether the company s product mix is on point no 1 financial firepower canada s marijuana market represents a big market opportunity for cannabis companies but it s not nearly as large of an opportunity as the united states or major markets in europe a marijuana leaf image source getty images advertisement advertisement spending on marijuana in canada totals about 6 billion canadian per year according to statistics canada however the u s market is valued at 50 billion and global spending is an estimated 150 billion per year according to the united nations clearly capturing a significant share of canada s market as its new recreational market matures will be a boon but capturing meaningful share in america and elsewhere is more important the companies likely to benefit most from global legalization are arguably those with the deepest pockets so it s critical to continuously track changes in these companies balance sheet as a refresher a balance sheet is a financial statement that highlights a company s assets liabilities and shareholder equity evaluating changes in cash and debt can be particularly helpful in making sure you re investing in top quality companies that can capitalize on the growing market for legal cannabis for instance the industry s deepest pockets belong to canopy growth nyse cgc last year constellation brands acquired a 38 stake in canopy growth for about 4 billion giving it lots of firepower to invest in new greenhouses greenhouse automation cannabis extraction facilities and equipment product development clinical research trials and importantly new markets canopy growth has started to flex that financial muscle but it still has most of the money at its disposal in december it acquired colorado based hemp company ebbu for ca 425 million but only ca 25 million of that deal was paid for in cash the rest of the deal was stock also canopy growth announced in january plans to invest in a to be built hemp industrial park but that project is only expected to cost it 100 million to 150 million as of dec 31 canopy growth boasted over ca 4 1 billion in cash plus ca 799 million in marketable securities it can sell on its balance sheet so those investments barely dent its stockpile here are some select balance sheet items from canopy

numbers in thousands of canadian dollars no 2 pot production it s tempting to spend a lot of time considering the peak pot production figures that cannabis companies are talking about but investors should remember that those forecasts aren t written in stone plans can change so there s no guarantee a company that s forecasting production will increase from 10 000 kilos today to 100 000 kilos or more in the future will actually deliver on its promise advertisement advertisement quarterly production is a better measure to track specifically changes in kilos sold and kilos harvested is key because that shows investors whether a company is already executing on its growth strategy in ways that will allow it to make the most of canada s maturing market and new opportunities elsewhere such as in germany or the united states for example aurora cannabis nyse acb has taken a two pronged approach to increasing its marijuana capacity it s arguably been the most acquisitive pot company but it s also plowing money back into its most important greenhouses including aurora sky that approach allowed it to sell nearly 7 000 kilos of marijuana and marijuana equivalent products in the fourth

new york the bull market for u s stocks turns 10 years old this weekend which puts it way past senior citizen status for a market run it s got the scars to prove it since rising from the rubble of the financial crisis in 2009 this bull market has faced several near death experiences worries about everything from debt problems in europe to the global trade war have nearly derailed it at various points over the past decade but in each instance the market steadied itself before notching a 20 percent loss a reversal that would have turned the bull market into a bear it sustained itself even as other investments such as oil and stocks from other countries long ago fell into their own bear markets it s been one bull run but there have been stages to it said michael cuggino portfolio manager and president of permanent portfolio family of funds because of that it s been harder to kill off and it s had a better run than you d expect this bull market has rewarded the faithful with a return of more than 400 percent including dividends even investors who bought s p 500 index funds at the 2007 peak and subsequently lost more than half their money now have more than double what they started with that is as long as they resisted the urge to sell each time skeptics said the bull was ready to collapse here s a look at some of the biggest hurdles the market overcame during the last 10 years don t double dip through the first year of the bull market stocks shot nearly straight up surging about 75 percent in a little more than 12 months investors were hopeful for what s known as a v shaped recovery where the upward move would be a mirror image of the terrifying downturn that preceded it but by the spring of 2010 markets had a new concern could greece pay its bills greece s economy was small but the worry was that its debt problems could spill over into the global economy the 2008 financial meltdown had clearly and painfully demonstrated how interwoven markets had become mixed data on the u s economy also raised concerns and investors were talking about a double dip recession where the economy would fall back into contraction soon after the 2007 09 great recession the unemployment rate at the time was still above 9 percent versus 4 percent in january 2019 a chaotic week in 2011 by the summer of 2011 investors worries about europe s debt problems had spread beyond greece to spain italy and other countries around the european periphery the u s economy meanwhile was still considered fragile and the unemployment rate remained around 9 percent in august standard poor s stripped the u s government of its aaa credit rating and the wildest week in wall street s history got underway the s p 500 had swings of 4 percent on four straight days each time in a different direction the bull market nearly expired during that week at its lowest point the s p 500 had lost nearly 18 percent from a prior peak set in april of that year by october 2011 it was down 19 4 percent china takes center stage during this bull market china overtook japan to become the world s second largest economy more importantly china provided much of the momentum for a global economy that was desperate for growth following the great recession with europe struggling and japan seemingly in the doldrums u s companies increasingly depended on china s surging economy and middle class for growth at apple for example sales in the china region grew 92 percent over the company s last five fiscal years nearly double the 48 percent rate of growth for all of apple s other markets combined u s stocks buckled in the summer of 2015 and at the turn of 2016 as china s torrid growth slowed the country s economy grew 6 9 percent in 2015 a still high rate but the slowest in 25 years the price of oil was also plunging at the time which more than halved earnings for big energy companies too much of a good thing in early 2018 stocks were surging because both the economy and corporate profits looked strong but in february a report showed that workers wages rose more than economists expected that sounds like a good thing but investors grew nervous that higher labor costs would erode corporate profits it also increased the chance of the federal reserve getting more aggressive about raising interest rates to forestall a surge in inflation since the great recession low rates engineered by the fed had helped to lift corporate profits and the stock market and investors feared losing that pillar of support rates recession and trade as 2018 came to a close many fears converged to bring the bull market the closest it s come to death over the last 10 years investors were fearful the fed s policy of gradual interest rates increases would put the brakes on the u s economy china s growth was slowing and it was locked in a trade dispute with the united states other economies around the world were weakening as well by christmas eve the s p 500 had dropped 19 8 percent from its record set in september what helped pull the bull market back from the brink some of the same factors that supported the market for most of the last 10 years a helpful fed and rising corporate profits federal reserve officials have pledged to be patient in raising interest rates and s p 500 companies are wrapping up a fifth straight reporting season where profits rose by more than 10 percent over the last decade we worked through risk after risk after risk said cuggino even though u s growth was relatively anemic for several years it was still growing when most of the world was not we were the best house in a bad neighborhood
greyerz we are now in the final seconds of the global mega bubble as the world edges closer to the next crisis today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on qe and historic moves in currencies told king world news that we are now in the final seconds of the global mega bubble global euphoria coming to a disastrous end march 10 king world news egon von greyerz the world financial system has been in a euphoric state since 2009 it seems that the keynesians like krugman or the modern money theorists mmt are right after all all asset markets are near the highs and show little signs of changing direction as treasury secretary mellon said in september 1929 there is no cause to worry the high tide of prosperity will continue all that is required is more of the same medicine more credit more money printing to make a virtuous circle of eternal prosperity clearly the cassandras are all wrong with their pessimistic forecasts that never happen the greek princess had the ability to forecast the future but her curse was that nobody believed her accurate predictions link to cassandra article we modern cassandras are in the same position we are certain that the theories based on spending and borrowing to rescue the biggest debt bubble in history are totally fallacious we know that a debt problem cannot be solved by more debt no one defined it more succinctly than albert einstein we cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them listen to the greatest egon von greyerz audio interview ever by clicking here or on the image below sponsored but sadly for the world cassandra will be right this time since the party is over the time bomb below says it all contained in the red bomb are all the explosive elements that will change the history of the world any single one of these risks is sufficient to trigger a collapse of the world economy the combined explosive nature of all the risks will not only disprove mmt but create a world which will be a lot less pleasant to live in this cleansing of a sick financial system and a morally decadent world will be totally necessary to create new green shoots based on real sustainable values but the transition will create great suffering for the whole world in the final stages of a major super cycle there is a normally total lack of clarity in the thinking of world leaders but not only that there is also a total lack of leadership right now this is exactly what we have countries normally get the leaders they deserve the world is in desperate need of statesmen who can make uncomfortable decisions to get the world out of the mess it is in but looking around the world there is no statesman in any country there are countries with strong leaders like putin in russia and orban in hungary but real statesmanship does not exist anywhere look at france where macron becomes more unpopular by the day soon every frenchman will wear a yellow vest and it is already spreading to other countries the french economy and financial system are weakening and the inequality between the rich and the poor has the seeds of yet another french revolution 15x german gdp germany has been the biggest beneficiary of a weak euro but in spite of that the german economy is now deteriorating rapidly merkel s socialist policies will have disastrous effects on the german economy in coming years exacerbated by an immigration policy which will create a major economic and social disaster when deutsche bank db collapses which is probable that will have repercussions not only for german banks but for the global banking system db s derivative book of eur 50 trillion is 15x german gdp when counterparty fails the bundesbank and the ecb will need to print more fiat money than germany printed during the hyperinflationary weimar republic in addition the bundesbank and the german financial system are the biggest guarantors of the ecb and the target2 lending to southern european countries which are all likely to default on their commitments the uk leadership is extremely weak theresa may s government is irresolute and divisive they have spent 2 years trying to extricate britain from the eu this issue has totally dominated uk politics at the expense of the economy with less than 3 weeks left to brexit day the uk is nowhere nearer an agreement with the brussels elite who have consistently frustrated the process meanwhile the us is bankrupt with a currency which is living on borrowed time trump had good intentions but has been shackled by the deep state when the biggest economy in the world collapses it will have major repercussions on the world already every major country or continent in the world has problems of a magnitude that will bring each country down in addition to the above nations this carnage will engulf japan china south american countries and many more the final seconds of the global mega bubble people must understand that the world has never faced risk of this magnitude we are now in the final seconds of the global mega bubble the likes of which the world has never seen before what will happen next will be worse than the fall of the roman empire much worse than the south sea and mississippi bubbles and will create a disaster that will dwarf the great depression of the 1930s the problem is simple to define and is all based around debts and liabilities at the beginning of this century global debt was 80 trillion when the great financial crisis started in 2006 global debt had gone up by 56 to 125 trillion today it is 250 trillion 250 trillion ticking time bomb thus in this century global debt has more than trebled so far mmt seems to work just print and borrow more money and the economy will take care of itself einstein said it won t work and the laws of nature also tell us that this is a saga that will have an unhappy ending but rather than trying to figure out what the exact trigger will be it is much more important to focus on how to protect yourself financially gold has throughout history been the solution to a mismanaged economy based on deficits debts and money printing but it must be physical gold stored outside the financial system in the safest jurisdictions and vaults it is essential to have direct ownership of the gold and direct access etfs futures or part ownership of bars are not proper wealth preservation the 2 quadrillion nightmare the krugmans and mmt fans will now get more than they ever asked for because the world will soon start the biggest money printing bonanza in history bearing in mind that total debt and liabilities including derivatives are over 2 quadrillion we could easily see similar or higher amounts of money printing the recent kwn article by lundeen projects 3 000 silver and 30 000 gold those are not unrealistic targets but are most likely based on normal inflation with hyperinflation the future gold price is likely to have many more zeroes we must remember that we are holding gold primarily to preserve wealth since it is the best store of value and represents stable purchasing power but gold is likely to do better than to maintain purchasing power for the simple reason that there will be a massive shortage of physical gold when the gold paper market blows up this is why it is critical to hold physical gold bars or coins i wrote about the gold maginot line a few weeks ago which is at 1 350 this line has stopped gold since 2013 after a first attempt to break through two weeks ago we have probably finished a small correction and gold is building up momentum to break through once it starts it will go very quickly through the old high of 1 920 remember that all time highs have already been broken in many currencies and that will also be the case for gold prices in us dollars for anyone who doesn t understand the necessity of owning gold just go through the list of risks in the time bomb and once you have gone through it go through it again and again and again the list includes 3 dozen reasons why you need to hold physical gold as protection or insurance against unprecedented global risk anyone who doesn t own gold today mustn t wait for the next move up to take place that could be too late once the real move starts it will be very difficult to get hold of gold at any price at some point there will no physical gold on offer the paper gold positions of banks and futures exchanges will see to that central banks will also have major problems most of them have covertly sold their official holdings and most of what they have left they have already leased to the market that gold has gone to china india russia and all the central banks have left is an iou from a bullion bank that won t be honored china s staggering gold accumulation with a guaranteed mess in the world financial system the resulting panic in the gold market will eliminate the ability for people to protect themselves finally people need to understand that the price of gold today is as cheap as it was in 1970 at 35 and in 2000 at 270 see final chart below gold 1970 2000 2019 for those who would like to read more of egon von greyerz s fantastic

by kevin yao and yawen chen beijing reuters china s central bank on sunday pledged to further support the slowing economy by spurring loans and lowering borrowing costs following data that showed a sharp drop in february s bank lending due to seasonal factors the central bank is widely expected to ease monetary policy further this year to encourage lending especially to small and private firms vital for growth and job creation the central bank s prudent monetary policy will emphasize on counter cyclical adjustments said people s bank of china pboc governor yi gang using a phrase that implies the need to fight an economic slowdown the global economy still faces some downward pressure and china faces many risks and challenges in its economy and financial sector yi said at a press conference on the sidelines of the country s annual meeting of parliament there is still some room for the pboc to cut reserve requirement ratios rrrs although the amount of room is less compared with a few years ago yi said the pboc has cut the amount of cash that commercial banks need to set aside as reserves five times in the past year to spur lending to small businesses in the private sector the rrr for big banks is now at 13 5 percent and the ratio for small to medium size banks is at 11 5 percent yi said lending rates for small firms are still relatively elevated due to higher risk premiums and the central bank will forge ahead with reforms to lower such risk premiums high risk premiums on loans to small firms reflect commercial banks traditional reluctance to extend credit to the sector because of concerns about their creditworthiness pboc data on sunday showed new bank loans in china fell sharply in february from a record the previous month but the drop was likely due to seasonal factors while policymakers continue to press lenders to help cash strapped firms stay afloat a pull back in february s tally had been widely expected as chinese banks tend to front load loans at the beginning of the year to get higher quality customers and win market share chinese banks made 885 8 billion yuan 131 81 billion in net new yuan loans in february down sharply from a record 3 23 trillion yuan in january when several other key credit gauges also picked up modestly in response to the central bank s policy easing yi said combined january february new loans and total social financing tsf a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy could paint a more accurate picture as they showed a rise of 374 8 billion yuan and 1 05 trillion yuan from a year earlier respectively debt defaults analysts say china needs to revive weak credit growth to help head off a sharper economic slowdown this year but investors are worried about a further jump in corporate debt and the risk to banks as they relax their lending standards corporate bond defaults hit a record last year while banks non performing loan ratio notched a 10 year high pan gongsheng a vice governor at the pboc told the same briefing that china will control the amount of bond defaults in 2019 using both legal and market means pan conceded that bond defaults increased last year but the level of defaults was not high compared with china s average bad loan ratio premier li keqiang told parliament on tuesday that monetary policy would be neither too tight nor too loose li also pledged to push for market based reforms to lower real interest rates chinese policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008 09 and subsequent downturns sources have told reuters the central bank is not ready to cut benchmark interest rates just yet but is likely to cut market based rates yi said the downward trend in tsf has been initially curbed and broad m2 money supply growth will be more or less in line with nominal gross domestic product growth in 2019 yi added central bank data showed growth of outstanding tsf a rough gauge of broad credit conditions slowed to 10 1 percent in february from january s 10 4 percent versus a record low of 9 8 percent in december m2 money supply grew 8 0 percent in february from a year earlier missing forecasts the central bank data showed yi said china s macro leverage ratio or the amount of debt relative to gdp was at 249 4 percent at the end of 2018 a fall of 1 5 percentage points from a year earlier yi said analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better most economists expect a rocky first half before conditions begin to stabilize around mid year as support measures begin to have a greater impact china s economic growth is expected to cool to around 6 2 percent this year a 29 year low according to reuters polls growth slowed to 6 6 percent last year with domestic demand curbed by higher borrowing rates and tighter credit conditions and exporters hit by the escalating trade war with the united states
advertisement alexandra ocasio cortez tweeted workers are often paid far less than the value they create that is essentially a restatement of karl marx s labour theory of value the theory suggests that economies run into trouble when workers can t afford to buy the products they are making investment bank analysts at citi hsbc and macquarie are worrying over the same issue there are so few rich people and so many people sharing a declining portion of wealth that the next recession might actually be exacerbated by the inequality that low pay has created these analysts argue you can t successfully run an economy based on the spending power of a tiny number of rich people late last month us rep alexandria ocasio cortez tweeted a criticism of ivanka trump who had said she was against the idea of a guaranteed minimum wage because i don t think most americans in their heart want to be given something people want to work for what they get so i think that this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want ocasio cortez responded a living wage isn t a gift it s a right workers are often paid far less than the value they create that caught my eye because it is essentially a restatement of karl marx s labour theory of value and it s not often you see that discussed in the mainstream media if all workers are paid less than the value they create then there will never be enough workers to buy the things they make prior to marx the value of any product was regarded as pretty much the same as its price in the marketplace it s how much you would pay to avoid making the product yourself according to adam smith 1723 1790 the reason you might spend 100 on a pair of shoes is because even though 100 is quite expensive it s a lot easier than making a pair of shoes by hand yourself smith said advertisement marx 1818 1883 who was a big fan of smith was more interested in how products acquire value as they come into existence a cow doesn t slaughter itself and magically transform into a pair of leather shoes that only happens because workers apply labour to the cow s corpse turning its skin into leather and then sewing that leather into shoes only after labour has been applied do shoes have any value it s the labour that creates the value not just the fact that the shoes can be traded for cash if you accept that then it becomes immediately obvious that what ocasio cortez said is correct workers in a shoe factory are paid far less than the value they create they have to be if 100 of the money from shoe sales were paid directly to the workers then the factory would go out of business there would be no money left to pay for electricity and there would be no profits to invest in more efficient shoe making machines to help the factory compete in the future but that raises a contradiction if all workers are paid less than the value they create then there will never be enough workers to buy the things they make let s say our shoe factory has one worker who makes five pairs of shoes per day and these sell on the market for 100 each the factory makes 500 per day in sales the worker s wage is 10 an hour for a 10 hour day so the worker is paid 100 per day the worker can only afford to buy one pair of shoes even though she has made five at first this doesn t feel like a problem because obviously there are billions of people on the planet and they all need shoes the factory can definitely sell those other four pairs to someone somewhere what concerned marx was the fact that ultimately every single worker on the planet in every office and factory is paid less than the value of the goods they create it is not possible for all the goods being produced to be bought by all the workers making them in addition there is almost always a reserve army of unemployed people who can t afford to buy anything exacerbating the problem the tendency is for the system to collapse marx believed the tendency is for the system to collapse and for recessions to destroy shoe factories whose customers are too poor or not numerous enough to buy all the shoes marx believed this collapse can be staved off he argued if the shoe factory goes to great lengths for instance by investing in new technology allowing that shoe worker to double her productivity and make 10 pairs of shoes per day or maybe the same number of shoes at a lower price advertisement but the collapse is only pushed into the future new technology will be also be acquired by all the competing shoe factories squeezing profits and squeezing some factories out of business and if the factory buys shoemaking machines instead of hiring new workers then it still faces the problem of producing more shoes than can be bought by the workers making them by amazing coincidence ocasio cortez then tweeted a chart of workers pay increases compared to their productivity increases to make the point that even when labour becomes more valuable it does not share the rewards it is impossible for capitalists to pay workers the full value of their labour without going bankrupt that is a vast over simplification of marx s analysis but you get the gist marx thought capitalism was inherently unstable precisely because workers are not paid the full value of their labour and precisely because it is impossible for capitalists to pay them the full value without going bankrupt it s one of the internal contradictions that capitalism cannot resolve advertisement of course not all profits are invested in new equipment factory owners take a slice for themselves and it tends to be a much bigger slice than the workers get there are reasons for this of course it was the capitalists money that brought the factory into existence and the inevitable collapse can be avoided if the profits are diverted into a new venture like a hat factory that might create new jobs for workers who can then buy shoes whatever they do the bosses get richer than the workers now you have two sets of people both doing the same thing making shoes but being paid wildly unequal sums for doing so which is another way of saying that workers are often paid far less than the value they create as ocasio cortez tweeted aoc and the investment banks are on the same side of the debate she isn t alone in worrying about what workers get paid over the last few years a surprising number of investment bank analysts at citi hsbc and macquarie have published research that says inequality and low pay may lead to recessions or at the very least hold back economic growth which ironically even makes the rich poorer these people are not marxists obviously although like marx they are economists but like marx they are concerned that inequality in the us and the west is becoming so extreme that ordinary people won t have enough money to keep the economy going advertisement the charts in this story all show the same thing the share of national income going to the top 1 of earners is increasing while the share of income going to the bottom 50 of people is declining the rich are getting richer and the rest of us are sharing an ever smaller slice of the pie the bottom 50 of people in the us and europe now share just 13 of national income what if we run out of rich people the top 0 1 own close to 20 of all household wealth in the us according to a paper by gabriel zucman an economics professor at the university of california berkeley this is a problem the investment bank people say because there aren t enough people with money to keep capitalism ticking over income inequality is cited as another factor in the stagnation process as a few wealthy individuals cannot drive an economy by themselves citi analysts tobias m levkovich and lorraine m schmitt told their clients in 2015 two analysts at macquarie viktor shvets and perry yeung said something similar last year they cited work by moritz kuhn and moritz schurlarick published by the federal reserve of minneapolis in 2018 and by emmanuel saez and thomas piketty which said advertisement the bottom 25 of households has a negative net worth ie they are in debt the population between 25 and 50 only owns only 2 of national wealth the share of the middle class between 25 and 75 dropped from 15 in 1989 to only about 8 the top 10 control about 77 of national wealth over time the top 1 increased its share from 27 in 1989 to about 40 in 2013 in other words wealth has not just accrued to the top 10 but it went almost entirely to the top 1 they told clients the middle class creation in 1950s 70s has clearly been replaced by a middle class compression over the last three decades certainly since late 1980s if the west goes into recession the fortunes of the rich might make it worse janet henry an economist at hsbc told clients in 2018 that the accumulation of wealth by a tiny minority might actually hold the economy back income inequality suppresses consumption given the lower marginal propensity to consume of higher earners and can be negative for growth if the savings of higher earners do not push up productive investment spending but get parked in property or government bonds she wrote income inequality which often goes hand in hand with a lack of social mobility also creates disparities in life expectancy education skills levels and labour mobility that will impact on future productivity and growth potential this has implications for government revenues and their ability to fund public services and future liabilities given the huge structural factors from demographics to technology that are contributing to the growing income polarisation it is not something that will miraculously dissipate on the back of one or two years of robust growth she said worse if the west goes into recession then the fortunes of the rich will make it worse she says because the poor don t have enough money to withstand it the depth of any downturn when it finally happens could be amplified by this income and debt distribution she told clients in a note late last year in other words the richest 1 might buy a lot of shoes but they cannot possibly buy enough shoes to keep all the shoemakers employed you need workers with enough money to buy shoes too and that means as aoc tweeted last month as investment bankers have been worrying about since the 2008 financial crisis and as marx wrote 200 years ago that it is very important to consider what workers are paid in relation to the value they create advertisement this story is part of business insider s series on inequality in britain

civilians or to be suspended from the grouping the tmc took over after president omar al bashir was ousted on april 11 any suspension of sudan s au membership could affect the tmc s efforts to win international recognition as the country s legitimate rulers during an interim period of up to two years and thus delay any aid to the country that has been trying to cope with a dire economic crisis

and a western diplomat head had earlier said that the tmc wanted a period of three to six months to continue its discussions with protesters and opposition groups to hammer out an agreement on how to run the transitional period the tmc has resisted pressure to hand power to civilians but has said it was ready to accept a civilian government of technocrats to run the country during an interim period of up to two years that would prepare for a presidential election but protesters say the proposal would leave ultimate power in the hands of the military demanding that the ruling council be staffed by civilians with military representation reuters april 18 2019 us backs calls for civilian led transition the united states has reiterated its call for the military to handover power to a

eur usd the pair collapsed on thursday march 7 after the ecb announced that it was not worth waiting for the increase in interest rates this autumn the earliest when this can happen is 2020 in addition it became known that the european regulator plans to launch ltro long term refinancing operation in september a program to refinance european banks at low interest rates if we add the reduction in forecasts for gdp and inflation to this as well as statistics on foreign trade of china that are not the best for the eurozone the picture for the european currency is rather sad as a result by mid friday the pair slipped to the values of summer 2017 1 1175 literally jumping out of the medium term corridor 1 1215 1 1570 however data on the us labor market published on march 8 nfp allowed the bulls to turn the trend up after the number of new jobs amounted to 311k in january it was expected that in february this figure would be equal to 180k in reality the result turned out to be many times worse only 20k which made it possible to once again talk about stagnation in the us economy and to return the pair to the level of 1 1235 gbp usd as expected by most analysts 60 on the eve of the re vote in the uk parliament on the eu deal which should occur on march 12 the pound continued its decline losing about 200 points in a week and reaching values in the 1 3000 zone usd jpy recall that last week about 20 of the oscillators on h4 and d1 already gave signals this pair was overbought which allowed us to expect a fairly strong downward correction this is what happened in reality the yen almost won back the losses of the last week of february and ended the five day period at the level of 111 15 cryptocurrencies bitcoin has been slowly and not very confidently but still growing for the last month and a half somebody of course may have some hopes out of the growth of 16 but if you look at the chart it is clearly visible that any efforts of the bulls immediately meet with active resistance from the bears who categorically do not want to release the main cryptocurrency beyond the 15 week highs therefore it is still possible to talk about the consolidation of btc in the 3 900 zone as for the capitalization of the crypto market here everything looks quite prosaic and monotonous starting from the end of december its volumes fluctuate in a fairly narrow range from 110 billion to 135 billion not counting a one time surge to 141 billion of the top altcoins litecoin ltc usd has shown the most visible growth having added almost 90 in a month and a half for ethereum eth usd this indicator looks much more modest plus 30 while for ripple xrp usd the increase was only 10 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following the week march 11 to 15 will literally be filled with events each of which can not only cause an increase in volatility but also lead to a change in the trends direction so on monday march 11 a meeting of eurozone finance ministers will be held in brussels and on the same day in the evening the data on the us retail sales control group will become known which according to forecasts may slightly strengthen the dollar tuesday will also see the publication of economic statistics from the united states this time it will be the consumer price index attention should be paid to the speech of the head of the federal reserve j powell on monetary policy on wednesday we are expecting a report on the uk budget as well as statistics on retail sales and industrial production in china on thursday we will learn what is happening with consumer prices in germany and on friday we will hear haruhiko kuroda s comment on the prospects for the monetary policy of the bank of japan but all these rather important events fade before what should happen on tuesday march 12 in the capital of the united kingdom it is on this day that a second vote will be held in the british parliament on the terms of brexit and in the event of another failure of prime minister may lawmakers will be able to vote on march 13 to postpone the negotiations and postpone brexit to a later date theoretically even a second referendum on the exit of the uk from the eu is not excluded these votes can affect not only the quotes of the major world currencies but also the future of the world economy as a whole in the meantime analysts opinions are as follows eur usd 60 of experts supported by almost 90 of oscillators and trend indicators expect the euro to further fall to the 1 1100 1 1125 zone it should be noted that in the transition to the forecast for the second half of march 60 of analysts are already siding with the bulls waiting for the pair to return to level 1 1400 1 1500 gbp usd 65 of the experts have now voted for the decline of the pair to the level of 1 2850 1 2900 however in the transition to longer term forecasts as well as in the case of the euro the majority 60 expects the british currency to strengthen and rise to the maximum of february 1 3350 and then 200 points higher usd jpy despite the fall of the pair last week it remains within the ascending channel which began at the very beginning of january 2019 that is why 60 of analysts supported by graphical analysis on d1 believe that the pair will overcome the bar at 112 00 after which it is expected to move in the side channel 112 25 113 70 as it was last november december the alternative point of view is supported by 40 of experts who believe that the pair has not yet reached its local bottom which is in the zone of 109 70 110 10 cryptocurrencies there is a saying many men many minds a well known crypto trader and one of the top authors on tradingview under the pseudonym magicpoopcannon has conducted a survey among his followers on twitter asking them to give an answer regarding the long term price of bitcoin about 3 thousand subscribers took part in the voting according to their answers the majority 42 believes that over the next four years the price of bitcoin will be in the interval between 100 000 and 1 million 30 called a number between 20 000 and 100 000 13 in the range from 3 000 to 20 000 and 15 predicted this cryptocurrency the darkest future calling the range from 0 to 3 000 as for the forecast for the near future according to most experts the btc usd pair will most likely continue to move in the 3 600 4 300 range waiting for some really serious news that will help break through the boundaries of this channel in any direction

the move has been looked at politically rather than through the prism of economics second it has not always been seen as preparatory to the gst the real test will lie in the ls verdict this writer saw a glimpse or two of demonetisation way back in early 1946 as a nine year old we had moved to calcutta now kolkata less than two years before that one evening my father came home and promptly showed my mother two large currency notes with a portrait of king george vi the like of which the writer had never seen before each was worth a thousand rupees my father explained how he was offered five such notes at rs 600 each only and he declined thinking it was illegal eventually his office colleague thrust two of them into his jacket s pocket he brought that home the next day he was meant to go to the bank which would give him new rs 1 000 notes in exchange my father went on to explain that during world war ii which had ended in august 1945 many a trader had profiteered by selling war materials for american as well as british troops who had been deployed on the burma now myanmar front the suppliers made money but did not always pay taxes the british indian government therefore decided to demonetise the thousand rupee note since then this writer has not been unfamiliar with the process the year 1946 is too long ago but in 1978 79 too the janata party government of morarji desai had demonetised high value notes but the measure was so half hearted that most people cannot remember it even this writer cannot recollect the details in contrast the modi government s action has had an enormous impact though it took time for many people to comprehend what exactly were the implications but most who had stocks of untaxed cash lost their money those who could not find a way out deposited it in the bank on the fair assumption that they would sort it out with the income tax officer at the time of assessment with or without penalty a kolkata person who reportedly had rs 7 000 crore could have done the same unless his cash was gained not only from an untaxed source but also from a dubious earning like smuggling this writer discovered how unusual the move was on the evening when prime minister narendra modi announced his step with regard to the demonetisation of rs 500 and rs 1 000 notes the writer and one of the most informed veteran journalists were dining at a club when the announcement was made but that gentleman needed to be explained the implications those who had bundles and bundles of unaccounted notes of the two denominations lost heavily that night one person was rumoured to have become poorer by rs 7 000 crore in one stroke many small holders managed to change their notes at a discount of between 20 and 50 per cent with the help of brokers who had connections with willing bank managers this was one of the several mismanagements reported against the government another was the delay at many banks of new supply of currency the rest was the loss of money by the middle class to upper class holders some felt gravely upset and sinned against for being suddenly deprived of their hard earned money they were right except that they overlooked that they had not paid income tax on the money they lost the first reaction this writer heard of was from three of his acquaintances a teacher a technocrat and a businessman each one of them stood to lose up to rs 50 lakh which were lying in the house or a safe deposit locker they all swore against the government on the other hand the average lower middle class and poorer people were vicariously happy that the rich people have been hit for their ill gotten wealth until then their impression was that only the poor get punished while the rich get away with the help of their influence and wealth the real stunning effect was that a great deal of informal euphemism for black money ceased to be legal tender most of it went into the banks in the process for a few days to a couple of months parts of over 85 per cent of the currency notes rs 500 and rs 1 000 became non legal tender immediately there was a liquidity crunch also because of the delay in supply of new notes except for rs 2 000 notes others were not printed for reasons of secrecy how much of the secrecy was for a dramatic effect and how much was to prevent transfer of cash by the big holders were a matter of conjecture but one thing was certain that demonetisation was a stinging message against black money as never before in india it was also a warning that more steps were coming sure enough the goods and services tax gst was on the anvil for those not emotionally involved could understand that a digital or just a modern economy could not exist on two parallel money streets one white and bankable and the other black and not bankable one which proposes to be taxable and the other which evades tax from start to finish the latter would continually undercut the former because it would always be cheaper those opposed to demonetisation keep calling the latter informal instead of black even well known economists and scholars talk in these terms possibly they are being considerate to a great portion of yesteryear traders in our country this writer s personal experience is interesting my company manufactures toothbrushes whose sales shot up by over 50 per cent on the morrow of demonetisation and more so after the introduction of gst the explanation was that his competition in the cheaper varieties was taking no notice of taxation with the changes several of the competitors stopped manufacturing there is no doubt that the so called informal sector has been stunned liquidity had shrunk while new currency notes were being printed once they came into full flow there was no such problem the only difference was that black money has to be spent whereas money in the bank is usually spent with care and caution the reported reduced consumer demand is due to the comparative reduction in superfluous spending there are several other countries which have demonetised their currency including the uk and australia so has pakistan zimbabwe had done something unique it abolished its own currency and replaced it with the us dollar yet other countries are north korea myanmar nigeria and ghana by and large they have not benefitted not because of demonetisation per se but due to the lack of any improvement in financial management whenever the government faced a shortage of funds its banks resorted to printing notes to meet its expenditure regrettably demonetisation in india has been looked at politically rather than with the help of economic logic second it has not always been seen as preparatory to the gst which makes trading with black money almost impossible moreover paying gst means also exposing one s turnover to the income tax authorities for those who were used to tax free trading these measures are doubly painful its impact on the general elections remains to be seen the writer is a well known columnist and an author

advertisement this is the time for freedom lovers to sound the alarm on the dangers of giving government more power over the economy during an appearance on an international business news network legendary economist thomas sowell said he wouldn t bet on people resisting the siren song of socialism adding fuel to the fire economist peter schiff warned his podcast audience recently that the world was borrowing itself broke and that a global recession was all but guaranteed on tv schiff also warned that the coming global financial crisis would usher in more socialism but as global central banks signal they may mess around with the balance sheets and interest rates once again to keep their economies from collapsing the public still seems blissfully unaware of the gravity of the coming crisis as we learn that net worths have fallen to levels only seen during the 2008 global financial crisis the public might finally begin to worry about the future wif only to pressure elected officials to stop meddling with their economies but then maybe things might get even worse and we ll see a complete change in the overall mood with many economies in disarray socialist and socialism friendly politicians could gain significant ground in the coming years or even months and in 2020 we could see us president donald trump losing to someone like democratic socialist senator bernie sanders advertisement so many people today including in the leading universities don t pay much attention to evidence sowell said when you see people starving in venezuela and fleeing into neighboring countries and realize that this is a country that once had the world s largest oil reserves you realize that they ve ruined a very good prospect with ideas that sounded good but didn t turn out well this transformation of the venezuelan economy has been on the make since 1999 when president hugo chavez promised to snuff out imperialism and inequality all through the implementation of a heavily planned state run economy by banking on people s anger toward a government that had been inflating the currency and therefore destroying the purchasing power of the venezuelan bolivar chavez promised things were going to be better but under his and his protege s rule monetary inflation skyrocketed with the price hikes that followed the nation went into crisis president nicolas maduro responded by freezing prices and ordering six minimum wage hikes during 2018 but despite all these policies things only got worse as millions of venezuelans flee due to hunger and flat out despair us lawmakers like representative alexandria ocasio cortez suggest just printing more money to pay for their policies they fail to see how this type of policy would lead to the disaster we re seeing in venezuela and will often argue that having a planned economy isn t that big of a deal but it is precisely this careless approach to monetary policy that has brought us to the mess we re about to experience as the us federal reserve announces that americans net worth dropped to 104 3 trillion as the year came to an end a decrease of 3 73 trillion from the third quarter we also learn that young people are failing to pay off their debt even though they continue to sign up for more loans on a whim as these very millennials notice they are broke and things are only getting worse they might undoubtedly listen to people like cortez and think they have what it takes to make their lives better the rest as they say would be history and when the us sneezes the rest of the world catches cold if anything this is the time for freedom lovers to sound the alarm on the dangers of giving government more power over the economy eric jurado gmail com

students on campus at tunxis community college in farmington credit ctmirror file photo julius dancy s parents couldn t afford to send him to a four year college his high school grades he admits weren t great so he didn t qualify for merit scholarships but dancy lives in tennessee where since 2014 the state has promised free community college for young people who enroll full time do eight hours of community service a semester and earn a c average dancy 18 is now in his first year studying business at southwest tennessee community college in memphis the state s tuition free college program made college possible for him he said i wouldn t have been able to go to college without southwest offering the things that they do he said in an interview with stateline as for many of his high school classmates he added i know for a fact that they wouldn t have been able to go to college without the tennessee promise programs such as tennessee s have caught the public imagination at least 15 states some led by republicans others by democrats now cover two year or four year college tuition for some students lawmakers in 23 states are floating free college bills this year and several high profile democratic presidential candidates want to not only make college tuition free but also eliminate student loan debt but policymakers are sparring over who should get aid and how much critics on the left want to expand free college to more students and cover more than tuition they argue that in many states program dollars flow to wealthier students and don t defray expenses such as textbooks course fees and transportation critics on the right worry that universal free college programs fail to prepare students for the workforce some also warn against creating expensive new entitlement programs in michigan democratic gov gretchen whitmer s call this year to increase scholarship aid and make community college tuition free was coolly received by the republican led legislature in remarks to reporters senate majority leader mike shirkey said he s not sure that the high cost of college is the problem i think value is and we don t do a good enough job measuring value he said that is ensuring that college degrees pay off whitmer s goal to ensure that 60 percent of michigan adults have a college credential by 2030 he said is pretty much meaningless what if all those achievements were in underwater basket weaving budget constraints often force lawmakers to scale back their free college plans we re seeing more and more narrowly tailored programs that aren t really billable as the universal free college said sarah pingel senior policy analyst at education commission of the states the nonprofit arm of an interstate compact on education policy a promise to students free college programs date back decades indiana for example has offered some students full scholarships since the 1990s but they began to multiply in the years after the great recession as college debt soared and forecasters predicted that most future jobs would require advanced training offerings range from city programs funded by private donors to state grants for workforce oriented degrees and in new york s case a four year scholarship that converts to a loan if recipients leave the state after graduation but perhaps the best known example is the tennessee promise which attracted lots of media attention when it was signed into law and inspired a flurry of copycat programs the grant for recent high school graduates covers any last community college tuition and mandatory fee dollars not already covered by other grants such as the federal pell grant for low income students and tennessee s merit scholarship it s known as a last dollar funding model in 2015 the first year of the program community colleges enrolled almost a quarter more recent high school graduates and almost half of the new enrollees didn t get any promise dollars because they qualified for other grants enrollment has jumped in other states with similar last dollar programs we have seen a significant boost in this post high school population said sara enright vice president for student affairs at the community college of rhode island and i think it s because when you put out a free college banner it s just a simple message that draws people in in 2016 the year before the rhode island promise program began 1 100 recent high school graduates enrolled in the state s community college by last fall that group s enrollment had more than doubled most states attach strings to free college programs such as requiring students to attend full time that s helped boost graduation rates in rhode island where enright expects 18 percent of the first rhode island promise cohort to graduate after two years in community college triple the typical graduation rate most ccri students attend part time promise students in tennessee also graduate at higher rates than their peers but the students who receive the most promise aid mostly men who don t qualify for need based or merit aid are the least successful just 11 percent of such students in the program s first cohort completed a degree or certificate in five semesters compared with about 20 percent of promise students overall the director of policy at the tennessee board of regents office of policy and strategy amy moreland said such students are more likely than other students in the promise program to graduate with a technical certificate that prepares them for a specific job a promise to students free college programs date back decades

with about 20 percent of promise students overall the director of policy at the tennessee board of regents office of policy and strategy amy moreland said such students are more likely than other students in the promise program to graduate with a technical certificate that prepares them for a specific job the free college concept has become so popular particularly within the democratic party that some states have rebranded existing financial aid programs to include the word promise that language mirrors the college promise campaign a nonpartisan nonprofit announced by then president barack obama in 2015 generous state financial aid has allowed californians to attend two year colleges for free for decades but in 2017 the state community college chancellor s office renamed a longstanding grant for low income students as the california college promise grant that was a clear renaming of an existing program in order to capitalize on some of the free college momentum across the country said debbie cochrane executive vice president of the institute for college access and success an education nonprofit with offices in oakland california and washington d c separately california lawmakers last year passed legislation that freed up more money for two year colleges to spend either on tuition aid or on services that might help students graduate or defray other costs such as textbooks democratic gov gavin newsom wants to add 40 million this year defining free but four year colleges and universities worry that such programs could hurt their finances if a significantly higher number of students attend a community college as opposed to going to a four year college it could possibly weaken the four year college funding model said tom harnisch director of state relations and policy analysis at the american association of state colleges and universities that s because freshman and sophomore year lectures crammed with hundreds of students are a money maker for universities that help subsidize smaller upper division seminars he said even community college students who transfer to four year schools usually enter as juniors meaning they miss those lucrative large lectures and paying for free college has been a challenge for lawmakers tennessee unique among states has an endowment comprised of lottery reserve funds that pays for tennessee promise the program cost about 30 million last school year lawmakers created a similar grant for working adults two years ago budget limitations this year could table proposals to expand free college in oregon and new jersey lack of funds in 2017 led oregon colleges to temporarily restrict eligibility for oregon promise some conservatives argue that free college programs pass along increasingly high costs to taxpayers the state level programs for free community college or free four year college have the same underlying problem which is they don t address the root causes of tuition inflation said mary clare amselem a policy analyst at the heritage foundation a think tank based in washington d c she also questioned the push to encourage students to attend community college given that many have dismal graduation rates twenty four percent of first time students graduate from public two year colleges in three years while 60 percent of first time students graduate from public four year programs in six years according to federal statistics lawmakers might want to consider spending money on high school vocational training or apprenticeships instead amselem said we should have multiple pathways and options to career success meanwhile some left leaning groups have criticized free college programs for spending money on wealthier students and failing to address costs of attendance beyond tuition tiffany jones director of higher education policy at the education trust a national nonprofit focused on promoting equity in education analyzed the 13 free college programs active in 2017 and found eight used a last dollar model like tennessee s that meant obviously that there was no financial benefit for the lowest income students she said programs that only offer aid to low income students such as maryland s or provide promise aid before other grants allowing total aid to exceed tuition costs as oklahoma and california do promote equity by directing more aid toward students who need it most jones said and many grants promoted as free college don t actually cover the full cost of going to college she said media coverage of oregon s free college program can be misleading said juan baez arevalo head of oregon s office of student access and completion it s not free he said of the grant the oregon promise program covers community college tuition but not course fees textbooks transportation or room and board those other costs can outpace tuition costs at central oregon community college for instance a student living locally and studying full time would owe about 2 376 a year in tuition but add college fees books transportation and living expenses and cost of attendance balloons to an estimated 13 764 if the student lives at home with her parents the perception that free college is just a middle class handout has made some education advocacy groups reluctant to support the policy even in states such as new jersey where democratic gov phil murphy is trying to target aid to the neediest students including working adults studying part time sometimes i just think support is influenced by that national rhetoric that doesn t align with values we have here said new jersey higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis some mayors around the country are now afraid that if they start a free college program they ll face criticism for not making aid generous enough said krissy dealejandro executive director of tnachieves a privately funded nonprofit that supports the tennessee promise program by among other things training and recruiting volunteer mentors i think that s stifling she said when are you sacrificing the great for the perfect dealejandro said that while more well off students might receive more promise money the average award in spring 2017 was 1 011 lower income students can receive more non tuition support such as academic advising and coaching provided by her nonprofit dancy said that support for tennessee promise participants such as mentors advisers and reminder emails and texts has helped him stay on track when his grades fell this semester he was instantly surrounded by adults pointing him toward tutoring resources and reminding him to stay focused to me it doesn t even feel like it s a scholarship he said it feels like more of a family thing stateline is an initiative of the pew charitable trusts
trump s twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party namely that they re both dishonest and ignorant republicans hate deficits or at least that s what they claim republicans in congress spent the entire obama administration inveighing against budget deficits warning incessantly that we were going to have a greek style fiscal crisis any day now president donald trump on the other hand focused his ire mainly on trade deficits insisting that our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us but over two years of unified gop control of government a funny thing happened both deficits surged the budget deficit has hit a level unprecedented except during wars and in the immediate aftermath of major economic crises the trade deficit in goods has set a record do you have something to say share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email letters seattletimes com and please include your full name address and telephone number for verification only letters are limited to 200 words what s the significance of this tide of red ink let s be clear neither the budget deficit nor the trade deficit poses a clear and present danger to the u s economy advanced countries that borrow in their own currencies can and often do run up large debts without drastic consequences which is why the debt panic of a few years ago was always nonsense yet trump s twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party namely that they re both dishonest and ignorant about the dishonesty is there anyone left who believes that republicans ever really cared about debt and deficits the truth is that the phoniness of their fiscal posturing should have been obvious all along in any case at this point it s undeniable that their fire and brimstone debt rhetoric was nothing but a pose an attempt to weaponize the deficit as a way to block and undermine president barack obama s agenda the moment they had a chance the very politicians who grandstanded about the need for fiscal responsibility rammed through a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy a tax cut that is the main reason for the exploding budget deficit oh and the tax cut has utterly failed to deliver the promised investment boom companies didn t use their giant windfall to build new plants and raise productivity they used it to buy back a lot of stock passing the gains on to wealthy investors what about the ignorance as many people have pointed out to no avail trump is all wrong about what trade deficits do true at times of high unemployment deficits can cost us jobs but in normal times they don t reduce overall employment nor do they make us poorer on the contrary other countries are sending us valuable goods and services which we re paying for with pieces of paper paper that pays very low interest rates who s winning again beyond that however trump is completely wrong about what causes trade deficits in the first place in fact his own policies have provided an object lesson in the falsity of his vision in the trumpian universe trade deficits happen because we made bad deals we let foreigners sell their stuff here but they won t let us sell our stuff there so the solution is to throw up barriers to foreign products i am a tariff man he proudly proclaimed the reality however is that trade deficits have almost nothing to do with tariffs or other restrictions on trade the overall trade deficit is always equal to the difference between domestic investment spending and domestic saving both private and public that s just accounting the reason america runs persistent trade deficits isn t that we ve given away too much in trade deals it s that we have low savings compared with other countries tariffs can of course reduce imports of the goods subject to the tariff and hence reduce the trade deficit in that particular industry but it s like pushing on a balloon you can squeeze it in one place but it will just inflate by the same amount somewhere else the process through which this conservation of deficits takes place can vary although a stronger dollar which hurts exports is usually one major channel but the basic result that tariffs don t actually reduce the overall trade deficit is clear sure enough the trump tariffs of 2018 did in fact lead to a sharp fall in imports of the goods subjected to tariffs but imports of other goods rose while exports performed poorly and the overall trade deficit went up substantially which is exactly what you should have expected after all that big tax cut for the wealthy reduced national savings and the supposed cause of the deficit isn t the only thing trump gets wrong about trade policy he also keeps insisting that foreigners are paying his tariffs in reality prices received by foreign exporters haven t gone down prices paid by u s consumers have gone up instead again the swelling trade deficit doesn t pose any immediate threat to the u s economy and even the trumpian trade war has probably done only limited economic harm the main damage is to u s credibility but trump s twin deficits show that his party has been lying about its policy priorities and that he is completely clueless about his signature policy issue luckily a great nation like america can survive a lot including dishonesty and ignorance at the top

colleagues q4 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc watch cnbc s full interview with larry kudlow following weak jobs data carl quintanilla back to today s other big story of course job creation really grinded to a halt in february labor department says nonfarm payrolls is up just 20k that s the worst month since september of 2017 even as the unemployment rates drops to 3 8 joining us with the reaction from the white house today national economic council director larry kudlow larry great to have you back good morning larry kudlow good morning carl you know i was there in the roman empire it wasn t all that great we should really put have some perspective on it carl quintanilla you in the robes i ve got to see pics or it didn t happen larry help us understand 20 000 how did this happen larry kudlow i think it is a very flukey number it is interesting that 20 000 there the household employment number from which unemployment comes was up 255 which is a great number the unemployment rate fell right 2 from 4 to 3 8 wages were up actually a big wage number year on year 3 4 look i think you have timing issues with respect to the government shutdown winter seasonal issues very flukey i wouldn t pay attention to it to be honest with you jim cramer well larry it is jim i want to i totally share your view i want to be able to defend the number as a way to be able to say there was weather and this time you really got to take weather seriously but i wonder larry at what point are some of these woes from overseas are we importing i know we re going to import a lot from that deficit number but are we importing brexit are we importing worries in germany are we importing the issues that are hurting china because i don t want those to impact us because they don t necessarily reflect anything other than united states being a little more ascendant than they are larry kudlow look well that last point is an important point we re the fastest growing economy in the world from the major economies and you mentioned europe the united states is buying goods we are really the only source of stimulus i mean let s take europe it s a big trading partner so we re buying we re importing their consumer goods importing their capital goods we re importing their manufacturing goods and that s you know they need that demand if it weren t for us they would be in worse shape probably negative across the board they can keep throwing money at it as mr draghi is now more easy money lending to the banks that s not going to do it they have been doing this for years they need changes in their labor regulations they need lower marginal tax rates et cetera et cetera we are the source of stimulus we are the hottest economy in the world and we are expensing despite the silly flukey number we are on a roll and i m going to say that the outlook for the american economy is still 3 growth plus david faber really that s that was my question larry you called a silly flukey number so you don t believe it is reflective of all of a slowdown in growth larry kudlow no i don t think it is reflective of anything except you have timing issues and scoring issues and eligibility issues and lousy winter seasonal issues again this is all going to be revised up you can use a three month moving average i think jobs are about 190 000 plus look at the house hold survey that s where the unemployment rates come from that thing was up if i have it right 255 000 so your unemployment rate comes down from 4 to 3 8 and your wage numbers are up i believe 4 3 4 year on year those are really really big numbers and again you may not see it in this month monthly data is monthly data there s a lot of noise but the trend lines are so important the biggest factor in the growth of jobs in the past year is guess what women women have come back into the labor force i don t know what the number is 50 something percent 57 or 58 of the new entrants in the labor force from women that s a big turnaround from the last 15 or 16 years and then of course as we ve discussed on this show blue collar blue collar employment manufacturing autos and so forth fastest gains since the 80s and the blue collar wages are rising faster than the white collar wages i m not saying higher i m just saying faster these are great things and by the way one last number i just want to put this in the best number i ve seen all week productivity output per hour that is the ultimate growth driver in our economy at least productivity is up 1 8 for the last four quarters in 2018 that s a big number because that thing had been flat zero or near zero for many years that tells you a number of things okay i think that lower tax rates and deregulation is working but it shows you that money is being invested businesses are investing new equipment new campuses new everything new robots you were talking about ai before that s a big number 1 8 productivity growth changes the whole potential of the economy to grow it is a terrific number much more important than today s payroll number jim cramer alright so larry i like that i likethe women that s important for the international women s day of course the participation is terrific but at what point larry can we say things are good here things have slowed down in china down 20 in that for heaven s sake and a remarkable number at what point do you go to the president and say listen you know we got plenty of time don t have to hurry this we re winning they re losing larry kudlow well look we have come a long way in those talks i m not sure i have any new news to add particularly we are still negotiating by phone and teleconference the documents from two weeks ago advanced enormously that s why the president is optimistic about the potential for a deal we re still looking at the structural issues we re looking at the enforcement issues we re looking at the commodity issues i don t want to hang a timetable on this ambassador lighthizer is doing the best he can there may be a meeting down in florida in mar a lago between the two leaders maybe late this month or early next month nothing in cement but there s a lot of talk about a meeting they re moving along very nicely they re moving along very nicely and they re covering more ground than ever before and look jimmy you re right china s economy there s two things going on here one is the business cycle is lousy the recent data is lousy the stock market has come back this year but it had been performing very badly but there is a long term problem here china had been departing from its market based reforms that helped them grow in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s they ve been moving in the wrong direction they ve been moving away to a more authoritarian economy and political story that s hurt them direct investment has slowed down enormously and they ve had to fight to keep the yuan renminbi steady now we have hurt them i think president trump s negotiating strategy tough aggressive tariffs are part of his strategy so they have come to the negotiating table to talk about more things more seriously than ever before so you re right we have them over a barrel on the other hand we would like a good deal both countries should benefit but i must say as the president has said and he s very serious if we don t get a good deal for the united states and its workforce and its blue collar people and its ranchers and its technology you know they got stop stealing our technology if we don t get a good deal then we won t get a good deal and you saw him walk away from north korea i m just saying that s a directive moment it could apply to trade i m not forecasting i m just saying it has got to be a good deal for the usa carl quintanilla and if it is not larry if you do walk then what are we left with i mean tariffs go to 25 trade deficit continues to grow our budget deficit continues to rise 70 year on year then what larry kudlow well i don t want to do what ifs because i m not predicting that we ll walk away i m just saying the president made it clear how tough a negotiator he can be the tariffs were one illustration of that and the north korean i call it a directive moment is another i m not suggesting that s going to happen i m not here to announce that i don t want anyone to misinterpret we are actually all in the senior government we are all relatively optimistic but again our conditions have to be met and there have to be big changes in the ip theft you know this issue as well as we do in the force transfer of technology in the ownership provisions and in the enforcement provisions but having said that carl we have a lot of really good stuff on the table the documents are very good i m not here to reveal the details but i m just saying we have come further than any time before and it is pretty good stuff so i don t want to sound like a bear i m actually rather a bull on it but i m saying if it doesn t measure up and it goes to jim s point if it doesn t measure up the united states will stick to its guns believe me on that david faber larry carl mentioned the budget deficit you were on this with us last friday i didn t mention it i like to get to it every other kudlow appearance 310 billion for first four months of the year you know running close to that trillion dollar number in an economy that is strong to your point which makes people wonder what is going to happen if the economy weakens in terms of our ability to deal with that kind of a deficit if we re generating that much now larry kudlow alright david did you say in an economy that is soft david faber no i said strong larry kudlow oh thank you no no thank you i appreciate that little ear trouble look ay the budget is coming out next week i believe omb will publish its budget what you ll see is a study glide path towards lower deficits as a share of gdp and the very tough spending outline 5 spend and reduction domestic spending across the board it s just what the doctor ordered we don t want government spending to interfere with economic growth so you ll see a pretty steady downward glide path on this point whatever your villain is in the deficits let me say even the cbo with which we generally disagree i m not breaking news here on my part but they just published their new numbers you know from the point of pretax cut to now we have had about 7 trillion unexpected increase 7 trillion over 10 years in terms of gdp and that kind of calculates to roughly 1 2 1 3 trillion in additional revenue that s the cbo numbers these are all ten year estimates i apologize for that but that s the convention so what am i saying here the tax cut was about 1 5 trillion scored we have virtually paid for it i guess 8 0 paid for it and that s by the cbo s own numbers so our growth estimates as you can expect will be faster they re closer to 2 we re sticking with 3 i think what we did was we borrowed in the short run to make a great investment in the economy through tax cuts that investment is paying off growth productivity higher wages and now we will recoup that investment and the books are going to gradually look better and better as the share of gdp that s the way this thing should work and i think that s the way it is already working carl quintanilla larry chinese foreign minister appeared to applaud huawei for filing their suit should investors see huawei as a wild card in trade talks larry kudlow i don t want to get into any details on that one for sure the huawei issue is a complicated issue it is really not a trade issue i mean if you listen to ambassador lighthizer we regard that more as a legal issue at least at the moment i know it is part of the overall landscape carl but i don t want to really comment on that there is a legal process that is going on it may enter into trade i don t want to make any predictions let me just set huawei aside for the moment carl quintanilla okay larry appreciate the time as always larry kudlow thank you

washington the pace of hiring in the united states fell last month to its lowest point in nearly a year and a half a surprise drop likely reflecting harsh weather and other temporary factors that led most economists to see the slowdown as a temporary blip employers added just 20 000 jobs down from a blockbuster 311 000 in january even with february s anemic gain job growth over the past three months has averaged a solid 186 000 enough to lower the unemployment rate over time and average hourly pay surged 3 4 percent from a year earlier the sharpest year over year increase in a decade the unemployment rate also dropped to 3 8 percent near the lowest level in five decades from 4 percent in january all told friday s monthly employment report from the government pointed to a still sturdy job market and economy the u s labor market is still in good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial slower job growth was expected after huge average gains of better than 250 000 over

because of a weaker global economy a trade war between the united states and china and signs of caution among american consumers those factors have led many analysts to forecast anemic growth in the first three months of this year but most economists still cautioned against reading too much into february s sluggish pace of hiring the monthly employment data can be volatile during the nearly

the months that followed and february s increase in average pay suggests that businesses are stepping up their efforts to attract and keep workers the year over year increase of 3 4 percent in february is up from a corresponding figure of just 2 6 percent a year ago julia pollak a labor economist at jobs marketplace ziprecruiter said many companies are becoming increasingly hungry for workers the number of job ads on its site that offer to pay for training she said jumped 42 percent last year from 2017 and positions that offer flexible hours soared 110 percent a trend that could draw more women with family responsibilities off the sidelines and into work employers are finding all these ways to sweeten the deal and invest in their employees pollak said carole witkowski vice president of human resources at batteries and bulbs said her 700 store retail chain has raised starting hourly pay for workers at its distribution center from 11 to 12 with additional raises for those working evening and overnight shifts the company has taken other steps she said jobs at the distribution center located outside milwaukee don t require high school diplomas and have been plagued by

percent its highest point in more than a year the rate for hispanic and latino americans though dropped to a record low of 4 3 percent the overall jobless rate fell partly because thousands of federal

austerity from the left to the right governments have only that one word on their lips confronted with fiscal deficits many countries all over the world have embraced austerity measures giving a growing number of citizens the feeling they are being left behind and provoking a crisis of representation and legitimacy demanding budget cuts which in practice have a direct impact on public services is not only the bedrock of populism authoritarianism or social unrest it is also a frontal attack on women s rights women are more dependent on public social services which have the capacity to shift the unpaid care burden that falls disproportionately on their shoulders cleaning cooking and looking after dependent family members children elderly people and people with disabilities are still women s affairs trapped at the bottom across south asia women report doing much more unpaid care and domestic work than men 10 times as much in pakistan almost seven times more in india and nearly three times more in bangladesh women and girls are also the most impacted when countries offer poor basic facilities according to a report from unicef and the world health organisation 2 1 billion people around the world have to fight every day to access clean safe water and the task of providing it falls disproportionately on women and girls especially in rural areas in laos for example women are 83 4 per cent of the water carriers for the 48 5 per cent of households that lack access it it means that they have fewer opportunities for education training and work making their economic empowerment very difficult even when women manage to work they are often trapped in low paid poor quality jobs frequently in the informal sector many of them lack social labour protection and decent working conditions adding to the already unacceptable gender pay gap of 33 per cent in south asia women are less likely than men to receive a pension in old age and their benefit levels are usually lower in bangladesh for example the old age allowance offers benefits of around 3 per month corresponding to only 22 per cent of the poverty line women s access to social protection quality public services and infrastructure is now a priority of the international community it is actually the main topic of the united nations 2019 commission on the status of women that will take place in new york from march 11 to 22 this meeting is not just a bureaucratic exercise its conclusions will define the gender equality policies that countries aim to implement in the years to come public services international an international trade union federation will be there as part of a global union delegation of nearly 200 women and men jointly we will point out the positive aspects of the report prepared by the un secretary general especially its emphasis on a universal and rights based approach but we also will call on governments to translate these principles into concrete strategies to eliminate gender inequalities fiscal injustice it is urgent to reform the global international fiscal system to put an end to all tax avoidance mechanisms when corporations do not pay their fair share of taxes there is less money to invest in public services sustainable infrastructure and social protection which are the key drivers of gender equality annual tax revenue lost by developing countries due to trade mis pricing alone is estimated at between 98 billion and 106 billion nearly 20 billion more than the annual capital costs needed to achieve universal water and sanitation coverage we also want to highlight the essential and primary role of the states as the guarantors of the human rights of all women and girls whenever private companies have wanted to take over basic public services and infrastructure such as water and sanitation or health and education facilities this has always resulted in deterioration in quality especially for the most vulnerable in these troubled times when xenophobia is exploited by many unscrupulous political leaders we also call on the representatives to commit to policies addressed to all women including women migrants refugees and asylum seekers without voluntary policies such as these it will be impossible for most of the countries to meet their commitment to gender equality through the 2030 agenda for sustainable development women will still struggle to remain in the labour market and secure social protection entitlements through employment they will not find time for rest leisure or political participation universal rights based quality public services are a feminist issue the writer is general secretary of public services international share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit

washington ap the pace of hiring in the united states fell last month to its lowest point in nearly a year and a half a surprise drop likely reflecting harsh weather and other temporary factors that led most economists to see the slowdown as a temporary blip employers added just 20 000 jobs down from a blockbuster 311 000 in january even with february s anemic gain job growth over the past three months has averaged a solid 186 000 enough to lower the unemployment rate over time and average hourly pay surged 3 4 percent from a year earlier the sharpest year over year increase in a decade the unemployment rate also dropped to 3 8 percent near the lowest level in five decades from 4 percent in january all told friday s monthly employment report from the government pointed to a still sturdy job market and economy the u s labor market is still in good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial slower job growth was expected after huge average gains of better than 250 000 over the preceding four months job growth should bounce back in march and through the rest of this year last month s pullback in hiring does follow signs that u s economic growth is probably slowing because of a weaker global economy a trade war between the united states and china and signs of caution among american consumers those factors have led many analysts to forecast anemic growth in the first three months of this year but most economists still cautioned against reading too much into february s sluggish pace of hiring the monthly employment data can be volatile during the nearly decade long recovery from the great recession job growth has sometimes plunged in a single month to 15 000 in may 2016 for example and to 18 000 in september 2017 only to rebound to healthy levels in the months that followed and february s increase in average pay suggests that businesses are stepping up their efforts to attract and keep workers the year over year increase of 3 4 percent in february is up from a corresponding figure of just 2 6 percent a year ago story continues julia pollak a labor economist at jobs marketplace ziprecruiter said many companies are becoming increasingly hungry for workers the number of job ads on its site that offer to pay for training she said jumped 42 percent last year from 2017 and positions that offer flexible hours soared 110 percent a trend that could draw more women with family responsibilities off the sidelines and into work employers are finding all these ways to sweeten the deal and invest in their employees pollak said carole witkowski vice president of human resources at batteries and bulbs said her 700 store retail chain has raised starting hourly pay for workers at its distribution center from 11 to 12 with additional raises for those working evening and overnight shifts the company has taken other steps she said jobs at the distribution center located outside milwaukee don t require high school diplomas and have been plagued by high turnover many workers can find jobs elsewhere others haven t worked much before and aren t always used to showing up on time regularly so about 18 months ago the company started

washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell made clear he and his colleagues are in no hurry to adjust interest rates as growth slows and inflation stays muted but said the us central bank would announce new details of plans for its balance sheet reasonably soon bloomberg reported in a speech late friday in stanford california powell didn t mention the dismal u s employment report for february released earlier in the day saying measures of the labor market look as favorable as they have in many decades before reiterating the fed s mantra on being patient despite this favorable picture we have seen some cross currents in recent months he said in the prepared remarks with nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures the committee has adopted a patient wait and see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of policy he also said the rate setting federal open market committee is well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet runoff later this year powell s remarks follow a spate of gloomy economic developments in the u s and elsewhere that are validating the fed s decision earlier this year to put interest rate moves on hold for the time being after hiking four times in 2018 a possible warning sign in that data dependent strategy appeared as the week came to a close the u s labor department reported that employers added just 20 000 new jobs last month the fewest since september 2017 and well below economists estimates the outlook outside the u s also took a hit this week as china lowered its goal for growth in 2019 to a range of 6 percent to 6 5 percent while the european central bank slashed its forecast for 2019 growth to 1 1 percent from 1 7 percent u s stocks fell more than 2 percent on the week responding to questions after his speech powell said inflation in the u s is low stable and doesn t react much to slack in the economy the product of economic changes and credibility in the fed built up over the decades that needs to be maintained he also said economies around the world have slowed in the past six months citing western europe china and the u s downside risks to the outlook have increased he said citing brexit and uncertainty around trade policy mark duggan director of the stanford institute for economic policy research said following the speech that he thought powell and his colleagues were striking the right tone around monetary policy they re reacting to the data and that s smart he said the data has come in recently suggesting inflationary pressures are going down not up powell s speech marked the last substantive public remarks from a fed official before the fomc convenes march 19 20 to decide the next move on monetary policy after offering new economic forecasts and rate projections no rate move is expected amid concerns such as those raised thursday by fed governor lael brainard who said a weakening economic outlook in the u s and abroad argue for a softer path for interest rates than previously envisioned powell devoted part of his prepared remarks to the importance of maintaining trust in public institutions the u s central bank has come under scrutiny from president donald trump who has complained about powell s campaign to return rates to a more normal setting powell will have an opportunity to lay out the fed s strategy in an interview scheduled to air sunday night on cbs s 60 minutes program speaking at length on a variety of topics powell said the decision on the level at which to halt balance sheet runoffs will be determined by estimates of the demand for bank reserves reserves are on the liability side of the balance sheet and have fallen largely in line with the ongoing decline in assets when the monthly runoffs are halted powell said officials may decide to hold the overall size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to the desired level as other liabilities such as currency increase the fed expanded its balance sheet to a high of 4 5 trillion with bond purchases including during the great recession since october 2017 officials have trimmed the portfolio back to about 4 trillion the fed manages short term interest rates through a mechanism it adopted during the financial crisis that relies on abundant bank reserves and so is keen not to let reserves fall too low in another nod to post crisis normalization powell said he has asked a group of his colleagues to review the role of interest rate projections that are published quarterly or the fed s so called dot plot the tool has gathered even more attention from economists and investors as the central bank has reduced the amount of forward looking guidance it provides to the public through its policy statements in recent years but it does a poor job powell said of conveying the level of risks attached to those projections returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the fomc s post meeting statement presents a challenge for the dot plot has on occasion been a source of confusion he said we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that sometimes surrounds the dots powell also laid out the objectives of a policy framework review the fed has said will last all year as well as what will not be undertaken we seek no changes in law and we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the fed or in the 2 percent inflation objective he said adding there is a high bar for adopting any other fundamental change powell focused at length on the worries associated with operating monetary policy in a long term environment of low inflation and low interest rates making it difficult for the fed to combat recessions because rates may frequently return close to zero that s causing officials to consider adopting a make up strategy wherein they would seek to follow periods of below target inflation with periods of above target inflation in an effort to boost the average level of price changes since the fed adopted an explicit 2 percent inflation target in 2012 the core rate of inflation measured by the central bank s own favorite gauge has averaged just 1 6 percent makeup strategies are probably the most prominent idea and deserve serious attention he said they are largely untried however and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice
new york city could be one recession away from bankruptcy financial analysts are warning experts say that the city s high tax burden its net out migration and skyrocketing public spending could result in new york s first bankruptcy in more than 40 years the city is running a deficit and could be in a real difficult spot if we had a recession or a further flight of individuals because of tax reform economist milton ezrati told the new york post new york is already in a difficult financial spot but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setback the last time new york was close to bankruptcy was in 1975 when then president gerald ford famously refused to bail out the city from its crippling debt new york city could go bankrupt if a recession hit financial analysts are warning mayor bill de blasio s new budget includes an additional 3billion in spending on top of the current 89 2billion last october the city said that its long term liabilities including bonded debt pensions and other retirement benefits for its public sector workers reached a record 257 3billion an increase of 4 7billion since fiscal year 2017 the average liability per new york city household has increased by more than 1 500 to 82 577 according to the citizens budget commission mayor bill de blasio s new budget includes an additional 3billion in spending on top of the current 89 2billion analysts say de blasio s preliminary fiscal 2020 budget includes 750million in savings but that won t be enough if a recession comes as many predict the mayor has also increased spending since taking office the pace of his spending increase is triple the rate of inflation according to the post the state has also added more than 33 000 public sector workers in the last five years thus increasing its long term liabilities the last time new york was close to bankruptcy was in 1975 when then president gerald ford famously refused to bail out the city from its crippling debt to make matters worse governor andrew cuomo s preliminary budget calls for a 600million in cuts to spending on the city economic worries are also on the mind of the powers that be in albany cuomo said on monday that the state is running a 2 3billion deficit cuomo said the new tax law passed by the republican led congress in 2017 which limits the ability to deduct state and local taxes from federal income taxes contributed to the deficit according to wamc the governor also said that the dip in the stock market in december led to lower than anticipated tax payments cuomo says he is opposed to plans by progressive to impose even higher taxes on wealthy new yorkers in order to subsidize ambitious programs like single payer health care the governor says that new york already has the second highest taxes on millionaires in the country
if nothing else the latest u s trade deficit 621 billion in 2018 for goods and services should give president trump a lesson in the economics of trade trump has insisted that a successful policy requires a trade surplus good and the absence of a deficit bad that s wrong as many economists have argued the economists are right not only is the deficit sizable it s also 119 billion or almost 25 percent larger than the deficit in 2016 502 billion the last year of the obama presidency by trump s own standard his policy has failed even as he implausibly claims that it hasn t had he heeded economists both liberal and conservative he could have avoided this embarrassment he might also have seized an opportunity to educate the public about trade because millions of americans almost certainly share his view that only exports and the jobs tied to them benefit the nation while imports do the opposite because they destroy jobs advertisement president trump on feb 24 said there could be very big news over the next week or two in u s trade negotiations with china video reuters if that were true then the rising trade deficit would have caused a sharp decline in jobs and possibly even triggered a recession we all know this hasn t happened in part because trump keeps reminding us of all the jobs created on his watch that would be 4 9 million from january 2017 to january 2019 how can employment grow when the trade deficit is rising the main explanation as i ve argued for years is that the u s dollar is the dominant global currency it s used by many countries companies and individuals not just the united states and americans to conduct trade to finance business to borrow and lend across borders to hedge against the instability of other currencies and of course to support criminal activity this unique role no other currency comes close to serving as global currency feeds demand for dollars on foreign exchange markets raising the dollar s price a higher priced dollar in turn makes u s exports more expensive and u s imports cheaper advertisement presto there s the formula for persistent trade deficits we provide a service to the world economy the dollar s global role and other countries repay us by sending us imports but these effects are not shown in the official statistics if they were the u s deficit would shrink or become a surplus it s not surprising that since 1980 the united states has run current account surpluses only in 1980 1981 and 1991 the current account is a broad measure of trade nor is it surprising that each of these surpluses was associated with a recession which reduced americans demand for imports if trump truly wants a trade surplus the easiest way to achieve it would be to cause a worldwide economic collapse the reality is that the u s economy is growing faster than the economies of most developed countries and this has raised both the trade deficit and domestic job growth stronger u s economic growth increases americans demand for imports weaker foreign growth reduces demand for u s exports advertisement two caveats must be added share this article share first imports do eliminate some u s jobs but so does competition between american based businesses job losses from the 2007 2009 great recession were far greater than declines caused by trade it s also worth recalling that the benefits of trade extend beyond jobs imports mute price increases provide more consumer choice and promote competition second although unfair business practices aren t yet the main cause of trade deficits the trump administration is right to object loudly to the special treatment that china gives its cutting edge industries these measures include subsidies intellectual property theft and the coercion of foreign companies to participate in joint ventures with chinese partners the irony is that trump s devotion to the trade deficit as an indicator of success or failure has made the task of curbing china s unfair practices even harder it s not just the united states but also japan members of the european union and other countries that feel victimized by chinese behavior advertisement trump s goal should be to unite these china critics into a common negotiating front rather than allowing china to play one country off another as is now occurring but if ending u s trade deficits is the main objective this becomes virtually impossible because deficits exist with so many other countries trump and the rest of us are trapped by his rhetoric if we pursue a trade surplus we re doomed to fail read more from robert samuelson s archive
on a day when dominican poachers were caught sucking conch from under our noses our minister of finance dr nigel clarke has delivered a budget which is unusual and promising with an unprecedented loss of immediate revenue from april 1 2019 this is no tomfoolery it is a sort of entrepreneurial gamble general consumption tax gct threshold up to 10 million some 7 million up from the current 3 million from gct alone the government is likely to lose a minimum of 0 731 billion in revenue massive tax relief due to reform of the stamp duty and estate tax will lead to a reduction in around 10 billion in government income finally and to the glee of small business operators there will be relief via the abolition of the minimum business and asset tax which non financial institutions currently pay headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters all in all the government will lose more than 14 billion in direct tax inflows based on the current system clearly there is a method to this madness and it must seek to recoup this loss there is a clear logic globally the micro small and medium enterprise msme sector is the largest contributor to economic growth for example in the african nation botswana a country which i have never visited msmes contributed some 40 per cent of gross domestic product gdp and were 90 per cent of all registered businesses in 2014 on the other side in tunisia some 44 per cent of the employed labour force was engaged in msmes in a country with a wavering banking sector it was not surprising that the engine of growth was seen by international policymakers as these smaller businesses environment of entrepreneurship more than 90 per cent of companies and businesses worldwide are msmes with japan having the highest percentage in the developed world with figures of 99 per cent india has a rate of 80 per cent simply put it makes a lot of sense and many more dollars to put money in the hands and facilitate an environment of entrepreneurship interestingly there are interesting parallels between what we heard from the minister and the shellfish find our authorities recognised that in our search for sustainable development we had to take drastic and immediate measures to protect our marine food stock thus as with the customary annual lobster ban from april fool s day until june 30 annually we have instituted a one year lockdown on the big sea snail the fact is that if we are going to have real prosperity there is going to have to be serious regulation and monitoring and protection of the vulnerable because there will always be powerful minorities who are capable of subverting the process for their own selfish purposes and to them it matters not what happens to the rest of the society small fishermen who obey the rules or commit minor infractions to them do not devastate our reefs like large predatory vessels we might not export the conch directly to tunisia but the delicate mollusc with the soft pink interior shell is of a very succulent flavour and is nicely ensconced in a strategic location highly demanded by the french who already have a cultural love of escargots and other bland snails we have a niche our warm water snail is precious especially since the stocks in florida have been depleted due to overfishing and poor environmental management but the little conchs must be protected like the small enterprises and not be subject to the vagaries of unscrupulous elements on the whole it takes three years for conchs to reach maturity after their parents do the nasty imagine in one trip some 4 000 pounds being extracted similarly msmes do not become centres of profit making until around the same time as well nonetheless we know that the threats to the little conch industry comprise poachers who cross into our waters and illegally harvest our livestock as well as poor management of the marine ecosystems with our paltry fines and short sentences we have not come to recognise that poaching of conch especially when there is a ban on their harvesting constitutes illegal international animal trade just like exotic fauna and body parts such as tiger bone and ivory this criminal industry is worth us 19 billion per year only the trade in illegal drugs counterfeiting and human trafficking rake in more filthy lucre even the illegal arms trade earns less to the criminals my point is we need to see the severe criminality of the action for what it is and take drastic action here i would love to see enforcement of international treaties and border controls where anyone who attempts to import conch and other rare seafood such as lobsters into countries such as france and the united states must have the stamp of the custom agents of the countries of purported origins validate contract work finally we go back to the msmes as we strive for increased labour productivity which is what will make the msmes truly profitable there is a quiet little storm brewing where the minister of labour is being tugged to validate contract work doubtless minister shahine robinson is right in that the international labour organisation ilo does recognise this type of work arrangement as an acceptable form however it has spent a lot of effort uncovering disguised contracts where bona fide workers are being exploited well here is the science and evidence workers who are engaged under valid contracts of employment where they are treated humanely even in micro enterprises are more likely to go the extra mile to be productive on the other hand indecent work fuels not only low productivity but also criminal activity including local poaching furthermore if disposable income increases without a corresponding increase in productivity and gdp we have more money chasing fewer local goods this will lead to either inflation of the price of local commodities or an increase in imports thus my caution is as we seek prosperity let us protect the workers as we

governor of the people s bank of china yi gang attends a press conference on the financial reform and development for the second session of the 13th national people s congress in beijing on march 10 wei yao china will continue to launch prudent monetary policies and fend off financial risks so as to better serve the real economy and promote high quality development according to chinese central bank governor â china will not adopt the exchange rate as a way to win market competition a method to improve export or a tool to conduct trade frictions with the united states â governor of the peopleâ s bank of china yi gang highlighted at a press conference on financial reform and development for the second session of the 13th national peopleâ s congress in beijing on march 10 â the global economic landscape is still undergoing complicated changes with certain downward pressures domestically china also faces many economic and financial risks as well â yi told the press according to yi china has seen changes in the internal and external environment this year the trade talks with the united states proved productive thus the likelihood of a further interest rates hike by the federal reserve system has been reduced the countryâ s financial regulation and management of local governmentsâ debts have also stabilized market expectations but to retain this stability and avoid risk further actions are required the countryâ s monetary policy needs to be balanced in scale and to reflect counter cyclical adjustments which means that m2 money supplies and social financing growth will be in line with nominal gross domestic product growth in 2019 china will also step up financial support for private enterprises especially ones which are small or micro sized yi said china and the united states have reached consensus on the currency exchange rate including respecting both sidesâ autonomy over monetary policies and adhering to the market determined exchange rate system since chinaâ s market has been increasingly adaptable to fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and developed more tools of hedging risks both domestic market participants and foreign investors will grow more confident in the market determined renminbi the governor added â china will not adopt the exchange rate as a way to win market competition a method to improve export or a tool to conduct trade frictions with the united states â yi highlighted yi stressed that the opening up of chinaâ s financial market is conducive to both the country and the world â chinaâ s stock market debt market and other financial markets will be gradually opened to the world â he said copyedited by craig crowther
introduction saying china has been in the news a ton lately would be an understatement over the past two years itâ s hard to go a day without hearing a story about trade relations between u s and china since the â trade warâ began chinaâ s stock market has significantly underperformed the u s as youâ ll see in the chart below data by ycharts as uncertainty continues to stir surround the u s and china trade relationship now is a good time to buy a broad china etf specifically the ishares msci china etf mchi mchi details the ishares msci china etf tracks a cap weighted index of investable chinese shares and stretches across all market cap sizes with an expense ratio of only 0 59 this is one of the most cost effective ways to get broad exposure to chinese securities one major concern with investing in emerging market securities is getting good pricing on your transactions thereâ s nothing to worry here as you can see from the charts below mchiâ s premium discount typically hovers around 0 00 and its spread is fairly consistent around 0 016 source why the opportunity exists the media is currently suckering investors and markets into believing talks between china and the u s are souring or moving slower than expected i would be so quick to buy what theyâ re selling as weâ ve seen this before only a few short weeks ago during chinaâ s lunar new year due to a lack of news given the holiday some media outlets began to focus on negative data points to produce headlines and garner attention we say a flurry of negative stories surrounding the us china trade discussions but it is clear now that progress occurred during this period whatâ s happening now well china is currently involved in its biggest parliamentary event of the year the peopleâ s national congress it started earlier this week and runs for the next 10 days all the major party members and decision makers are tied up with the event so unexpectedly thereâ s been a lack of headline news out of china classic case of no news becoming bad news why you should take advantage if you can ignore the sensationalized headlines and focus on whatâ s really going on youâ ll find some details that run contrary to what is currently being published for example earlier this week the wall street journal reported that as part of the chinese governmentâ s communications to the public today regarding their economic plans the controversial â made in china 2025â language was surprisingly nowhere to be found â during a nearly 100 minute speech to chinaâ s legislature tuesday premier li keqiang dropped any reference to the plan that the trump administration has criticized as a subsidy stuffed program to make china a global technology leader at the expense of the u s the policy had been a highlight of mr liâ s state of the nation like address for three years running â this is an important development â made in china 2025 is or was a big initiative by chinaâ s government to move away from being the worldâ s leading producer of cheap goods to producing goods of higher value also the government wanted the nation to produce and consume more of its own goods by 2025 reducing its dependency on foreign entities this policy isnâ t inherently bad and while it makes complete sense for an economy that has become the second largest in the world and wants to dominate the planet it is not hard to imagine why the u s would take issue with it given that the u s is actively seeking to negotiate better terms for its companies doing business with china in my opinion the removal of this messaging shows chinaâ s government is sending a clear message that itâ s sincere in its desire to complete a trade deal that satisfies all parties involved and if youâ re looking for another sign u s secretary of state mike pompeo who has made it a point to stay out of the spotlight during these negotiations told farmers in iowa earlier this week that a trade agreement could be reached in a only a couple weeks from now china s recent economic numbers another reason why china is likely ready to deal is somewhat weaken economic data reduced domestic demand and the aforementioned trade war with the united states contributed to chinaâ s economic growth reaching its lowest point since 1990 china is targeting 6 to 6 5 percent of growth in 2019 which is the first time the number has been ranged bound and less than the 6 6 percent gdp growth the country reported in 2018 this disappoint growth numbers are a concern but premier li keqiang outlined some policies that should help spur growth li said chinaâ s fiscal policy will become â more forceful â the government plans tax cuts of about 2 trillion yuan which translates to about 298 3 billion in taxes and fees for companies li went on to say that beijing will increase cuts in reserve requirements for smaller and medium sized banks with the goal of boosting lending to small companies by large banks to boost infrastructure investment chinaâ s finance ministry raised the special bond issuance quota for local governments to 2 15 trillion yuan from 1 35 trillion yuan in 2018 according to reuters chinaâ s government cares deeply about political stability and understands one of the easiest ways to disrupt that is an economic downturn theyâ ll do everything in their power to keep the economy moving in the right direction and one of the easiest ways to do that would be a completed trade deal with the united states their motivation to get a deal done and their move to more accommodating fiscal policy presents a buying opportunity for broad china exposure take advantage of the recent market overreaction risks unfortunately no one really knows whatâ s going to happen with the us china trade negotiations add in someone as volatile as donald trump and the perceived progress thatâ s being made could all be unraveled in a second this would be bad for china and likely the u s too i believe a deal being reached is much more likely than the market is pricing in but the alternative is always a possibility also mchi holds large positions in tencent otcpk tcehy and alibaba baba at 14 4 and 13 9 respectively if you already have exposure to these names this investment might not make sense in the context of your entire portfolio and could expose you to some company specific risks why mchi over fxi you should use mchi over the ishares china large cap etf fxi for two main reasons the first is that mchi is 20 cheaper to own than fxi while this wont make much of a difference if you re planning a short term trade over the long term this cost difference can be a huge drag on fund returns the second reason is mchi is much more diversified than fxi fxi only holds 77 different securities compared to mchi s 317 you re getting much broader exposure to china s market through mchi which is the point of this trade we re not trying to pick which individual securities will increase author s note thanks for reading if you

ceos are worried in a recent survey of some 1 400 global business leaders the biggest fear of c suite executives in 2019 is a recession another survey by the boston consulting group found that 82 of investors were preparing for an economic slowdown while a further 73 anticipated a recession in the next two years advertisement gauges of consumer confidence in the us point to a general growing pessimism paywall about the state of the economy meanwhile rattled chinese consumers are swapping iphones for cheaper alternatives putting off car purchases and opting not to travel as much if you share these concerns about the future what s the next step it seems straightforward enough you cover your back by reducing spending in case you lose your job your house loses value or markets take a nosedive if you run a company you might do something similar an anticipated drop in revenue spurs a push to cut costs and possibly even staff general motors to give a recent example offered voluntary buyouts to 17 700 employees late last year before slashing 14 000 jobs instead of preparing for a slowdown careful spending can actually cause it but what may seem sensible in isolation adds up in aggregate when consumers and businesses start spending less en masse it creates the conditions that can spark a slump instead of preparing for a slowdown it causes it the next recession may be a self fulfilling prophecy advertisement that s despite the fact that consumers or businesses may have little to worry about as the conference board a think tank recently observed economic indicators do not point to imminent recession risks outside of the uk in the us gdp expanded by 3 4 last quarter after the third quarter s whopping 4 2 growth even taking into account the effect of ongoing trade tensions it s an undeniably healthy figure unemployment is the lowest it s been in almost a half century and inflation remains under control still a lack of faith in what the conference board calls traditional levers of power public policy and political institutions is manifesting itself as a fear that leaders aren t equipped to manage a potential economic crisis ironically defensive spending tactics could be the quickest way to test that theory if you can dream it genuine crises manmade or otherwise often precipitate economic recessions the drought that caused the dust bowl of the 1930s or the sudden drop in military spending after world war ii are two examples but sometimes it doesn t take a shock of this magnitude to fluster consumers and investors in the summer of 2007 ben bernanke then the chair of the us federal reserve anticipated a modest economic decline followed by growth throughout 2008 but investors thrown by what they perceived as dangerous risks building up in the system saw it differently and decided to take matters into their own hands the s p 500 peaked in october 2007 and would bottom out nearly a year and half later advertisement the increased risk that they had imputed to the system became a reality economist j bradford delong wrote in project syndicate like triage nurses in an emergency room they quickly assessed the patient and then ran with their initial diagnosis as if there were no other option as the old wall street saying goes it all comes back to greed and fear all over the world people were spooked contrary to bernanke s prediction output consumption and investment declined by similar magnitudes around the globe even without the same impetus as the subprime laden us while some of this was due to how closely global financial markets are now linked it doesn t go far enough to explain the sharp shift in business cycles and expectations that followed writing in the american economic journal economists philippe bacchetta and eric van wincoop suggested that a much more important factor was a demand collapse resulting from a self fulfilling shock to expectations or panic even though their situations were different policymakers and consumers around the world seem to have expected a similar nosedive in income and economic activity as in the us when they adjusted their behavior accordingly the predicted slump became a reality this phenomenon is known as contagion though there are those who argue that the effect of market interdependence or how intertwined global markets are is not given its due advertisement as the old wall street saying goes it all comes back to greed and fear but do we have to veer so sharply between the two social psychologist stephen worchel who works on fear and ethnic violence describes the overlap in the type of fear that precipitates violence against a group and the kind that tanks markets it s circular he says we begin to develop fear on an issue or about a group and then we need to justify that fear but because nobody wants to hold irrational fears we seek out information that justifies our own fear inspired belief whether that s selectively reading news stories or focusing only the outlets that hold similar views to our own they re not looking for data worchel says they re really looking for stories that justify their fear in the case of economic recessions a whispered rumor about house prices weakening or company earnings underperforming might set off a chain reaction where consumers seek out stories that confirm what they ve already been told it s not enough to simply tell people that they re wrong worchel says or that they re nothing to be scared of i ll get further if i tell them yes there can be that fear and that can be dangerous but here s what you can do to reduce your fear here s what you can do to try to address the issues that you re fearful of advertisement how the threat of recessions begets recessions in the us where personal consumption accounts for almost 70 of gdp any cut to household budgets has significant implications for the economy china s push to become a more consumer focused economy paywall makes sentiment there similarly important to global growth as confidence drops spending goes with it a whispered rumor about house prices weakening or company earnings underperforming might set off a chain reaction alan greenspan the former fed chairman generally adhered to the belief that people act according to rational self interest he warned of irrational exuberance as the dot com bubble inflated but nobody took it seriously and stocks continued their climb a few years later once he had left the fed the bottom fell out of the us economy and the fingers of blame turned his way greenspan was forced to reckon with how the economic theory he espoused failed to account for the full scope of what took place in a 2009 financial times opinion piece paywall greenspan described how he underestimated the human propensity to panic and its effect on markets when it comes to spending there is an innate human propensity to swing between euphoria and fear which while heavily influenced by economic events has a life of its own he wrote in my experience such episodes are often not mere forecasts of future business activity but major causes of it advertisement what happens now though we re not facing an imminent recession it might not take much to push people over the edge there are a number of events which could be enough to tip the balance says roger farmer an economist at ucla and the author of prosperity for all how to prevent financial crises slowing growth in china political tensions with china events in europe which could easily trigger a recession in europe that then spreads he says we ve got the brexit debate going on in the uk right now plus turmoil in france immigration issues everywhere any one of these things could panic markets at some point although profit growth has been strong overall earlier this year bellwether companies like caterpillar and jpmorgan missed their fourth quarter earnings targets for the first quarter analysts have been lowering their expectations across the board predicting that profits for s p 500 companies will shrink for the first time in a long time simply telling people not to worry doesn t seem to have much effect advertisement mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz says that last year s robust results shouldn t necessarily be expected to be the new norm last year was exceptional he told cnbc we had returns no volatility and every single correlation worked for the investor being overly concerned about not matching those sparkling figures could mean talking ourselves into a recession he said but simply telling people not to worry doesn t seem to have much effect one traditional way that central banks respond to potential downturns giving confidence to markets and consumers is by cutting interest rates but interest rates are so low now that they don t have that ammunition notes farmer of ucla instead i think you should look out for unconventional responses to the next recession he says creative actions following the 2008 financial crisis including lending widely and purchasing risky assets prevented the value of assets from dropping even more abruptly next time around we may need even more ingenuity especially when it comes to counteracting the narratives that risk becoming self fulfilling already the fed has been more explicit about its goals for inflation and is much more voluble than it was under greenspan it is not the only institution with the power to dent or boost confidence but the unpredictability of the current administration in the white house has not made it a reliable partner still the fed does what it can the hope is that people will listen to its carefully worded assessments and that the information will make them feel less buffeted by forces outside of their control in doing so the goal isn t just to tackle fear but to take preemptive steps to stop the crisis this fear may trigger

ready to go back to the shattered era new york the old drop dead epoch and fun city times looks like that s what s on the cards based on this new york post report warning that the socialist led city is in dire danger of bankruptcy if there s an economic downturn new york city is careening closer to all out financial bankruptcy for the first time since mayor abraham beame ran the city more than 40 years ago experts say as tax fleeced businesses and individuals flee en masse and city public spending surges into the stratosphere financial analysts say gotham is perilously near total fiscal disaster long term debt is now more than 81 100 per household and mayor de blasio is ramping up to spend as much as 3 billion more in the new budget than the current 89 2 billion the city is running a deficit and could be in a real difficult spot if we had a recession or a further flight of individuals because of tax reform said milton ezrati chief economist of vested i ve got some news for new

undiversified economy what the city does have in common with all four places through is that s word socialism and sure enough they re looking at the same kind of crisis socialist bill de blasio has been mayor of new york for going on six years now and he hasn t held back on what socialists specialize in which is government spending according to the washington examiner the state of new york shells out 32 cents from every taxpayer dollar that comes in for welfare payments to those who can t or won t work according to the state of new york s office of the state comptroller which pays attention to new york city s government spending in just the last year new york city has outspent the rest of the state in public assistance up 3 7 safety net assistance up 6 family assistance up 1 7 while assistance for other programs such as snap decreased at lower rates than the state as a whole on all fronts you can bet that new york city s percentage is likely above the state s averaged 32 and all this at a time when the u s has seen its best economic performance since the reagan years bill de blasio has been spending up a storm as the socialist mayor of new york city and with every expansion driving out another piece of the productive sector instead of jobs expanding welfare has expanding and residents are fleeing amazon after all got chased out thanks to his fellow socialist rep alexandria ocasio cortez a move that is going to cost the city a pretty penny in lost tax revenue nice work socialists and now the famous other people s money is running out which is likely to signal the demise of the socialism itself if it can t keep a money stream from the productive sector with which to shovel out the socialist welfare it shows that socialism is a parasite system always needing some kind of sugar daddy to glom off on whether it s castro in cuba seeking a new patron every few years or de blasio seeking a new corporate sponsor to keep the tax money rolling in yet once socialism kills its host as the cash runs dry the collapse commences anybody out there could see that that was what was going to happen as i wrote back in 2013 when i was an editorial writer for investor s business daily largely appealing to identity politics to win his italian name is of his own making and his african american wife and children have been paraded as political props the only thing that passed for a political plan from him was his vow to tax the rich to end the policing that has made new york safe and to expand welfare make no mistake the people of this city have chosen a progressive path and tonight we set forth on it together de blasio said on his election night problem these are ideas that have been tried before in new york s recent past the rubble of the south bronx the crime waves mick jagger sang about and the municipal bankruptcy from which gerald ford told new york to drop dead rather than rescue were all the result of corruption and incompetence which were reversed with the election of rudy giuliani in 1993 well now that specter is appearing and it came in all of five years will new yorkers and others enamored of socialism ever learn from this maybe that s the question to start seeking answers about how bad does it have to get and why must it always get bad for anyone to wake up image credit ludovic bertron via flickr cc by sa 2 0

friday s surprisingly weak job creation numbers were another sign the economy is slowing economists and the president will debate whether the federal reserve is the reason the chair of the federal reserve is arguably the most powerful person handling our economy but interviews with the head of the fed are rare chairman jerome powell was appointed to the board of governors by president obama and was elevated last year to chairman by president trump since then the fed has raised interest rates four times leading mr trump to call the federal reserve crazy last week at the fed s headquarters in washington we asked powell about interest rates whether the president can fire him and what he believes are the greatest threats to prosperity scott pelley have you stopped raising rates jerome powell well that s a good question we see the economy as in a good place we think that the outlook is a favorable one inflation is muted and our policy rate we think is in an appropriate place so what we ve said is that we would be patient scott pelley what does patient mean jerome powell patient means that we don t feel any hurry to change our interest rate policy what what s happened in the last 90 or so days is that we ve seen increasing evidence of the global economy slowing down although our own economy has continued to perform well scott pelley where do you see weakness in the u s economy jerome powell generally speaking the u s economy is coming off a very strong year last year we had growth just a touch higher than 3 percent we have high levels of employment low levels of unemployment wages are moving up consumer confidence is high business confidence is high we ve seen a bit of a slowing but i would say the principal risks to our economy now seem to be coming from slower growth in china and europe and also risk events such as brexit scott pelley a record 7 million americans have fallen behind on their car payments never happened before what do you make of that jerome powell car sales have been quite high for a number of years so the whole body of outstanding auto loans is much larger than it was i think it also though shows that not everyone is experiencing this widespread prosperity that we have and that s something we pay attention to as well scott pelley retail sales declined in december the fastest pace since 2009 are these things taken together suggesting that the system is blinking red jerome powell there s also evidence by the way that spending has popped back up in january but we ll that s a surprisingly weak reading and we ll be watching the next month s reading shortly scott pelley but the overarching question is are we headed to a recession jerome powell i think growth this year will be slower than last year last year was the highest growth that we ve experienced since the financial crisis really in more than 10 years this year i expect that growth will continue to be positive and continue to be at a healthy rate the federal reserve system was created by congress a century ago to prevent financial panics its mission is to create maximum employment while keeping inflation under control scott pelley you mentioned growth last year being slightly over 3 percent that was with the tax cut and with unemployment in this country at a rate that we haven t seen in decades is that the best the economy can do now are the days of 4 percent growth over jerome powell you can break it down into a couple of things one is how fast is the labor force growing and the other part is how fast is productivity growing the labor force back when we used to have 4 percent and 5 percent growth years the labor force was growing quickly 2 5 percent 3 percent in some cases back in the 60s and 70s we have an older population now and our labor force is growing more slowly it s growing less than 1 percent a year so it s not likely that we could sustain the kinds of growth rates that we had when population and the labor force was growing more quickly scott pelley so 4 percent is something we shouldn t expect in the future jerome powell there will be years of 4 percent growth but it would be it would be challenging to see sustained 4 percent growth again because of the slow growth of the workforce powell s experience in the workforce is a privileged one princeton led to georgetown law which led to a wall street career that made him a multimillionaire now as chairman he s been raising rates in tiny increments to control inflation but the president thinks he s gone too far president donald trump no i think the fed is making a mistake they re so tight i think the fed has gone crazy jerome powell i don t think it would be appropriate for me to comment on other elected officials or on the president scott pelley isn t it your duty to respond when the president calls the fed a much bigger problem than china jerome powell my duty is one that congress has given us which is to use our tools to achieve maximum employment and stable prices and to supervise and regulate banks so that they treat their customers fairly and so that they re strong well capitalized and can perform their critical function in good times and bad that s my job scott pelley can the president fire you jerome powell well the law is clear that i have a four year term and i fully intend to serve it scott pelley so no in your view jerome powell no scott pelley how independent is the fed who do you answer to jerome powell we are directed to take to execute policy in a strictly non political way serving all americans and that s what we do we are independent in that sense our decisions on rates can t be reversed by any other part of government our accountability runs through the elected representatives and the oversight committees in congress jerome powell with his federal reserve chairman predecessors janet yellen and ben bernanke traditionally chairs of the fed don t do interviews their words can upend markets but that tradition was broken by ben bernanke on 60 minutes during the great recession recently we assembled bernanke his successor janet yellen and powell scott pelley and i wonder what kind of advice you ve given chairman powell about the withering criticism that you might get from the public congress business the president ben bernanke well i kept on my desk a quotation from abraham lincoln to the effect that if you re right it won t matter what they say if you re wrong it won t matter what they say so the best thing to do is to make what you believe is the right call scott pelley chair yellen what advice did you give to chairman powell janet yellen we worked together closely and i knew that he knew everything that one needs to be a successful chair to be inclusive in decision making to bring many voices to the table to listen carefully jerome powell being in this role is a very humbling thing and you learn to listen to other people s perspectives pretty well powell listens to a lot of perspective in the fed s boardroom the federal open market committee sets interest rates scott pelley you ve had four interest rate increases in your tenure i wonder were any of those unanimous jerome powell they were all unanimous scott pelley all four jerome powell that s not to say that we don t have vigorous discussions and a range of perspectives the fed wants to maintain inflation at 2 percent about where it is now but powell told us he s flexible to a point scott pelley if the inflation rate rises something over 2 percent for a limited period of time that doesn t mean the fed s gonna jump on the brakes jerome powell i think we wouldn t overreact to inflation modestly above 2 percent any more than we overreacted to inflation modestly below 2 percent i think we ll always be moving inflation back to 2 percent with our policy but i think we do that in a symmetric way it s taken nearly a decade to worry about inflation again the collapse in the 2008 financial crisis was the worst since the great depression mortgage fraud on a massive scale caused the dow to fall 54 percent and unemployment to rise to 10 percent taxpayers were forced to bailout reckless wall street excess back then tighter restrictions were imposed on banks but now powell and congress are loosening those rules scott pelley are american banks safe today jerome powell the american banking system is much much stronger and more resilient than it was before the financial crisis particularly the largest banks have double or more the amount of capital which is to say resources to absorb losses in addition we ve required them to undergo resolution planning in case they do fail there s a plan for what to do which doesn t involve a taxpayer bailout scott pelley but in 2007 the fed missed the reckless criminal banking that was happening how do you know today that the banks are safe jerome powell we spent 10 years analyzing understanding what went wrong and trying to correct it scott pelley a collapse of the financial system like we saw in 2008 cannot happen again jerome powell cannot is a strong statement you know i would say that our system is vastly more resilient scott pelley how concerned are you about either criminals or more importantly hostile nations attacking our banking system through the computer system jerome powell we devote very large amounts of time and resources to protect the fed but also to protect financial institutions and the financial markets the banks we supervise are required to have plans in place and state of the art you know technology i would say for cyber risk though i ve never felt a time when i when i think we re doing enough scott pelley i have the sense that i just hit on the thing that keeps you up at night jerome powell i would say of the risks that we face that certainly is the largest one scott pelley it s become your top priority jerome powell the kinds of risks that we faced in the financial crisis are very real but we know i think generally what to do there cyber is a relatively new kind of a risk with nation state actors and it s one where the playbook is still being developed in real time powell told us about another risk hidden in our economy it includes an estimated half a million workers who ve given up looking for jobs jerome powell we have an unusually large number of people in their prime working years who are not in the labor force the united states has a lower labor force participation rate than almost every other advanced country that is not our self image as a country scott pelley where did these people go who are no longer looking for work jerome powell part of it is evolving technology so as technology evolves it requires rising skills on the part of the people u s educational attainment has not moved up as rapidly as it has in other countries globalization s also a factor for many advanced economies manufacturing to some extent has moved into developing countries so for whatever reason and the opioid crisis is related to i think to those other factors scott pelley the opioid crisis jerome powell the opioid crisis is millions of people they tend to be young males and it s a very significant problem and it s part of a larger picture scott pelley you seem to be talking about part of this generation being lost jerome powell that is the issue when you have people who are not taking part in the economic life of a country in a meaningful way who don t have the skills and aptitudes to play a role or who are not doing so because of because they re addicted to drugs or in jail then in a sense they are being left behind still these are not bad days to be chair of the fed unemployment is near a 50 year low wages are growing at a pace of more than 3 percent and if the expansion lasts another three months it will be the longest in history at 10 years scott pelley how long can it last jerome powell i would just say there s no reason why it can t continue scott pelley for years jerome powell eventually expansions come to an end the business cycle has not been repealed but i would say there s no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand produced by henry schuster associate producers rachael morehouse and sarah turcotte
beijing march 10 ians china s top central banker on sunday signalled that beijing and washington were getting close to reaching a currency deal as part of their continuing negotiations to settle a yearlong trade battle both sides have reached consensus on many crucial and important issues people s bank of china pboc governor yi gang told the media here on the sidelines of the nation s annual legislative session as part of the accord yi said china won t engage in competitive devaluation to give chinese exporters a leg up in foreign markets a commitment chinese officials have also made in multilateral agreements such as those among the group of 20 g20 industrial nations how china manages its currency has been a point of contention between washington and beijing for years us president donald trump was vocal throughout his election campaign in saying china manipulates the yuan to gain an advantage in trade by making its products relatively cheaper trump repeated the charge last year when the yuan s plunge aroused suspicion that beijing was pushing down its value to offset us tariffs on chinese products in the recent trade talks us negotiators pushed their chinese counterparts to keep the yuan stable and to improve transparency in currency market interventions by china s central bank during a congressional hearing last month us trade representative robert lighthizer said we have spent a lot of time on currency and the agreement will be enforceable still how the currency deal if reached will be enforced remains unclear both sides are haggling over an enforcement mechanism for the broader trade agreement yi said both sides have discussed how they should disclose information when they buy or sell in foreign exchange markets according to rules set by the international monetary fund another point of discussion he said involves how both nations should respect the autonomy of each other s monetary policy that latter issue is of deepening concern to the pboc because it doesn t want a pledge to keep the yuan steady to tie its hands in supporting economic growth by loosening credit policy letting more yuan funds flow into the economy could pressure the value of the yuan the pboc mainly looks at domestic factors when setting monetary policy yi said the exchange rate isn t a major factor in domestic monetary policy yi also sought to temper investors expectations for more aggressive monetary easing to prop up the slowing economy a neutral monetary stance he said means that china will keep its overall leverage ratio stable in the past year the central bank cut the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve five times in a bid to unleash more funds for lenders to make loans there is still room for such reserve requirement reductions this year mr yi said though the room has narrowed he also said the central bank will continue to foster competition among banks as a way to lower lending rates but he gave no indication that any reduction in benchmark interest rates are in the cards at the end of last year credit amounted to 249 4 per cent of china s gross domestic product he said which was 1 5 percentage points lower than the level as of the end of 2017

what to know in the past three months job gains have averaged a solid 186 000 there were also positive numbers the unemployment rate fell to 3 8 percent last month from 4 percent in january average hourly pay rose 3 4 percent from a year earlier the largest gain in a decade the pace of hiring in the united states fell last month to its lowest point in nearly a year and a half a surprise drop likely reflecting harsh weather and other temporary factors that led most economists to see the slowdown as a temporary blip employers added just 20 000 jobs down from a blockbuster 311 000 in january even with february s anemic gain job growth over the past three months has averaged a solid 186 000 enough to lower the unemployment rate over time and average hourly pay surged 3 4 percent from a year earlier the sharpest year over year increase in a decade the unemployment rate also dropped to 3 8 percent near the lowest level in five decades from 4 percent in january all told friday s monthly employment report from the government pointed to a still sturdy job market and economy the u s labor market is still in good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial slower job growth was expected after huge average gains of better than 250 000 over the preceding four months job growth should bounce back in march and through the rest of this year last month s pullback in hiring does follow signs that u s economic growth is probably slowing because of a weaker global economy a trade war between the united states and china and signs of caution among american consumers those factors have led many analysts to forecast anemic growth in the first three months of this year but most economists still cautioned against reading too much into february s sluggish pace of hiring the monthly employment data can be volatile during the nearly decade long recovery from the great recession job growth has sometimes plunged in a single month to 15 000 in may 2016 for example and to 18 000 in september 2017 only to rebound to healthy levels in the months that followed and february s increase in average pay suggests that businesses are stepping up their efforts to attract and keep workers the year over year increase of 3 4 percent in february is up from a corresponding figure of just 2 6 percent a year ago julia pollak a labor economist at jobs marketplace ziprecruiter said many companies are becoming increasingly hungry for workers the number of job ads on its site that offer to pay for training she said jumped 42 percent last year from 2017 and positions that offer flexible hours soared 110 percent a trend that could draw more women with family responsibilities off the sidelines and into work employers are finding all these ways to sweeten the deal and invest in their employees pollak said carole witkowski vice president of human resources at batteries and bulbs said her 700 store retail chain has raised starting hourly pay for workers at its distribution center from 11 to 12 with additional raises for those working evening and overnight shifts the company has taken other steps she said jobs at the distribution center located outside milwaukee don t require high school diplomas and have been plagued by high turnover many workers can find jobs elsewhere others haven t worked much before and aren t always used to showing up on time regularly so about 18 months ago the company started paying 250 each quarter to workers who arrive on time every day and in the suburbs outside chicago when the company received no applications in response to retail job postings last winter it offered a 500 signing bonus that shook loose some applicants we got a little aggressive there witkowski said nationally though the sluggish hiring and job cuts in february were widespread across industries construction cut 31 000 jobs the most in more than five years likely because of cold weather manufacturing added just 4 000 the fewest in a year and a half a sign that trump s trade war has raised costs and lowered exports for many factories retailers cut 6 100 positions while jobs in a category that mostly includes restaurants and hotels were unchanged the unemployment rate fell despite the tepid pace of hiring the government uses one survey of households to calculate unemployment and a separate survey of businesses to count job growth and sometimes the results of the two surveys diverge for a single month the jobless rate for african americans which hit a record low of 5 9 percent in may and has frequently been celebrated by president donald trump rose for a third straight month in february to 7 percent its highest point in more than a year the rate for hispanic and latino americans though dropped to a record low of 4 3 percent the overall jobless rate fell partly because thousands of federal workers had been temporarily counted as unemployed in january during the partial government shutdown they returned to work and were counted as unemployed in february also on a positive note the proportion of part time workers who d prefer full time jobs fell sharply that measure had risen in january during the shutdown as some furloughed government workers took part time jobs temporarily but in february a gauge of what is called underemployment which includes part timers who want full time work and discouraged people no longer looking for jobs reached 7 3 percent the lowest level since 2001 there are signs that the economy is slowing consumer confidence fell sharply in january held back by the shutdown and by a steep fall in stock prices in december and americans spent less over the winter holidays with consumer spending plunging in december by the most in five years we are seeing a fading of the effects of the trump tax cut and increased government spending which helped accelerate growth last year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics analysts generally foresee growth slowing sharply in the first three months of this year to just a 1 percent annual rate down from a 2 6 percent rate in the october december quarter still most expect a rebound in the april june quarter and there are already signs of one consumer confidence rose in february along with the stock market and more americans signed contracts to buy homes in january propelled by lower mortgage rates
houston march 10 2019 prnewswire prweb bitcoin oil btco announces further details of its optimally improved ledger oil by unveiling details of its forthcoming algorithm historically bitcoin btc has been extremely volatile which bitcoin oil believes limits its capabilities for mass adoption and in turn its usefulness as a medium of exchange and a reasonably stable store of value hence btco s team considers price stability and reduced volatility as the pathway to bitcoin mass adoption by leveraging btco s proof of stake or pos algorithm bitcoin oil believes that the adoption of btco by participants of the bitcoin oil distributed ledger network or bitcoin oil network will create one of the first true incentive based ecosystems enabling price stability through coin holder s holding of btcos btco intends to implement such incentive based ecosystems through hodlers rewards btco plans to implement the hodlers rewards in three different tiers and to incorporate these hodlers rewards in btco s algorithm as a reward in the form of btco coins holding tier 1 buying and holding btcos for some time staking tier 2 staking a certain amount of btcos participating tier 3 becoming a key participant of the bitcoin oil network including for example as a validator delegator etc based on these three different tiers btco plans to implement the hodlers rewards as follows i holders of btcos that hold and not transfer their btcos for certain period of time will be able to receive hodlers rewards which represents a tier 1 reward ii holders of btcos that are eligible for tier 1 reward may receive additional hodlers rewards if such holders also stake their btcos for a chance to participate in the operation and security of the bitcoin oil network and iii holders of btcos are eligible for tier 2 reward may receive additional hodlers reward as tier 3 reward if such holders participate in the security and operation of the bitcoin oil network including among other things acting as a validator or delegator we believe that the three tiered reward of the holdlers rewards program will create the right level of incentive to encourage holders of btcos to continue their engagement with the bitcoin oil network on a long term basis no other cryptocurrency offers such a reward structure as part of their algorithm dna btco believes that the hodlers rewards program will likely reduce the price volatility of btco which in turn will result in btco being a uniquely positioned cryptocurrency that will become more useful as a medium of exchange and a reasonably stable store of value hence btco is creating stability through an economy of incentives with an improved structure of bitcoin s blockchain enhanced with entirely new algorithms and technologies btco holders will now for the first time ever not just be rewarded for loyalty but be playing a part in creating a true stable coin in addition btco will introduce its transaction based oil cost which will be paid to btco s network participants analogous to gas prices of other cryptocurrencies the concept of btco s oil cost was developed to keep a distinct value that solely indicates the consumption towards computational expenses on the blockchain to draw an analogy running a real world car for x miles may require y gallons of fuel or moving x amount of money from one bank account to another may cost y dollars in processing fees in both cases x indicates the utility value while y indicates the cost of performing the process of the car trip or financial transaction likewise a transaction on btco may be worth 25 btco x and the fee to process this transaction at that time may be for example 1 100 btco y whereby the actual transaction fee oil cost is determined by the formula oilcost oilconsumed x oilprice hence btco participants who perform the important tasks of verifying and processing a transaction will be awarded this transaction fee oil cost for their computational services as tier 3 reward of hodlers rewards program to a large extent high fees became another problem for bitcoin btc as fees climbed some users looked for alternative cryptocurrencies while others stopped using btc altogether and as btc s transaction fees continued to rise even further more and more users and companies made them a top priority as a result these high fees have encouraged many companies to simply stop using btc and shift to other blockchain networks like litecoin ethereum or bitcoin cash where transaction fees are much lower which is obviously not a positive sign for btc s long term future even though reports show that the average btc transaction fee has fallen to 0 244 as of february 16 2019 this amount is still significantly higher than comparable fees in other networks and still way too high for low cost driven mass transactions especially as btc s fees are highly volatile since its peak on december 23 2017 when the average transaction fee exceeded 54 90 leaving many users extremely skeptical about future btc fees hence btco s innovative oil cost fee structure represents another important market driven innovation which helps on the one hand to drastically increase the cryptocurrency s attractiveness for users e g enabling micro payments and other low cost driven mass transactions on btco and on the other hand to create the right level of incentive through the hodlers rewards program for network participants we are not here to be just another cryptocurrency we are here to be the ultimate evolution of bitcoin hannah paddock btco s chief marketing officer cmo explained often it takes a revolution to create a solution and btco is most certainly doing just that so for the first time a cryptocurrency like btco is creating real stability through loyalty an imperative component to be fit for the future we aim to achieve mass adoption where hundreds of millions of wallets will speak for the strength of our strategy and for the first time in bitcoin history we will avoid extreme volatility and be considered a legitimate medium of exchange for holders of btco hannah paddock continued already in some other cryptocurrencies staking creates an incentive for holders to remain with and continue to participate in such platform as they can earn a percentage of their staked assets on a monthly quarterly or yearly basis what s even more unique about btco s incentive based ecosystem is the so called time warp factor by which the hodlers rewards ratios for holding staking and participating will increase at the end of each full quarter by a pre determined amount the distinctive combination of the time warp factor on the x axis and the fixation of three reward tiers on the y axis is expected to result in greater price stability of the btcos as significant numbers of btco will be locked away and stored off the market for considerable amounts of time which will subsequently and constantly tighten the overall btco supply while bitcoin btc currently pays large amounts of new free bitcoins btc for each newly mined block to its miners btco intends to convert from this unsound pow protocol and implement pos which will enable btco to eliminate such mining based dilution and drastically reduce inflation as future incentives will be differently awarded than current mining rewards hannah paddock outlined this change to pos creates extremely valuable reward capacities and enables btco to optimize the allocation of such rewards by shifting incentives from huge mining monopolists to each and every btco holder on a transparent equal and fair pro rata basis hannah paddock continued primarily the price of btco will be determined by the simple and effective rules of supply and demand as the maximum supply will be capped in general and as the available circulating supply will be reduced in particular through the aforementioned reward structure any market pricing models based on ceteris paribus analysis lead to the assumption that btco s price is going to be more stable and less volatile than the current and historic market of bitcoin btc which btco believes will pave the way for btco s mass adoption this progress is based on the hodlers rewards part of the algorithm which creates stability through loyalty and reward program for participation in the bitcoin oil network daily price swings of 10 to 20 percent or more are not uncommon among bitcoin btc and other major cryptocurrencies making them exceptionally volatile in comparison to fiat currencies or government bonds this inherent volatility means users run the risk of the value of their assets being eroded which has turned out to be one of the major obstacles for bitcoin s btc mass adoption in the last decade rewarding btco holders incentivizes long term retainment of btco which will create the stability bitcoin btc so desperately needs hence btco believes a provable way to temper the historical instability would go a long way for the masses to view btco as the most legitimate version of bitcoin and pave the way for its true mass adoption supplementary incentives for holders will include additional non monetary qualitative bonuses e g btco holders will be
