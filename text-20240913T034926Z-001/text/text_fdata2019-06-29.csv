adamu edward lametek thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe the 267th meeting of the monetary policy committee mpc held against the backdrop of sustained global economic and financial uncertainties drivers of rising risks in the world economy include brexit iran sanctions volatile commodity oil prices as well as the trade war between the united states of 13 america usa and china financial markets have remained on the edge in the face of multiple vulnerabilities connected especially to the dangling us sanctions weak growth prospects and absence of a clear pathway to nondisruptive exit of the united kingdom from the european union eu mindful of these setbacks the international monetary fund imf has further reviewed downwards its projection of global growth for 2019 to 3 3 per cent on the heels of lower growth expectations across developed emerging markets and even developing economies on average growth in the advanced economies is expected to slow to 1 8 per cent in 2019 from 2 2 per cent in 2018 similarly growth in emerging markets and developing economies emdes is expected to moderate to 4 4 per cent from 4 5 per cent in 2018 owing mainly to low commodity prices and likely spillovers from weakening global trade and geo politics amid concerns about global growth trade and financial markets unease most central banks cbs are holding back on policy tightening from the advanced economies the indications are much clearer in europe neither the european central bank ecb nor the bank of england boe is currently looking to increase policy interest rate in april the bank of japan clarified its intension to maintain the extremely low rates into 2020 similarly the us fed had offered guidance to the market suggesting that any future rate hikes would be gradual with global inflation remaining benign central banks appetite for tightening should moderate across board with those in emdes 14 moving gradually towards synchronizing their monetary policy postures with their counterparts in the advanced economies the generally cautious approach to monetary policy underlines the fact the cbs have not forgotten the unwholesome lessons of the last global economic and financial crisis and are therefore quite mindful of current risks to growth and financial stability aligning this global trend with the domestic context increases my persuasion about the merit of protecting growth over the medium term there is no doubt the lingering external vulnerabilities would pressure growth in many developing economies especially through their impact on commodity prices and export demand generally nigeria s oil export already faces both price and demand uncertainties adding to the pressures on aggregate domestic output in q1 2019 real gdp grew by about 2 0 per cent representing moderation when compared with the last quarter of 2018 key indicators suggest expanding economic activity in the second quarter of 2019 albeit slowly both manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis stood at 57 8 and 58 9 points respectively in may 2019 nevertheless the overall outlook for economic growth remains fragile as shown by the cbn s composite index of economic activity cbn ciea owing largely to external risks domestic insecurity and slowing credit to the private sector against this background the current projection of 3 01 per cent real gdp growth for 2019 could prove too optimistic unless growth promoting policies are vigorously pursued clearly economic growth needs to be much better to be able to positively 15 impact unemployment significantly in view of the growing number of new entrants into the labour market given the protracted slack contribution of the oil sector the impetus for speedier economic growth could only be expected to come from the non oil sector in particular agriculture and services will continue to require considerable support to move the economy out of the apparent low growth trap meanwhile traditional pressures on prices appear to be ameliorating notwithstanding the slight uptick in inflation in april banking system liquidity continued to be moderate on account of the bank s sterilization actions omo auctions and foreign exchange sales by the cbn these actions have continued to offset injections from faac repayment of maturing bills and rediscounting of bills consequently broad money supply m3 rose only moderately in march 2019 driven mainly by claims on the federal government in line with the decision of the mpc in march interbank rates obb and ibr moderated on average in april 11 50 and 12 32 relative to march 2019 16 71 and 18 09 however transmission to the entire term structure of interest rates remains a key policy challenge relatedly the foreign exchange fx market continues to be relatively stable on account of sustained supply of fx by the cbn and from autonomous sources consequently the naira exchange rate has remained stable with a positive medium term outlook deriving mainly from the relatively good level of external reserves and prospects of sustained inflow of capital threats to capital inflow are moderate especially as advanced economies tilt monetary 16 policy towards accommodation owing to uncertainties around trade and economic growth given the foregoing background it is not surprising that core inflation has maintained a downward path even as headline inflation rose to 11 37 per cent in april 2019 from 11 25 per cent in march on the month on month basis the headline index increased by 0 94 percent in april 2019 up from 0 79 percent in march the increase in headline inflation came primarily from food inflation which rose to 13 7 per cent in april from 13 45 per cent in march the outlook for inflation up to october 2019 shows relative stability with the headline measure expected to be around 11 0 per cent barring any major shock this outlook is predicated largely on sustained sterilization naira exchange rate stability and early commencement of food harvest in this regard the bank s interventions in agricultural production will continue to be particularly relevant in addressing high food prices in the short to mediumterm in the banking system major financial soundness indicators fsis further improved in april 2019 due mainly to recoveries loan disposals and write offs industry capital adequacy ratio car increased marginally to 15 60 per cent in april 2019 from 15 14 per cent in february 2019 while non performing loans npls decreased to 10 95 per cent from 11 28 per cent however the npls ratio is still higher than the prudential limit of 5 0 per cent other vulnerabilities in the industry include high concentration and contagion risks as well as significant fx exposure these conditions have tended to increase averseness 17 to risk in the industry leading to some form of asset substitution it is especially concerning that credit to the private sector is declining and this needs to be halted and possibly reversed to strengthen economic activity and job creation in arriving at a decision at the may mpc meeting i reckoned that the effects of the downward adjustment of the mpr in march had not fully manifested and that downside risks to growth were quite strong although interbank rates slightly eased in response to the adjustment in the policy rate retail rates remained sticky downwards more importantly credit to the real economy declined in my statements following the immediate past 2 mpc meetings i underscored the need to support growth given the weak outlook for economic activity based on indications from the oil sector external vulnerabilities and sluggish consumption demand i am persuaded to sound a similar tone in this statement given that the outlook for growth and employment continues to be hazy and largely uncertain in view of multiple risks at home and abroad much as openness offers numerous benefits it certainly increases exposure to external risks and vulnerabilities which economic policy must continuously take onboard i perceive at the moment that the external threats to medium term economic stability of nigeria are quite strong meriting a coordinated policy shield in the form of building buffers fiscal and monetary and clear signals to the markets i voted to retain all the policy parameters at their levels prior to the may meeting of the mpc principally to allow some more time for the policy adjustment in march 2019 to fully unleash its effects finally it is important to note that the challenge posed by rising food prices demands action beyond monetary policy and cbn s intervention in the sector as i have stated in the past insecurity and distribution bottlenecks need to be addressed holistically to ease food supply across the country adenikinju adeola festus international economic developments international economic environment has not changed significantly from the last meeting of the mpc in march global economy remains fluid with 19 significant vulnerabilities and uncertainties global growth is projected to slow from 3 6 per cent in 2018 to 3 3 per cent in 2019 given that global economic growth is the most important determinant of evolution of international commodity prices the uncertainties surrounding the health of the global economy is a potential threat to the nigerian economy that depend so much on oil prices and financial flows however in the short term the geopolitical tensions in the middle east the accommodating monetary policy of the feds and in many other western economies and moderation in inflation rates in the advanced economies may positively impact on oil prices and private capital flows to emerging and developing economies hence there is a strong probability that oil price will stay above the budget benchmark price domestic economic developments on the domestic front output growth retains its fragile but positive trajectory in q1 of 2019 the real gdp grew by 2 01 per cent in q1 2019 compared with 1 89 per cent in q1 2018 fueled mainly by the non oil sector the oil sector contracted by 2 4 per cent purchasing manager s index pmi continues its positive trajectory exchange rate across the various windows remain stable with the naira appreciating slightly in the investors and exporters i e segment of the market foreign reserves which stood at us 45 42 billion by mid may still provides respectable import coverage measures of both the output gap and unemployment gap suggest underutilization of domestic resources and spare capacity in the economy headline inflation year on year increased from 11 25 per cent in march 2019 to 11 37 per cent in april 2019 driven largely by food inflation core inflation however fell to 9 30 per cent in april 2019 from 9 46 per cent in march 2019 the rising food price is partly due to seasonal effects and rising insecurity across the country broad money aggregates m3 and m2 performed significantly below their targeted benchmarks in april 2019 reserve money grew by 9 69 per cent month on month in april 2019 this was 13 87 per cent above the q2 2019 provisional benchmark the nigerian stock market underperformed emerging markets stocks on the average in q1 2019 the financial system indicators fsi since the last mpr meeting continue to trend in the right direction the npls ratio is trending downward but is still significantly above prudential benchmark requiring more actions by the central bank and by the dmbs the preference shown by the dmbs for fixed income government assets over credit to the real sector of the economy is worrisome credit to real sector is not only low but decreasing in relative terms in asset portfolio of dmbs and is concentrated on low employment generating sectors banks seems to have abandoned their primary role of intermediation this unhealthy trend should be strongly discouraged banks continue to focus on easy ways of making money including through its various charges on customers and government securities at a time when the economy is in dire needs of banks credit the nigerian economy needs a vibrant consumer credit system in order to drive private consumption and expand domestic supply consumer credit is a 21 major driver of growth in a capitalist economy however the ecosystem and institutions needed for a successful consumer credit system must be established it is also disappointing that the decrease in the mpr in march has not impacted in expected way on rates at the retail end of the credit market although rates on intermediate financial assets decrease maximum and prime lending rates rose in april while rates on consolidated demand savings and terms deposit declined further worsening the gap between the average lending and deposit rates coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy is important to ensure that current policy interventions have the desired impacts on the economy fiscal deficit is high and worrisome government debt is rising in the face of underperforming revenue and security is a major challenge posing significant threat to investment and economic growth one viable way to address revenue under performance is for the government to explore alternative funding sources for infrastructure projects decision there is need to allow the previous cut in the mpr to work itself through the system staff report shows that current mpr is consistent with taylor rule estimates suggesting that the present monetary policy stance appears to be appropriate short and medium term inflationary outlook suggests that inflationary build up is moderate protecting and deepening economic growth rate to reduce high unemployment and poverty in nigeria is quite important i am interested on how the policy direction of the new administration and the implementation of the national minimum wage would impact on the future trajectory of the economy hence i cast my vote to hold the existing monetary policy parameters ahmad aishah n background at the march 2019 meeting the monetary policy committee mpc cut the monetary policy rate by 50 bps to 13 5 per cent following several meeting 23 cycles of a hold in the policy rate this decision was predicated on the need to strengthen the fragile economic recovery and spur stronger output growth in view of the relative price and monetary stability achieved in recent months accelerating domestic output expansion is further supported given worsening global growth prospects and heightened fears of some advanced economies aes slipping into recession in the near future this portends significant headwinds for emerging market and developing economies emdes like nigeria thus in the first mpc meeting since the rate cut my primary considerations were to review developments in key macroeconomic variables particularly inflation exchange rate the factors that support these and examine improvements if any in economic expansion and growth prospects slight uptick in inflation attributed to seasonal effects as the committee focuses on growth it is important to closely monitor any potential negative effects of its monetary policy decisions aimed at stimulating aggregate demand on price and monetary stability its primary remit according to the national bureau of statistics nbs headline inflation year on year inched up 0 12 per cent points in april 2019 to 11 37 per cent due to increase in food inflation from 13 45 per cent to 13 70 per cent over the same period while core inflation declined to 9 30 per cent from 9 46 per cent the nbs attributes increases in food inflation to seasonal factors whilst current increases in the price level was anticipated by bank staff in their inflation outlook issued at the january meeting these submissions indicate that the slight growth in inflation is not a result of the recent rate cut it appears safe to conclude that downside risks to consumer price stability remain low in the medium term nbs maintains that structural not necessarily monetary factors currently hold sway furthermore results of research conducted by bank staff provided at the may meeting indicate positive impact for growth with minimal effects on inflation in the current range of rate cut finally whilst the new minimum wage is a potential headwind for inflation its effects are expected to be benign given persistently low aggregate demand exchange rate stability persists amidst volatile oil prices and portfolio flows a key consideration at the march meeting was the potential effect of a policy rate cut on portfolio flows which have helped buoy the exchange rate and accretion to reserves i e if a lower rate would reduce nigeria s competitiveness relative to other emerging markets spurring flow reversals thereby creating a headwind for the exchange rate stability whilst foreign exchange inflows dipped noticeably in april 2019 net flows remained positive at us 4 7billion reflecting strong investor confidence supported by accommodative policy stance in aes these factors combined with crude oil price levels which have remained above us 60p b over the last six months have supported stability and fueled further accretion to reserves us 45 42 billion as at may 16th 2019 although there is some volatility in crude oil prices along with uncertainty in global growth prospects the naira exchange rate is expected to remain relatively stable in the 25 medium term even in the face of slight easing in domestic monetary conditions domestic output growth positive but weak although real gdp grew by 2 01 per cent in q1 2019 compared with 1 89 per cent in q1 2018 growth remains weak and far below the pre 2016 recession levels of 6 34 per cent q1 2012 suggesting the economy is still at the recovery stage of the business cycle which requires significant stimulus to forestall any reversals similarly the purchasing managers index a leading indicator of gdp performance showed expansion of economic activities but at a slower pace from 58 5 points to 57 7 points in january and april 2019 respectively more importantly unemployment remains high at 23 1 per cent q3 2018 and most projections for nigeria s real gdp growth for 2019 hover around 2 0 3 0 per cent which remain below the levels required to reduce vulnerabilities and improve development outcomes this underscores the importance of significantly stimulating the domestic economy in view of the limited fiscal space whilst supporting growth in the non oil sector which remains the key driver of output growth banks as a catalyst for economic growth this sluggish domestic output growth environment underscores an urgency to dramatically enhance investment and expansion in the real sector via new credit positive financial soundness indicators suggest that the banking industry is well positioned to play a bigger role in this respect industry capital adequacy liquidity and profitability continue to improve whilst non performing loans npls reduced between february and april 2019 this picture of financial resilience is at odds with the current low levels of real sector lending especially in the light of burgeoning lending to government observed in banks outsized subscriptions to risk free treasury securities for instance information from bank staff reveals contraction in credit to the private sector between february and march 2019 even as income from trading activities increased vis a vis a reduction in non interest income from credit activities whilst factors such as residual low risk appetite in the light of recent high levels of npls and significant asset portfolio write offs are duly noted the industry must dramatically increase lending to the real sector to strengthen the economic recovery bolster domestic productivity and create jobs in addition banks are encouraged to ramp up investments in technology to facilitate efficient retail loan distribution and explore using behavioral analysis and artificial intelligence to enhance credit decisions particularly for loans to the informal sector these must be supported by other institutions and initiatives designed to derisk lending to smes such as micro finance banks including the new national micro finance bank collateral registry to expand small and micro credit collateral options and the cbn s interventions in employment elastic sectors like agriculture and more recently textile and creative industries which will help bridge the credit gap and lower lending rates in the long run policy decision notwithstanding relative stability in key macroeconomic indicators we must remain mindful of risks from an increasingly vulnerable global economy the escalating trade war between the united states and china has created stronger headwinds while other familiar headwinds continue to threaten global growth prospects in consideration of these developments the imf has further revised downward global growth projections for 2019 from 3 6 per cent to 3 3 per cent although a 3 3 percent global expansion is relatively reasonable the outlook for many countries remains challenging with considerable uncertainties in the short term especially for oil dependent emdes like nigeria operating within a volatile international crude oil market and constricted fiscal space the foregoing implies a balance of risks tilted against output growth my march 2019 statement emphasized the need to urgently ramp up investments to support growth given the fragile recovery and persistent vulnerabilities however pursuit of stronger growth must be balanced with the imperatives of price and monetary stability the primary mandate of the committee whilst the medium term path of inflation suggests a downward trajectory its current level remains above the target band and thus calls for vigilance furthermore to support the relative fx stability it is critical to maintain an appropriate interest rate that sustains capital inflows in the short term alongside implementing long term initiatives designed to grow fiscal revenues and improve fiscal consolidation 28 as further impact of the rate cut is allowed to manifest the present policy rate maintains stability and creates conditions that support growth and overall economic resilience therefore i vote to retain the current monetary policy stance by keeping mpr at 13 50 cash reserve ratio at 22 5 liquidity ratio at 30 and asymmetric corridor at 200 and 500 basis points around the mpr asogwa robert chikwendu my decision at the march 2019 monetary policy committee meeting the mpr was cut to support economic activity and the decision was largely underpinned by the lower inflationary risks long periods of exchange rate stability and higher levels of external reserves eventhough inflation rates increased marginally in april 2019 due to rising food prices the general expectations as well as cbn staff projection is that lower inflationary pressures are likely to re emerge in the near future amidst this recent marginal inflation uptick and with the increased uncertainty in the external economic environment there may be genuine reasons for moderate monetary tightening these considerations may however not be ideal at this time given that the anticipated gains from the march 2019 mpr cut are yet to fully materialize especially in the credit market in a real sense the monetary policy committee and indeed other policy makers in nigeria at this time still face an increasingly challenging task of supporting growth while reining in possible price increases and moderating any domestic financial market imbalance my opinion is that policy parameters should remain largely unchanged at this may 2019 mpc meeting i will thus vote to retain the mpr at 13 5 retain the crr at 22 5 retain the asymmetric corridor at 200 500 basis points retain the liquidity ratio at 30 0 30 the considerations the key considerations for monetary policy choice at this meeting follows an assessment of two underlying trends global macroeconomic situation domestic economic prospects including the financial market conditions global macroeconomic situation on the global issues trade tensions and policy uncertainties continue to diminish global growth prospects as such growth projections for many developed and developing economies have once again been downgraded for 2019 and 2020 similar to the macroeconomic situation in the last mpc meeting trade tensions have escalated brexit uncertainty has persisted longer than expected geopolitical tensions and domestic political uncertainties have intensified in several regions and there have also been some localized natural and weather related shocks as a result trade and investment have moderated drastically especially in europe and china and the manufacturing sector where global vale chains prevail is expected to remain in this low gear for some time in future in specific terms for 2019 subdued growth is expected in most advanced economies especially those where trade and manufacturing play important roles such as in germany where gdp growth is now projected to remain below 1 percent and japan projected to grow by 1 0 per cent similarly gdp growth for 2019 is expected to moderate in the 31 other euro area countries as well as in china while the forecasts for australia and new zealand have also been revised down slightly in the united states eventhough the momentum of growth was high in the early parts of this year it has since started to moderate as the fiscal policy support earlier introduced begins to wane for the emerging market economies there are diverging trends of growth prospects for 2019 for instance the short term outlook for argentina mexico turkey is expected to be sluggish and subdued as a result of poor investment and industrial production while some moderate growth strengthening is projected for india brazil republic of korea and malaysia the inflationary pressures in many economies appears to have been dampened and generally below central bank targets and in several of these cases caused largely by the weak domestic demand in the us despite the rising wage growth headline inflation still hovers below the 2 per cent target which is similar to europe where inflation remains subdued and it is expected to remain steady in 2019 even with the increasing upward wage pressure in japan inflation has been projected to stay well below the 2 percent target in 2019 and 2020 while across south asia inflation rates are forecast to remain largely similar to the levels in 2018 the monetary policy stances of major central banks across the globe have shifted slightly towards an easier approach reflecting these lower inflationary trend and the slowing levels of economic activity in march 2019 us federal reserve lowered general expectations from two interest rate hikes to none in 2019 while the european central bank has also delayed any possible increase in interest rates until at least 2020 the bank of japan has recently provided strong indications to continue with its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing programme while in china the easing of credit conditions has continued with a further lowering of reserve requirement ratios for banks in early 2019 so as to improve domestic liquidity conditions india has also cut interest rates in february and april of 2019 while in the republic of korea the central bank has removed any reference to a possible monetary policy tightening in the near term similarly few countries in africa angola nigeria egypt gambia ghana malawi have opened monetary policy space by cutting interest rate since the beginning of 2019 so as to support economic activity interestingly the pausing of monetary policy normalization process in the developing economies seems to have also reduced the threats and pressures of capital outflow from these african countries that recently reduced policy rates but many of the countries including nigeria still face the challenge of translating the capital inflows into productive domestic investments domestic economic prospects and financial market imbalances as at may 2019 the macroeconomics dynamics in nigeria remained weak despite moderate gdp upticks in the 2019 q1 thus casting a shadow over the prospects of achieving the economic recovery and growth plan ergp targets as well as the sustainable development goals sdgs more worrisome is the seemingly unpredictable financial market banking debt 33 and stock market conditions even in the midst of rebounding portfolio capital flows to nigeria recent output estimates show that although there was an improvement in real gdp growth in q1 2019 at 2 01 percent when compared to the corresponding period of q1 2018 at 1 89 percent but it fell short of the 2 38 percent growth recorded in q4 2018 while the non oil growth rate declined from 2 70 percent in q4 of 2018 to 2 47 percent in q1 of 2019 the oil growth rate contracted further from 1 62 percent in q4 2018 to 2 40 in q1 of 2019 except for the agricultural and construction sectors which performed better in q1 of 2019 when compared to q4 of 2018 all other sectors including industry trade and services had a sluggish start in 2019 when compared to the last quarter of 2018 the growing output divergence between sectors in nigeria at a time of high unemployment rates and low domestic demand is worrisome and will require fiscal and quasi fiscal government support to complement monetary policy efforts such a combination can address the current output weakness especially the sector divergence and boost long term growth in a sustainable way inflation also remains a crucial macroeconomic challenge in nigeria eventhough there have been relatively subdued pressures in recent times an upward trend emerged in april 2019 as the headline inflation y o y rose to 11 37 percent from 11 25 percent in march 2019 and this was largely due to increases in food prices recent trend show that core inflation has been moderating consistently since april 2018 while food inflation has been largely 34 unpredictable given that the expenditure share of food items in the consumption basket underpinning the consumer price index is high in nigeria then achieving price stability and curbing inflationary pressures in the near term will depend heavily on food price inflation which may sometimes be less sensitive to prevailing market interest rate furthermore financial market conditions have remained poor and sluggish since the start of 2019 and the recent easing of monetary policy at the march 2019 mpc meeting seems not to have stabilized these conditions the all share index and equity market capitalization have maintained continued declines in 2019 similar to 2018 due to poor activity at the primary segment of the market even though there was a temporary rebound of market capitalization by early may the upwards daily movements have not been sustained the expected impact of the mpr cut on other market rates are yet to materialize while maximum lending rate rose by 0 05 percent between march and april 2019 the prime lending rate grew by 3 30 percent the spread between the maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rates according to cbn staff report stood at 26 56 percent in april 2019 which is huge while the continued daily volatility in the interbank and obb interest rates also does not yet depict any correlation with the monetary policy rate mpr of importance is the current trend in total bank credit which also seems not to have responded to the march monetary policy shifts as staff report show a decline between march and april 2019 in addition the bank profitability indicators responded poorly to the easing of monetary policy and 35 have remained volatile even though such soundness indicators as capital adequacy ratio and non performing loans ratio are on the positive trajectory while it may appear too early for the monetary policy rate cut in march 2019 to have reduced some short term risks on the financial market so as to guarantee improved credit supply additional monetary policy rates cut now are unlikely to reverse credit trend or even boost domestic demand rather there is a short term likelihood that it could spur additional financial market imbalances which may further raise the risks to financial stability given this limited monetary policy space a moderate fiscal stimulus but with less elevated public debt levels would be very useful for further bolstering growth in critical underperforming sectors of the economy balami dahiru hassan the global economy is being challenged by familiar headwinds which include the following trade tensions between the united states of america us and key allies such as the china and the european union eu unsuccessful negotiation between the us and north korea secondary sanction against iran heightened uncertainty around brexit negotiations diminishing pace of normalisation in the us monetary policy european central bank ecb returning to monetary accommodation and uk refraining from monetary normalisation the above headwinds have implications on the nigerian economy growth global output growth in 2019 is expected to moderate to 3 3 percent down from 3 6 and 3 8 percent in 2018 and 2017 respectively in the advanced economies growth is projected at 1 8 percent for emerging markets and developing economies emdes it is projected at 4 4 percent while for sub saharan africa output growth is estimated at 3 5 percent in 2019 against 3 0 percent in the previous year it should be noted that the potential output growth is driven partly by strong total factor productivity tfp and capital accumulation in china and other emerging market economies such as india due to technological growth and economic efficiency the output growth in q1 2019 by country showed that the us economy slowed to 3 2 percent in q1 2019 in china output continued to slow down due to the effects of us trade tariffs and the rebalancing programme the expectation on the nigerian and the south african economies is that they may continue on the path of recovery but at a slow pace due to volatility in price of crude oil for south africa problem of power supply and labour issues may weigh on growth it is worth noting that the gross domestic product gdp in 2018 in selected advanced economies the euro area united kingdom uk and japan slowed down the direction of world trade continues to be characterised by heightened trade tension thus depressing global trade volume by 1 7 percent month on month in february from 2 1 percent in january 2019 inflation in terms of inflation the advanced economies are locked up in low inflation trap while the emdes are in high inflation trap each responding appropriately to their economic environment in euro area inflation inched up moderately to 1 7 per cent in april 2019 from 1 4 percent in the previous month the european central bank s ecb s new requirement of monetary accommodation kicked in following indication of weakening macroeconomic fundamentals in japan inflation remained low in spite of continued government stimulation inching up marginally to 0 5 percent in march 2018 from 0 2 percent in the previous month as food transport and housing prices increased moderately similarly inflation in the uk continued to trend below bank of england boe long run target of 2 0 percent remaining flat at 1 9 percent in march 2019 while there were mixed price development in emerging market and developing economies inflation rates in most countries reviewed moved 38 upwards with the exception of egypt in india inflation was projected at 3 9 percent in 2019 up from 3 5 percent in 2018 in china inflation forecast for 2019 indicate a 2 3 percent rise in consumer prices from the 2 1 percent figures in 2018 due to expected rise in food prices inflation in ghana rose to 9 5 percent in april 2019 from 9 3 percent in the prior month in egypt inflation rate fell to 13 percent in april 2019 from 14 2 percent in the prior month reaching its lowest level since january 2019 in brazil inflation rose further to 4 94 percent in april 2019 from 4 54 per cent in the previous month and slightly below market expectations of 5 0 per cent across advanced economies given the fall in commodity prices inflation is likely to remain muted it is expected that currency depreciation in some emdes could pass through to higher domestic prices and partially offset downward pressure on low commodity prices exchange rates generally most currencies depreciated against the us dollar as shown by data on the global financial markets in europe the british pound and the euro depreciated against the us dollar by 0 92 and 0 60 percent respectively between march 29 and april 26 2019 in asia the japanese yen the chinese yuan and the indian rupee all depreciated marginally against the us dollar by 0 68 0 25 and 1 24 percent respectively over the same period in north america the canadian dollar depreciated by 0 79 percent while the mexican peso appreciated 2 59 percent in south america the brazilian real argentine peso and colombian peso all depreciated against the us dollar by 39 0 28 5 62 and 1 61 percent in africa the naira remained relatively flat against the dollar in the review period south africa s rand and egyptian pound and ghanaian cedi appreciated by 0 76 0 86 and 0 05 percent kenyan shilling however depreciated against dollar by 0 68 percent the pass through effect of depreciation can be inflationary if not properly handled policy rates from march 2019 and may 2019 central banks survey revealed that only nigeria reduced her policy rates while others held their policy rate constant these included the fed bank of england ecb reserve bank of india bank of japan and peoples bank of china all of which retained their policy rate in response to the prevailing uncertainties in the global economy the global development have implications for the domestic economy for example the weakening signal from the oil future market will affect the cbn ability to support the naira if oil spot prices follow the direction of the futures market this shows the need to build buffers to enable the cbn respond to anticipated changes in the global economy capital flows to emerging market economies such as nigeria may likely increase particularly if the post election security situation in the country improves cbn should work closely with the fiscal authority to improve the investment climate there is need to monitor current portfolio investment inflows into nigeria which are being lumped up at short end of the yield curve domestic level at the domestic level factors such as volatility in crude oil prices high npls infrastructure deficit low capacity for revenue generation and insecurity such as boko haram herders farmer conflicts kidnaping and cybercrime hampered economic activities the growth in the economy is driven by the non oil sector which grew from 2 87 percent in first quarter of 2018 to 2 4 percent in the first quarter of 2019 the economy registered a positive growth rate of 2 01 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 which was far below the potential productive base of the economy the growth rate is weak as it is below the population growth rate of 2 82 percent thus reflecting a fall in per capita output increase in output growth is extremely critical for the growth of the economy further on domestic developments the current inflation rate of 11 37 percent is above the cbn target of 6 9 per cent unemployment in the economy is above the natural rate of unemployment nairu to promote growth and reduce inflation there is need for demand side and supply side management policies to be formulated and implemented it has been identified that there is demand gap in the economy and therefore banks should embrace consumer credit this would impact on consumption production and growth in the economy private credit bureau or system be created engage stakeholders to contribute their quota and how to honour their obligations and alternative dispute resolution system be established the 41 credit channel for monetary policy will aid growth and will have high impact in housing mining and transportation value chain banking industry financial soundness the capital adequacy ratio car improved from a low of 15 14 percent in february 2019 to 15 60 percent in april 2019 this is remarkable because it is slightly above the prudential requirement by 0 60 percentage point on the non performing loans npls ratio there was improvement as the ratio declined from 11 28 percent in february 2019 to 10 95 percent in april 2019 the reduction in the npls was driven by write offs and recoveries there was also increase in provisioning by banks for npls in the review period similarly the industry liquidity ratio lr rose further from 51 05 percent in february 2019 to 52 61 percent in april 2019 this performance was 4 81 percentage points higher when compared with of the ratio at end april 2018 overall the nigerian banking sector remains sound and resilient policy decision the decision taken was based on developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environment given the above i am of the opinion that we hold but advised that consumer credit should be pursued vigorously to promote growth there is need for sustained policy support because gdp growth is still fragile 42 i therefore vote to i retain mpr at 13 5 percent ii retain the crr at 22 5 percent iii retain the lr at 30 percent and iv retain the asymmetric corridor of 200 500 basis points isa dutse mahmoud a introduction the waning momentum in the global economy which became evident in the second half of 2018 is expected to intensify in 2019 this scenario is directly attributable to a confluence of factors plaguing key advanced and emerging economies such as the escalating trade tensions between the us and china that saw tariffs jump from 10 to 25 the enforcement of iranian sanctions the uncertainty of a no deal brexit the underperformance of some key economies in europe and the continuing effort at re balancing the chinese economy away from external demand and credit driven investment to higher domestic demand on the domestic front the economy is still confronted with headwinds that threaten sustainable growth external economic conditions the seemingly unending whirlwinds buffeting the global economy led the imf to cut its global growth estimate for 2019 from 3 6 to 3 3 which represents the third time the imf has downgraded its growth forecast within a period of six months in tandem with the slowing global economy global trade in goods and services will increase at a weaker rate of 3 4 in 2019 as compared with the 3 8 growth achieved in 2018 growth in the advanced economies is expected to decline from 2 2 in 2018 to 1 8 in 2019 the key economic blocs accounting for the slide include the 44 us where growth will plummet to 2 3 in 2019 down from 2 9 in 2018 the euro area that will see output nose dive to 1 3 in 2019 compared with 1 8 in the previous year in line with the global pattern economic growth in emerging market and developing economies emdes is to witness marginal deceleration from 4 5 in 2018 to 4 4 in 2019 which is a reflection of the continuing slowdown in the chinese economy it is worth noting that the softening industrial production in the world s major economies and the weakening global demand lead to reduced international trade with broad implications for primary commodity exporting countries like nigeria where potential decline in exports may result in falling aggregate demand output and employment moreover the expansionary policy response to the growth conundrum by the advanced economies range from monetary accommodation in the euro area to no rate hike in the us and uk and outright lowering of rate in new zealand with implications for financial market development in emdes given that policy normalization is no longer on the front burner the moderation in the speed of financial flows into us dollar denominated assets is expected to remain while correspondingly inflows into emdes are expected to rise the increasing portfolio flows into the nigerian economy will continue to support and further sustain the relative stability in the foreign exchange market consequently import induced inflationary pressures will remain subdued in the foreseeable future in nigeria 45 the international price of crude oil is projected to remain above 60 barrel in 2019 and is now hovering around 70 barrel with this favourable swing there is re kindled hope that nigeria can build fiscal buffers increase foreign reserves and facilitate stability in the foreign exchange market domestic economic conditions the recent data from the national bureau of statistics nbs underscores the fragility in domestic economy with a real gdp growth of 2 01 in q1 2019 which was 0 37 percentage point less than the 2 38 recorded in q4 2018 the same trend is evident on a disaggregated basis as the contraction in the oil sector growth rate worsen from 1 62 in q4 2018 to 2 40 in q1 2019 while the non oil sector growth declined by 0 23 percentage point from 2 7 in q4 2018 to 2 47 in q1 2019 these are pointers to the existence of spare productive resources in the economy thus the unemployment rate remains high as cbn in house research reveals the yawning gap between the unemployment rate and the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu therefore there is need for a multi pronged approach to address the binding constraints to rapid and inclusive growth the data from nbs indicates that there is a gradual build up in inflationary pressures as headline core and food inflation month on month rose to 0 94 0 70 and 1 14 in april 2019 from 0 79 0 53 and 0 88 in march 2019 respectively on a year on year basis the outcome is mixed as headline inflation stood at 11 37 in april 2019 compared with 11 25 in the previous month while core inflation fell by 0 16 percentage point and food 46 inflation rose by 0 25 percentage point between march and april 2019 respectively the annual headline inflation rate for april 2019 is not particularly alarming when compared with the 11 37 and 11 44 of january 2019 and december 2018 respectively nevertheless an appropriate policy mix should be put in place to nip this developing inflationary pressure in the bud against the backdrop of the numerous upside risks to inflation which include upward adjustments in wages and salaries high liquidity injections arising from the continuing implementation of the 2018 fgn budget and increased liquidity prompted by massive interventions high inflow of capital and home remittances on a salutary note the current level of external reserves of over 44 billion and the moderately high price of crude oil in the international market provides the platform for sustainable foreign exchange rate stability in the near term and mechanisms to rein in imported inflation broad monetary aggregates m3 and m2 increased during the reporting period even though they exhibited significant negative deviations underperformed from their indicative benchmarks in april 2019 m3 and m2 at 5 42 and 1 85 were 9 05 and 11 14 percentage points below the 2019 benchmarks of 14 47 and 12 99 respectively maximum and prime lending rates however increased from 30 83 and 14 92 in march 2019 to 30 89 and 18 23 in april 2019 respectively these developments have negative implications for credit extension to the real sector the banking system development is mixed as the industry performed well in the areas of good capital adequacy cost effective operations high liquidity 47 and robust returns on investments however while the deposits and liquidity trends increased progressively the total credit growth remained negative and new credits fell in terms of value against the background of declining non performing loans npls even though these still remain high the falling trend in new credits in q1 2019 correlates well with the increase in real gdp at a decreasing rate during the first quarter of 2019 at this time the poor credit delivery to the private sector by banks cannot be attributed to low system liquidity because the converse is the case it is thus inappropriate to contemplate a further policy rate cut as this will add fuel to the liquidity overhang and jeopardize the price stability mandate of the bank especially in the light of the uptick in the general price level in april 2019 it is more appropriate to decisively deal with the numerous factors which account for the high level of npls in the system to create a conducive environment for banks to lend for both production and consumption voting decision a loosening policy option will appear time inconsistent there is need to allow a reasonable time lag to judge the impact of the recent policy rate cut moreover any further rate cut will aggravate liquidity problems and will be out of tune with the buildup of inflationary pressures on the other hand a rate increase is likely to undercut the nascent growth in output and exacerbate the high level of unemployment and underemployment in the economy therefore i voted to retain all existing policy parameters as follows mpr at 13 50 per annum the asymmetric corridor at 200 500 basis points around the mpr liquidity ratio at 30 0 per annum crr at 22 5 per annum nnanna okwu joseph growth remains muted amidst sub optimal credit to the private sector and commercial banks preference for public sector lending aggregate demand was relatively weak and the financial conditions reveal a banking industry overwhelmed by adverse selection and risk aversion data from the nbs reveal that real gdp grew by 2 01 per cent in 2019q1 relative to 2 38 per cent in 2018q4 and 1 89 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018 against this backdrop the need to diversify the productive base by channeling more resources to the agricultural sector cannot be overstated despite the reduction in non performing loans npls credit to growth enhancing sectors continued to be weak at 5 42 per cent growth in april 2019 compared to end december 2018 broad money m3 was below target and inadequate to significantly drive growth though banking industry data reveal that non performing loans npls remain elevated its downward trend indicates that the industry remains resilient despite the soundness of the sector growth in credit to the core private sector was tepid at 9 79 per cent in april relative to end december 2018 at 64 4 per cent growth credit to government was significantly crowding out the private sector money market rates were relatively stable with modest oscillations in line with liquidity conditions incipient inflationary pressures persist on account of structural and food supply shocks headline inflation year on year increased marginally after three consecutive months of decline to 11 37 in april 2019 from 11 25 per cent in march 2019 similarly food inflation rose to 13 70 per cent year on year from 13 45 per cent in the same period however core inflation declined to 9 30 per cent from 9 50 per cent in march 2019 with this development i see strong merit in pursuing tight monetary policy in the short run while ensuring that farmers and operators in the agricultural value chain space are adequately funded the fiscal space to scale up well targeted capital expenditure was further constrained by rapidly growing public sector debt rising debt service obligations and low revenue collections these developments represent headwinds to the implementation of the n8 92 trillion 2019 budget and achievement of inclusive growth accordingly the urgent need to enhance the fiscal buffer cannot be overemphasized the balance of payments continued to be viable supporting external reserves accretion and exchange rate stability a balance of payment surplus of us 0 002 billion was recorded in 2018q4 while external reserves of us 45 42 billion was achieved this performance revealed resilience which will sustain investors confidence and bolster exchange rate stability despite the overwhelming need to grow the economy pursuing an expansionary monetary policy at this juncture is contemporaneously time 50 inconsistent what is needed is a combination of fiscal and structural policies to improve the infrastructure deficits and diversify the productive base of the economy thus i vote to retain the current policy metrics obadan mike idiah as at the last monetary policy committee meeting held in march 2019 there were indications of strong concerns about the effects of uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the global economy on global economic activity financial flows and economic policies the uncertainties related to the likelihood of the us economy going into recession in 2020 non resolution of issues surrounding brexit weakening growth in europe as major economies like germany italy and france are confronted with internal weaknesses slowing growth in china due to the impact of its trade war with the us and tighter financial regulations amongst others these developments conditioned domestic policy measures in particular monetary measures across the globe global economic developments the above uncertainties across the global economy arising from various economic and political developments had not abated by the time of the mpc meeting on 20th and 21st may 2019 indeed they had intensified in some cases the concerns about them derive from their implications for growth and trade volumes both for the global economy and individual economies as well as monetary policy directions examples are the following downgrading of global output growth in light of the uncertainties and vulnerabilities global growth in 2019 has been further revised downward by the international monetary fund imf to 3 3 per cent from the earlier 3 5 compared to 3 6 percent in 2018 this is against the backdrop of the advanced economies that are expected to lead 52 growth in 2019 continuing to contend with uncertainties looming around them output growth in this group of economies has been further downgraded by the imf from 2 2 percent in 2018 to 1 8 percent in 2019 from an earlier 2 0 percent projection the speculation that the us economy may dip into recession sometime in 2020 remains relatively strong while the european central bank ecb has revised its growth forecasts for 2019 and gave indications of some recovery as it returned to monetary accommodation in the wake of macroeconomic weaknesses observed in the first quarter of the year growth in the emerging market and developing economies emdes is projected to slow moderately to 4 4 percent in 2019 from 4 5 percent in 2018 other major world economies are projected to have mixed growth performance china is expected to continue to weaken to 6 3 percent in 2019 from a peak of 6 6 percent in 2018 while india is projected to have a robust growth of 7 3 percent in 2019 up from 7 1 percent in 2018 ghana is projected to have moderate growth in 2019 while kenya s growth is projected to decline to 5 8 percent in 2019 from the growth of 6 0 percent in 2018 continued trade war between the us and china recently following the apparent breakdown of trade negotiations the us raised tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on us 200 0 billion goods imported from china in retaliation china has announced plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on us 60 0 billion imports from the us even though president donald trump has indicated readiness to enter into trade negotiations 53 with china it appears the stage is set for a tariff trade war which may ultimately benefit no one as prices shoot up in both countries volumes of trade fall and consumer welfare is sharply eroded in contrast the us has eliminated high tariffs on steel and aluminum from mexico and canada to pave the way for a new trade deal this notwithstanding the direction of world trade continues to be characterized by heightened trade tensions which depress global trade phenomenon of slowly rising inflationary pressures price development in the advanced economies has remained muted and indeed trending below 2 0 percent in some key advanced economies while in the emdes it averaged 4 9 percent with prices receding faster in some of the economies and much slower in some others many central banks have receded into a dovish stance with respect to a possible return to monetary accommodation in the face of signs of weakness in the global economy uncertainties around brexit in the united kingdom uncertainties surrounding brexit have persisted with the increasing likelihood of a nodeal brexit and a second referendum the prospects of a second referendum has become higher on the agenda even though the european union has further extended the exit date to october 2019 meanwhile investors appear to have adopted a wait and see posture with british and european assets as developments around brexit unfold gradually volatility of oil prices remain the price of bonny light on may 7 2019 stood at us 61 85 per barrel compared with us 67 48 per barrel on march 13 2019 and the opening price of us 45 41 per barrel on january 1 2019 even though the reduction in production of oil by both opec and non opec members by 1 2 million barrels per day effective from january 2019 has contributed to the recent uptick in oil prices the increasing investment in shale oil production by the us remains a significant threat to future oil price increases us crude oil production is reported to have averaged 12 1 million barrels per day in march 2019 it is forecast to average 12 4 and 13 1 million barrels per day in 2019 and 2020 respectively futures market data suggest that the price of crude oil will fall to just over us 60 0 in 2021 and if russia declines to back an extension of the production cut agreement at the end of june as has been indicated oil prices may become much lower in line with the expectations of the us oil production strategy and to the detriment of the oil exporting countries all the above point to a global economy that is grappling with challenging times the developments have several implications some of which are sources of concern generally weak growth leads to a slowdown in global aggregate demand and weak export revenue the growth concerns have led many central banks to adopt dovish stances on monetary policy such that policy rates are being maintained or reduced the us federal reserve bank fed has abandoned its initial forward guidance of at least two policy rates hikes in 2019 the fed no longer sees any compelling need to adjust the policy rate in either direction while it is jealous of its independence visa vis president trumps attempted interference the fed is not unmindful of indications of the likelihood of the economy going into recession in 2020 and the consequent need for monetary accommodation generally because of the weak growth projections and the need to avert recession and generate employment most central banks have gone into accommodation mode by keeping the policy rates constant or reducing it out of 14 central banks surveyed by the cbn between march and april 2019 two of them central bank of nigeria and reserve bank of india reduced policy rates while the others held the rates constant with the return of ecb to monetary accommodation and the us and uk moving away from normalization of monetary policy in the shortterm capital flows to emdes such as nigeria may likely increase this requires creating the necessary conditions for this to materialize o the uncertainty associated with brexit negotiations and the us mercantilist trade policy towards its trading partners particularly china europe mexico and canada has a significant negative impact on trade and investment flows resulting in the slowdown of the global economy thus at a time of increasing vulnerabilities in the global economy with possible negative implications for domestic economies nigeria s monetary policy direction would have to take cognizance of the economy s slow recovery from recession and the need to improve growth performance as well as employment generation poverty reduction and overall economic diversification specific developments in the domestic economy are also important in determining policy direction domestic economic developments gdp growth performance well thought out fiscal monetary trade and other policies as well as recovery of the world oil market moved the economy out of recession since the second quarter of 2017 but the growth attained remains low and fragile very much below the economy s potential and below the country s worrisome high population growth rate the growth rate has also tended to fluctuate standing at 1 81 2 38 and 2 01 percent in quarters 3 and 4 2018 and quarter 1 in 2019 respectively the baseline growth projections for the economy in 2019 are also below 3 0 percent although the annual budget puts the average at 3 01 percent however the output gap suggests room to expand the economy and make it to grow fast the gap can be closed when the economy is stimulated with appropriate policy measures including monetary accommodation in this regard the major focus would be the non oil sector which has continued to drive growth inflation rate the headline inflation rate increased marginally in april 2019 after three months january february and march of successive moderation the year on year headline inflation rate stood at 11 37 percent in april compared to 11 25 percent in march the month on month headline inflation rate also inched up from 0 79 percent in march to 0 94 percent in april but the year on year core inflation rate reduced while the month on month core inflation rate inched up the price of food and non alcoholic beverages was the primary source of the uptick in headline inflation as the prices of most other items remained constant the uptick in headline inflation at this time is not unexpected considering that the harvest season has gradually been replaced by planting farming season supply challenges have begun to surface compounded by farmers herders conflict which has impacted food supply negatively this factor along with other structural impediments to agricultural production would need to be effectively addressed the central bank of nigeria s heterodox policy interventions in agriculture manufacturing and smes development would need to be sustained to boost domestic production food security dampen inflation expectations raise employment reduce poverty and advance the economic diversification objective banking system performance the available data indicate that improvements have continued to be recorded in capital asset based financial soundness indicators capital adequacy ratio liquidity ratio and non performing loans ratio npl nevertheless the npl ratio is still high and above the 58 prudential limit and even though the return on equity and return on asset showed decline between february and april 2019 they are still high compared to comparator countries where efficiency and management levels are much higher the assets of the banking industry have continued to trend upwards driven by increased investment in government securities this leads us to the issue of concern in the industry s asset structure the proportion of government securities in the banking industry s asset structure is growing while that of loans and advances is declining loans and advances are being displaced by banks investment in government securities which have become seductive to them because of their high yields and risk free nature this cannot be allowed to continue as it implies abandonment of their primary mandate of intermediation to the detriment of production distribution and exchange that are yearning for loans financing even though the number of new credits increased strongly in april 2019 compared to december 2018 the value of such credits is much lower while the credit is highly concentrated in a few obligors therefore a way must be found to limit banks purchase of government securities so that they can focus on their primary functions of deposit mobilization and lending at the same time the central bank would need to expedite the implementation of its planned measures aimed at assisting the banks to minimize non performing loans and boosting loans repayments this will further encourage the banks to focus on delivering on their primary mandate of intermediation and hence avoid crowding out the non bank public in the government securities market government s fiscal operations these have been characterized by weak revenue mobilization unstable and inadequate oil revenue receipts and fiscal deficits year in year out government revenue projections are not realized while expenditures are large resulting in huge fiscal deficits public debt accumulation and pressure on the monetary authority the fiscal deficit in 2018 was n3 6 trillion financed by domestic borrowing external borrowing and the monetary authority net deficit consequently the country s public debt has grown and become highly worrisome with debt servicing accounting for a very significant proportion of revenue and the annual budget the total public debt as at december 31st 2018 stood at n24 387 trillion with external debt accounting for 32 percent as the country would not like to return to the pre 2005 era of external debt crisis control must be exercised on future foreign borrowing while efforts are further intensified to grow the economy diversify the revenue base and mobilise significant nonoil revenue greater stability will be achieved when the country begins to rely more on taxation rather than unstable oil receipts to finance development opinion this opinion takes cognizance of the foregoing especially the need to strengthen growth and economic diversification it also takes cognizance of the staff quantitative assessments of the impacts of the various monetary policy options relating to loosening tightening and maintenance of the status quo even though the inflation rate inched up in april the assessments show that a reduction in the monetary policy rate mpr would accelerate gdp growth moderate inflation rate while the monetary aggregates would not 60 exceed their provisional benchmarks for 2019 the interbank call rates for the entire 2019 would be lower than what prevailed in the second quarter consequently i vote to reduce the mpr by 25 basis points while holding the other monetary policy indicators cash reserve requirements liquidity ratio and asymmetric corridor at their extant levels sanusi aliyu rafindadi decision my decision to vote for a hold in today s meeting was informed by the need for monetary policy stance to rein in inflation sustain the relative exchange stability and support output recovery although the increase in the headline inflation year on year in april 2019 driven mainly by food prices may appear to suggest that the inflationary process was driven by supply side and structural factors available data and as well as staff estimates of the nairu and output gap suggest that monetary policy demand side measure can be efficacious in taming the sticky inflation further analysis of the available data and empirical evidence from the staff estimates therefore shows to further reduce inflation from its current low double digit level and boost output growth without compromising the relative stability of the exchange rate or reduce reserve accretion a delicate mix of supply side and demandside policies are required my vote to hold the rate at 13 5 was informed by the conviction that aggressive pursuit of the heterodox policy measures could boost the short run aggregate supply through interventions that increase low cost credit supported by increased effective demand through interventions that increase consumer credit 62 background and justification global economic developments global output is expected to slow down in 2019 while inflation would decline in advanced economies but marginally rise in emerging markets and developing economies emdes consequently the dovish monetary stance in the key advanced economies could in the short to medium term raise capital flows to the emerging and developing economies the global economic environment continued to face uncertainties resulting from escalation of the trade war between us and china breakdown of brexit negotiations new us sanctions on iran tensions on the korean peninsular rising public corporate debt in some emdes as well as rising vulnerabilities in major financial markets these have has resulted in the downgrade of global output growth by the imf to the 3 3 percent in 2019 compared with the 3 3 percent achieved in 2018 the downgrade resulted from the expected slowdown in advanced economies which were projected to grow by 1 8 percent in 2019 compared with the 2 2 per cent achieved in 2018 this is mainly because of the projected slowdown of growth in the euro area to 1 3 in 2019 from 1 8 in 2018 and the us to 2 3 in 2019 from 2 9 in 2018 growth in emdes is also projected to slow down to 4 4 percent in 2019 compared with the 4 5 percent achieved in 2018 mainly due to the expected slowdown of the chinese economy as a result of the trade war from 1 5 q on q in q1 2019 to 1 4 in q1 2018 inflation in the key advanced economies is trending below the 2 target in euro zone at 1 7 in april 2019 the uk 1 9 in march 2019 japan 0 5 in march 2019 and is on target in the us at 2 in april 2019 inflation is forecasted to moderate to 1 6 percent in 2019 from the 2 0 percent achieved in 2018 these price development coupled with the projected slowdown in output growth have prompted many central banks in advanced economies to adopt a dovish monetary policy stance with the possibility of return to monetary accommodation in the near to medium term the recent cut in policy rate by the reserve bank of new zealand could be marking the beginning of a coordinated response to the expected slowdown of the global economy the bloomberg s global financial conditions index shows that global financial conditions are easing thereby threating to raise global financial market vulnerabilities the rise of merrill lynch global financial stress index also suggests an increased global financial market stress due to volatilities in the futures markets arising from the heightened us china trade war tensions crude oil price volatility is expected to continue on the account of the unrests in libya tensions in the middle east threats on military action on iran rising stock piles of us shale oil as well as fears of depressed global output growth as the future direction of oil price is unclear the likelihood of rising exchange rate pressures in oil exporting economies also remain uncertain these developments have a number of clear implications for nigeria first the possibility of a return to monetary in major advanced economies suggests 64 that capital flows from the advanced economies to emdes may increase this underscores the need for the real yields on the naira denominated assets need to remain positive secondly the uncertainties in directions of the oil market remains a source of concern especially for exchange pressures should the downside risks to global output heighten thirdly these developments are clear signals for nigeria to intensify efforts aimed at diversifying the economy and government revenue away from the oil sector implications of the domestic economic developments the available data forecasts and staff estimates reveal that domestic output has risen and is expected to continue to rise real output remains below its potential level unemployment lies below the nairu and inflation has risen and is expected to rise amidst tightening monetary condition the combination of these developments suggests that the economy may be stuck in a short run equilibrium that requires both demand and supply side policies to simultaneously reduce inflation and unemployment as well as increase output in the near term data shows that domestic real output has sustained a positive trend since the fourth quarter of 2017 real output grew by 1 98 percent in 2018 compared with 0 82 percent in 2017 quarterly output has also significantly increased growing by 2 01 percent the first quarter of 2019 compared to 1 89 percent in q1 2018 the growth was driven by the non oil sector which grew by 2 47 65 percent while the oil sector actually contracted by 2 4 percent forecasts show that output growth is expected to rise throughout 2019 culminating into an annual growth rate of 2 3 percent for the year inflation y on y which has increased from 11 25 percent in march 2019 to 11 37 percent in april 2019 is expected to moderate until august 2019 the rise in inflation was driven by food prices which grew by 13 7 percent in april from 13 45 percent in march 2019 while core inflation moderated on a month on month basis however both core and food inflation increased during the period this underscores the importance of supply side and structural factors in the inflationary process in addition staff estimates show that the real output has been below its potential level since the second quarter of 2016 while the unemployment rate lies above the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu amidst rising inflation and rising output these estimates of potential output and nairu suggest that the dynamics of output and inflation can be approximated by the comparative statics depicted in the simplified ad as framework in figure 1 for the purpose of evaluating policy options as indicated in the figure the current inflation rate πt and real output yt are determined by the short run equilibrium e1 at which the short run aggregate supply curve as0 intersects the aggregate demand ad0 this short run equilibrium located to the right of the long run equilibrium e0 determine the current real output yt that is below its longrun potential and current inflation rate πt that is above its long run target π the unemployment rate associated with the current output will be below the nairu obtainable when yt yp as can be seen therefore to 66 simultaneously reduce the current inflation and raise real output or reduce unemployment a combination of demand management and supply side policies are required tightening alone for instance will shift the ad to the left thereby reducing inflation but will also reduce output easing would shift the ad to the right and raise output and reduce unemployment but will also raise inflation an effective policy strategy could be to use a targeted monetary policy intervention that increases lending to the real sector at the prevailing interest rate to support production which will shift the short run as to the right while holding the ad this could be achieved if quantity of lending can be significantly increased at the current interest rates the basis for my policy choice in the light of above analysis i voted to hold the rate because a loosening to support output would raise the inflation rate in the process while tightening to reduce inflation would reduce output and raise unemployment i therefore voted for a hold with the conviction that the central bank would intensify its development finance interventions and other heterodox policies that support the supply side so that both lower inflation and faster output growth can be achieved simultaneously consequently i voted to retain the mpr at 13 50 percent retain the crr at 22 5 percent retain the asymmetric corridor at 200 500 basis points and retain liquidity ratio at 30 0 percent proshare nigeria pvt ltd shonubi folashodun a global economic developments economic fundamentals in some advanced economies developed more positively than expected in the first quarter of 2019 growth in the united states united kingdom and the euro area were higher in 2019q1 compared with the levels in 2018q4 germany and japan recorded positive growth against zero growth and contraction in 2018q4 respectively however a number of downside risks may constitute drag to global growth going forward re ignition of trade war between the us and china breakdown of negotiation on brexit and subdued international trade flows have dimmed the horizon on global growth with the exception of india which had marginally higher growth china brazil russia and south africa slowed in 2019q1 thus the international monetary fund projected global growth at 3 3 per cent in 2019 weo april 2019 inflation trended below the 2 0 per cent target in the advanced economies and generally averaged 4 9 per cent in emerging and developing economies highlighting potential for higher growth to push inflation to target levels these developments have implications for capital and investment flows as well as demand for emdes including nigeria domestic economic environment recent uptick in inflation in april 2019 after the downward trend in 2019q1 reflected mainly the effect of seasonal factor rather than a resurgence of 69 fundamental inflationary pressure headline inflation on year on year basis inched up to 11 37 per cent in april 2019 from 11 25 per cent in march 2019 this was due wholly to the rise in food inflation to 13 70 per cent from 13 45 per cent in march 2019 on account of seasonal factors including commencement of the planting season and insecurity in some parts of the food producing states which had disrupted production and distribution of food items sustained decline in core inflation so far in 2019 highlighted the muted effect of exchange rate pass through as a result of generally stable exchange rate driven by expansion in the non oil sector output growth remained weak and fragile with potentials for further non inflationary growth through both expansionary fiscal and accommodative monetary policy real gross domestic product gdp growth at 2 01 per cent in 2019q1 compared with 2 38 per cent in 2018q4 reflected the 2 47 per cent expansion in the non oil sector with the major growth drivers being agriculture and services sectors contraction in the oil sector was the major drag on output growth as a result of below target production amidst positive development in international oil price continued expansion of composite purchasing managers indices pmi for manufacturing and non manufacturing sectors underscores the impact of sustained exchange rate stability on business planning and intermediate goods pricing overall real output was well below the potential level highlighting the need for greater aggressiveness of fiscal and monetary 70 policy measures that promote expansion of economic activities in the face of increasing population and unemployment growth in the monetary aggregates was characterised by mixed trends with the narrow measures of money supply generally underperforming while sustained increase in securitized money pushed growth of the broader measure of money beyond the benchmark growth in broad money supply m3 relative to the level at end december 2018 was 5 42 per cent at endapril 2019 annualised to 16 26 per cent against the benchmark of 14 47 per cent though net domestic credit ndc and time and savings deposits grew by 19 31 and 6 53 per cent respectively in april 2019 narrow money supply m1 contracted by 4 26 per cent while m2 underperformed at 1 85 per cent annualised to 5 54 per cent compared with the benchmark of 12 99 per cent the less than target growth in m2 and contraction of m1 despite the significant growth in ndc highlights the persistent disconnect between the dynamics of money supply components and flow of credit to the private sector in particular and the real economy in general this continues to be a concern overall activities in the money market and movements in the rates reflected generally positive reaction to the 50 basis points reduction in policy rate at the preceding mpc meeting initial volatility that characterised movements in the inter bank and open buy back rates eventually culminated in a decline as at may 16 2019 also low activity at the deposit and lending facility windows showed the relative vibrancy of the inter bank segment in the review period this was also reflected in the downward trend in nigerian treasury and cbn bills rates with implications for lower cost of liquidity management and positive balance sheet effect for participating entities in the money market it however remained worrisome that trends in the money market rates did not transmit to lower lending rates highlighting the weakness of transmission mechanism sustained stability in the banking industry is reflected in improvement of banks prudential measures though conditions highlighted the need for the bank to intensify current regulatory and supervisory measures to ensure further progress apart from the improvement in asset quality indicated by the steady decline in industry non performing loans npl ratio from december 2018 provision coverage remained high and sufficient similarly industry capital adequacy and liquidity ratios were above the levels in march 2019 and the prudential thresholds recurring challenges of the banking sector however remained the lack of credit creation to support real sector activities and growth excessive investment in government securities as well as high interest rate which must be decisively addressed along with prompt resolution of outlier institutions these will further strengthen the resilience of the industry despite the decline in foreign portfolio and direct investments viability of the external sector was generally strengthened sustained stability at the investors and exporters as well as at the bureaux de change bdc windows aided by the steady accretion to reserve continued to boost business planning and investors confidence also declining import bill narrowing income account deficit and increasing export of merchandise goods have combined to sustain overall balance of payment surplus whereas recent decline in capital flow may portend worrisome trend a quick reversal is expected and already manifesting as competitiveness remain unchanged overall considerations and decision factors within both the global and domestic economic environment continued to condition the direction of monetary policy on the global scene beyond the implications of deterioration in brexit negotiation and the fact that the bar for a near term cut by the fed is higher than most policy makers realise policy direction must position against the spillover effect of further slowdown in global growth though recent trends in the international price of oil provides opportunity for some respite sufficient caution must be taken including building of fiscal buffers to manage likely impact of sudden reversal that may come with resolution of the temporary impasses fueling the upbeat in oil prices on the domestic front the major challenges for monetary policy remained low credit flow to the real sector sub optimal output level and high unemployment to which the increasing insecurity has been attributed recent uptick in inflation mainly on account of food inflation was expected however the prognosis over the next months is a gradual decline inflation moreover as the insecurity challenges are resolved improved food distribution is expected to reduce pressure on food prices implementation of the new minimum wage is not expected to have any long term impact on general prices just as declining core inflation provides respite from heightening of inflationary pressures addressing the sub optimal output level will halt rising unemployment growing domestic output however requires a combination of fiscal and monetary policies within the gradual expansion of agriculture a quick win will be aggressive investment along the entire value chain to harvest the gains of high capital output ratio the value chain with numerous points for value added activities provides enormous employment and income enhancing opportunities to reduce the shortfall in aggregate demand and take advantage of current negative output gap focus of policy must include stimulating consumer spending banks must expeditiously grow consumer credit for households to take up accumulated stocks which invariably lead to increased production and aggregate supply thereby dousing inflationary pressure in addition to increase credit accessibility and uptake deliberate effort must be made to drive down interest rate especially considering the weakness of the transmission mechanism from the monetary policy and money market rates to deposit and lending rates cbn s supply of low price credit is only to complement what banks do as cbn continues its supportive and intervention activities to facilitate expansion in the real economy the fiscal authority must aggressively take 74 actions that provide the necessary stimulus for economic growth specifically it is imperative for the authority to enhance the tax net and compliance so as to grow the abysmally low tax to gdp ratio reduce the seeming over borrowing trend to prevent crowding out of the private sector and avoid debt servicing pressure unnecessary subsidies must be discontinued so as to provide resources for infrastructure improved social services and reduced cost of doing business overall stable exchange rate and favourable returns continued to make the nigerian market competitive and attractive for foreign flows output remained weak and fragile but steady on an upward trajectory with potential for significant non inflationary growth i believe that our policy path is forward looking and that the cbn must intensify its activities to reduce the risk premium as well as other measures to drive down lending rates and promote credit growth i therefore vote to reduce the mpr by 25 basis points to 13 25 per cent retain the asymmetric corridor of 200 500 basis points around the mpr retain cash reserve ratio crr at 22 5 per cent and retain liquidity ratio at 30 0 per cent emefiele godwin i governor of the central bank of nigeria and chairman monetary policy committee global economic growth which slowed to 3 6 percent in 2018 is projected to decline to 3 3 percent in 2019 for many countries short term outlook remains weak due to pervasive uncertainties these are underlain by the lingering trade tensions between us and china macroeconomic challenges in some emerging market economies including brazil argentina turkey and indonesia leading to a considerable exchange market pressures the auto industry disruptions in germany as well as the normalization of monetary policy in most advanced economies although 2019 started on a low pedestal the global economy is expected to strengthen in the second half of the year this pickup will be driven by accommodative monetary policy in major economies supported by retreating inflationary pressures and tapering output gaps the us federal reserve paused interest rate hikes and signalled no increases for the rest of the year the european central bank the bank of england and the bank of japan have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has increased its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs domestic economic developments economic activity in nigeria moderated in the first quarter of 2019 to 2 01 percent from 2 38 per cent in the q4 2018 the non oil sector continue to drive growth contributing about 90 86 per cent to the nation s gdp the 76 growth performance is marginally above the imf weo april 2019 projection of 2 1 per cent growth for nigerian economy in 2019 but lower than cbn staff estimate of 2 38 per cent for the same period despite the moderation the nigeria economy still enjoys favourable sentiments supported by positive pmi both in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing indices the favourable sentiment is also boosted by the continued stability in the foreign exchange market and the drive for increased credits to the real sector of the economy unemployment rate stands at an abysmal 23 1 per cent as at third quarter of 2018 with youth unemployment reaching 55 4 per cent report on domestic prices indicate a slight uptick in the year on year headline inflation to 11 37 per cent in april 2019 from 11 25 per cent in march the increase was driven by the composite food price index which rose by 13 70 per cent as against 13 45 per cent in march 2019 even as core inflation fell to 9 30 per cent from 9 46 per cent on a month on month basis the three components of inflation recorded upticks indicating existence of current pressures on inflation however the relative stability in the fx market continues to anchor expectations about future prices the current stock of fx reserves at us 45 4 billion covering more than 13 months of imports compares favourably with the international standard of 3 month import cover exchange rate has not only stabilized but has also significantly converged across different segments of the market the balance of payments bop estimates for q4 2018 shows a substantial 77 improvement in the bop outcome the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of us 2 80 million as against a huge deficit of us 4 542 08 million recorded in the preceding quarter the current account balance cab also improved significantly from a deficit of us 1 544 41 million in q3 2018 to a surplus of us 1 104 57 million in q4 2018 these were made possible by the significant decline in import bills due largely to our various policy initiatives including intervention policies and the restriction of fx supply for the importation of 41 non essential items i noted that although aggregate credit to the economy and credit to the private sectors grew faster than their 2019 indicative benchmark the broad money supply fell short of their benchmark m3 grew by 5 42 per cent over the preceding december 2018 relative to the benchmark of 14 47 per cent similarly m2 grew by 1 85 per cent in april as against the provisional benchmark of 12 99 per cent analysis of the overall liquidity condition of the financial system indicate that government securities plus omo bills account for more than 70 percent of total specified liquid assets of banks while interbank placements account for a meagre 4 75 per cent suggesting that banks have shirked their intermediation role consequently total industry credits declined by 0 58 per cent between april 2018 and april 2019 a trend that has persisted since 2017 this is a worrisome development given the slow and fragile economic activity in the country key considerations the slowdown in global economic activity and the subdued inflationary pressures has prompted a shift towards easier monetary policy stances across many developed and developing economies accordingly the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience in my march 2019 statement i underscored the need to support growth and create jobs to bolster our economic prosperity the same economic conditions that existed at that time continues to prevail even at the current period as the outlook for economy continues to be fragile our recovery process has remained slower than desired and worriedly lower than the rate of population growth thus percapita income remains low while unemployment rate continues to trend at a dangerously unacceptable region accompanied by persistent poverty which undermine productivity i noted with concern the ongoing asset substitution by banks as they shift their balance sheet from loans and advances to risk free government securities this is a classic case of disintermediation we need incentive structures that would make banks lend to the real sectors of the economy all these developments make case for continued support for growth and job creation i remain mindful of the fact that inflation rate which had been trending down for the past three months inflexed in april however the current level of inflation is still below the threshold of 12 0 percent above which inflation becomes inimical to growth we should therefore utilize the small policy 79 space created by this gap to pursue policies that would boost economic activity policies must at this point address critical issues such as access to credit job creation and the diversification of the economy policy preference i am therefore of the opinion that monetary policy should accommodate these critical issues as we continue to search for measures that would ensure sustainable economic growth in the long term my inclination today is to hold all parameters at their current levels while stepping up our intervention activities in critical sectors of the economy and using our omo operations to control liquidity in the banking system therefore i vote to 1 retain the mpr at 13 5 percent 2 retain the crr at 22 5 percent 3 retain the asymmetric corridor at 200 500 basis points and retain liquidity ratio at 30 0 percent godwin i emefiele con governor may 2019

expectations setting were rather well set for the highly anticipated trump xi meeting at g20 both sides agreed to stop raising tariffs further but it s unsure whether they ve closed the huge gap that led to collapse in trade negotiations if the causes remain the results would be the same no matter how long the talks will continue but anyway the results should keep investors happy for now and we d likely see a lift in sentiments as the week starts in the currency markets commodity currencies already jumped the gun last week lead by new zealand then australian and canadian dollar however aussie will be facing risks of rba rate cut as well as chinese data this week economic data from canada affirmed boc s neutral stance but wti crude oil appears to have topped at 59 84 after failing 60 handle pull back in oil price could be a drag on the loonie this week on the other hand yen was the weakest one last week followed by sterling and then swiss franc dollar was mixed as it pared some losses after fed officials talked down the chance of aggressive 50bps cut while markets are pricing in 100 chance of a fed cut in july we d maintain that the meeting is still live at least the upcoming data of ism indices and non farm payroll would need to show some more deterioration in the economy to seal the dovish case otherwise we might see dollar forming a bas for sustainable rebound trump xi meeting no new tariffs china to buy us farm products us to sell tech to huawei us and china agreed to stop further escalation of trade war for the time being after 80 meeting between trump and xi jinping as sideline of g20 summit in japan trade negotiations will resume while china agreed to purchase additional us agricultural products meanwhile the ban of supply to chinese telecom giant would be lifted partially as part of the agreement trump described the meeting as excellent as good as it was going to be and declared that we re back on track he added we will continue to negotiate and i promise that at least for the time being we won t be adding additional also china will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products and they re going to start doing that almost immediately trump said regarding the issue of huawei trump said we ll have to save that until the very end of the trade talks however one of the things i will allow however is we will keep selling that product and us companies can sell their equipment to huawei trump said but we re talking about equipment where there s no great national security problem with it but so far nothing substantial was mentioned regarding the core issues of intellectual property theft forced technology transfer and market distortion by large subsidies to state owned enterprises it s unsure if trump was already happy with more chinese purchases or he s completely forgotten what are the most important issues on the chinese side state run xinhua described the meeting result as both presidents agreeing to restart trade consultations between their countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect in response to the news imf managing director christine lagarde warned while the resumption of trade talks between the united states and china is welcome tariffs already implemented are holding back the global economy and unresolved issues carry a great deal of uncertainty about the future g20 pledged to realize free fair non discriminatory transparent predictable and stable trade and investment environment g20 leaders ended the summit in japan pledging to realize a free and fair trade and investment environment but they stopped short of denouncing protectionism though the group still agreed on continuing with wto reform while acknowledging the complementary roles of bilateral and free trade agreements in the joint communique the group said we strive to realize a free fair non discriminatory transparent predictable and stable trade and investment environment and to keep our markets open and they reaffirm our support for the necessary reform of the world trade organization wto to improve its functions actions are needed on the functioning of the dispute settlement system also we recognize the complementary roles of bilateral and regional free trade agreements that are wto consistent we will work to ensure a level playing field to foster an enabling business environment markets ignored fed comments still pricing 100 chance of july cut now that g20 risk is past focus will turn immediately to us economic data this week including ism indices and non farm payrolls currently fed fund futures are still pricing in 100 of a fed rate cut in july 71 9 chance of 25bps cut 28 1 chance of 50bps the pricings were not much changed from prior week s we d maintain that such expectations are over even the most dovish fed official st louis fed president james bullard called for a 25bps cut in july only he said last week just sitting here today i think 50 basis points would be overdone and i don t think the situation really calls for that but i would be willing to go to 25 fed chair jerome powell also emphasized we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short term swing in sentiment doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook fed s july meeting remains open at least before nfp release dollar index at a juncture next move to be decided soon dollar index turned sideway after edging lower to 95 83 it s for now trying to draw support from 100 projection of 98 37 to 96 45 from 97 76 at 95 84 55 week ema and 55 month ema if dxy is to bottom in near term this is the moment break of 96 45 support turned resistance will be the first sign of completion of fall from 98 37 firm break of 55 day ema now at 97 08 will confirm however break of 95 83 will extend the decline from 98 37 probably to 38 2 retracement of 88 25 to 98 37 at 94 50 before bottoming we ll know which direction it takes this week usd jpy weekly outlook usd jpy edged lower to 106 78 last week but recovered since then initial bias remains neutral this week first as long as 108 80 resistance holds further decline is in favor break of 106 78 will resume the fall from 112 40 to retest 104 69 low on the upside however considering bullish convergence condition in 4 hour macd break of 108 80 will confirm short term bottoming intraday bias will be turned back to the upside for 110 67 resistance next in the bigger picture decline from 118 65 dec 2016 is still in progress with the pair staying inside long term falling channel break of 104 62 will target 100 projection of 118 65 to 104 62 from 114 54 at 100 51 for now we d expect strong support above 98 97 2016 low to contain downside to bring rebound in any case break of 112 40 is needed to the first serious sign of medium term bullishness otherwise further decline will remain in favor in case of rebound in the long term picture the rise from 75 56 2011 low long term bottom to 125 85 2015 high is viewed as an impulsive move no change in this view price actions from 125 85 are seen as a corrective move which could still extend in case of deeper fall downside should be contained by 61 8 retracement of 75 56 to 125 85 at 94 77 up trend from 75 56 is expected to resume at a later stage for above 135 20 147 68 resistance zone

this article first appeared in forum the edge malaysia weekly on june 24 2019 june 30 2019 there is considerable concern about the government s possible ratification of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp the successor to the tpp after us president donald trump s withdrawal following his inauguration in late january 2017 although free trade is attractive especially to consumers desiring lower import prices it is generally acknowledged that no country has ever developed without policy interventions typically involving trade to develop new economic capacities and capabilities thus far the cptpp has been ratified by 7 out of 11 signatory countries with malaysia one of the four outliers ratification advocates wishfully claim that the cptpp would boost malaysia s economic growth by greatly increasing exports they cite much disputed peterson institute for international economics piie and world bank studies by the same authors using a dubious methodology even rejected by the us government s international trade council in mid 2016 under president barack obama the reports cite increased exports but are silent about the far greater increase in imports dubious gains from trade trade economist rashmi banga s cptpp implications for malaysia s merchandise trade balance for the united nations conference on trade and development is the only available study of its likely economic impact on the country her detailed and nuanced analysis suggests much need for caution while exports to cptpp countries will rise 0 2 imports will grow 6 0 setting malaysia s annual merchandise trade balance back by us 2 4 billion or about rm10 billion this would worsen its balance of payments as its services trade balance has always been in deficit the original tpp promised malaysia more exports mainly to the us although such claims were grossly exaggerated by the piie without the us the paltry gains have diminished further as malaysia already has free trade agreements ftas with other major trading partners in the cptpp such as japan australia and singapore participation in the agreement has little to offer the two largest imported items are cars and plastic materials banga estimates that imports of vehicles mainly from japan will rise 36 if customs duties come down to zero this is likely to wreak havoc on malaysia s already vulnerable automotive industry the cptpp will also enable much more imports of plastic materials including waste and scrap by around 35 mainly from japan singapore and australia over a quarter century ago then world bank vice president larry summers infamously suggested that toxic waste might be dumped in poor countries in africa owing to the lower opportunity costs involved on the cusp of becoming a high income nation the last administration belatedly took the advice by licensing ostensible plastic waste recycling plants malaysian ftas with singapore japan and australia affect 82 of its cptpp exports and 84 of imports hence malaysia will not lose much to trade diversion by not ratifying the cptpp about us 53 2 million or 0 09 of current exports to other cptpp countries on the other hand it will retain revenue from its relatively higher import tariffs 21st century gold standard cptpp advocates claim that malaysia will also gain the respect of the international community by ratifying its new cutting edge state of the art gold standard 21st century fta in fact the cptpp will mainly benefit transnational firms at the expense of consumers workers and the public in participating economies with the investor state dispute settlement isds provisions for example foreign investors will be able to sue the government for loss of revenue and profits if government policies are changed or if contracts are renegotiated even if it is in the interest of the public like banning toxic or carcinogenic chemicals isds involves binding private arbitration bypassing the national judicial systems this significantly strengthens the rights of foreign investors at the expense of those of governments with typically more modest means to litigate cases thus exercising a chilling effect on governments to comply with foreign corporate demands government ability to improve public policy will thus be restricted ironically the trump administration is now opposed to isds transcanada sued the us government under the isds provisions of the north american free trade agreement for us 15 billion after the obama administration cancelled its keystone xl pipeline project the case was dropped after trump revived the project cptpp proponents insist that strengthening intellectual property laws will benefit everyone as it will incentivise research and innovation a claim for which there is no evidence the tpp agreement would have lengthened monopolies on patented medicines kept cheaper generics off the market and allowed natural biological materials and processes to be patented the penang based third world network has long highlighted many such cptpp dangers for instance citing the malaysian government s procurement of an egyptian generic treatment of hepatitis c estimated to afflict almost half a million malaysians for rm1 300 instead of the patented us treatment costing almost rm300 000 encircling china the tpp was originally a minor plurila teral regional trade agreement involving four countries the obama administration decided to use it to check china s growing economic influence with the recent escalation of tensions between china and the us many malaysians are understandably concerned about how the growing economic conflict will affect economic prospects ratifying the cptpp is likely to be seen as taking sides even without the us in it to secure broad public support in the face of growing scepticism about the benefits of trade liberalisation associated with globalisation the obama administration involved over 700 advisers mainly representing

source de dollarisation fraught with risk the zimbabwe independent june 28 2019 latin american countries such as bolivia and peru like zimbabwe did this week once embarked on de dollarisation without macro economic stability and other necessary conditions with the process ending up in inevitable failure by kudzai kuwaza on monday zimbabwe through statutory instrument 142 of 2019 abolished the use of foreign currency in local transactions in a bid to contain the thriving black market the zimbabwean dollar became the only legal tender with effect from monday nearly a decade after it was decimated by hyperinflation and demonitised however the local unit has been introduced without vital benchmarks being met the conditions needed for a de dollarisation and use of a fully fledged currency include attaining a sustainable gdp growth rate of at least 7 low and stable inflation reducing the high debt ratios to very low and sustainable levels increasing the level of savings and investments to at least 25 of gdp reducing the balance of payments and at least six months import cover as zimbabwe embarks on the process to de dollarise studies have shown that the process is not easy especially on the aspect of restoring public confidence in the restoration of the local currency moreso in zimbabwe where many are still traumatised by loss of savings due to the hyperinflationary era which led to the demise of the zimbabwean dollar in 2009 even though countries like chile israel poland and georgia have been able to successfully de dollarise their economies through market oriented measures and better macro economic management economist prosper chitambara said that the process of de dollarisation is fraught with risks a study of countries that have dollarised in the past reveals that dollarisation is not easily reversed even after the underlying causes have been removed it takes a long time to build public confidence and trust in the local currency and it has been shown that economies remain addicted to dollars in spite of the disappearance of those factors that initially led to dollarisation chitambara pointed out empirical evidence suggests that successful de dollarisation is usually the outcome of a persistent process of disinflation and stabilisation rather than a main policy objective the persistence of low and stable inflation on the backdrop of fiscal consolidation should give rise to an endogenous and rather slow process of de dollarisation that is de dollarisation should be a by product of stabilisation rather than an outcome of a policy programme with that explicit aim while some countries such as brazil colombia mexico and venezuela have tried to avoid dollarisation by banning or highly restricting the possibility of issuing deposits in foreign currency residents responded through opening offshore accounts in 1982 bolivian authorities attempted to de dollarise the economy by converting dollar denominated financial instruments to pesos bolivianos at an exchange rate below the prevailing one in the market capital controls price controls and interest rate caps were also imposed this backfired as this led to inflation which at one time stood at 20 000 it also led to a significant increase of offshore deposits among other negatives the peruvian government s initial forced conversion of foreign currency deposits to the local currency was a disaster dollar deposits were converted in 1985 into domestic currency deposits this had a catastrophic effect of substantive financial disintermediation and capital flight mexico and latin american countries only managed to reduce the amount of dollars only after years of measures vietnam s de dollarisation however was a success this has been associated with a successful disinflation strategy adopted former economic planning minister tapiwa mashakada and miriam mushayi said ill timed de dollarisation by government could lead to the withdrawal of goods from shelves by retailers causing artificial shortages the rejection of the zimdollar and re dollarising increase of the money supply growth as government resorts to the printing press to increase the wages of civil servants and hyperinflation local economic research outfit econometer global capital has projected inflation to shoot to 450 by year end from the current 97 85

of sudden growth they had been steadily developing since the fall of the monarchy and the proclamation of the republic in april 1931 burnett bolloten evolution itself must not by any means be regarded as a single act but as a series of more or less powerful outbreaks rapidly alternating with periods of more or less complete calm v i lenin here bythe spanish civil war 1936 1939 witnessed the most significant military confrontation between revolutionary workers and fascists of the 20century workers control of industry and political life in the cities accompanied collectivization movements in the countryside this historical moment cannot be fully understood without looking at the pre civil war period the transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1931 until the election of the left wing popular front government in february of 1936 these pre revolutionary years pushed to the surface a plethora of political parties organizations and tendencies vying for leadership in the eventual struggle against fascism and for democracy and socialism leon trotsky offered considerable insight and clarity into the nature of the revolution during these years despite an assortment of competing political forces vast geographical distance and the constraints of political exile the purpose of this two part article is to examine the pre civil war years 1931 1935 utilizing trotsky s analysis of spain part 1 and assess the accuracy of trotsky s approach by looking at the historical events as they unfolded from 1930 1935 part 2 this is necessary in order to understand how critical these years were to shaping the civil war and revolution of 1936 and ultimately how the revolution failed to become socialist trotsky brought to the spanish revolution the experience of generations of revolutionary struggle by 1931 trotsky had participated in and had led the russian revolutionary movement for three decades and through three russian revolutions 1905 february 1917 and october 1917 during the 1920 s trotsky opposed joseph stalin s abandonment of international socialism and his role in stifling a promising pre revolutionary moment in england and a revolutionary one china for his dedication in defending an internationalist and socialism from below perspective trotsky was expelled from the ussr in 1929 he had already spent a year within the ussr as an exile physically and politically barred from the communist party and living in alma ata present day kazakhstan by the end of 1931 about one year after a mass movement for democracy had begun to sweep spain trotsky had already articulated a thorough analytical and strategic approach to pre revolutionary spain trotsky s writings of 1930 and 1931 are compilations of articles letters pamphlets and bulletins that were written to the communist opposition of spain oposición comunista de españa oce a group that hoped to build a revolutionary workers party trotsky s writings were not meant to provide day to day coverage on the events unfolding in spain rather they provide a general analysis regarding the character of the revolution and articulate a political strategy that the oce would utilize in shaping its political and organizational activity through this correspondence trotsky sought to answer this central question how can workers win political power and collectively administer society in their interests trotsky s answer can be summarized with the following series of interrelated questions what are the peculiarities of spanish economic development what social classes result from that economic development what is the relative weight of the working class in relation to other social classes what political parties and organizations exist in the interests of which social class es do they speak and within which social class es have they established leadership how can the working class politically lead itself and the diverse middle class surrounding it what reforms should be fought for and what demands should be advanced that can unify parties and organizations on the left and all social classes subordinated to capital in order to fight the political forces on the right who defend capitalism in decline these questions demonstrate the scientific nature of trotsky s thought and a marxist approach to revolution the economic base of society produces social classes determines which classes are predominant and those that are structurally capable of leading other social classes in the transformation of society all social classes have political leadership i e parties and organizations that represent them nevertheless it is not automatic that a given political party represents the interest of the social class it claims to represent these conditions require that the working class organize themselves in a political party to fight for their primary class interest an end to the exploitation of workers labor under capitalism and the establishment of socialism this party is the structure through which the working class fighters can unify and mobilize other political forces and social classes that are fettered by capitalism around specific democratic demands the process of mobilizing and fighting for these immediate and democratic demands empowers the working class to struggle for more and is the starting point for a complete social transformation the set up 1930 1931 the dictatorship that ruled spain through the 1920 s ended when general primo de rivera abdicated in january of 1930 general dámaso berenguer fusté assumed leadership over an interim government created to oversee the transition to democracy in reality a constitutional monarchy although the upper echelons of spanish society anticipated the transition to be peaceful 1930 was a year of rising struggle according to paul preston 1930 saw in comparison with 1929 four times as many strikes involving five times as many strikers with a loss of ten times as many working days the strike wave first emerged in the provinces of cataluña levante aragon and andalucía in june it swept through the south during that summer to the regions of seville granada again to andalucía and málaga by september it had reached the north asturias galicia and the basque region come november the two largest trade union federations had helped organize a general strike in madrid this deluge of struggle was in part a response to the contraction of the spanish economy with the onset of the worldwide economic downturn of the 1930 s nonetheless while economic grievances certainly provided an impetus to the struggle as the year of 1930 passed the strikes took on an increasingly political character the masses were protesting government repression and advocating change to a more democratic form of government the strikes of 1930 reached proportions they did because there were trade unions and political parties on the left to harness and lead that sentiment lending mutual support to one another berenguer proposed elections to the cortes the equivalent of a parliament to be held for march 1st 1931 the masses responded with protests pushing the republican party to lead the call for an election boycott the protests eventually forced the resignation of berenguer in february king alfonso assumed leadership over the interim government hoping to consolidate support for a constitutional monarchy through municipal elections which were announced for april 12 1931 the elections resulted in an overwhelming victory for the liberal capitalist republican party the republican party formed a cabinet with the socialist party and announced elections to the cortes for june the cortes elections in june resulted in an endorsement for the republican and socialist parties solidifying the coalition government that inaugurated the second republic the republicans represented a majority in the coalition the socialists the minority the republican leader niceto álaca zamora assumed the presidency and manuel azaña also a republican became prime minister the office of the president held a mandate for a six year term during which he would be empowered to dissolve the cortes and call new elections on two occasions trotsky observed that republican assumption to government was not due to any revolutionary initiative of their own but rather the pressures of the mass democratic movement sweeping spain the objective elements of the revolution a survey of economic development 1 what are the peculiarities of spanish economic development trotsky s analytical point of departure was to answer this question to begin he discussed how spain s past shaped its level of development in 1931 spain is unmistakably among the most backward countries of europe but its backwardness has a singular character invested by the great heroic past of the country while the russia of the czars always lagged far behind its western neighbors and advanced slowly under their pressure spain knew periods of great bloom of superiority over the rest of europe and of domination over south america the mighty development of domestic and world commerce increasingly overcame the effect of feudal dismemberment of the provinces and the particularism of the national regions of the country the growth of the power and importance of the spanish monarchy in those centuries was inextricably bound up with the centralizing role of mercantile capital and with the gradual formation of the spanish nation paradoxically the wealth that poured into spain during the colonial era did not contribute to its industrialization rather it facilitated spain s eventual economic and political decay the riches were squandered on sustaining an overbearing and bureaucratic empire the extravagant consumption of the monarchy and imports from the maturing capitalist regions the netherlands and england domestic industry was not encouraged to develop and could not as long as the english and the dutch could provide spanish markets with cheap industrial goods spain s colonial empire fomented anemic capitalist development contributing to its decentralization and the prominence of provincial peculiarities trotsky writes spain s retarded development inevitably weakened the centralist tendencies inherent in capitalism the decline of commercial and industrial life in the cities and of the economic ties between them inevitably led to the lessening of the dependence of individual provinces upon each other this is the chief reason why bourgeois spain has not succeeded to this day in eliminating the centrifugal tendencies of its historic provinces the meagerness of the national resources and the feeling of restlessness all over the country could not help but foster separatist tendencies particularism appears in spain with unusual force especially compared with neighboring france where the great revolution finally established the bourgeois nation united and indivisible over the old feudal provinces the weak thrust and centrifugal tendencies of capitalist development produced fragile political institutions void of any semblance of democracy and aggravated provincial antagonisms between the capital madrid and the basque and catalan regions provoking movements for autonomy and independence in these two latter areas trotsky observed the predominance of the centrifugal tendencies over the centripetal ones in the economy as well as in politics undermined the foundation of spanish parliamentarism the government s pressure on the electorate was decisive throughout the last century elections unfailingly gave the government a majority because the cortes found itself dependent upon the successive ministries the ministries themselves naturally sank into dependence on the monarchy madrid held the elections but the king held the power the monarchy was doubly necessary to disunited and decentralized ruling classes which were incapable of governing the country in their own name feeble economic development and political institutions had reinforced one another producing the need for the monarchy to rely on its backward institutions in order to hold the country together these institutions were the church the army and the guardia civil the police force in the countryside trotsky explained the centralizing role of the church alongside the monarchy and in alliance with it the clergy represents another centralized force catholicism to this day remains a state religion the clergy plays a big role in the life of a country being the firmest axis of reaction the state spends many tens of millions of pesetas annually to support the church the church garnered wealth in the midst of poverty and misery a report to the cortes in 1931 estimated that the jesuit order possessed one third of the country s entire wealth they owned industrial and financial enterprises even exploiting unpaid labor to amass profits the army was another bureaucratic and parasitic left over from the monarchy one in six military personnel were officers and one in every hundred a general trotsky described the centralizing role of the army the history of spain is the history of continual revolutionary convulsions military coups and palace revolutions follow on each other s heels during the nineteenth century and the first third of the twentieth political regimes kept changing kaleidoscopically not finding sufficiently stable support in any of the propertied classes even though they all needed it the spanish monarchy more than once fell into dependence upon its own army the army an institution which sought to arbitrate political upheaval and conflict contributed to the instability during the reign of queen isabella there were eighteen major military coups and thirty nine different cabinets in the span of twenty five years spain lost its colonial possessions the philippines cuba and hispañola to the united states after the spanish american war in 1898 the victory over morocco proved pyrrhic costing tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of pesetas spain s weighty feudal past meant that agriculture was predominant seventy percent of the total population still derived a living from the countryside in 1931 the latifundios large estates were a dominant feature of the spanish countryside francis lannon relates the underdevelopment of these areas tracts of uncultivated land a wasteful three field system tres hojas with only one third cultivated at any one time scandalously low harvest yields lack of fertilizers irrigation and other technical improvements fertile land given over to raising fighting bulls absentee landlords day laborers living in appalling barracks cortijos separated for months on end from their families laborers with little or no income in the winter months the church which profited greatly from this misery in the hinterlands was solidly against even the most modest reform that would alleviate this poverty land was so tied up with finance capital that its redistribution threatened the very basis of capitalism the institute for agrarian reform in order to not threaten the precarious stability of spanish capitalism did not redistribute land but merely rented it out to sharecroppers and tenant farmers leaving these small proprietors to remain under the tutelage of the latifundistas large landowners spain had experienced a boost in industrial production during world war i providing goods for foreign markets in the mining textile and agricultural goods sectors however when the war came to an end spain lost those markets and under the rivera dictatorship protected its industry with high tariffs britain and france retaliated raising tariffs on spanish agricultural goods this crippled the spanish economy since agricultural goods accounted for two thirds of total exports precipitating an agricultural crisis and reinforcing the industrial downturn consequently the domestic prices of goods rose diminishing the purchasing power of the poor by 1931 industry represented roughly thirty percent of the total economy the iron steel and extractive industries as well as the financial sector were located in the basque region much of the financial capital was foreign based giving spain a semi colonial status in europe mining was predominant in the region of asturias the textile and light manufacturing sector which consisted of small firms resided mostly in cataluña madrid s main enterprises were in the transportation service construction light industrial and textile sectors the vast countryside was a combination of small to medium sized peasant owned plots of land in the northern and central provinces and latifundios in the southern provinces that employed agricultural labor and were rented out to tenant farmers and sharecroppers the leading role of the working class 2 what social classes result from that economic development what is the relative weight of the working class in relation to other social classes uneven industrial development throughout spain created the following arrangement of social classes the privileged classes represented roughly one million people i e bureaucratic officials priests military officers big landowners and capitalists the upper middle classes represented approximately two million people one million well to do peasants one million middle class professionals and small business owners in the urban centers the lower middle classes and working classes represented about eight million people one million small craftsman between two and three million industrial workers and miners between two and three million agricultural workers and two million small rural proprietors i e peasants tenant farmers and sharecroppers spanish capitalism although appearing late relative to other industrial nations had fully penetrated the countryside but was marked with primitive production techniques bequeathed by a feudal past consequently the capitalist class itself composed of the most backward looking agrarian landlords was ill suited to fight for even modest democratic reform let alone establishing a robust democracy trotsky compared the weak spanish capitalist class with the bolder bourgeoisies of england in the 17th century and the french in 1789 he wrote now even less than in the nineteenth century can the spanish bourgeoisie lay claim to the historic role which the british and french bourgeoisie s once played appearing too late dependent on foreign capital the big industrial bourgeoisie of spain which has dug like a leech into the body of the people is incapable of coming forward as the leader of the nation against the old estates even for a brief period the magnates of spanish industry face the people hostilely forming a most reactionary bloc of bankers industrialists large landowners the monarchy its generals and officials all devouring each other in internal antagonisms it was impossible for the capitalist class to wage a fight against the feudal features of production because capitalism had grown relatively peacefully within feudalism depending much on the traditional institutions of the monarchy to discipline the working class trotsky explained in spain capitalism must use feudal means to exploit the peasantry to aim the weapon of revolution against the remnants of the spanish middle ages means to aim it against the very roots of bourgeois rule uneven economic development and the overwhelming participation of large landowners in capital formation produced significant inequities in land distribution 1 5 million of the small rural proprietors only possessed 2 5 acre plots of land and they were forced to work on large estates in order to survive in contrast 50 000 members of the gentry owned half of the total acreage in spain and 10 000 landowners owned 250 or more acres industrialization in the early decades of the 20th century spain changed the class composition of the country concentrating workers into large enterprises trotsky wrote the last decades particularly the years of the world war produced important changes in the economy and the social structure of the country of course spain still remains at the tail end of europe but the country has experienced its own industrial development in both extractive and light industry during the war coal mining textiles the construction of hydroelectric stations etc were greatly advanced industrial centers and regions sprang up all over the country this created a new relationship of forces and opened up new perspectives industrial development raised the proletariat to its feet and strengthened it in the spain of old small entrepreneurs the petty bourgeoisie the social class scrunched between the big capitalists and the working class dominated in the production and distribution of goods however industrialization took the leading role away from this social class trotsky explained that the working class was not only the newer social class but the most formidable unlike peasants or small businessmen the working class owned nothing but their labor and had an interest in running those firms for the collective good of society in other words the working class was the only group structurally capable of leading society out of a capitalist system for trotsky the emergent spanish working class in a primarily agrarian country resembled the social composition of russia during the revolution of 1917 for the working class the fight against feudal forms of exploitation and capitalism could not be separated capitalist economic relations were dominant and had fully penetrated the spanish countryside however the industrial working class being the critical social class did not mean that the it could wage revolution on its own it needed an alliance with other groups and social classes subjugated and oppressed by big capital one group was the agricultural workers they would lead the revolution in the countryside trotsky explained we must by no means forget about the independent role of the agricultural workers they are the main instruments of the proletarian revolution in the rural districts with the peasants the workers have an alliance but the agricultural workers are a part of the proletariat itself this important distinction must always be kept in mind to summarize the working class was the only class capable of reconstituting society on the basis of collectivized wealth this class included agricultural laborers who worked but did not own the land the machinery or tools i e the means of production revolution demanded that the industrial working class in the cities and the agricultural laborers in the countryside organize themselves and lead the sympathetic middle classes peasants tenant farmers sharecroppers well to peasants small businessmen professionals etc in the fight for socialism however all this demanded a revolutionary leadership among the working class with a clear political program and strategy to lead itself and other potentially sympathetic social forces the political forces 3 what political parties and organizations exist in the interests of which social class es do they speak and within which social class es have they established leadership by 1931 a variety of organizations and parties existed that gave political expression to the struggle between social classes the political party that spoke consistently for the democratic reform interests of the ruling class was the republican party itself a grouping of liberal capitalist parties of various political shades the radical party alejandro lerroux represented the right wing of the republican coalition parties this party was thoroughly conservative they had the allegiance of those sectors of the middle and lower middle classes who were tired of the monarchy sick of the role of the church and the army in political affairs but were most afraid of the popular social movements simmering under the surface of spanish society the conservative republican party in cataluña was the lliga regionalista which had the allegiance of the sharecroppers rabassaires the smaller left wing republican parties were the catalan party esquerra miguel maura and lluis companys acción republicana manuel azaña the radical socialists and a republican party in galicia these parties represented the interests of those progressive middle and lower middle class members who wished for a completion of the liberal revolution that failed during the 19th century they were predominantly doctors lawyers university professors and other professionals although separated into respective right and left tendencies all parties in the republican coalition desired a peaceful transition from monarchical dictatorship to capitalist democracy and economic development a tall order during revolution trotsky said of the republicans in their highest echelons the spanish republicans are distinguished by an extremely conservative social program their fear of the masses is greater than their hostility to the monarchy in the same letter trotsky wrote of this bourgeois party the base of support of the spanish republicans as we have already said is completely on present property relations we can expect them to neither expropriate the big landowners nor to liquidate the privileges of the catholic church nor to cleanse the augean stables of the civil and military bureaucracy the mass formations of the political left were socialists and anarcho syndicalists the spanish socialist party partido socialista obrera de españa psoe held leadership over the unión general de trabajadores ugt an important trade union federation in 1930 the ugt boasted a membership of 287 000 but its union would expand rapidly in the next few years of the second republic the ugt would incorporate into it the national federation of land workers federación nacional de trabajadores de la tierra fntt a union for agricultural laborers the psoe was affiliated with the second international and sought the peaceful expansion and protection of workers rights both the psoe and ugt were dominant in madrid new castile old castile estremadura asturias and the basque country the most prominent leaders of the psoe and ugt were indalecio prieto and largo caballero the anarcho syndicalists although not an official political party led the confederación nacional de trabajo cnt and the federación anarquista ibérica fai trade unions the cnt angel pestaña and juan peiro dominated politically in cataluña and also held political sway in the provinces of aragon valencia and among the agricultural workers in the southern province of andalucía the anarchists had led many important struggles facilitating the expansion of their unions but abstained from political issues on principle and supported isolated insurrections against the government without a program of ultimately taking political power the fai buenaventura durruti and garcia olivar established in 1927 was the more political and militant wing of the anarchist movement and when it ultimately fused with the cnt politically led that new grouping the cnt fai unlike the psoe and the ugt which bargained peacefully with the primo de rivera dictatorship during the 1920 s the cnt was declared illegal and forced underground in 1931 total membership of the cnt fai was 500 000 members on the far right the monarchist parties still possessed substantial influence over the most traditional institutions of spanish society the church the aristocratic officer corps of the army and the guardia civil these parties were renovación española antonio goicoechea and calvo sotelo the explicitly monarchist traditionalist communion a carlist tendency that had a social base in the reactionary well to do peasantry of the navarre province acción popular gil robles which was a catholic party that sought political power through legal means and was by far the most successful of the far right parties by 1934 acción popular had gathered thirty six conservative groups and parties into a coalition called ceda confederación española de derechas autónomas ceda sympathized with hitler and mussolini and consolidated the base of future fascism in spain funneling their members into the falange española the explicitly fascist party led by josé antonio primo de rivera with the outbreak of civil war in 1936 acción popular ceda represented the typical politics of a proto fascist coalition it desired through electoral means a return to life under the monarchy a corporatist state the rule of traditional institutions and consequently fought every progressive reform proposed by the second republic the groups on the radical left were the spanish communist party partido comunista de españa pce with about 800 members in 1930 and led by josé díaz and jesús hernández the catalan baleric communist federation also known as the workers and peasants bloc bloc obrer i camperol boc and led by joaquín maurín with a few thousand members and the spanish communist opposition oposición comunista de españa oce whose most distinct leaders were andreu nin and juan andrade the oce was an affiliate of the international left opposition ilo the expelled faction of the official communist party of the ussr led by trotsky although the oce possessed only a handful of followers about 50 in 1931 it was the organization with the clearest political analysis of the unfolding revolution and the best program for political action consequently it offered the best chance for building a revolutionary party that could lead the working class to power the oce would name itself the izquierda comunista de españa ice at their congress held in march 1932 the subjective elements of revolution 4 how can the working class politically lead itself and the diverse middle class surrounding it 5 what reforms should be fought for and what demands should be advanced that can unify parties and organizations on the left and all social classes subordinated to capital in order to fight the political forces on the right who defend capitalism in decline the past economic and political development of spain the objective elements of revolution shaped 1931 spain this accumulation of history was what marx referred to as the circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past i now turn to the role of human agents in transforming their world the part where men make history the subjective elements of revolution according to the circumstances in which they are rooted trotsky s answer to these questions comes in three parts 1 understanding the important role in fighting sincerely and wholeheartedly for democratic demands 2 conducting a united front with other left parties to win these demands in order to 3 build and consolidate a mass revolutionary leadership of workers within a single political party this party would be the only force capable of leading the oppressed and exploited majority to take state power in order to organize production collectively for the benefit of the majority because the oce was a very small organization at the start of the pre revolutionary events trotsky spoke most about the critical role of democratic demands in the developing social upheaval that would facilitate the growth of the oce the role of democratic demands as explained earlier a modern industrial working class existed in an economically backward spain that knew no democracy because the capitalists through the republican party were too cowardly to champion substantive democratic reform the working class had to be the leading force in the fight for democracy democratic demands were the medium through which the oce could unify the forces on the left to fight the right and consolidate the best working class fighters into one party thereby pushing the revolution forward the struggle for democracy in the midst of a revolution overlapped with the fight for working class demands decent wages and land and would inevitably transcend to more radical socialist demands for example workers control of industry and establishment of workers councils at a certain stage of the struggle democratic demands would have to be fought for utilizing extra parliamentary means i e pickets demonstrations strikes etc during the struggle for democracy the masses reach a point where they gain confidence in their momentum and power this is the stage when revolutionaries can advance more radical democratic and socialist demands in his first letter to the spanish opposition in january 1930 written following primo de rivera s abdication trotsky discussed the role of democratic demands in the future revolution by advancing democratic slogans the proletariat is not in any way suggesting that spain is heading toward a bourgeois revolution spain has left the stage of bourgeois revolution far behind but in this epoch the proletariat can lead the revolution that is group the broadest masses and of the working class and oppressed around itself and become their leader only on the condition that it now unreservedly puts forth all democratic demands in conjunction with its own class demands so according to trotsky the revolution could not be bourgeois in character the peaceful development of capitalism within a feudal spain thwarted such an endeavor however the spanish workers and peasants were not yet committed to socialist revolution the masses yearned for democracy and it was the role of revolutionaries within the working class to demonstrate how the instinctual democracy of the working and peasant masses was synonymous with class demands and revolutionary socialism i e radical economic democracy would raising democratic demands fool the masses into believing the republicans had their interests at heart trotsky answered needless to say democratic demands under no circumstances have as their object drawing the proletariat closer to the republican bourgeoisie on the contrary they create the basis for a victorious struggle against the leftist bourgeoisie making it possible to disclose its anti democratic character at every step the more courageously resolutely and implacably the proletarian vanguard fights for democratic slogans the sooner it will win over the masses and undermine the support for the bourgeois republicans and socialist reformists the more quickly their best elements join us the sooner the democratic republic will be identified in the mind of the masses with the workers republic bold democratic slogans would expose the vacuous democracy of the republican bourgeoisie ill suited for waging a determined battle for liberty against the monarchy by supporting all really democratic and revolutionary movements of the popular masses the communist vanguard will be leading and uncompromising struggle against the so called republican bourgeoisie unmasking its double dealing its treachery and its reactionary character and its attempts to subject the toiling masses to its influence when berenguer had announced elections to the cortes for march 1st trotsky argued that a boycott of this election was appropriate understanding that any cortes set up would be a sham nevertheless it was not sufficient to merely criticize berenguer through a boycott it was necessary to provide an alternative therefore the oce should advance the argument for a revolutionary constituent cortes instead of the anti democratic berenguer cortes in order to initiate the discussion among left workers and peasants about how real democracy could be won i e through workers revolution and socialism trotsky argued but even while boycotting berenguer s cortes the advanced workers would have to counterpose to it the slogan of a revolutionary constituent cortes we must relentlessly disclose the fraudulence of the slogan constituent cortes in the mouth of the left bourgeoisie which in reality wants a conciliationist cortes by the good graces of the king and berenguer for the purpose of haggling with the old ruling and privileged cliques a genuine constituent assembly can be convoked only by a revolutionary government as a result of a victorious insurrection of the workers soldiers and peasants after mass protest forced the resignation of berenguer from the interim government trotsky reiterated the importance of agitating for the revolutionary constituent cortes based on universal suffrage without discrimination of sex from the age of eighteen with no restrictions the april elections and the creation of a democratic capitalist government allowed for revolutionaries to raise the most radical demands trotsky argued the communists issue the most radical democratic slogans complete freedom for the proletarian organizations freedom of local self administration election of all officials by the people admission of suffrage to men and women from the age of eighteen etc formation of a workers militia and later on of a peasants militia confiscation of all properties of the monarchy and the church for the benefit of the people above all for the unemployed and the poor peasants and for improving the conditions of the soldiers complete separation of church and state in addition trotsky argued that his comrades should demand the arrest the most prominent leaders and supporters of the old regime confiscate the property of the monarchy these democratic demands far from channeling working class struggle down the path of pure reformism were very radical and served to connect in the minds of the spanish masses the relationship between democracy and socialism the communist party of spain pce had consistent with its ultra radicalism during this time raised the dictatorship of the proletariat as the principal slogan to advance the revolution trotsky discussed the limitations of this slogan in the following way we can and must counterpose the revolutionary cortes to the conciliationist cortes but to our mind it would be incorrect at the present stage to give up the slogan of the revolutionary cortes to counterpose the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat to the problems and slogans of revolutionary democracy for a republic for an agrarian revolution for the separation of church and state the confiscation of church properties national self determination a revolutionary constituent assembly would be the most sterile and miserable doctrinairism before the masses can seize power they must unite around the leading proletarian party the struggle for democratic representation in the cortes at one or another stage of the revolution can immeasurably facilitate the solution of this problem for trotsky the slogan dictatorship of the proletariat sounded too abstract and did not reach the masses of workers and peasants who had their eyes and ears fixed on the cortes elections even worse to the peasants this slogan sounded as if the workers wanted to subjugate them rather than give them freedom to work the land trotsky asked rhetorically why was it important to raise democratic demands to the cortes as a focal point for revolutionary agitation he answered precisely because the spanish people are inclined to exaggerate the creative power of the cortes every awakened worker every revolutionary peasant woman wants to participate in the elections we do not solidarize ourselves for a moment with the illusions of the masses but we must utilize whatever is progressive about these illusions to the utmost trotsky was persistent in his criticism of the thoughtless formula stalin had advocated through the pce that democratic reforms were synonymous with opportunism and socialist demands with revolutionary marxism according to trotsky revolution did not obey such a formal scheme the slogan dictatorship of the proletariat was on its own a worthless demand trotsky related to reduce all the contradictions and all the tasks to the lowest common denominator the dictatorship of the proletariat is a necessary but altogether insufficient operation even if one should run ahead and assume that the proletarian vanguard has grasped the idea that only the dictatorship of the proletariat can save spain from further decay the preparatory problem would nevertheless remain in full force to weld around the vanguard the heterogeneous sections of the working class and the still more heterogeneous masses of the village toilers to contrast the bare slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat to the historically determined tasks that are now impelling the masses towards the road of insurrection would be to replace the marxist conception of social revolution with bakunin s rather than obeying formal laws revolution was a dynamic process which based itself not simply on how the masses are acting but on how they are thinking about how they are acting in other words their consciousness consciousness in revolution or struggle of any magnitude always lags behind action people may be acting in a revolutionary way but their hopes still remain in finding a solution within the capitalist system the slogan dictatorship of the proletariat standing alone was abstracted from the actual events of the revolution in trotsky s mind this formal slogan needed to be filled and complemented with democratic demands that were historically relevant to the struggle if this did not occur the revolutionaries would not be making sense to workers around them let alone to the non workers which in turn would reinforce their isolation the pce demand for dictatorship of the proletariat sounded radical but trotsky argued that not only did such a demand not make sense and fit the present moment of the struggle it led to disastrous tactics around the time of the elections to the cortes the pce had called for the arming of workers and peasants trotsky argued that the arming of the workers and the peasants could not be associated with any offensive action rather distribution of arms could only make sense as a demand for armed defense of their organizations from right wing attack even though the revolution was in its early stages this did not mean that the oce need advance the hollow reforms proposed by the republican socialist coalition part ii will address these specific reforms later rather trotsky argued for radical social legislation in the form of unemployment insurance increased taxation of the wealthy and free popular education in addition there also needed to be a series of transitional demands these included nationalization of railroads mineral resources banks workers control of industry and state regulation of the economy such transitional demands served not only to advance the revolution at a certain advanced stage of the struggle such as a general strike but if won would facilitate the planning of the state economy once workers took political power also clear democratic demands were crucial for winning the peasants sharecroppers and tenant farmers to workers revolution peasants would see that the revolutionary working class party fought also for the interests of the peasants trotsky explained the peasantry cannot give the proletariat its confidence a priori by accepting the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat as a verbal pledge the peasantry being a large and oppressed class at a certain stage inevitably sees in the democratic slogan the possibility for the oppressed to overthrow the oppressors the peasantry will inevitably link the slogan of political democracy with the slogan of the radical redistribution of land the proletariat will openly support both demands trotsky talks about the specific reforms that revolutionaries should advance and fight for together with the peasantry in order to break the peasantry away from localism and reactionary influences the proletariat needs a clear revolutionary democratic program the yearning for land and water the bondage caused by high rents acutely pose the question of confiscation of private land for the benefit of the poor peasants the burden of state finances the unbearable government debt bureaucratic pillage and the african adventures pose the need for a cheap government which can be achieved not by the owners of large estates not by bankers and industrialists not by the liberal nobility but only by the toilers themselves the domination of the clergy and the wealth of the church put forward the democratic problem to separate church and state and to disarm the church transferring its wealth to the people from trotsky s writings during this period it is evident that the oce was still trying to grasp how the struggle for democratic reforms would augment the fight for more radical demands like the establishment of soviets workers councils addressing the oce trotsky turned to the experience of the russian revolution of february 1917 as a reference point for appraising spanish conditions of the moment and their future trajectory a spain is not at war and you do have no slogan for peace b you don t have workers soviets yet not to speak of soldiers soviets i do not even see that this slogan is being raised among the masses c the republican government from the very outset applies repressive measures against the left proletarian wing which we did not have in february because the bayonets were at the disposal of the workers and soldiers soviets and not in the hands of the liberal government the february regime in the political sphere immediately realized full and absolute democracy the bourgeoisie maintained itself by the good will of the masses of workers and soldiers your bourgeoisie maintains itself not only on the good will but also on the organized violence that it took over from the old regime you do not have complete and unconditional freedom of assembly speech press etc the electoral basis of your new municipalities is very far from democratic meanwhile in a revolutionary epoch the masses are particularly sensitive to every inequality in rights to every form of police rule this should be utilized in other words it is necessary for the communists at present to come forward as the party of the most consistent decisive and intransigent defenders of democracy democratic reforms provided the oce with points of unity around which the left forces would consolidate their forces expose the government ambivalence and betrayal to popular social reform thereby building a revolutionary alternative and home for the radicalizing workers and peasants to organize trotsky explained create serious difficulties for the socialists and drive a wedge between the socialists and the republicans that is divide even for a time the enemies of the proletariat and what is a thousand times more important drive a wedge between the working masses and the socialists the experience of the russian revolution again provided a roadmap for how this struggle for democratic reforms within a united front was absolutely necessary to win socialist revolution the enormous role of the bolshevik slogan down with the ten capitalist ministers is well known the slogan was adopted in 1917 at a time of the coalition between the conciliators and the bourgeois liberals the masses still trusted the socialist conciliators but even the most trusting masses always have an instinctive distrust of the bourgeoisie of the exploiters and of the capitalists it is upon this distrust that tactic of the bolsheviks was based during the specific period we didn t say down with the socialist ministers we didn t even advance the slogan down with the provisional government as a fighting slogan of the moment but instead we hammered incessantly on the same theme down with the ten capitalist ministers this slogan played an enormous role because it gave the masses the opportunity to learn from their own experience that the socialist conciliators thought much more of the capitalist ministers than of the working masses slogans of that type are best fitted for the present stage of the spanish revolution the proletarian vanguard is fully interested in pushing the spanish socialists to take power into their hands for that to happen it is necessary to split the coalition the present task is the fight to drive the bourgeois ministers from the coalition the achievement of this task even in part is conceivable only in connection with important political events under pressure of new mass movements and so on thus in russia under the constant pressure of the masses first guchov and miliukov then prince lvov were ousted from the coalition government kerensky was put at the head of the government the number of socialists in the government rose and so on after lenin s arrival the bolshevik party did not solidarize itself for one moment with kerensky and the conciliators but it helped the masses to push the bourgeoisie out of power and to test the government of the conciliators in practice that was an indispensable stage in the bolshevik rise to power the experience here resembled the situation in spain and could provide the necessary next steps in the struggle the slogan down with zamora maura is quite timely it is only necessary to make one thing clear the communists are not agitating in favor of the lerroux ministry nor are they assuming any responsibility for the socialist ministry but at every given moment they deliver their strongest blows against the most determined and consistent class enemy thereby weakening the conciliators and clearing the way for the proletariat the struggle for democratic reforms was integral to the fight for broader social transformation herein lies the essence of what trotsky called permanent revolution the strategy for fighting for these reforms was the united front revolutionaries uniting with those who are not yet won to revolution and in the course of struggle weakening the political right the capitalist system as a whole bolstering the confidence of the working and peasant masses and ultimately winning them over to the side of revolution and organizing workers within a revolutionary party now let us examine in detail the role of the united front and its conceptual application to the spanish struggle the united front a strategy to win the masses the municipal elections in april and the cortes elections in june confirmed trotsky s and the oce s conviction that revolution was underway the masses had voted for democracy and against the restoration of the monarchy the time had come to unapologetically demand widespread reform and direct all political force criticism and agitation toward the monarchy at the same it was critical to place the republican socialist coalition under relentless criticism for balking on social reform the united front strategy trotsky articulated consisted of this fight the reactionary and conservative monarchist right with all the forces on the left who agree in fighting alongside other left parties and organizations the revolutionary left would force the tepid democrats and reformist leaders to act when the republican and socialist leadership fail to carry the struggle forward against the right the rank and file would become disappointed with their leadership and seek out a new bold and revolutionary alternative in this way the radicalizing masses would be won to organizing within a revolutionary workers party the vehicle through which workers revolution will be explicitly fought for and won the united front required open discussion of the movement among all left parties involved the revolutionary party needed to maintain political independence from other left parties in order to explicitly fight for the interests of the working class while extending the alliance of left groups in the broadest fashion possible the need for the united front arose from the very nature of revolution revolution trotsky argued awakened millions of the toiling masses for the first time accordingly it did not translate into the people identifying immediately with revolutionary politics instead the workers and peasants would first pass through liberal and reformist political parties on the left that they believe will struggle for their interests the masses of workers soldiers and peasants must pass through the stage of socialist republican illusions in order to rid themselves of these illusions all the more radically and conclusively so that they are not trapped by phrases can look the facts straight in the face and stubbornly prepare the second revolution the proletarian revolution trotsky brought his revolutionary experience to bear during the russian revolution of 1917 the vast majority of workers peasants and soldiers first gave their political allegiance to the menshevik and social revolutionary parties before they were won to the bolshevik party program of taking state power through the democratically elected workers councils or soviets likewise during the german revolution of 1918 1919 workers first identified with the political program of the more conservative wings of the workers movement the united social democratic party or uspd and the social democratic party or spd before moving further to the left and joining the german communist party kpd the united front approach contrasted sharply with the pce s ultra left tactic that labeled all non communist parties as social fascists and therefore unworthy of an alliance to defeat the right from the experience of the russian revolution trotsky concluded that no matter how reactionary the reformist coalition governments of the social revolutionaries and the mensheviks were and how repressive they acted toward the bolsheviks it was the united front between these reformist parties and the bolsheviks that defeated the kornilov fascists in august 1917 this anti fascist front proved critical in the bolshevik party winning the confidence of the soviet majority and establishing a workers government a few months later trotsky argued that the joint action of the oce with the psoe socialists and the cnt and fai anarcho syndicalists was essential for defeating the right and ultimately winning workers to revolution in 1931 the ugt and the cnt represented the majority of spain s working class the ugt boasted a membership of roughly 250 000 and the cnt had about 500 000 members and the membership of these unions would increase rapidly in the next few years i now turn to trotsky s analysis of and strategic approach to each of these two most important political forces the socialists psoe trotsky was convinced that the psoe leadership would in the end betray the revolution the psoe had just emerged from a dictatorship in which it was a political partner however the socialists had the allegiance of hundreds of thousands of workers in the city and the countryside and it was on the backs of those workers through the massive wave of struggle in 1930 that pushed the psoe to align with the republicans establishing a democratic government trotsky wrote the following about socialist participation in the new republican government the fact that the socialist leaders trail behind the republican leaders is quite in the nature of things yesterday the social democracy clung with its right arm to the dictatorship of primo de rivera today it clings with its left arm to the republicans the principal aim of the socialists who do not and cannot have an independent policy is participation in a solid bourgeois government to this end they would not refuse to make peace even with the monarchists the socialism of the psoe was consistent with other social democratic i e reformist parties that had leading working class constituencies in other countries during times of revolution most notably the menshevik party in russia 1917 and the german social democratic party spd from 1918 1923 the menshevik party opposed workers taking power through their democratically elected workers councils or soviets a few years after the bolsheviks led the formation of an exclusively workers and peasants government in october of 1917 trotsky decried the politics of the german social democratic party spd the spd even though it had been at the head of a democratic movement of workers in 1918 and 1919 refused to dismantle the capitalist state and build a workers government based on workers councils setting the german revolution backward and contributing decisively to the slow degeneration of the russian revolution trotsky warned in spain if the socialists were to acquire a leading position over the proletariat during the revolution it would be capable of only one thing spilling the power conquered by the revolution into the republican sieve from which power would automatically pass to its present possessors the psoe was condemned to play a conservative role during the revolution because they shared power with the republicans who were at the helm accordingly the psoe would be responsible for any repression of worker and peasant protest the role of minority partner explained the socialists psychological predisposition to fear the rising class struggle which is best summed up by miguel cordero a ugt trade union official in the following way our revolutionary optimism had hardly been excited at all it was just obvious that we were faced with an imminent revolution which would take place with us or without us or even against us a mass movement pushed the hesitant psoe and ugt leadership into the government this dynamic foreshadowed a clash between the psoe and ugt leadership with the rank and file membership as strike activity increased the socialist leaders consider themselves lucky because they do not have a majority in the cortes and because their coalition with the bourgeoisie is thus justified by parliamentary statistics the socialists do not want to take power for they justly fear that a socialist government will only be a stage on the road to the dictatorship of the proletariat the socialists intend to support the coalition as long as it is possible to hold back the proletariat by doing so and then when the pressure of the workers becomes too strong to pass into opposition under some radical pretext leaving it to the bourgeoisie to discipline and crush the workers what made the socialist party particularly dangerous in trotsky s mind was their ability to assume a radical façade providing a left wing cover to republican repression of the workers and peasants movement they could blame the republicans for stalling on important reforms and when the struggle heated up use the republicans to discipline the workers acquiescence to repressing the workers movement aside trotsky anticipated the socialist excuses for not deepening social revolution and provided the oce with a way forward the socialists will say they cannot give up the coalition because they do not have a majority in the cortes our answer to that is to call for democratic elections to the cortes on the basis of truly universal and equal suffrage for men and women from eighteen years of age in other words to the nondemocratic falsified cortes we counterpose at this stage a truly popular truly democratic honestly elected cortes thus when the socialists place the blame on the republicans for sabotaging reform revolutionaries must respond with the demand for a new election to the cortes that truly represented the will of the spanish masses this would give the socialists the majority they need to take government power in their hands the inevitable gulf that would develop between the socialist leadership and their rank and file would facilitate workers radicalization to the left and consequently their seeking out a revolutionary alternative to the psoe the united front trotsky argued was the best revolutionary strategy to reap the benefits of the political gulf developing between the socialist leadership and the rank and file and bolster the forces of the revolution the participation in power of the socialists means that violent clashes between the workers and the socialist leaders will increase this opens up great possibilities for the revolutionary policy of the united front every strike every demonstration every approach of the workers to the soldiers every step of the masses towards the real democratization of the country will henceforth collide with the resistance of the socialist leaders acting as the men of order it is therefore all the more important for the communist workers to participate in a united front with the socialist syndicalist and nonpartisan workers and to draw them under their leadership the starting point for trotsky was clear revolutionaries should at every moment agitate and expose the halfway measures of the republican socialist coalition to expand democracy within spain their leaders the socialists have power this increases the demands and tenacity of the workers every striker will not only have no fear of the government but will also expect from it the communists must direct the thoughts of the workers precisely along these lines demand everything from the government since your leaders are in it in reply to the workers delegations the socialists will say that they do not have the majority yet the answer is clear with truly democratic suffrage and an end to the coalition with the bourgeoisie a majority is guaranteed but this is what the socialists do not want their situation places them in conflict with bold democratic slogans under the slogan of democracy and of an end to the coalition between the between the socialists and the bourgeoisie we drive a wedge between the workers and the socialists and prepare the next stage of the revolution to summarize trotsky knew the psoe would fail the test of leading the revolution however the masses did not understand this in 1931 therefore the strategy of diverting the influence of the socialist party away from their rank and file amounted to the following direct all political attacks toward the monarchy and to the republicans for conceding too much to the monarchist right wing with the intent of pushing the socialists deputies into power these reformist leaders being tied to the republicans in a coalition would eventually betray the interests of the poor pushing the radicalized layers of society into a party that could offer a revolutionary alternative to the politics of strict reformism winning the masses away from their socialist leaders required more than words trotsky explained social democracy must be politically discredited in the eyes of the masses but this cannot be achieved by means of insults the masses trust only their collective experience they must be given the opportunity during the preparatory period of the revolution to compare in action the communist policies with those of the social democrats in other words the oppressed of spain needed not only the negative experience of the psoe s betrayal but a positive example of an organized revolutionary alternative that provided leadership and clarity in struggle as trotsky knew well variants of spanish socialism had already been put to the test of revolution in russia in 1917 and in germany from 1918 1923 success of the revolution in russia and its failure in germany had everything to do with the presence of a revolutionary party that could harness and direct the energy of the masses the anarcho syndicalists cnt and fai spain was a country with a strong anarchist tradition the anarchist cnt grew immensely during world war i from 25 000 in 1914 to 500 000 in 1918 becoming the undisputed leader of the spanish labor movement and far surpassing the ugt in membership and militancy trotsky argued early on that addressing the limitations of anarchist theory and practice regarding revolution was critical while the socialists flung themselves into the government with the republicans the anarchists ignored both the municipal and cortes elections they did so not because they had a clear revolutionary analysis perspective and strategy concerning how the elections encapsulated the radicalization of the spanish masses rather they denied the importance of political questions in general the avoidance of politics was rooted in the contradictory anarcho syndicalist approach of leading the working class to take economic power in society without establishing a revolutionary workers government a body consisting of immediately recallable delegates that would organize production according to the needs of society and defend against counter revolution of the capitalist class trotsky explained how anarchist politics applied to a revolutionary situation had counterrevolutionary consequences anarcho syndicalism disarms the proletariat by its lack of a revolutionary program and its failure to understand the role of the party the anarchists deny politics until it seizes them by the throat then they prepare the ground for the politics of the enemy class surrendering politics and political power to the capitalist parties was the equivalent of giving the ruling class the instruments with which to bludgeon the working class back into submission the anarchists believed that by ignoring the cortes elections they were exhibiting control over that body trotsky explains sarcastically how this conception misunderstood fundamental power relations the brilliant idea of the syndicalists consists of controlling the cortes without participating in it to employ revolutionary violence to fight for power to seize power all this is not permitted in its place they recommend the control of the bourgeoisie which is in power a magnificent picture the bourgeoisie breakfasts lunches and dines and the proletariat led by the syndicalists controls these operations on an empty stomach trotsky predicted that as the mass struggle at the grassroots level rose there would be political disagreements debates and splits among the anarchist leadership indeed there already existed the divergent tendencies of the cnt and fai and rank and file understanding this political differentiation would be important for implementing a strategy on how to relate to the anarchists in struggle trotsky explained one cannot doubt that the differentiation among the anarcho syndicalists the most revolutionary wing the further it goes will find itself ever more in conflict with the sindico reformists from this left wing putschists heroic adventurists individual terrorists and others will inevitably surge up needless to say we cannot encourage any kind of adventurism but we must make sure in advance that not the right wing which combats the strikes but the left revolutionary syndicalist wing will come closer to us trotsky remained optimistic among the rank and file anarcho syndicalists there are potentially great forces for revolution therefore it was crucial for the oce to participate in the cnt in this way approaching the anarchists was similar to the socialists after the politics of anarchism fail to push the struggle forward win the rank and file to build a political movement and organization that advanced the goal of the working class taking political power the only difference in approach to the anarchists relative to the socialists was recognizing and encouraging their level of militancy but subjecting them to criticism when their anti power politics rolled the struggle backward in the end trotsky argued anarchist theory and practice would fail the test of revolution but he warned that it not also lead to the failure of the revolution itself the whole fate of world anarchism is intimately bound up with the spanish revolution and since anarcho syndicalism is moving inevitably to the most pitiful and ridiculous bankruptcy there is no doubt that the spanish revolution will be the tombstone of anarchism but it is necessary to be sure that the tombstone of anarcho syndicalism does not at the same time become the tombstone of the revolution the need for a revolutionary party trotsky s ideas regarding the united front strategy and the importance of raising democratic demands were interconnected pieces of the subjective element required for the successful advancement of the revolutionary process trotsky had clearly articulated a thorough revolutionary program however trotsky was emphatic for a successful solution of all these tasks three conditions are required a party once more a party again a party of course a revolutionary program required a party of militants to implement that strategy and have a place for radicalizing workers to go if the revolutionary left remained isolated if their party had no influence during the revolution the masses would eventually become demoralized and find no way out of the political impasse this would strengthen the forces of reaction in spain and eventually lead to the victory of fascism as early as 1931 trotsky was already identifying those who would build and lead the revolutionary party yet to be constituted in spain the radicalizing working class small agrarian and urban proprietors and agricultural workers who looked to both the socialist party and anarchists for leadership in struggle as previously noted these leaders would eventually leave them in the lurch once the revolutionary struggle peaked and the realization of proletarian power was a reality therefore having a revolutionary alternative to reformist socialism and anti political anarchism was critical if the revolution were to succeed trotsky was confident that the oce could win the best elements of the revolutionary communist left in spain to build a united party the oce had the best politics and analysis of the spanish revolution but it was only constituted in madrid in april of 1931 and barcelona in september of that year furthermore it possessed only a handful of followers the most prominent leaders being andreu nin and juan andrade who had spent the 1920 s in exile however unlike the bolshevik party during the february revolution of 1917 the oce did not have as strong a network of experienced revolutionaries cadres that were recognized leaders and agitators throughout spain the revolutionary communist organizations in 1931 were weak and politically confused the communist party pce which boasted only a few hundred members was politically isolated and subservient to the increasingly stalinized comintern the catalan federation boc led by joaquín maurín a revolutionary communist organization although critical of stalin was not consistent in its opposition to ussr policy dissociated itself often from trotsky had accommodated to catalan nationalism and anarchist syndicalism and appeared content to not extend its influence beyond cataluña in the absence of a politically sound and influential revolutionary socialist left trotsky discussed how continual unguided struggles could be a detriment to the revolution in the long run the spontaneity which at the present stage constitutes the strength of the movement may in the future become the source of its weakness to assume that the movement can continue to be left to itself without a clear program without its own leadership would mean to assume a perspective of hopelessness for the question involved is nothing less than the seizure of power even the stormiest strikes do not solve this problem not to speak of the ones that are broken if the proletariat were not to feel in the process of the struggle during the coming months that its tasks and methods are becoming clearer to itself that its ranks are becoming consolidated and strengthened then a decomposition would set in within its own ranks the broad layers aroused by the movement for the first time would once more fall into passivity the awakened hopes would very quickly be converted into disappointment and exasperation this disappointment and exasperation would abet the forces of reaction and lead to the growth and ultimate victory of fascism but with the conditions pointed out above the passivity and the hesitancy of the revolutionary party and the spontaneity of the mass movement genuine fascism would find a base in spain the big bourgeoisie would conquer the unbalanced disappointed and despairing petty bourgeois masses and direct their restlessness against the proletariat the lack of a revolutionary party rooted in the class struggle in 1931 meant that the pace of struggle would develop slower consequently participation in the cortes elections in june was an important starting point for winning political influence trotsky explained is there any basis for thinking that the convocation of this cortes will be interrupted by a second revolution there is no basis whatever powerful movements of the masses are quite possible but without a program without a party these movements cannot bring about a second revolution to call for a boycott would now be to call for self isolation it is necessary to participate most actively in the election the current pre revolutionary period gave the oce a chance to win the best fighters to its organization trotsky explained how a revolutionary party is steeled and disciplined in the struggle the mighty pressure of the masses welds the party together the internal struggle trains the party and makes its own road clear to it in this struggle all the members of the party gain a deep confidence in the correctness of the policy of the party and in the revolutionary reliability of the leadership only such a conviction in the rank and file bolshevik won through experience and ideological struggle gives the leadership the chance to lead the whole party into battle at the necessary moment and only a deep confidence in the party itself in the correctness of its policy inspires the working masses with confidence in the party the right of nations to self determination the right of colonial morocco cataluña and the basque region to self determination was a democratic demand that would play a significant role in the development of the spanish revolution the demand for self determination was derived from definite conditions of uneven economic development and could only be achieved through the leadership of the working class and the realization of socialism for centuries madrid acted as an imperialist bureaucratic centralizer over a country that experienced weak economic development regional dispersal and the salience of culturally autonomous regions in its political life the social base of regional nationalism predominated among the radicalizing petty capitalists small business owners sharecroppers tenant farmers and peasants and also found a hearing among the working class even though the social basis of nationalist politics originated outside the working class it was the duty of revolutionaries to defend these political movements as long as castile sought to subjugate these regions the struggle for self determination was a progressive and democratic movement of nations or regions to determine their own affairs this was a demand ever more important for revolutionaries to defend especially against the current democratic government of the republicans and socialists trotsky explained the chief carrier of the national tendencies and illusions is the petty bourgeois intelligentsia striving to find support among the peasantry against the centralizing role of big capital and the state bureaucracy at the present stage the leading role of the petty bourgeoisie in the national liberation movement as in every revolutionary democratic movement in general inevitably brings into the movement numerous prejudices of various kinds from this source national illusions also seep in among the workers but what has been said does not at all diminish the progressive revolutionary democratic character of the catalan national struggle against the spanish great power chauvinism bourgeois imperialism and bureaucratic centralism it must not be forgotten for a minute that spain as a whole and cataluña in particular are at present governed not by catalan national democrats but by spanish bourgeois imperialists in alliance with the landowners old bureaucrats and generals and with the support of the spanish national socialists this whole fraternity stands on the one hand for the continued subjugation of the spanish colonies and on the other for the maximum bureaucratic centralization of spain itself that is for the suppression by the spanish bourgeoisie of the catalans the basques and the other nationalities at the present stage of developments with the given combination of class forces catalan nationalism is a progressive revolutionary factor spanish nationalism is a reactionary imperialist factor the nationalist politics of catalans basques and moroccans reflected a petty bourgeois social outlook which was directed at the big capitalist buttressed by the imperial state not at the capitalist system as a whole for this reason revolutionary workers should maintain independence from the politics of these classes on the other hand the working class in the autonomous regions needed to support the struggle against the reactionary bourgeoisie in order to advance the workers revolution trotsky explained petty bourgeois national illusions are capable of dismembering the proletariat of spain along national lines but the spanish communists can successfully fight against this danger in only one way by pitilessly denouncing the violence of the bourgeoisie of the ruling nation and in that way winning the confidence of the proletariat of the oppressed nationality any other policy would be tantamount to supporting the reactionary nationalism of the imperialist bourgeoisie of the ruling nation against the revolutionary democratic nationalism of the petty bourgeoisie of an oppressed nation therefore the fight for self determination like any democratic demand required revolutionary leadership of the working class to lead the battle within society to defeat the reactionary imperialist right from the correspondence between trotsky and the oce it is evident that a burning question remained unanswered what if the struggle for self determination led to the complete separation of the autonomous regions from madrid this question was particularly pressing in the case of cataluña an industrially developed region relative to others and home to spain s most militant working class trotsky answered this question distinguishing between the two forms of separatism that of the capitalists and that of the workers the separatist tendencies present the revolution with the democratic task of national self determination but while the separatism of the catalan bourgeoisie is only a pawn in its play with the madrid government against the catalan and spanish people the separatism of the workers and peasants is only the shell of their social rebellion one must distinguish very rigidly between these two forms of separatism however if revolutionaries defended the right of cataluña to separate and that struggle matured would this not lead to the balkanization of spain into smaller antagonistic states to answer this trotsky drew on the experience of the bolsheviks approach to nations in the balkan peninsula he explained there was a time when the balkan peninsula was unified under the domination of the turkish gentry the militarists and the proconsuls the oppressed people longed to overthrow their oppressors if opposition to partitioning the peninsula had been counter posed to these aspirations of the people we would have been acting as lackeys to the turkish pashas and beys on the other hand however we know that the balkan peoples liberated from the turkish yoke have been at one another s throats for decades in this matter too the proletarian vanguard can apply the point of view of the permanent revolution liberation from the imperialist yoke which is the most important element of the democratic revolution leads immediately to the federation of soviet republics as the state form for the proletarian revolution not opposing the democratic revolution but on the contrary supporting it completely even in the form of separation that is supporting the struggle but not the illusions we at the same time bring our own independent position into the democratic revolution recommending counseling encouraging the idea of the soviet federation of the iberian peninsula as a constituent part of the united states of europe in sum the right to self determination of the basques and catalans was integral to the fight for and establishment of a socialist federation of states and not a balkanized constellation of smaller nationalistic and warring nations revolutionary workers needed to bring their independent socialist position into any democratic movement for self determination support the struggle but not the illusions of the nationalist basque and catalan bourgeoisie if separation were to take place it would have to be realized in conjunction with workers revolution throughout spain anything less would mean probable counter revolution trotsky noted that the workers formed the majority in cataluña giving them decisive influence on the question of self determination it was plausible that workers may not want to separate and demand only regional autonomy drawing the conclusion that they have a better chance of winning workers revolution as a united spanish working class trotsky noted that while a movement for separation from madrid may occur in these regions it was not the duty of revolutionaries to insist on this policy absent the support of the majority of people in the region trotsky argued in order to draw the line between the nationally oppressed workers and peasants and their bourgeoisie the proletarian vanguard must take the boldest and most sincere position on the question of national self determination the workers will fully and completely defend the right of the catalans and basques to organize their state life independently in the event that the majority of these nationalities express themselves for complete separation but this does not of course mean that the advanced workers will push the catalans and basques on the road of secession on the contrary the economic unity of the country with extensive autonomy of national districts would represent great advantages for the workers and peasants from the viewpoint of economy and culture whether the movement in cataluña and the basque regions declared itself for autonomy or complete separation the objective for the revolutionary working class in the movement for national and regional determination was the same workers revolution socialism would be the only way to substantively free colonies like spanish morocco and regions from castilian imperialism how would revolutionaries gauge the sentiment among the catalan and basque masses for self determination trotsky answered by means of a free plebiscite or an assembly of catalan representatives or by the parties that are clearly supported by the catalan masses or even by a catalan national revolt trotsky added that the struggle for self determination would not be decided merely by petty bourgeois nationalists can the catalan workers have an indifferent attitude to the attempts of the petty bourgeois democracy subordinated as always to big capital to decide the fate of the catalan people with the aid of anti democratic elections without the slogans of political democracy to supplement and concretize it the slogan of national self determination is a senseless formula or still worse it is dust thrown in the eyes in other words the catalan and basque fight for self determination would be meaningless if the movement did not involve the working class which held great social weight in the catalan and basque region and become part of the broader movement for democracy and socialist revolution throughout spain with respect to morocco revolutionaries required unflinching anti imperialist politics in order to solidarize with the colonial oppressed in the end the nationalist movements in cataluña and the basque region did not demand full separation but regional autonomy conclusion trotsky s methodical scientific and marxist approach to spanish conditions at the very beginning of revolutionary process of 1930 31 has been established now it is time to turn to the pre civil war years of 1930 1935 and assess how well trotsky s ideas anticipated the general momentum of historical events during these years notes

by chen jia china daily updated 2019 06 29 15 22 the people s bank of china headquarters in beijing aug 3 2018 investors are looking for fresh cues on possible monetary policy moves amid growing concerns that lingering trade tensions will prompt policymakers to consider more easing measures a regular monetary policy committee meeting of the people s bank of china the central bank has led to discussions on possible monetary policy adjustments whether it will follow the other major central banks to ease policy especially through cutting the long term unchanged benchmarked interest rates once the united states federal reserve cuts policy rates at the end of july and economic growth downside risks increase china may follow the fed in cutting interest rates if there is no major change in the inflation levels said li chao chief researcher of huatai securities the renminbi will however face pressure even against a weaker us dollar if the central bank eases the monetary policy further economists said a statement on the pboc website said that the renminbi exchange rate has been stable until now the currency will have stronger capacity to resist external shocks due to the enhanced economic resilience it said but monetary authorities are keeping a close watch on changes in the global and domestic economic financing situation the pboc reaffirmed that necessary and innovative monetary policy tools will be used to counter financial stress and keep liquidity at a reasonably ample level before the ongoing g20 summit in osaka japan the us federal reserve sent a signal that it might cut the policy rates later this year as global economic uncertainties are rising and domestic inflationary pressures are subdued the european central bank president mario draghi has also indicated in recent speeches that the bank was planning to further ease monetary policy if the monetary easing continues it will create more liquidity and i am very much concerned about that naoyuki yoshino dean and ceo of the asian development bank institute told china daily in osaka the relatively lower interest rates in the us and the eu have triggered capital inflows into asian countries in order to maintain stable capital inflows the rest of the world has to cut interest rates if the fed cuts the policy rate afterward said yoshino citing japan s recent monetary easing as an example chinese leaders have reiterated on different occasions that the country will avoid beggar thy neighbor policies and not use the exchange rate as a weapon to solve trade issues instead efforts will be more on enhancing the macroeconomic policy coordination with other countries chen yulu vice governor of the pboc said that china expects the g20 summit to deliver clear and positive signals to improve macroeconomic policy coordination and stabilize the global financial system with fiscal monetary and structural policy tools the monetary policy committee said it would strive to maintain a prudent policy to avoid aggressive monetary easing and focus on supporting the real economy it also pledged to maintain the renminbi exchange rate at a reasonably stable equilibrium whether the pboc will follow the us fed on rate cuts is especially relevant due to the escalating china us trade tensions and it has been a major cause for the growing uncertainties in the growth outlooks of both economies said lu ting chief economist of nomura securities a tokyo based brokerage as china is in a prolonged transformation of its interest rate regime the likelihood of the pboc cutting the benchmark lending and deposit rates is quite small but it may lower some quasi policy rates such as the reverse repo rate the medium term lending facility rate and the standing lending facility rate if the fed cuts rates said lu

the three northern triangle nations have done little to provide for the poor honduras guatemala and el salvador are by all accounts countries ravaged by gang violence drug trafficking and extreme poverty it s these elements that have driven wave after wave of illegal immigration to the u s drawing the ire of president donald trump and yet the bond market views the nations especially the first two as stable almost safe investments in some cases they can borrow at similar rates to regional powerhouses brazil and mexico it s an odd thing almost improbable sounding and it reveals a surprising truth about these countries they all have rock solid fiscal accounts advertisement how s that possible in such destitute places because it turns out they earmark precious little money to basic social programs not only does this save them cash allowing them to hold down their budget deficits but it has the effect of encouraging the poor those who would benefit the most from greater outlays for healthcare or housing to emigrate this in turn has an added advantage for these nations the migrants send growing quantities of dollars to their families back home generating a steady flow of hard currency that is a central pillar of their economies for some perspective their value is roughly 30 times greater than the aid money that a frustrated trump pulled from the countries this week when all of these elements are stitched together and viewed holistically it can appear as if the economic model these governments have adopted is one based on exporting people that might be an over simplification and it may not be the governments intent but it is the net effect of the policy mix according to longtime observers of the region migration is part of the model said seynabou sakho the world bank s director for central america a country may not have a big deficit but at the same time the needs of its people aren t being met officials in the finance ministries and presidential offices of el salvador honduras and guatemala didn t respond to requests for comment sakho s colleagues at the world bank run what they call social protection studies they try to measure how much support governments provide for the poor and the vulnerable and they break their work down into several key indicators poverty reduction access to government assistance and the impact of that assistance the three central american nations known collectively as the northern triangle rank toward the bottom in each of those categories the world bank also tracks social spending on a per capita basis in el salvador the number came to 562 it was even lower in honduras 278 and guatemala 258 that s a fraction of the 2 193 spent in costa rica or the 2 269 in brazil the world bank hasn t updated that data set since 2012 but analysts say there have been few signs of improvement in recent years patronage and corruption they say is compounding the shortfall siphoning off funds earmarked for the poor transparency international ranks the three nations in the bottom half of its corruption perceptions index with guatemala in the lowest quartile lucrecia mack said she was astonished by how rampant graft was when she took the top job at guatemala s health ministry in 2016 it s everywhere she said documents are falsified signatures are forged invoices are made up she remembers one scheme where officials bought new tires for ambulances re sold them to pocket the cash and left the old ones on the vehicles the little money that the health ministry has winds up in the wrong hands said mack the daughter of a renowned human rights activist who was slain in 1990 according to her calculations guatemala only spends about one fifth of what it should annually on health care the budget has always been extremely tight as a result she said the ministry only has enough public clinics and hospitals to attend to about 6 5 million people that was the population in 1975 it s more than doubled since poor infrastructure like lack of running water and proper sewage in many places exacerbates the effects of the funding shortfall maternal mortality rates for example are highest in the rural communities where there are the fewest highways mack said she reeled off a litany of other health problems plaguing the nation pneumonia diarrhea diabetes cirrhosis infant mortality chronic malnutrition mack lasted just 13 months in her post when the president jimmy morales expelled a un backed body that had begun looking into his government as part of an investigation into organized crime in the country she resigned in protest hugo noe pino paints a similarly bleak picture in honduras the former central bank chief says the lack of funding is so extreme that some patients have been left to bring their own screws for surgeries on broken bones in public hospitals that s the sort of horror story that s often heard nowadays in crisis torn venezuela but venezuela is broke having blown through almost its entire stash of hard currency and defaulted on its foreign debt honduras on the other hand could easily tap the bond market for additional financing especially at a time when rock bottom rates in developed countries are pushing investors to seek better returns elsewhere so too could guatemala even el salvador can sell debt at rates roughly in line with those paid by costa rica the playground for american tourists that has been the region s longtime oasis of stability but they rarely do the three countries went two years without selling a single foreign bond among them until guatemala broke that drought last month fiscal austerity has become such a single minded priority in these countries as a means to keep inflation in check and their currencies stable that even the international monetary fund an institution that s been pilloried for years for pushing draconian budget cuts has urged guatemala to spend more there s an obsession with this issue said ricardo castaneda an economist with icefi a guatemala city based think tank that focuses on fiscal policy pino who has also served as honduras s finance minister acknowledged that the government has ramped up spending on security some in a bid to tame the violence but said that it came at the expense of health and education programs meantime housing and transportation projects are often under the condition of political support they are done selectively and don t have a significant impact on levels of poverty he said even after the increase in security spending honduras still doesn t rank particularly high on a global scale in this category none of the three countries do where they do top the charts is on homicide rates a world bank report places el salvador first honduras second and guatemala 13th immigration is a symptom of the diseases we have violence lack of economic growth lack of investments in all of the rural areas nayib bukele said at a conference in washington a few weeks before being sworn in as president of el salvador this month people don t leave their families and country to cross three frontiers and a desert because things are fine bukele s predecessor salvador sanchez ceren did seek to boost social spending during his five year term congress balked at the idea of taking on additional debt though and the legislation died morales also made a brief attempt to ratchet up expenditures in guatemala he was going to fund it by raising the country s tax rates which are among the world s lowest but the business community mobilized to quickly kill the plan the two candidates vying to succeed morales have pledged to try again to boost spending meanwhile the exodus from the three countries continues to build more than 144 000 migrants were taken into custody along the u s border in may a 32 jump from april and the biggest monthly total in 13 years according to customs and border protection almost four fifths of those apprehended were from the northern triangle amazingly about 1 out of every 200 hondurans was taken into custody at the border in the month all of this has only served to further rile up trump he vented publicly for days about a migrant caravan moving toward the border late last year and then in may he lashed out against mexico saying its government wasn t doing enough to detain and process those migrating illegally or seeking asylum he threatened to punish mexico by imposing tariffs only to back off the idea days later when mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador pledged to expand the deployment of the national guard along the country s southern border the migrants though will keep coming until things change radically at home there is a need to invest much more in human capital whether we are talking about health whether we are talking about education whether we are talking about social protection said sakho the world bank director this has been really at the root of the lack of economic opportunities that we are seeing that are leading to migration from bloomberg share this share print twitter telegram tumblr reddit pocket linkedin pinterest mastodon whatsapp email facebook like this like loading
listen to this article describe k511bn provisional budget unrealistic some legislators on friday challenged new minister of finance economic planning and development joseph mwanamvekha to justify what they described as unrealistic assumptions in the k511 3 billion provisional budget he presented but the house later approved the budget mwanamvekha presents the provisional budget photograph lisa kadango mana among other things the members of parliament mps questioned the minister s assumptions to reduce domestic debt from the current 4 1 percent of gross domestic product gdp to 0 3 percent and his projections on the exchange rate with the dollar which is currently at k760 to an average of k750 which the legislators said were unrealistic mwanamvekha presented the interim budget pursuant to section 178 of the constitution and after a resolution for the national assembly to approve and authorise him to withdraw from the consolidated fund an amount not exceeding k511 269 522 794 for the purpose of meeting expenditure necessary to carry on services of government from july 1 2019 to october 31 2019 the interim budget for four months is about 36 percent of the 2018 19 revised fiscal plan of k1 429 trillion which expires tomorrow the budget initially pegged at k1 454 trillion was revised downwards on account of non disbursement of budget support by the world bank among other factors presenting the budget mwanamvekha said exchange rate is expected to average k750 to the dollar and that government will reduce domestic borrowing from 4 1 percent of gdp to 0 3 percent between july and october 2019 inflation rate the minister said is also expected to average eight percent during this period under adding that only ongoing projects will be provided for in the provisional budget provisions for new projects will be made in the main budget and all contractual obligations which fall due within the four months under consideration have been provided for said mwanamvekha gwengwe public debt not in control in instant reactions to the budget some mps expressed scepticism especially over the underlying assumptions of the budget describing some of them as unrealistic and overly ambitious the minister aims to cut domestic debt from 4 1 percent of gdp to 0 3 percent how does he intend to achieve this questioned mp for lilongwe msozi north sosten gwengwe who is also malawi congress party mcp spokesperson on finance in parliament he said malawi s public debt stock estimated at around k3 trillion is currently not under control and is unsustainable gwengwe said we have taken these loans willy nilly instead of giving pay rises to our civil servants we are busy paying companies huge sums of money in form of interest payments questioned borrowing kalua earlier this week the world bank also lamented over huge accumulation of debt stock which it says largely stems from recurring fiscal deficits as government continues to overspend above what it collects in terms of government revenue mzimba north alliance for democracy aford mp yeremiah chihana also wondered why mwanamvekha is projecting that exchange rate will average k750 to a dollar when on the market the kwacha is already trading at k817 to a dollar adding that it is clear that the economy is bleeding he said reducing borrowing to 0 3 percent is not realistic it is my hope that this is not just mere rhetoric the situation on the ground shows that malawians are economic refugees in their own country taking his turn rumphi east lawmaker kamlepo kalua people s party also questioned the 4 1 percent of gdp domestic borrowing figure that mwanamvekha mentioned in the provisional budget according to kalua domestic borrowing as a percentage of gdp stands at 5 8 percent and not 4 1 as the minister said a latest world bank malawi economic monitor mem launched in lilongwe on tuesday vindicates kalua as it says net domestic borrowing has been revised upwards to 6 percent of gdp from the previously estimated level of 4 7 percent karonga central mp cornelius mwalwanda mcp who once served as deputy finance minister in bingu wa mutharika s administration also doubted the average exchange of k750 to a dollar assumption underpinning the provisional budget as well as the k50 7 billion grants that treasury expects to receive from development partners during the period under review with the current situation it won t be easy to receive such an amount of grants said mwalwanda the provisional budget has revenue and grants amounting to k461 2 billion of which k410 5 billion is domestic revenues and k50 7 billion are grants reacting to the concerns later mwanamvekha said the provisional budget has a net domestic borrowing of k16 5 billion which he said is lower than the k84 3 billion for the same period in the 2018 2019 budget on debt stock the minister insisted that as far as treasury is concerned domestic debt as a percentage of gdp stands at 4 1 percent on exchange rate mwanamvekha while hoisting a copy of the nation defended the assertion by chihana that the kwacha is already showing signs of appreciation against the united states dollar check in today s newspaper the buying rate is k760 while the selling rate is k770 we should be able to have an exchange rate of k750 soon and we are moving towards that tobacco dollars will help us stabilise already 100 million about k77 billion has been realised from tobacco sales the kwacha will soon remain stable said the minister in the budget wages and salaries are projected at k135 billion representing 34 percent of the 2018 2019 fiscal plan development expenditure has a total provision of k116 5 billion of which k98 7 billion is foreign financed while k17 9 billion is domestically financed
president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to

spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment

u s review incoming data unlikely to dissuade fed cuts all eyes are on president trump and chinese president xi as they meet at the g 20 meeting to see if they can hammer out a trade truce please see our topic of the week section on page 7 for our take on the potential outcome trade concern has clouded business certainty on investment spending and perhaps hiring plans consumer confidence has also been hit though spending has fared slightly better inflation seems to be coming in modestly firmer in the second quarter though not enough to dissuade the fed from cutting rates in our view incoming data unlikely to dissuade fed cuts all eyes are on president trump and chinese president xi as they meet at the g 20 summit to see if they can hammer out a trade truce in short we do not expect a deal nor further levies to come out of the meeting but instead for it to result in further negotiation you can find more on this in our topic of the week section but here we emphasize that despite the cease fire since late march the mere threat of additional tariffs has weighed on business confidence and investment spending and is likely to do so until a resolution is met the u s commerce department reported this week that durable goods orders declined 1 3 in may surpassing consensus expectations for a scant 0 3 decline the good news taking the may decline at face value likely overstates the weakness of factory activity in may boeing s ongoing struggles with its 737 max fleet of aircraft were largely to blame for the decline in orders given the volatile nondefense aircraft component declined nearly 30 over the month that followed almost a 40 decline the previous month and obscures a modestly firmer trend in underlying core orders the bad news recall it is nondefense capital goods shipments that feed into the bea s estimates of equipment spending in the gdp report which on a three month average annualized basis were down 11 3 in may that is not a good sign for q2 equipment spending but again this is entirely due to the halt in boeing shipments ex aircraft nondefense capital goods shipments are up at a 1 7 pace and suggest a moderately firmer trend in investment spending the u s federal aviation agency found a new safety issue in the 737 max computer system this week which is expected to delay the aircraft s return to service and deliveries up to three more months further more recent readings on new orders from purchasing managers indices suggest factory activity remains under pressure the tabling of mexican tariffs points to some room for improvement but without a resolution to trade disputes with china we expect factory activity to continue to languish amid the resulting uncertainty and floundering global growth uncertainty regarding trade has also likely weighed on consumer confidence in recent months but the slower job growth in may was also likely a factor in the weakness while the labor market is still hot by most measures it is not as strong as it was according to measures of consumer confidence the jobs plentiful index has rolled over in recent months and is worryingly reminiscent of what we have seen late in prior cycles the job opening rate and small business hiring plans have also come down slightly though they too remain high it is possible that businesses are holding off on hiring until trade tensions dissipate but if these patterns hold job growth could slow in coming months something the fed is likely monitoring despite uncertainty spending data have fared slightly better personal consumption rose 0 4 in may following an upwardly revised 0 6 in april and suggest personal consumption expenditures are on track to come in north of 3 0 in the second quarter inflation fared better as well with the pce deflator rising 1 6 on a year ago basis in may even despite the modestly firmer footing in q2 inflation data this week are unlikely to dissuade the fed from cutting rates later this year u s outlook ism manufacturing monday in may manufacturing activity continued to weaken as the ism index dipped to 52 1 marking the slowest pace of growth in the factory sector since october 2016 last week the preliminary markit pmi unexpectedly tumbled even further to 50 1 the lowest reading since september 2009 with still no resolution of a trade deal slower economic growth out of china and weaker global demand further weakening in the ism index is likely other purchasing managers indices have also indicated slippage for june all regional fed pmi survey s declined for the month suggesting we should expect downside momentum in manufacturing activity a sub 50 reading could potentially add to the market s call that the fed will cut its target range for the fed funds rate 50 bps at its next meeting on july 31 we look for the ism to remain in expansion territory consistent with a smaller reduction in rates previous 52 1 wells fargo 51 3 consensus 51 2 ism non manufacturing wednesday the ism non manufacturing index rose more than expected in may to 56 9 while the index is still below its six month average the growth in the service sector continues to outpace the manufacturing sector the preliminary read of the markit service sector pmi fell in june to 50 7 the worst reading since february 2016 meanwhile the regional fed service sector surveys also showed activity slowing in june we therefore expect the june ism non manufacturing index to ease to 55 7 a sharp miss to the downside would generate more cause for concern about a slowdown in the economy although it does not get as much attention as the manufacturing index the ism non manufacturing index encompasses a majority of the economy and can offer greater insight into the stability of current economic conditions previous 56 9 wells fargo 55 7 consensus 56 0 employment friday hiring cooled in may with firms adding only 75k jobs while job gains for the prior two months saw the largest downward net revision since 2010 the three month moving average employment gain is now at only 151k initial jobless claims were little changed in june leading us to look for a rebound in hiring nonfarm payrolls tend to be a volatile series but another sub 100 print may reinforce the market s expectation that the fed will cut interest rates 50 bps in july however an upside surprise in job growth would dampen the markets aggressive rate cut expectations we expect payroll growth to rise in may adding 175k jobs while the unemployment rate should remain at 3 6 the slower rate of improvement would be consistent with only a 25 bps cut at the fed s july meeting in our view previous 75k wells fargo 175k consensus 160k global review central banks on hold for now but for how long the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz opted to hold policy rates steady however it signaled lower rates may be needed over time the central bank of mexico also kept rates on hold although it may start to tilt towards a more dovish forward guidance we continue to believe it will cut rates this year european economic and sentiment data continue to underwhelm with cpi inflation still subdued in june while measures of confidence were softer than expected this week s data continue to underpin our view that the ecb will look to ease monetary policy this year and provide new stimulus to spark the broader european economy rbnz steady but signal more cuts could be coming as widely expected the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz held its official cash rate at 1 50 this week however policymakers at the rbnz stated that the outlook for global growth has weakened while the domestic economy is also decelerating in this context the rbnz also mentioned that a lower policy rate may be needed over time as inflation continues to remain subdued and to meet its employment objectives new zealand s economy has been slowing down for some time now as demand from china softens amid a structural slowdown and persistent trade tensions with the united states as well as issues within the domestic economy in response to low inflation a softening labor market and external conditions the rbnz cut policy rates in early may and given commentary from central bank policymakers we expect the rbnz to pursue further monetary easing measures later this year market participants seem to be in agreement with this outlook as well as markets are currently pricing in two more rate cuts from the rbnz over the next twelve months central bank of mexico finally turning dovish on thursday the central bank of mexico opted to keep policy rates steady at 8 25 with policymakers voting to hold rates with a vote of 4 1 this vote represents the first divided decision since november 2018 and in our view is a signal that the central bank of mexico may be starting to turn more dovish than previous assessments of monetary policy we also view some of the language in the accompanying statement as relatively dovish and could be further evidence of the evolving stance on monetary policy in mexico this language includes mention of a softening economy while the central bank also noted that additional downgrades to the country s sovereign credit rating are possible and could weigh on mexican asset prices going forward we view this as a significant shift as the central bank of mexico has maintained a relatively hawkish bias this year despite a softening economy mexico s economy has decelerated sharply since 2018 and leading indicators of economic activity as well as sentiment data have been underwhelming for most of this year as well while we expected the central bank of mexico to pursue a rate cut at some point this year the tone from thursday s meeting could indicate an interest rate cut could be coming sooner than we expected europe stuck in the doldrums european economic and sentiment data continue to remain rather subdued with june cpi inflation still underwhelming the most recent inflation data indicate headline inflation held steady at 1 2 year over year while core cpi increased moderately to 1 1 despite the increase in core inflation cpi remains well below the ecb s target of close to but below 2 and recent comments from mario draghi suggest that the transmission of easy monetary policy to boost inflation has been slower to materialize than expected also concerning are the european commission s confidence measures throughout the eurozone those confidence measures have been trending lower since early 2018 with the most recent data the softest since mid 2016 the combination of weak sentiment along with deteriorating growth and inflation dynamics reintroduces the possibility of new stimulus measures from the ecb given recent comments from draghi and recent economic developments we believe the ecb will cut its deposit rate and main refinancing rate in september global outlook mexico manufacturing pmi monday over the past year or so mexico s economy has slowed significantly with q1 gdp softening and missing consensus forecasts yet again this sluggish momentum has carried into the second quarter as well with broad measures of economic activity slowing and sentiment data remaining subdued the manufacturing pmi in particular has fallen notably over the course of the year with the may pmi dropping to 50 down from a peak of 52 6 in february while the manufacturing pmi has not yet fallen into contraction territory we would not be surprised if it did so in june as the threat from president trump to impose tariffs on all of mexico s exports to the united states likely weighed on manufacturing sentiment and activity this month despite trump s decision to not impose tariffs on mexican exports we continue to believe the mexican economy will decelerate from here while the central bank of mexico will likely need to pursue rate cuts this year in order to stabilize the economy previous 50 0 reserve bank of australia tuesday australia s economy continues to markedly underperform as a sharp slowdown in the domestic housing sector along with uncertainty related to the health of china s economy and persistent u s china trade tensions weighs on economic activity and sentiment in response the reserve bank of australia rba cut its cash rate in early june for the first time in over two years while signaling further rate cuts may be appropriate going forward however over the past few days rba governor philip lowe indicated that while market participants are anticipating easier monetary policy from central banks it s possible that further monetary easing may not be as effective as markets expect despite lowe s comments markets are currently pricing in 60 bps of policy rate cuts over the next 12 months with over a 70 chance of an interest rate cut at next week s meeting we believe the rba will cut the cash rate next week and consensus forecasts share a similar view as well previous 1 25 consensus 1 00 turkey cpi inflation wednesday following the sharp depreciation of the turkish lira and delayed policy tightening from the central bank in 2018 inflation has been elevated for an extended period of time in turkey however for the past few months inflation has been on a downward trajectory falling quicker than consensus forecasts with may cpi easing to 18 7 year over year a quicker than expected slowdown in inflation could be significant as it may provide an incentive for turkey s central bank to start cutting policy rates monetary easing from the central bank at this time could likely be viewed by markets as premature and would likely result in another sharp sell off of the currency despite the economy exiting technical recession it is still fragile and a significant depreciation of the lira would likely throw turkey s economy back into recession if cpi falls below consensus forecasts again in june the probability of rate cuts could increase and our focus would shift to the next monetary policy decision in late july previous 18 71 year over year consensus 16 10 point of view interest rate watch policy ease is a global phenomenon we have been writing recently about our expectations of monetary easing by some major central banks in coming months specifically we look for the fed to reduce its target range for the federal funds rate 25 bps at its july 31 fomc meeting and another 25 bps in fourth quarter probably on october 30 top chart we also expect that on september 12 the european central bank will cut its deposit rate to 0 50 from 0 40 and its two week refinancing rate to 0 10 from 0 00 middle chart but the fed and the ecb are not the only central banks who are easing policy by our count seven central banks argentina australia chile iceland india mozambique and russia have cut policy rates in this month alone while only one norway has raised rates reasons for rate cuts by specific central banks vary but the general backdrop of slowing global growth and benign inflation is conducive for more monetary policy accommodation although we look for 50 bps of policy ease by the fed the market is currently priced for 75 bps of fomc rates cuts by early next year implemented rate cuts by many foreign central banks to date and expectations of more to come have helped to keep the u s dollar well supported as shown in the bottom chart the tradeweighted value of the dollar remains near a 17 year high the greenback has been especially robust vis à vis the currencies of many developing economies looking forward we expect that the u s dollar will depreciate modestly in coming quarters versus the currencies of many advanced economies as the growth differential between the u s economy and these economies narrow see our monthly economic outlook for details however we look for the greenback to remain generally better supported against the currencies of many developing economies emerging currencies tend to do better in an environment of strong global growth slower global growth in coming quarters should diminish the relative appeal of some of these currencies even if easier fed policy provides a modicum of support to those emerging currencies credit market insights consumer credit in its present state outstanding consumer credit rose 17 5 billion in april its fastest pace in six months revolving credit mostly linked to credit card debt rose 7 0 billion in april after a decline of 2 0 billion in march and pushed revolving credit to about 45 billion above its 2008 peak these numbers are not a cause for concern as long as we do not see a continuous rise in credit card delinquencies currently low 90 day credit card delinquencies and a reassuring debt toincome ratio do not corroborate an ailing consumer the personal saving rate is elevated while tight labor market has allowed for modest wage gains consumer expectations tend to lead consumers use of revolving credit according to the university of michigan these expectations declined to 89 3 in june but still remain near their cycle high a continuous decline in expectations could have implications for a slowdown for revolving credit or more discretionary spending but despite current uncertainty we expect consumers to continue borrowing given their strong foundation nonrevolving credit which includes items such as mortgages and student loans grew 10 5 billion in april its slowest pace in 11 months this measure of credit is often thought to be a better indicator of financial stress and a persistent downward trend could imply the economy is slowing right now this measure is quite healthy but it is something to watch in coming months topic of the week let s make a deal what s happening today marks the start of the two day annual group of 20 summit in osaka japan where leaders of 19 countries and the european union come together in what is known as the premier forum for international economic cooperation the countries included in the meeting represent 80 of global gdp and the summit s focus is likely to be concentrated on international trade and climate change among other pressing global issues u s president trump is scheduled to meet with several leaders during the summit but perhaps the most important is the meeting with chinese president xi jinping tomorrow trade talks are set to be the key topic of discussion why it matters the outcome of the meeting is keenly anticipated by markets which have been riddled with uncertainty about the trade war in recent months in early may the united states increased tariffs on 200 billion of imported chinese goods to 25 from 10 an event that contributed to weakness in global equities and emerging currency markets increasing hopes of a productive outcome from the trump xi meeting have been contributing to a recovery in markets indeed the united states and china both have a lot to lose if the trade war escalates any further with additional tariffs american and chinese consumers are likely to face higher prices and global business supply chains may be disrupted business and consumer confidence is also likely to be rattled until a truce is met on trade and investment spending and personal consumption could recede as a result in china economic growth is slowing and consumer demand is weakening in the wake of an uncertain future our takeaway we expect the united states and china will avoid a further escalation of tensions and commit to ongoing dialogue to reach an agreement china requires the united states to remove extraneous tariffs eliminate the ban on american technology sales to huawei technologies and set a trade balance that will satisfy actual demand in both countries considering these conditions we doubt there will be significant progress on saturday and that a near term deal will remain elusive
policy blunders of epic proportion have become the rule not the exception it won t be nearly as easy to spin the looming consequences new haven blinded by a surging stock market and a 50 year low in the unemployment rate few dare to challenge the wisdom of us economic policy instant gratification has compromised the rigor of objective and disciplined analysis big mistake the toxic combination of ill timed fiscal stimulus aggressive imposition of tariffs and unprecedented attacks on the federal reserve demands a far more critical assessment of trumponomics politicians and pundits can always be counted on to spin the policy debate for us president donald trump and his supporters the art of the spin has been taken to a new level apparently it doesn t matter that federal deficits have been enlarged by an estimated 1 5 trillion over the next decade or that government debt will reach a post world war ii record of 92 percent of gdp by 2029 the tax cuts driving these worrying trends are rationalized as what it takes to make america great again nor are tariffs viewed as taxes on consumers or impediments to global supply chain efficiencies instead they are portrayed as weaponized negotiating levers to force trading partners to change their treatment of the united states and attacks on the fed s independence are seen not as threats to the central bank s dual mandate to maximize employment and ensure price stability but rather as the president s exercise of his prerogative to use the bully pulpit as he and he alone sees fit three flaws there are three basic flaws with trump s approach to economic policy first there is a disconnect between intent and impact the political spin maintains that large corporate tax cuts boost us competitiveness but that doesn t mean deficits and debt don t matter notwithstanding the hollow promises of supply side economics revenue neutral fiscal initiatives that shifted the tax burden from one segment of the economy to another would have come much closer to real reform than the reduction of the overall revenue trajectory has moreover the enactment of fiscal stimulus in late 2017 when the unemployment rate was then at a cyclical low of 4 1percent headed toward the current 3 6 percent added froth to markets and the economy when it was least needed and foreclosed the option of additional stimulus should growth falter similarly trump s tariffs fly in the face of one of the twentieth century s greatest policy blunders the smoot hawley tariff of 1930 which sparked a 60 percent plunge in global trade by 1932 with foreign trade currently accounting for 28 percent of gdp versus 11 percent in 1929 the us as a debtor country today is far more vulnerable to trade related disruptions than it was as a net creditor back then ignoring the cascading stream of direct and retaliatory taxes on consumers and businesses that stem from a tariff war trump extols the virtues of tariffs as a beautiful thing that is painfully reminiscent of the 1928 republican party platform which couched tariffs as a fundamental and essential principle of the economic life of this nation and essential for the continued prosperity of the country trump ignores the lessons of the 1930s at great peril the same can be said of trump s recent fed bashing the political independence of central banking is widely regarded as the singular breakthrough needed to achieve price stability following the great inflation of the 1970s in the us passage of the so called humphrey hawkins act of 1978 gave then fed chairman paul volcker the political cover to squeeze double digit inflation out of the system through a wrenching monetary tightening had volcker lacked the freedom to act he would have been constrained by elected leaders political calculus precisely what trump is doing in trying to dictate policy to current fed chair jerome powell the second critical flaw in trump s economic policy package is its failure to appreciate the links between budget deficits tariffs and monetary policy as the late martin feldstein long stressed to the extent that budget deficits put downward pressure on already depressed domestic saving larger trade deficits become the means to fill the void with surplus foreign saving denial of these linkages conveniently allows the us to blame china for self inflicted trade deficits but with tariffs likely to divert trade and supply chains from low cost chinese producers to higher cost alternatives us consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of tax hikes raising the risk of higher inflation the latter possibility though seemingly remote today could have important consequences for us monetary policy provided of course the fed has the political independence to act finally there are always the lags to keep in mind in assessing the impact of policy while low interest rates temper short term pressures on debt service costs as budget deficits rise there is no guarantee that such a trend will persist over the longer term especially with the already elevated federal debt overhang projected to increase by about 14 percentage points of gdp over the next ten years similarly the disruptive effects of tariffs and shifts in monetary policy take about 12 18 months to be fully evident so rather than bask in today s financial market euphoria politicians and investors should be thinking more about the state of the economy in late 2020 a timeframe that happens to coincide with the upcoming presidential election cycle in assessing how current policies are likely to play out penchant for spin there is nothing remarkable about a us president s penchant for political spin what is glaringly different this time is the lack of any pushback from those who know better the national economic council established in the early 1990s as an honest broker in the executive branch to convene and coordinate debate on key policy issues is now basically dysfunctional the nec s current head larry kudlow a long standing advocate of free trade is squirming to defend trump s tariffs and fed bashing the republican party long a champion of trade liberalization is equally complicit trump s vindictive bluster has steamrolled economic policy deliberations ignoring the lessons of history rejecting the analytics of modern economics and undermining the institutional integrity of the policymaking process policy blunders of epic proportion have become the rule not the exception it won t be nearly as easy to spin the looming consequences stephen s roach a faculty

there is no doubt that the country had been plunged into a price madness influenced by what the minister of finance and economic development prof mthuli ncube said was a process of self dollarisation which had a negative bearing on the general population the prices of basic goods and services were shooting up almost every day due to the unprofessional conduct of some in the business sector who were in fact chasing the black market rate of the us dollar to the local currency the move by the government to step in and scrap the multi currency regime on local business transactions was a bold step to ensure normalcy and also restore value to the local currency and at the same time protecting workers from speculators who were taking advantage of the use of the multi currency regime the country officially ditched the multi currency regime last monday after government gazetted statutory instrument 142 of 2019 which restricts all domestic transactions to local currency terms it is therefore time all patriotic zimbabweans come together to support the government initiative to bring normalcy in the business sector and also ensure that salaries earned by workers have value at the end of the day as pronounced by president mnangagwa the removal of the multi currency regime marked the country s return to normalcy briefing local and foreign journalists on the sidelines of the african union united nations wildlife economy summit in victoria falls last week president mnangagwa said the country had properly planned for the decision it took the recent events were indicative of what was coming and what has come is that zimbabwe has gone back to normalcy which is having our own currency we were living in an abnormal situation and we said we will only move when fundamentals are correct and we have moved because fundamentals to support the local currency are in place he said posting on his twitter account last week president mnangagwa added it has always been clear that for our economy to truly take off we need our own currency while the multi currency regime helped to stabilise the economy it did not give us control of monetary policy and left us at the mercy of us dollar pricing which has been a root cause of inflation when the majority earn in the local unit but goods are priced in us dollars the outcome will only ever be a two tiered economy stable and affordable prices for those with access to us dollars while the majority face an unrealistically high cost of living this is unfair and unsustainable we also note that zimbabweans have embraced the return of the zimbabwe dollar and a majority of businesses including those who were previously trading in forex had indexed their prices in local currency members of the public also expressed relief saying the multi currency regime had become a haven for currency distortions and profiteering by unscrupulous businesses and cartels i think this is good considering that people were economically abusing us in the name of the united states dollar and rand everything is rated in forex and i think the new intervention will correct the market said mr effort tarwirei a taxi driver confederation of zimbabwe retailers president mr denford mutashu said his organisation fully embraced the local currency and supported measures to stabilise the interbank foreign currency market he said pricing distortions arising from the inflated parallel market had left most zimbabweans reeling and on the brink of total poverty zimbabwe teachers association zimta president mr richard gundane said the new policy should leave workers earning enough money to take care of their families

blowin in the wind i hope more people listen in sum they re piling on to pay your rent or mortgage the economic foolishness of all this is painful housing is not a single good it s location location location and also size and condition this isn t about homelessness everyone lives somewhere so the point is to subsidize larger better or more conveniently placed housing or to free up money for people to spend on other things economics is about incentives if the government pays for all your rent past 30 of your income that s a big incentive to rent a huge apartment and not to earn any extra income affordable housing doesn t mean affordable housing in the same way affordable hamburgers mean affordable hamburgers it s a catchword for below market rate housing usually mandated by zoning boards but now i guess to be paid for by the government but when you give away something for by definition less than the market rate that means people line up for it like scarce rent controlled apartments is one more impediment to people moving for better opportunities prices go up period it ends up entirely in the pockets of current property owners there is a good case this happened already to earn a gazillion dollars in tech you need to move to the bay area there are only so many houses so the great gains in productivity end up in the pockets of existing landowners aha you will answer but they have a fix for that rent control now sweeping the nation we know where that leads they also answer as above the federal government will start building houses and apartments i guess millenials are too young and nobody reads any history any more but we and especially europe have tried this one over and over to catastrophic failure go visit the sites of housing projects now thankfully torn down in chicago they look like chernobyl go visit the cruddy outskirts of european cities with government built cement apartment blocks this is our vision for the middle class in sum the candidates promise to repeat for housing the immense success of subsidies and supply management and provision that the the government has just accomplished for health care insurance and education it s usually a good idea to figure out what s broken before we start fixing things that idea never seems to occur to anyone in politics when talking about economic policies where is the market failure in home and apartment building why is the private sector not building more housing the answer is pretty obvious zoning building codes insane permitting processes and so forth so the government restricts supply and prices go up then it subsidizes demand and prices go up some more then it puts in price controls so the plan seems to be to bring the government s huge success with health care and health insurance to the housing market one tiny ray of light calfornia s sb50 proposal to force local zoning to allow development near transit had a similar feature yes we allow development everywhere except in poorer neighborhoods most in need of development which are protected from the evils of new starbucks and whole foods popping up these are tough times to be an economist as a matter of technocratic policy this is not hard stuff physicists don t have to write blog posts because the candidates want to enshrine the phlogistic theory of heat doctors don t have to rail about hhs policy on four humor management somehow we are left railing against fallacies understood since the 1700s it is of course no better on the right the benefits of free trade and migration have also been known since the 1700s it is just sadly that there is no debate on the right at the moment this is a real weakness of the american political equilibrium that in a reelection year all the new ideas and analysis come out of the party in opposition it would be a great time for the republican party to try to come to terms with what trumpism means how it relates to traditional conservatism and to hash out ideas like this alas that will not happen one is tempted to dismiss all this as rhetoric that will settle down in the general election but i don t think one should take too much comfort trump ended up doing a lot of exactly what he said he would do politicians often do on this i found fascinating a tidbit from dan henninger in wsj covering a poll of democrats conducted by fox news
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by kelsey johnson ottawa reuters canadian firms expect an increase in sales growth over the coming year a bank of canada survey said on friday adding to optimism that the economy is recovering from a recent downturn companies cited healthy domestic and foreign demand as well as a low canadian dollar in the central bank s quarterly business outlook survey related stories the survey which the bank said pointed to a slight improvement in sentiment after a moderation in the previous quarter was released the same day as statistics canada reported unexpectedly strong economic growth in april i don t think you d want to characterize this as a blockbuster report by any means but it is significantly more optimistic than what we saw from the survey in the first quarter andrew kelvin chief canada strategist at td securities said by phone of the companies surveyed 44 expected sales to grow at a faster rate than in the past 12 months while 21 predicted a lesser rate of sales growth in the previous survey the balance was 40 to 34 most of the sales optimism is concentrated in central canada the increase in expectations businesses said comes despite ongoing weakness in the western canadian oil industry and continued uncertainty around global trade foreign sales remain positive spurred by a low canadian dollar and sustained foreign demand especially from the united states respondents said the canadian dollar strengthened to c 1 3078 to the u s greenback or 76 46 u s cents after the survey was released despite the optimism most respondents said they anticipated the u s economy would grow more slowly than was expected in 2018 in part because of trade tensions with china i think if you re looking at a slowing u s economy the most natural thing to attribute that to is the trade tensions just because they are so present in people s conversations with businesses kelvin said canada and china are involved in their own trade dispute that has snagged several agricultural products including canola beef and pork in its crosshairs the bank of canada raised interest rates five times between july 2017 and october 2018 it has since stayed on the sidelines citing the economic challenges posed by high levels of household debt low oil prices and international trade tensions the majority of firms surveyed said they anticipated inflation will be in the lower half of the central bank s 1 to 3 inflation control range over the next two years graphic canada an economic snapshot reporting by kelsey johnson editing by david ljunggren nick zieminski and james dalgleish

for president emmerson mnangagwa s government the re introduction of the national currency a decade after its demise is a return to normalcy for president emmerson mnangagwa s government the re introduction of the national currency a decade after its demise is a return to normalcy for most of the country s citizens it s a bitter reminder of years of hyperinflation which destroyed their savings and left them bartering for daily basics remember 2008 when you needed trillions of dollars to buy bread in zimbabwe time goes backwards said edwin mapondera 34 who sells wooden sculptures in one of harare s affluent northern suburbs i m taking any currency people have not listened to this nonsense because now the famous zimbabwe dollar is going to become worthless in no time the reserve bank of zimbabwe said on monday that starting immediately currencies such as the united states dollar and south african rand would no longer be legal tender instead a quasi currency known as bond notes which can t be traded outside the country and their electronic equivalent the rtgs dollar will be termed the zimbabwe dollar by re introducing it the government is taking a risk as more people may be driven into the black market further starving the economy of already insufficient state revenue that could leave the state struggling to pay government workers who account for about 90 of its budget and with little money to shore up creaking infrastructure effects still linger from the last time the zimbabwe dollar crashed and burned transforming one of africa s most developed nations into a place where gasoline and bread were periodically unavailable with almost everyone unemployed while about a quarter of the population emigrated just two blocks from the country s premier meikles hotel what was once a neat and active bus terminus is overrun by hundreds of vendors selling everything from vegetables to spanners the 2008 catastrophe began after then president robert mugabe backed the seizure of white owned commercial farms around the turn of the century the farms new owners failed to produce exports plummeted and the national currency rapidly lost its value then the central bank turned on the printing press in a bid to meet the government s running costs within eight years inflation had reached 500 billion percent and the largest bank note was 100 trillion zimbabwe dollars foreign currencies became legal tender in 2009 that initially stabilised the economy but the strength of the dollar also made zimbabwean manufacturing companies uncompetitive against those of their lower cost south african rivals in november 2017 mugabe was ousted and replaced by emmerson mnangagwa the new president made a pledge that zimbabwe would be open for business but failed to address currency shortages and stagflation the resulting lack of investment and scarce hard currency left people lining up outside banks nor can the government pay for essential imports such as gasoline and wheat in february under the urging of finance minister mthuli ncube the central bank did away with the insistence that bond notes and the rtgs were on par with the us currency and instead created an interbank market despite this week s announcement the rtgs has continued its decline it traded at 13 50 to the dollar on tuesday according to data compiled by bloomberg bringing its fall this quarter to 69 the market was self us dollarising ncube an economist who has lectured at the university of oxford said in a video posted on twitter it was uncontrollable and we felt that we needed to bring the situation under control ordinary zimbabweans have seen at least three rounds of fuel price hikes this year and the cost of other goods such as bread and beer have risen markedly inflation officially at almost 100 is much higher if black market rates are used this is going to cause widespread panic among a highly sensitive consumer base which could provoke social unrest jee a van der linde an analyst at nkc african economics in paarl south africa said in a note to clients the country simply does not have the foreign reserves required to back its own currency moreover there is nothing that stands in the way of the rbz to create more money that sentiment is echoed by zimbabwe s business sector the central bank must exercise restraint and prudence with the printing machine the confederation of zimbabwean retailers president denford mutashu said the chamber of mines of zimbabwe said its members want to know if they will still be paid for their gold in forex they need dearly to pay for essential imports but the government s biggest challenge may be avoiding a repeat of the unrest it saw in january when streets protests led by labour unions erupted after the fuel price was more than doubled overnight at least 17 people died in the ensuing crackdown by security forces this decision destroys whatever little confidence that was left said peter mutasa president of the zimbabwe congress of trade unions as workers we reserve the right to do whatever is right for us and we will decide the way forward on how best we should proceed bloomberg

economic and monetary policy at a turning point where is the economy heading in europe the united states and china speech by yves mersch member of the executive board of the ecb at the petersberger sommerdialog königswinter 29 june 2019 despite the escalating trade dispute between the united states and china the global economy continues to grow robustly albeit at a slower pace looking at developments in major economies beyond the euro area activity in the united states is supported by the strong labour market accommodative financial conditions and current fiscal stimulus however economic growth is expected to decelerate at the same time in china the slowdown in domestic demand has been cushioned by the implementation of a series of fiscal and monetary policy measures although the escalation in the trade dispute with the united states is foreseen to weigh on trade china is expected to continue its orderly transition to a more balanced growth path the incoming data for the euro area in the first quarter of 2019 have been somewhat better than expected euro area real gdp increased by 0 4 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2019 bolstered by resilient domestic demand however survey information and economic indicators point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year this reflects the ongoing weakness in global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties that continue to weigh on euro area growth in particular in the manufacturing sector consequently the eurosystem staff projections see euro area real gdp growth of 1 2 in 2019 which will accelerate further to 1 4 in both 2020 and 2021 compared with the march 2019 staff projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up slightly for 2019 largely owing to a stronger than expected first quarter at the same time real gdp growth has been revised down for 2020 and 2021 mainly reflecting a somewhat weaker contribution of foreign demand the fundamental factors supporting the euro area expansion remain broadly in place labour market dynamics remain robust with unemployment at 7 6 in april the lowest level since august 2008 employment increased by 0 3 quarter on quarter in q1 2019 as in the previous quarter the cumulative increase in the number of people employed between q2 2013 the trough of euro area employment and q1 2019 amounts to 10 8 million nevertheless the risks surrounding euro area growth are tilted to the downside on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets turning to inflation headline inflation was 1 2 in june according to eurostat s flash estimate unchanged from may which conceals lower energy prices and a recovery in services inflation while measures of underlying inflation remained very subdued on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months before rebounding towards the end of the year oil prices as measured by the usd price of brent crude oil have risen by more than 20 since the start of the year this scenario is broadly in line with the latest eurosystem staff projections which foresee annual headline inflation of 1 3 in 2019 rising gradually to 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 broadly confirming the march outlook at the same time labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened in germany for example wages rose in the first quarter of 2019 by 2 5 in nominal terms and by 1 2 in real terms this is due to high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets which is translating into a pick up in wage growth summing up although the incoming data for the first quarter of 2019 have been somewhat better than expected weak global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties continue to act as a drag on euro area growth the monetary policy stance this led the ecb s governing council at its meeting on 6 june to take a series of decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective first we decided to adjust our forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates we now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term the decision to shift the date based part further into the future from at least through the end of 2019 to at least through the first half of 2020 transparently conveys to the public the governing council s genuine expectation that the current outlook for price stability very likely will not warrant a tightening of monetary policy at least for another year second we confirmed the ongoing full reinvestment of the principal payments from the maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation finally we determined the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii which were announced in march tltro iii operations will start in september 2019 and end in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years we decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the eurosystem s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark the rate applied in tltro iii will be lower and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points the schedule defining the borrowing costs under tltro iii is marginally less generous than that applied under the outstanding tltro ii in line with our intent of not discouraging banks that can afford to fund themselves in the market on attractive terms from doing so at tltro ii maturity at the same time the pricing schedule incorporates features that can greatly enhance our accommodative monetary policy stance as banks with strong lending performance will retain the opportunity to borrow at negative interest rates the pricing remains sufficiently generous especially when compared with alternative sources of funding for banks to keep credit flowing to firms and households on a scale that can continue to support the economy and inflation all in all this set of decisions will provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term while also preserving favourable bank lending conditions and supporting a smooth transmission of our monetary policy this being said the governing council remains ready to act in case of adverse contingencies and to use its instruments as appropriate to ensure price stability a reliable strategy is an anchor for credible monetary policy erratic policy debates for the purpose of creating short term stimulus risk undermining that credibility in the long run
a gauge of global stocks climbed on friday in advance of a meeting on trade between u s president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping as global equities notched their best first half since 1997 trump and xi will meet during a group of 20 summit this weekend in osaka japan for talks that could help resolve a yearlong trade war between china and the united states as signs of its dampening effect on global growth have become more prevalent everybody s anticipating a positive meeting between trump and president xi said denis sandy villere portfolio manager at villere co in new orleans it s priced in as if it s a foregone conclusion it s making us a little nervous that the market s already baked in all that good news economic data on friday showed us consumer spending increased moderately in may and prices rose slightly pointing to slowing economic growth and benign inflation pressures which could give the federal reserve enough leeway to cut interest rates in july wall street rose buoyed by financial shares in following the results of the us federal reserve s stress tests although each of the major indexes snapped a three week winning streak the s p 500 had its best june performance since 1955 while the dow marked its best june since 1938 the dow jones industrial average rose 72 84 points or 0 27 to 26 599 42 the s p 500 gained 16 53 points or 0 57 to 2 941 45 and the nasdaq composite added 38 49 points or 0 48 to 8 006 24 banking shares also helped european indexes move higher ahead of the meeting with germany s dax leading the way with a gain of more than 1 thanks to gains in deutsche bank ag also read airtel africa ipo debuts at 80 pence key things to know the pan european stoxx 600 index rose 0 70 to notch its best first half since 1998 and msci s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0 44 msci s index scored its best month since january gaining more than 6 in june as equities rallied after major central banks around the globe pivoted toward easier monetary policy stances that shift came as trade negotiations between the united states and china broke down earlier this year now markets are betting that an interest rate cut by the federal reserve of at least a quarter of a percentage point is a virtual certainty as early as the next policy meeting in july according to cme s fedwatch tool on thursday china s central bank pledged to support a slowing economy before the release of data that is expected to show china s factory activity slowed for a second consecutive month in june the dollar index fell 0 01 against a basket of major currencies and was set to turn in its weakest monthly performance since january 2018 as anticipation of a fed rate cut has pushed the index down about 1 7 this month
bloomberg president donald trump wants a weaker dollar to help boost exports and is counting on the federal reserve to help make that happen but the central bank s chairman jerome powell has made clear it s not his job it s a new twist in the broader pressure campaign the president has brought to bear on powell to cut interest rates to energize the stock market and fuel growth trump s focus on the dollar surfaced last week after the european central bank said it might ease policy prompting the euro to drop against the dollar trump seized on the move to say on june 18 that the fed s failure to lower rates was putting u s exporters at a competitive disadvantage he later mused on june 26 he d rather have ecb president mario draghi running the fed powell once again is finding himself on the defensive trying to shield the fed from political influence he deflected trump s calls back at the administration the treasury department the administration is responsible for exchange rate policy full stop powell said june 25 in response to a question from the audience after a speech in new york we don t comment on the level of the dollar we certainly don t target the level of the dollar we target domestic economic and financial conditions as other central banks do trump has explored options for removing or demoting powell over the fed s interest rate decisions which the president says have hampered growth and the currency comments offer yet another point of tension between the world s most powerful leader and its most influential central banker last week trump accused both europe and china of weakening their currencies to gain a competitive advantage some wall street banks are questioning whether the u s might intervene in currency markets make no mistake about it what draghi and other central banks are doing is the same as what china is doing weakening their currencies said dan dimicco who was an adviser to trump s campaign and presidential transition and now sits on an administration trade advisory committee the trump administration has from the start deviated from a 20 year old policy that a strong dollar was in the nation s best interest treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in 2017 that an excessively strong dollar could have negative effects on the american economy and trump has made similar comments since taking office the repeated intense comments by the president lead me to believe that we re no longer pursuing a strong dollar policy said nathan sheets chief economist for pgim fixed income and a former treasury official from the obama administration this is a distinct new chapter in u s currency management and strategy the strong dollar mantra was developed by then treasury secretary robert rubin in 1995 underpinning it is the view that a robust currency reflects a healthy economy and bolsters foreign demand for u s debt by reducing the prospect of currency losses while a stronger dollar helps american consumers by lowering the cost of imports it also compounds manufacturers struggles by making exports less competitive trump has an unlikely supporter in wanting a weaker dollar senator elizabeth warren the massachusetts democrat who s running for president she proposes actively managing the dollar to counter foreign investors and central banks moves trump and warren s ideas very much could trigger a currency war said fred bergsten an economist and author of the dollar s dilemma but those who advocate that a weaker dollar is better for the u s say that former president ronald reagan s administration was able to do it in the 1980s without destroying faith in the greenback in 1985 the u s worked with five countries including germany and japan to weaken the dollar in what was called the plaza accord but such a deal is unlikely under the trump administration a senior white house official said our standing internationally is so weak and incoherent that the u s can t pull something like this off said steve hanke an economist at johns hopkins university yet trump believes that countries manipulate their exchange rate through monetary policy said the official which is why the president is turning to the fed for help

vary in accordance with their high water marks our terrific may performance was almost completely unwound in june as our myriad short positions the fund is currently very net short reversed themselves despite this setback we remain very net short as i continue to believe we re entering a bear market for u s stocks in fact although the s p 500 set a nominal new high this month the individual stocks and russell 2000 index we re short are all well below their 52 week highs and there s ample evidence the u s economic slowdown is worsening while global negative yielding debt a sign of a massive looming economic slowdown has broached the insane level of 13 trillion and have a look at how ugly u s rail traffic is although the world s economic problems are exacerbated by trump s tariffs they re not caused by them the cause is too much debt combined with satiated consumption following a 10 year economic expansion meanwhile the fed s ongoing until october balance sheet contraction combined with a lack of european qe and a drastic reduction in japanese qe will allow the deflation of the economic and asset bubbles those money printing policies created and the fed s anticipated rate cuts later this year will do little to prevent that also keep in mind that much of the u s bull market s rise came from corporate buybacks and those tend to slow drastically when the economy does as the looming recession unfolds and those buyers disappear look out below seeking the most overvalued of all stock indices we thus remain short the russell 2000 iwm which has a trailing twelve month gaap pe ratio of 35 on what i believe are peak earnings while 35 of its constituents lose money elsewhere in the fund s short positions we remain short stock and call options in tesla inc tsla which i consider to be the biggest single stock bubble in this whole bubble market the core points of our tesla short thesis are tesla has no moat of any kind i e nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car design or technology while existing automakers unlike tesla have a decades long experience moat of knowing how to mass produce distribute and service high quality cars consistently and profitably tesla is now a busted growth story demand for its existing models has peaked and it will have to raise billions of dollars to produce new ones in a soon to be saturated market tesla is losing a ton of money with a terrible balance sheet while confronting massive competition in every aspect of its business elon musk is extremely untrustworthy tesla s q2 guidance is to sell 90 100 000 cars and while my own current guess is lower at around 86 000 to perhaps as high as 88 000 due to 2019 s massive price slashing approximately six official cuts so far this year plus huge discounting on top of that whatever the delivery number is it will occur at by far tesla s lowest asp ever tesla reported a disastrous q1 with a gaap loss of 702 million over 900 million excluding regulatory credit sales on just 63 000 deliveries my guess is that due to q2 s much lower asps it will have an average of around 4000 car in reduced gross profit on those first 63 000 cars i e minus 252 million while collecting only around 6000 car in incremental gross profit on the additional 23 000 q2 cars sold i e 138 million thus all else being equal tesla would lose an additional net of 114 million 252 million 138 million in q2 vs q1 s 702 million i e an astounding loss of 840 million however the copmpany may be able to book some additional emissions credits and recognize some non cash deferred autopilot revenue as well as avoid some one time write downs from q1 so even if it comes up with 340 million of non repeating q2 cost reduction revenue recognition vs q1 tesla will still lose around 500 million gaap in the quarter whatever q2 loss tesla prints would be at least 100 million greater if the company were providing adequate customer service twitter is filled with complaints from aggrieved owners some of them rather famous who can t reach anyone to fix their myriad problems within a reasonable timeframe although this is resulting in true brand destruction due to the high cost of batteries teslas are inherently unprofitable and thus improving the ownership experience would only increase the losses in other words tesla is truly a non viable business the party s over folks with no profitable growth massive ongoing losses and tens of billions of dollars in debt and purchase obligations the equity in tesla will prove worthless either quickly or following a series of increasingly ugly capital raises slowly and yet as the stock is currently still over 200 share i shall continue with most of the pent up demand for cheaper models fulfilled in q2 along with an 1875 cut in the u s tax credit on july 1 i expect a large slide in q3 q4 deliveries with tesla showing declines both sequentially and year over year vs q3 and q4 2018 things would be even worse in q3 if tesla didn t have several years of the uk s right hand drive model 3 backlog to fill which it plans to do in the quarter thus full year tesla deliveries will be only around 300 000 vs guidance of 360 000 to 400 000 and the full year gaap loss will be egregiously bad most likely well over 2 billion and for those of you looking for a resumption of growth from tesla s supposedly upcoming model y by the time it s available in late 2020 or 2021 if tesla is still in business it will face superior competition from the much nicer audi q4 e tron bmw ix3 mercedes eqb and volvo xc40 while less expensive and available now are the excellent new all electric hyundai kona and kia niro extremely well reviewed small crossovers with an epa range of 258 miles for the hyundai and 238 miles for the kia at prices of under 30 000 inclusive of the 7500 u s tax credit meanwhile the model 3 sedan will have terrific direct competition in 2020 from volvo s beautiful new polestar 2 and if you think china will be the saving grace for tesla i have bad news for you not only is the competition there for ev market share becoming a vicious dogfight see all the links below but beijing is now switching its subsidies to hydrogen fueled cars which it perceives as better than evs early in may tsla did an ugly convertible debt and equity deal to plug a hole in a very leaky bucket netting approximately 2 3 billion which on the back of my envelope means it will still be completely out of cash by year end and thus will have raise more money in q3 with its back against the wall on terms that are even uglier meanwhile tesla has the most executive departures and semi departures i ve ever seen from any company a dubious achievement that continued in full force in june with the exit of its much heralded head of production here s the astounding full list of escapees these people aren t leaving because things are going great or even passably at tesla rather they re likely leaving because musk is either an outright crook or the world s biggest jerk to work for or both could the business if not the stock price be saved in its present form if he left nope it s too late even if musk steps down in favor of someone who knows what he s doing emerging competitive factors outlined in great detail below and tesla s balance sheet make the company too late to fix without major financial and operational restructuring in may consumer reports completely eviscerated the safety of tesla s so called autopilot system in fact teslas have far more pro rata i e relative to the number sold deadly incidents than other comparable new luxury cars here s a link to those that have been made public meanwhile consumer report s annual auto reliability survey ranks tesla 27th out of 28 brands and the number of lawsuits of all types against the company continues to escalate there are now well over 600 so here is tesla s competition in cars note these links are regularly updated and in china here s tesla s competition in autonomous driving here s tesla s competition in car batteries here s tesla s competition in charging networks and here s tesla s competition in storage batteries yet despite all that deep pocketed competition perhaps you want to buy shares of tesla because you believe in its management team really so in summary tesla is losing a massive amount of money even before it faces a huge onslaught of competition and things will only get worse once it does while its market cap equals that of ford and is over 70 of gm s despite selling fewer than 300 000 cars a year while ford and gm make billions of dollars selling 6 million and 8 4 million vehicles respectively thus this cash burning musk vanity project is worth vastly less than its over 50 billion enterprise value and thanks to roughly 34 billion in debt purchase and lease obligations may eventually be worth zero elsewhere among our short positions we continue since late 2012 to hold a short position in the japanese yen via the proshares ultrashort yen etf ticker ycs as japan despite having substantially tapered its qe continues to print over 3 of its monetary base per year after quadrupling that base since early 2013 in 2018 the boj bought approximately 67 of jgb issuance and in 2019 it anticipates buying 70 in fact the boj s balance sheet is now larger than the entire japanese economy and it owns nearly 78 of the country s etfs by market value just the interest on japan s debt consumes 8 9 of its 2019 budget despite the fact that it pays a blended rate of less than 1 what happens when japan gets the 2 inflation it s looking for and those rates average say 3 interest on the debt alone would consume nearly 27 of the budget and japan would have to default but on the way to that 3 rate the boj will try to cap those rates by printing increasingly larger amounts of money to buy more of that debt thereby sending the yen into its death spiral when we first entered this position usd jpy was around 79 it s currently in the 107s and long term i think it s headed a lot higher ultimately back to the 250s of the 1980s or perhaps even the 300s of the 70s before a default and reset occur we continue to hold a short position in the vanguard total international bond etf ticker bndx comprised of dollar hedged non us investment grade debt over 80 government with a ridiculously low sec yield of 0 67 at an average effective maturity of 9 6 years as i ve written since putting on this position in july 2016 i believe this etf is a great way to short what may be the biggest asset bubble in history as with eurozone inflation now printing 1 2 annually these are long term bonds with significantly negative real yields in mid december the ecb halted quantitative easing thereby removing the biggest source of support for those bonds bubble prices currently the net borrow cost for bndx provides us with a positive rebate of nearly 2 a year more than covering the yield we pay out and as i see around 5 potential downside to this position vs our basis plus the cost of carry vs at least 20 unlevered upside i think it s a terrific place to sit and wait for the inevitable denouement of this insanity over 12 trillion of negative yielding debt we also have relatively small short positions in netflix nflx due to its egregious valuation within the context of increasing cash burn and competition particularly from disney square sq due to its egregious valuation and a stock dumping ceo who so effusively praises and enables elon musk that i suspect he s equally untrustworthy and indeed in june the company fired its auditor carvana cvna due to a laughable business model with escalating losses and a founder with a sketchy past who s dumping stock steadily and wayfair w an egregiously bad on line furniture business with yet another stock dumping ceo and now for the fund s long positions we continue to own aviat networks inc ticker avnw a designer and manufacturer of point to point microwave systems for telecom companies which in june reported an interesting deal to be the exclusive north american distributor for nec s microwave products in may aviat reported a lousy q3 for fy 2019 with revenue down 13 year over year but guided to a very strong q4 ending june 30th with revenue and income up substantially year over year for all of fy 2019 the company cut guidance to 246 251 million of revenue a 4 million reduction from previous guidance and non gaap ebitda of 11 12 million a 1 million reduction and because of its approximately 330 million of u s nols 10 million of u s tax credit carryforwards 214 million in foreign nols and 2 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards aviat s income will be tax free for many years thus gaap ebitda less capex essentially equals earnings so if the non gaap number will be 11 5 million and we take out 1 7 million in stock comp and 6 million in capex we get 3 8 million in earnings multiplied by say 14 approximately 53 million if we then add in approximately 29 million of expected year end net cash and divide by 5 4 million shares we get an earning based valuation of around 15 share however the real play here is as a buyout candidate aviat s closest pure play competitor ceragon crnt sells at an ev of approximately 0 6x revenue which for avnw based on the low end of 2019 guidance would be 0 6 x 246 million 148 million 29 million net cash 177 million if we value aviat s massive nols at a modest 10 million due to change in control diminution in their value the company would be worth 187 million divided by 5 4 million shares just under 35 share we continue to own westell technologies inc wstl which in may reported a terrible fy 2019 q4 with revenue down 12 5 year over year and a drop in gross margin from 45 5 to 37 6 and negative free cash flow of around 1 4 million about the only good news here is that the company ended the quarter with 25 5 million in cash and no debt and as gleaned from the conference call normalized fcf burn at q4 s revenue level is only around 900 000 westell now sells at an enterprise value of only around 0 1x i e 10 of revenue so on that metric it s clearly dirt cheap but the business needs to stabilize and grow on the conference call management was confident that later this year there should be enough revenue growth to cut quarterly burn to around 500 000 but break even now sounds like more of a next year possibility westell also suffers from a dual share class with voting control held by descendants of the founder however management has often stated that the controlling family is open to merging the two share classes and the company is so cheap on an ev to revenue basis that if management can t start generating meaningful profits it seems primed for a strategic buyer to acquire it an acquisition price of just 0 8x run rate revenue on an ev basis would be around 3 70 share we continue to own the powershares db agriculture etf ticker dba as agricultural products remain the most beaten down sector i can find that isn t a buggy whip something on the way to obsolescence or cyclical from a demand standpoint additionally if a trade deal with china is made the implications for u s ag products would be huge and meanwhile disastrous weather in the farm belt may be an additional near term catalyst thanks and regards mark

news national by bloomberg for president emmerson mnangagwa s government the re introduction of the national currency a decade after its demise is a return to normalcy for most of the country s citizens it s a bitter reminder of years of hyperinflation which destroyed their savings and left them bartering for daily basics remember 2008 when you needed trillions of dollars to buy bread in zimbabwe time goes backwards said edwin mapondera 34 who sells wooden sculptures in one of harare s affluent northern suburbs i m taking any currency people have not listened to this nonsense because now the famous zimbabwe dollar is going to become worthless in no time the reserve bank of zimbabwe said on monday that starting immediately currencies such as the united states dollar and south african rand would no longer be legal tender instead aquasi currency known as bond notes which can t be traded outside the country and their electronic equivalent the rtgs dollar will be termed the zimbabwe dollar by re introducing it the government is taking a risk as more people may be driven into the black market further starving the economy of already insufficient state revenue that could leave the state struggling to pay government workers who account for about 90 of its budget and with little money to shore up creaking infrastructure effects still linger from the last time the zimbabwe dollar crashed and burned transforming one of africa s most developed nations into a place where gasoline and bread were periodically unavailable with almost everyone unemployed while about a quarter of the population emigrated just two blocks from the country s premier meikles hotel what was once a neat and active bus terminus is overrun by hundreds of vendors selling everything from vegetables to spanners the 2008 catastrophe began after then president robert mugabe backed the seizure of white owned commercial farms around the turn of the century the farms new owners failed to produce exports plummeted and the national currency rapidly lost its value then the central bank turned on the printing press in a bid to meet the government s running costs within eight years inflation had reached 500 billion percent and the largest bank note was 100 trillion zimbabwe dollars foreign currencies became legal tender in 2009 that initially stabilised the economy but the strength of the dollar also made zimbabwean manufacturing companies uncompetitive against those of their lower cost south african rivals in november 2017 mugabe was ousted and replaced by emmerson mnangagwa the new president made a pledge that zimbabwe would be open for business but failed to address currency shortages and stagflation the resulting lack of investment and scarce hard currency left people lining up outside banks nor can the government pay for essential imports such as gasoline and wheat in february under the urging of finance minister mthuli ncube the central bank did away with the insistence that bond notes and the rtgs were on par with the us currency and instead created an interbank market despite this week s announcement the rtgs has continued its decline it traded at 13 50 to the dollar on tuesday according to data compiled by bloomberg bringing its fall this quarter to 69 the market was self us dollarising ncube an economist who has lectured at the university of oxford said in a video posted on twitter it was uncontrollable and we felt that we needed to bring the situation under control ordinary zimbabweans have seen at least three rounds of fuel price hikes this year and the cost of other goods such as bread and beer have risen markedly inflation officially at almost 100 is much higher if black market rates are used this is going to cause widespread panic among a highly sensitive consumer base which could provoke social unrest jee a van der linde an analyst at nkc african economics in paarl south africa said in a note to clients the country simply does not have the foreign reserves required to back its own currency moreover there is nothing that stands in the way of the rbz to create more money that sentiment is echoed by zimbabwe s business sector the central bank must exercise restraint and prudence with the printing machine the confederation of zimbabwean retailers president denford mutashu said the chamber of mines of zimbabwe said its members want to know if they will still be paid for their gold in forex they need dearly to pay for essential imports but the government s biggest challenge may be avoiding a repeat of the unrest it saw in january when streets protests led by labour unions erupted after the fuel price was more than doubled overnight at least 17 people died in the ensuing crackdown by security forces this decision destroys whatever little confidence that was left said peter mutasa president of the zimbabwe congress of trade unions as workers we reserve the right to do whatever is right for us and we will decide the way forward on how best we should proceed
writing back ranga mataire most honest zimbabweans living abroad particularly those in western capitals always recount stories of how they have over the years struggled to fit in their new environs from aping some little appropriate mannerism to a suitable accent the struggle is real for full blown adults vainly trying hard to appear and be regarded as someone close to being a native it can surely be emotionally draining to daily encounter curious snaring stares regular questions of where you from and i don t understand what you saying for some living abroad can be a nightmare there is always a danger of people s sense of well being permanently being emasculated to a point of self hate any allusions or reference to what defines them as africans and zimbabweans is despised caribbean author nigel thomas who was born on st vincent island and migrated to canada 18 years ago and is now a professor in united states literature at universite laval in quebec city traces the origins of the self hate culture prevalent in the diaspora to colonialism and slavery when he says africa in the caribbean in which i grew up symbolised savagery the word zulu in my village had the same virulent as cannibal clearly if we despised africa and africans then we hated ourselves just like nigel thomas joan erakit from uganda narrates how she underwent some kind of self exorcism to regain her africaness in a piece published by okayafrica com titled an african in need how i learned to stop the self hate and love my africaness on july 21 2017 erakit recounts her struggle of trying to assimilate in her new community in the united states and how at school she hated everything about herself i hated being an african i hated that my parents had an accent i hated that everyone in minnesota knew that we had come from africa and that in class they would chant coming to america every time i walked by referencing the eddie murphy film erakit says it only needed the coming into her class of a nigerian girl who was unashamedly proud of speaking in her own unique accent who dressed in the manner she so wished who animatedly spoke to her mother in her native language for erakit to realise the beauty of being herself the malady that afflicted erakit and thomas our caribbean brother seems to have embedded itself in our local brothers and sisters in the opposition who are in serious need of exorcism their attitude towards the introduction of the zimbabwean dollar needs a proper dissertation it is hoped that somewhere along the way they need to recover from thinking that anything initiated by a fellow african is not good enough the predisposition is that we are too weak to chart our own way we are too weak to challenge the prevailing dominant narratives about us we have a large chunk of our society being hostage to mental enslavement opinions that differ from those viewed as the paragon of virtue are debased the economic debate aside having our own national currency is part of establishing an authentic national identity a national identity is crucial in cementing a nation state countries have plunged into chaos because of lack of a national rallying badge of identity without unity there is no peace and without peace there cannot be any development the truth is we can t be a nation without national badges of identity this is not hollow nationalistic zeal but something that binds us together beyond ethnic backgrounds symbols like flags languages anthems and coats of arms are national badges of identity all these are crucial in that beyond political differences we feel a sense if affinity towards one another a sense of belonging derived from our shared history and experiences our national identity as a nation is incomplete without our national currency some would want us to live in perpetual psychological misery that everything about us is worthless the late prominent zimbabwean author chenjerai hove once said a national currency is a citizens pride and that it is part of the arithmetic of our lives when we are born and learn to count hove s reasoning was that a national currency carries our national identity and dignity and that a currency crisis is also a crisis of individual and national identity fracturing the national ego with disastrous consequences beyond the aesthetics of national identity and national cohesion very few doubt that it had become prudent for zimbabwe to review the optimum future currency regime given the fact that the multi currency system was posing a number of challenges although it was initially intended that the rand would be the reference currency the us dollar soon became the dominant currency for both accounting records and transactions granted that the multi currency regime brought hyperinflation down helped stabilise the economy and establish the conditions for the restoration of positive economic growth however the multi currency system has always been a temporary arrangement which was supposed to run until around 2012 no one doubts that the multi currency regime has reached its threshold given the challenges that are now being faced by government at operational level some of these challenges include the loss of seigniorage income that a central bank normally derives from its ability to issue currency in a dollarised environment seigniorage gains accrue to the central bank of the currency or currencies that are in use a research paper authored by keith jefferis gibson chigumira and erinah chipumho titled a review of zimbabwe s optimum future currency regime 2013 is arguably one of the best documents to comprehensively analyse the pros and cons of a multi currency regime the document posits that when a country relinquishes the exchange rate as an instrument it loses a mechanism for protecting itself from economic shocks arguably national autonomy over monetary policy is supposed to give a country the maximum freedom and flexibility through the use of various monetary policy instruments such as interest rates and reserve requirements to steer the economy in a particular direction indeed given that monetary policy is a key instrument of macroeconomic management the constraints imposed by the multi currency regime on the country specific objectives maybe viewed as a hindrance to achieving country specific goals i am not an economist but it would crucial for those who are opposed to the introduction of our national currency to appraise themselves with what economists call the lender of last resort facility a multi currency regime inhibits the central back from being the lender of last resort in providing the much needed liquidity to banks in distress and further prevents the reserve bank from responding decisively in times of crisis the time is now for zimbabweans to embrace who they are and stop the negativity we need to work towards dealing with the self hate the introduction of a local currency goes beyond economics it defines who we are as a nation state for feedback contact or
weekly recap major analyst calls looking backwards forwards for 2019 in 10 minutes yozayo thinkstock somehow the second quarter of 2019 has come to an end and the year is now half way over it also appears that the snap back rally after the sell in may and go away pressure abated and generated the best monthly june performance for stocks since 1938 the economy didn t even feel hot in june s numbers at all but then again the market is now hoping for a federal reserve rate cut or two by jerome powell and in the macroeconomic picture presidents trump and xi jinping have just massively dialed down their trade rhetoric by halting new tariffs resuming trade talks and even allowing u s tech companies to sell back into china and to huawei russia and saudi arabia have also reached a deal to cut oil production for six months ahead of the coming opec meeting 24 7 wall st wanted to bring a recap of the week of june 28 2019 via top news that we tracked and by bringing the most recent stock market predictions and analyst calls looking ahead the dow jones industrial average is up 14 and the s p 500 is up 17 3 the tech heavy nasdaq composite was last seen up 20 6 year to date gold is up about 9 this year and 58 per barrel crude oil is still up about 16 after the strong june recovery and despite selling off so much from the 66 or so highs with friday marking the last day of the second quarter whatever benchmarking is done will reflect friday s closing prices for the second quarter performance metrics there were some oddball trading volume spikes on friday with the flurry of stocks being added into or deleted from the annual russell 1000 2000 and 3000 rebalances it creates billions of dollars worth of inflows and outflows each year regardless of the china and oil seeing temporary resolutions economists and investors alike better be braced for some rather lackluster gross domestic product gdp numbers for the second quarter that figure will not be seen for another four weeks but the atlanta fed s gdpnow forecasting tool went down to just 1 5 gdp growth for q2 on june 28 from a prior 1 9 forecast just 2 days earlier and down from 2 1 just a week earlier the new york fed s nowcast has been weaker than the atlanta fed model and it ticked down to just 1 3 gdp growth for q2 on june 28 from 2 2 back in early may we have seen much less robust economic readings in june and there are likely to be more weak retail spending trends for june and we have to consider that consumer spending makes up about 70 of gdp also hurting or coinciding with weaker q2 gdp expectations the overall earnings trend of major companies seems weak with most investors hoping on trade resolutions and a fed powell rate cut at the july fomc meeting before we get into the top news of the week and the analyst calls and forecasting for the second half of 2019 and into 2020 there are some companies holding the dow back handily walgreens boots alliance inc nasdaq wba is the worst performing dow stock with a 20 drop year to date but its earnings is signaling that perhaps a bottom is in the boeing company nyse ba would seem to be the biggest harm on the dow with software issues increasing around the 737 max and going outside of the max program boeing now may get very few deliveries if an at all the rest of 2019 but it s still up over 12 this year 3m co nyse mmm is also a big drag with a 9 drop this year but even this troubled conglomerate has bounced 8 from its lows unitedhealth group inc nyse unh is also a lag with a 2 drop this year due to more concerns about the medicare for all

investors and market pundits have suggested that an outright end of china trade woes could add 15 to 20 per share on the stock even that wouldn t get apple back to its 52 week high of 233 47 and apple still faces some domestic issues here in the usa as its iphone cycle has matured and as it tries to get deeper into services and ecosystem revenues that said here is a very plain and simple reason we

warning gets louder and the reality is that a real recession in the wake of a trade truce probably just got delayed even further still as long as the next downturn isn t a disaster like a decade ago then the 6 yield of at t inc nyse t and the 6 yield of ford motor company nyse f looks safe wells fargo even told its clients this week maybe even the fake accounts to chase that 9 dividend yield from

concerns for the u s and international markets to contend with on top of global growth continuing to remain pressured bond yields are low enough again that it is frightening some investors the treasury s yield of 1 75 on the 2 year note implies that jerome powell and the fomc are at least 2 rate cuts behind the curve with fed funds still in a target of 2 25 to 2 50 and goldman sachs marcus and others have already lowered their own deposit rates ahead of the fed s actions still treasury yields of just 2 00 on the 10 year and 2 52 on the 30 year are concerning those yields are likely to

2020 soc gen also sees fed rate cuts in july and september just being the start with a total of 5 rate cuts of 25 basis points by the end of 2020 that is not encouraging for the domestic and global growth story even if it would be supportive for stock valuations crypto schmipto currencies and bitcoin this may bring out the crypto loving and crypto hating trolls in droves but that s life the

by david robertson stocks have an almost mythical aura about them for many investors conceptually stocks tend to produce higher returns than many other asset classes and therefore feature prominently in many retirement plans practically stocks have provided terrific returns for many through their working years and into retirement the proposition of investing in stocks however has changed over the years in many cases perceptions have not kept up with this reality as a result many investors still consider stocks to be a treasure while others are increasingly seeing them as trash to any analyst who follows publicly traded stocks it is obvious that there are a lot fewer of them around than there used to be a 2018 nber report highlighted the phenomenon there are fewer firms listed on u s exchanges than 40 years ago in 1976 the united states had 4 943 firms listed on exchanges by 2016 it had only 3 627 firms the report reveals that this decline is a fairly recent phenomenon having increased steadily through to the listing peak in 1997 the number of listed stocks has fallen sharply since then as the number of listings dropped every year since 1997 except for 2013 the reasons for the decline are also revealing the single biggest reason has been the high level of merger and acquisition activity in recent years but a slower pace of initial public offerings ipos has also contributed as a result of these coincident phenomena the size of listed firms has grown sharply the whole size distribution of listed firms has shifted so that average market capitalization and median market capitalization accounting for inflation increased by a factor of 10 from 1975 to 2015 not only are public firms much larger than they used to be fewer of them have long roads of growth still ahead of them this matters because stock returns are asymmetric while you can lose all your investment you can only lose the amount of that investment on the other hand it is possible to make many many times the size of an original investment on the upside as a result it is quite possible that one or two big winners in a portfolio can more than compensate for several underperformers for this reason the big winners over time have become legendary for their contributions to outperformance tom braithwaite touched on this in the financial times where he recounted the example of cisco going public in 1990 with less than 100m of revenues it then went on to become the first company to reach 500bn of market capitalization early investors in microsoft apple and amazon had similar experiences just one or two of these stocks could overcome a lot of weak performers in a portfolio recent vintage ipos however are featuring companies that mostly have waited much longer to go public and therefore afford less opportunity for growth for public shareholders braithwaite notes today with the help of a vast influx of sovereign wealth money and mutual funds not wanting to overpay at ipo companies can delay until they are big enough to command the sort of valuation that snap achieved this year 20bn the recent ipo of uber is emblematic of the trend just ahead of its ipo the company reported revenues of 11 27 billion in 2018 a level that amounts to over 110 times as much as cisco had when it went public as the uber example also plainly reveals when firms go public today they are increasingly doing so without any profits to show while the companies that do ipo may be leaders in their field they are still unseasoned and subject to substantial risks the ft reported on a study by jay ritter a business professor at the university of florida which noted in 1980 only 25 per cent of us companies had negative earnings when they came to market last year it was 80 per cent the trend in lack of profitability has also permeated the markets more broadly to be sure it is normal that some group of companies will be unprofitable for various reasons such as cyclical downturns idiosyncratic events or new business launches however the nber report shows that the current prevalence of unprofitable companies is unusually high the fraction of firms with earnings losses in a given year has increased substantially in 1975 13 percent of firms had losses in contrast 37 percent of firms had losses in 2016 all of this has led to a market that is considerably more concentrated than it used to be the nber report continued as a result earnings have become more concentrated in 2015 the top 200 firms by earnings had total earnings exceeding the total earnings of all public firms combined in other words the total earnings of the 3 281 firms that were not in the top 200 firms by earnings were negative the net result is an almost shocking lack of diversity of profits in aggregate the data reveal striking changes in the composition of the market there are a lot fewer public companies to choose from a much higher proportion of them lose money ipos don t provide anywhere near the same type of upside potential and aggregate earnings are massively concentrated in short the economist reports a smaller number of older bigger firms dominate bourses many of the compositional changes also go hand in hand with a weaker competitive landscape the economist highlighted the persistence of unusually high profits as one important signal of trouble high profits across a whole economy can be a sign of sickness they can signal the existence of firms more adept at siphoning off wealth than creating it afresh such as those that exploit monopolies if companies capture more profits than they can spend it can lead to a shortfall of demand rising profits then coupled with an increasing concentration of ownership means the fruits of economic growth are being hoarded there are plenty of other signs of weaker competitive conditions if one cares to look for example one would expect relatively high returns in an uncompetitive economy and lower returns in a very competitive one the data reflect poorly on us businesses we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us though american companies now make a fifth of their profits abroad their naughty secret is that their return on equity is 40 higher at home in addition there are indications that competition has also been stunted by way of laws and regulations the economist notes that business spending on lobbying doubled over the period as incumbents sought to shape regulations in ways that suited them sometimes big firms have simply leveraged their ability to influence and navigate an ever expanding rule book regardless the effect has been to reduce the rate of small company creation in america close to its lowest mark since the 1970s weaker competition gets manifested in other ways too in some industries banking is a case in point rent seeking will result in high pay to an employee elite instead sometimes lower accountability results historically when chief executives have gotten sacked it has been for poor performance more recently however the ft reports that an unusually high 39 percent of departures of chief executives were due to ethical issues a good summary of the trend comes from another nber report after 2000 the evidence suggests inefficient concentration decreasing competition and increasing barriers to entry as leaders become more entrenched and concentration is associated with lower investment higher prices and lower productivity growth the obvious conclusion the economist reports is that the american economy is too cosy for incumbents for all the legendary importance of adam smith s invisible hand of competition the report states that it is oddly idle in america as a result power has shifted from away from shareholders of public companies this suggests something even more important is happening gillian tett at the ft goes so far as to call into question the very purpose of public capital markets in the 20th century it was often assumed that public markets were the epitome of financial capitalism indeed the idea was so deeply ingrained that policymakers and financiers tended to assume that financial evolution went in one direction from private to public but today the trend towards private finance is being driven by pull and push factors on the one hand private equity real estate and debt investments have often offered better returns than public equity in the past decade at the same time the raison d etre for public markets is faltering they used to be seen as a more democratic and inclusive form of capitalism the economist also addresses similar issues mr mauboussin notes that 40 years ago a pension fund could get full exposure to the economy by owning the s p 500 index and betting on a venture capital fund to capture returns from startups now a fund needs to make lots of investments in private firms and in opaque vehicles that generate fees for bankers and advisers as a result according to the ft ordinary americans are being deprived of opportunities to invest early in the next big winners but only wealthy individuals can invest in individual private companies before the ipo in other words the opportunities that used to be shared widely across public markets are now the reserve of the privileged few one can argue that the democratic aspect of public markets is more than just challenged in many ways a mockery is being made of it steve case the founder of aol and ceo of revolution a venture capital company noted in the ft companies used to go public to actually raise operating capital since companies needed scarce capital in order to grow raising that capital normally sent a signal that attractive growth potential existed now however the goal of an ipo is all too often for investors to exit with as high a valuation as possible as such the signal provided by an ipo is almost exactly the opposite now an ipo signals the end of a growth thrust not the beginning of one and it is pawned off on the least discriminating of investors i e public ones these insights facilitate a vastly different narrative for the stock market what was once a reasonably accessible and diversified universe of companies that provided good exposure to a strong economy has now devolved into something considerably less attractive now the universe is comprised of a combination of old companies trying to hive off the greatest possible profits from dying industries and younger companies taking flyers on unproven and unprofitable businesses with shareholder money additionally given that these changes have occurred at the same time as passively managed funds have massively increased their share of the market it is hard to escape the possibility that passive investing has at least exacerbated some of these developments the lack of meaningful pushback by passive shareholders against management teams creates a vacuum of accountability from which many forms of bad behavior can thrive in light of all the changes that have occurred in the stock market over the last few decades it is very fair to say that it is much less attractive than it used to be but it is also possible to speculate further what if public stocks now are the leftovers the dregs that nobody else wants what if public stocks have become the detritus of the investment world to be fair the claim is extreme there are still good public companies out there although many of the stocks are overvalued nonetheless such a consideration has significant implications for investors one is that things change as attractive as stocks may have been forty years ago they represent a different proposition today especially at today s record high valuations as such it does not make sense to treat them as static entities in a portfolio context relatedly the constantly changing market creates an opportunity for active management and a risk for passive management as history shows in abundance stock returns are not magical entitlements some periods are great while others are devastating investors who do not adapt to changing conditions put themselves at great risk finally part of the aura associated with public markets has been due to their strong link with the economy as the nber report states however large firms no longer employ all that many people in america the domestic employee base of the s p 500 is only around a tenth of total american employment as a result the real economic impact of public firms has moderated considerably investors now need to consider a broader set of signals in order to get a good pulse on the overall economy so time flies things change and investors have a choice they can either look backwards and revel in the glory days of stocks or they can adapt to a new reality in which publicly traded stocks are just far less attractive than they used to be things will change again and someday there will be another golden age for stocks for now however it is best to be extremely discriminating
in her first post debate appearance sen elizabeth warren hosted a boisterous town hall in chicago that showcased her detailed policy ideas aimed at reshaping american government as we know it chicago cn in her first post debate appearance sen elizabeth warren hosted a boisterous town hall in chicago that showcased her detailed policy ideas aimed at reshaping american government as we know it packed into the ornate auditorium theatre of roosevelt university in downtown chicago a crowd of 3 600 came to see warren speak at her 102nd town hall on friday evening following her commanding debate performance wednesday night after the policy heavy debate warren opened the night by tying her personal story to her political ambitions aiming to convince supporters that her intense focus on policy is fired her by personal experiences and moral compass she told the crowd a personal story about finding her mother crying while getting dressed to go find a job after her father had a heart attack and could no longer support the family warren said the experience taught her that when the going gets tough you reach down deep you pull it up and you take care of the people you love warren said government should work the same way when i was a girl a full time minimum wage would pay expenses for a family of three warren told the audience today a minimum wage job will not keep a mama and baby out of poverty that is wrong the reason for the difference is who does government work for warren continued when i was a girl the question asked in washington was what does it take for a family of three to get a toehold in the middle class today in washington its where can we set the minimum wage to maximize the profits of giant multinational corporations she paused and added i don t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations i want a government that works for our family throughout the evening warren focused on her campaign themes restructuring the american economy by taxing the wealthy reducing corruption in washington by eliminating lobbying and preserving american democracy by overturning citizens united she spent over an hour talking about the details of her plans on each of these points while acknowledging that the plans all have moving parts that cannot be succinctly explained what i have to offer tonight is like a flight of beers she laughed i know where you re headed after this repeatedly warren returned to the same question whose side is government on arguing that the government we have right now is on the side of money when you see a government that works great for the rich that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out for what it is warren said if there is a decision made in washington i guarantee you it has been touched by money it has been moved and shaped by money she also got in a few digs at the zillionaires and analogized her plan for a wealth tax to a property tax not just on the real estate but on the stock portfolio the diamonds the rembrandt and the yacht by taxing the ultra rich 2 cents on the dollar for every dollar over 50 million warren promised to provide universal childcare for every baby universal pre k for every child raise the wages of childcare and pre school workers provide tuition free community college for everyone who wants to go and cancel student loan debt you re thinking 02 cents is she right about that warren drawled uh yes i ve done the math after making her policy points the senator took three questions at random from the crowd and spent a lot of time thoroughly answering each one the first from a young professed environmentalist asked what are you going to do about single use plastic in response warren committed to stopping the use of single use plastic but she went further how about we don t have a coal lobbyist as head of the epa warren also called for a moratorium on drilling rejoining the paris climate accord and implementing industrial policy that moves towards a clean earth the second question came from a woman born in mexico who is now a u s citizen she asked i d like to hear your plan for immigration and how soon after you are elected will you get those children out of the cages in her most emotional moment of the night warren recounted meeting with mothers in detention centers who had been separated from their children by u s border patrol and were in anguish not knowing where their babies were no great country locks up children she said to huge cheers no great country separates children from their families no great country lets profiteers make money off locking up desperate people all of us need to stand up and say to our government stop this it s wrong the final question addressed foreign policy and asked what will you do to restore the faith in our allies that this administration has done so much to harm first and foremost foreign policy by tweet does not work warren said to laughs she continued in a more serious vein we start by treating the rest of the world with respect warren said we identify real problems we don t try to use military solutions for problems that cannot be solved by the military alone we bring our military home from conflicts around the world warren acknowledged that her vision of america is radically different from the reality in america today but compared her vision to that of activists throughout american history who have worked to fundamentally change american society i wonder what the naysayers said to the abolitionists warren said the naysayers said it s too hard you re never going to change america what do you think the naysayers said to the suffragettes too hard give up now what do you think they said to the early union organizers the foot soldiers in the civil rights movements to the lgbtq activists who wanted equal marriage but they didn t give up they got organized they persisted and they changed the course of american history this is our moment our moment in history our moment to dream big when answering questions afterward from the press warren repeatedly declined to make any comment about other candidates despite pointed questions about joe biden s civil rights record and sen kamala harris s cozy relationship with the finance industry i am living my values every single day in this campaign warren responded i believe the way that democrats will win is by building a grassroots movement and this is what a grassroots movement looks like and with that she returned to a very long line of supporters waiting to take selfies with their preferred candidate

by temple li bernie sanders proposal to erase student tuition debt and provide free college for all has some serious flaws and discriminates against those of you who have struggled over the years to pay back your own college debt will the government be reimbursing you the college debt elimination proposal does not address the responsibility on the part of the student who accrued the debt did the student and their family make realistic decisions when selecting a college did they weigh the cost of the college vs the financial remunerations anticipated from the career or fields they were seeking to enter case in point a young man in new jersey who had graduated at the top 10 of his class elected to attend a two year tuition free community college as part of new jersey s stars program since he was not ready to select a career path he had been offered 20 000 in scholarship money per year to the university of vermont but it would have resulted in substantial student loans another young woman from vermont elected to give up a partial scholarship to ithaca college for a full scholarship to the university of vermont ithaca has a music program which particularly interested her however she realized that she would be pursuing a relatively low paying career as a music teacher so avoided assuming a student loan according to a bloomberg article by laura litvan and shahien nasirpour 6 24 19 widespread struggles are at least in part a consequence of the fact that virtually anyone can borrow from the u s government to pay for college with effectively little check on their ability to repay if students and parents do not exercise discretion in their school choices why then should the 1 6 trillion in student debt be whisked away to be added onto the garbage heap of u s unpaid debt the same article purports more than 1 million americans annually default on a student loan u s department of education data show and about 1 in 9 borrowers are at least 90 days late on their debt the highest delinquency rate among any form of household debt according to the federal reserve bank of new york the education department owns or insures more than 90 of all student debt but with joblessness at near record lows rising wages and a growing national economy experts question why so many americans are unable to pay their student loan bills is it because they are choosing to ignore their debt for the purpose of spending this money on enhancing their lifestyle instead to determine if student debt is a true hardship for those so encumbered these debtors should be encouraged to file for bankruptcy under the brunner test the most common test to get student loans discharged the test requires that the debtor cannot maintain a minimal standard of living based on current income and expenses that this is a sustained situation over most of the life of the repayment period and that the debtor has made a good faith effort to repay the loan currently filing for relief requires an additional petition to the bankruptcy process with modifications to the current requirements perhaps a path through bankruptcy might be the best solution while still holding people accountable but giving them an opportunity to eventually become debt free the second part of sanders proposal free college tuition for all at a cost of 2 2 trillion over ten years simply demonstrates that there is no such thing as a free lunch in this case sanders wants wall street to pay by taxing financial transactions kenneth e bentsen jr chief executive officer of the securities industry and financial markets association said in an online commentary published this month such a tax never raises anywhere close to the revenue promised while wreaking havoc for investors and markets the proposal is dependent on a 2 to 1 federal match with states federal state partnerships are difficult to implement as demonstrated by many conservatives states refusal to participate in medicaid expansion severely impacting obamacare additionally states in recent years have had little appetite for expanding support of higher education according to robert birgeneau professor physics in a berkley blog 2 29 16 referring to the state of california in 2004 the state provided 29 percent of berkeley s budget now it is about 12 percent and shows no sign of improving additionally states responsibility will be exacerbated if all high school graduates elect to go to a free university will there be space to accommodate their influx where will the money for property and facility expansion and maintenance additional human and technical resources come from increasing state taxes the biggest problem among some democrats is that the government will be subsidizing those students and families that can afford to pay for schools of higher learning according to birgeneau in his berkley blog providing free education to all will interfere with the objective of subsidizing low income students through the current practice of return to aid this is a means of redistributing wealth within universities and is prevalent among most public universities in the university of california system those who can afford tuition will spend about 14 000 a year for in state tuition and fees and 38 000 for out of state tuition and fees the return to aid program in california subsidizes low income students educational expenses including food shelter books and computers which birgeneau notes typically make up over half of the total cost of attending college at uc berkeley and uc davis return to aid from international students provides significant financial aid for middle class californians too prof birgeneau expressed his fear that free college for all will be detrimental to the lower income class and end up excluding them from attending college finally there is no accountability for students attending free colleges and universities there is no mention of maintaining a specific gpa or other criteria which must be met college is not for everyone according to statistics presented in a cnbc report by annie nova 6 26 2018 40 of college graduates take positions out of school that don t require a degree and more than 1 in 5 still aren t working a degree demanding job a decade after leaving school when there are so many programs proposals and issues vying for finite dollars is free college for all an effective use of taxpayer dollars whether these dollars come from investors in the stock market blue collar workers or college professors temple li is the news editor for empire state news where she

really well done so professionally done this marks my third visit to japan as president melania and i are we ve just left tokyo a short while ago as you know a very short while ago where we were the first state guests to their majesties the emperor and empress of japan and that was thrilling first time in 202 years that an event like that took place so that was quite exciting and i m thrilled to be back i always like being back in japan we ve had a great relationship we ve never been closer to japan than we are right now over the past two days leaders from the world s largest economies have convened here at osaka which is a tremendous city you fly over and you say does it ever stop it s big it s beautiful it s clean and it s really a the job they do with industrial manufacturing and lots of other things is really incredible we had a very productive conversation with a number of the leaders not only nations but business leaders here in japan and together we put together a lot of ideas and a lot of challenges for the future that we ll be able to meet and get things going very well our meetings also touched on women s economic empowerment you probably saw that ivanka trump was she s done a fantastic job and also a fantastic job in getting jobs for a lot of people within our country almost 10 million people the importance of resilient and secure infrastructure we discussed that at great length the need to uphold the rule of law and the critical importance of achieving a future for international trade that works all of the time for all of the people in addition to the working sessions we had a lot of working sessions many of you were at the working sessions i had tremendous bilateral meetings with many of the heads of state and just some of them are australia japan india germany russia brazil saudi arabia china turkey uk and i met with mexico also with the representatives of mexico who have done an incredible job they ve really stepped up to the plate i appreciate it and i want to thank them they have 6 000 troops at their southern border by guatemala and it s very hard to come in now and they have they just ordered really it was somewhat of a surprise 16 000 troops at our southern border their immigration laws are very strong ours are a disaster ours are a disgrace to our country we have loopholes and asylum that we could fix the asylum very quickly we could get rid of and fix the loopholes but we could get rid of the loopholes and we would have absolutely no problem at the border but if you watch the debates if you call them debates or whatever they were they don t really i think they want open borders i guess even though four years ago they wanted walls to be built i heard we just had another judge rule against us on a section of wall and that s a disgrace we ll appeal it right away ninth circuit as usual they go right into that ninth circuit the good news i put a lot of judges in and a number of them are in the ninth circuit now and it s very unfair it s very unfair when a judge can do what they do where a judge in a certain area can close down a country but we also had a big victory last week with the wall we had a judge in d c who gave us a very big victory so we re building a lot of wall but we had a ruling just yesterday late from a judge in the ninth circuit again so we re immediately appealing it and we think we ll win the appeal there was no reason that that should ve happened and a lot of wall is being built and again mexico is doing a real job our border patrol they ve done incredible work and ice is they re just special people law enforcement generally is just is special so with that i just want to say that these meetings have been great the one that i guess most people are interested in is china we had a great meeting president xi and we ve known each for as long as i m president and many of you were at the event in china a year ago when i ve never seen anything like it the it was beautiful we talked about it we dinner last night president xi and a number of us and it was something really incredible in beijing the red carpet was rolled out for all of us for this country for our country and we had a great meeting and we will be continuing to negotiate and i promised that for at least the time being we re not going to be lifting tariffs on china we won t be adding an additional tremendous amount of we have i guess 350 billion left which could be taxed or it could be tariffed and we re not doing that we re going to work with china on where we left off to see if we can make a deal china is going to start they re going to be consulting with us and they re going to start spending money even during the negotiation to our farmers our great farmers in the midwest i call them the great patriots because that s what they are they re patriots and china is going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product and they re going to start that very soon almost immediately we re going to give them lists of things that we d like them to buy our farmers are going to be a tremendous beneficiary you know if you look at farmers for 15 years before i came into the into this position farms and farmers have had a hard time if you look at that graph it was it was down fairly steeply down and a lot of it was because nafta was a terrible deal and we have i spoke with nancy pelosi last night about the usmca that s mexico and canada and it s now before them and they ll have to make a decision but that s one that the farmers love the manufacturers love the unions love it s a great deal for this country and nafta was i think one of the worst trade deals ever made maybe the wto was worse the wto from the time that happened in 95 from the time that happened china became like a rocket ship it was pretty much flat lined and then all of a sudden they joined the wto and they became they went i mean they went through the roof and very much to our liability it s we lost tremendous amounts of money over the from that time i mean we just lost tremendous amounts it was a terrible deal the wto world trade and if you look at nafta nafta has been a disaster for our country the usmca is a great deal for our country i think canada is happy but they re not happy like we re happy but they re very happy it s a good deal for canada a good deal for mexico they want it mexico just approved it in full canada is waiting for us to approve it i was with the prime minister just left him a little while ago and they re thrilled with the deal and we re thrilled everybody wants it and hopefully it will be a bipartisan deal i view that i told that to nancy pelosi i said view this as a bipartisan deal because a lot of the democrats want it especially i would say the farmers but really the industrial areas also the unions we ve got things on wages and we ve got things on the environment that few people have ever been able to get into an agreement and it s a very big deal it s a very big deal and it s a great deal tremendous support so they have to put it up for a vote and i think you ll get a great vote in the house and you ll get a great vote in the senate and you ll have a tremendous trade deal between the united states and canada and mexico and it s going to be something very special so we spend a lot of time with a lot of countries we do business with a lot of them australia is an example with japan we re negotiating with them because they send us millions of cars and we send them wheat doesn t work but what happens is japan is you probably saw some of the things they re doing but they re opening up many car companies and factories and plants throughout our country especially in michigan we have a lot of activity in ohio beyond japan activity we have a lot of activity now where companies are coming back to our country we re the hot show we re the hottest show in town we re the hottest show in the world right now our economy is the best one thing that every leader virtually every leader that i dealt with said is that congratulations it s incredible what s happened to the american economy we re the best economy in the world and it s something and it started from election day i put it out yesterday because we took a tremendous boost from the day after i got elected the stock market went crazy from that point until essentially now i think we hit in certain of the markets we hit the all time high again for many many times i can t tell you what it was but many many times we broke the record and we re you know our stock market is great our jobs are great we have the best job numbers essentially we ve ever had in some categories definitely we ve ever had the minimum you could say is in 51 years but it s really more than that and now it s going to be more than that african american asian american you saw that hispanic american the best numbers in history the history of our country we have the lowest unemployment numbers best numbers and many others too blue collar workers are doing fantastic they re the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts the blue collar blue collar you know we talk about for the rich it s really for everybody and it s also for big companies where they re moving here and remember who owns the stocks because the people that own the stock it s not the big companies it s the people with 401 k s whose numbers are at 60 percent and 70 percent and 42 percent and all different numbers that are tremendously high where the other spouse thinks that the spouse that s investing in the 401 k is a super genius but those 401 k s are very high and if you listen to what i ve been listening to and we re not going to devote anytime to it but with that kind of an attitude their 401 k s are going to crash and the market would crash because with what they want to do you would crash the market and the amount of wealth that would be lost would be incredible but i d rather wait until later in the campaign to say that because to be honest with you i want them to go and take these policies and bring them up i don t want them to change them anytime soon let them go have a good time but it s been very interesting to watch what s happening actually i found it very interesting so with that we ll take a few questions and then i m heading out to south korea and i may or may not see kim jong un but we ll be heading out to south korea spend about a day and a half there with president moon who is a really good guy he was here too as you know i saw him i met with him also and we ll see what happens please john q mr president thank you so much for joining us here the president yes q we all appreciate it it s always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly can you tell us a little more about how this china deal may work going forward because chinese officials have told fox news that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted they also want relief on huawei they want it taken off the black list they might want you to stop pursuing extradition of meng wanzhou can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding and if you do meet kim jong un at the dmz tomorrow would you step across the border into north korea the president sure i would i would i d feel very comfortable doing that i would have no problem with respect to china basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation which i ended a while back and we re going to continue the negotiation we agreed that i would not be putting tariffs on the 325 billion that i would have the ability to put on if i wanted that where you know we re fairly advanced depending where you want to look at and where you want to start pretty advanced we discussed we did discuss numerous other things we mentioned huawei i said we ll have to save that until the very end we ll have to see one of the things i will allow however is a lot of people are surprised we send and we sell to huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make and i said that that s okay that we will keep selling that product these are american companies john that make product and that s very complex by the way highly scientific and in some cases we re the ones that do it and we re the only ones that do it we re the only ones with the technology what we ve done in silicon valley is incredible actually and nobody has been able to compete with it and i ve agreed and pretty easily i ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so american companies will continue and they were having a problem the companies were not exactly happy that they couldn t sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to huawei so i did do that we talked about education and students somebody was saying it was harder for a chinese students to come in and that s something that if it were it somebody viewed it that way i don t we want to have chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities they ve been great students and tremendous assets but we did discuss it it was brought up as a point and i said that will be just like anybody else just like any other nation and we re actually going to a point where you know we re looking that if you graduate from a college because our great companies we talk about silicon valley and other places we have a problem in this in our country that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country and they say you have to leave we can t keep them and we re going to make it we re going to call it the smart person s waiver but we re going to make it so that they can not only stay but maybe they have access to green cards we want to keep these people here we have to keep yeah go ahead john q but are you concerned that as they did before china took it most of the way down the road and then say the president sure q we re going to pull back inaudible the president that could happen but we re holding on tariffs and they re going to buy farm product so you know so but that could happen john this doesn t mean there s going to be a deal but they would like to make a deal i can tell you that and if we could make a deal it would be a very historic event you know we ve never really had a deal with china we have we ve had tremendous deficits tremendous amounts of money was put into china 500 billion a year and i mean you know not just surplus and deficit i m talking about real hard cash and it should have never ever been allowed to have happened for all of our presidents over the last number of years go ahead please q yes mr president steve herman from the voice of america after your discussions with prime minister abe here are you still thinking about withdrawing from the u s japan security treaty and what did the prime minister say to you about that the president no i m not thinking about that at all i m just saying that it s an unfair agreement and i ve told him that for the last six months i said look if somebody attacks japan we go after them and we are in a battle full force in effect we are locked in a battle and committed to fight for japan if somebody should attack the united states they don t have to do that that s unfair that s the kind of deals we made that s every deal is like that i mean it s almost like we had people that they didn t either care or they were stupid but that s the kind of deals we have that s just typical but i have been i told him i said we re going to have to change it because look nobody is going to attack us i hope but you know should that happen it s far more likely that it could be the other way but should that happen somebody attacks us if we re helping them they re going to have help us and he knows that and he s going to have no problem with that yes please q thank you mr president i actually have a russia question but i wanted to quickly clarify is meng wanzhou s case also going to need to wait until the very end or is it possible the u s would drop the extradition effort the president when what on what q ms meng from huawei the top financial inaudible the president we didn t discuss ms meng we didn t that was not discussed we did discuss huawei but we didn t discuss her situation q okay thank you on russia respectfully it seemed like maybe you didn t really mean it when you said yesterday don t meddle in our elections mr president and then you guys both started laughing the president well i did say it you re to have to take a look at the words i did say it and we had a discussion we had a great actually we had a great discussion president putin and myself i thought it was really a tremendous discussion i think they d like to do trade with the united states and they have great product they have great land they have very rich land and a lot of oil a lot of minerals and the kind of things that we like and i can see trade going out with russia we could do fantastically well we do very little trade with russia which is ridiculous frankly so i could see some very positive things happening yeah but as per your question though i did say it and i did discuss it a little bit after that too yeah please q thank you mr president yesterday former president jimmy carter suggested that your presidency is illegitimate and that you only got the white house with help from russia your reaction to that sir the president russia russia russia isn t it crazy okay jimmy carter look he was a nice man he was a terrible president he s a democrat and it s a typical talking point he s loyal to the democrats and i guess you should be but as everybody now understands i won not because of russia not because of anybody but myself i went out i campaigned better smarter harder than hillary clinton i went to wisconsin i went to michigan the night of the vote i had 32 000 people at 1 o clock in the morning on election day i won michigan i won wisconsin i won pennsylvania i won states that traditionally haven t been won by a republican for many years haven t been won by a republican and this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that i worked harder and much smarter than hillary clinton did now i ll say this jimmy carter i was surprised that he would make a statement i saw it it was not a big thing but i saw the statement and it s you know a lot of democrats like to make that statement he s been trashed within his own party he s been badly trashed i felt badly for him because if you look over the years his party has virtually he s like the forgotten president and i understand why they say that he was not a good president look at what happened with iran that was a disaster what iran did to him they tied him up in knots the reason ronald reagan probably because president so you know it s a democrat talking point yeah please go ahead jim q yes mr president if i could follow up on the question about your comments with vladimir putin the president sure q about russia meddling you did seem to be joking there with the russian president are we taking that to be wrong the president no q and what is it with your coziness with some of these dictators and autocrats at these summits with mohammad bin salman the crown prince of saudi arabia when you were asked about the case of jamal khashoggi you did not respond to that question in front of the saudi crown prince the president i don t know that anybody asked me q were you afraid of offending him on that subject the president no not at all i don t really care about offending people i sort of thought you d know that laughter q well you passed up an opportunity there the president and by the way congratulations i understand your book is it doing well q it s doing very well mr president the president really q i ll get you an autographed copy the president good send it i want to see it q yes sir yeah the president send me a copy no i get along with everybody except you people actually i get along with a lot of people i have a tremendous relationship with president xi nobody else would have the deal that we have we re getting tens of billions of dollars from china coming in a lot of things are happening and despite that we re moving along towards something that could be very historic but i get along with president putin i get along with mohammad from saudi arabia look i spoke to saudi arabia when the oil prices a year ago were getting very high and i wasn t so nice and i said you got to get some more oil into the system because what s happening is no good and they did and the people are driving at you know very low numbers right now you haven t seen in the old days you d have spikes where the gasoline went to 5 and more and it wasn t so good but i also get along with people that would be perceived as being very nice you have a lot of very nice leaders of countries i was with q but mr president isn t the president i was with wait a minute i was with prime minister may today i was with so many you take a look new head of australia look at japan abe prime minister abe is a fine they re all fine as far as i m concerned some are stronger than others some are tougher than others and a lot of people q mr president but if i may though mr president on the case of jamal khashoggi you have a lot of journalists in this room who object to what appears to be the saudi government s complicity and perhaps orchestration of the assassination and dismembering of a journalist the president yeah q and when you were given the opportunity to call mohammad bin salman out on that you did not do it did you do it privately and do you agree that it is despicable for a government to kill a journalist in that fashion the president yes i do i think it s horrible or anybody else by the way q yeah the president but i think it s horrible and if you look and look into saudi arabia and you see what s happening 13 people or so have been prosecuted others are being prosecuted they ve taken it very very seriously and they will continue to and i ve let everybody know i m not i m very unhappy about that whole event but if you look at what s going on and right now within saudi arabia they re prosecuting additional people there s a lot of things happening at the same time i will also say and nobody said nobody so far has pointed directly a finger at the future king of saudi arabia i will say i spoke to his father jim i spoke to his father at great length they ve been a terrific ally they re creating millions of jobs in this country they re ordering equipment not only military equipment but 400 billion worth of and actually even more than that over a period time worth of different things and with that being said i m extremely angry and unhappy about a thing like that taking place but as of this moment more than 13 people are being prosecuted and i hear the number is going to be going up but it s a good question yes please q thank you mr president i m ching yi chan with shanghai media group it s very good to note that you averted the further escalation of trade tension with china and can you share some details of your interaction with president xi this time and also if i may another quick question on north korea do you think it s possible that there will be a third one on one summit with chairman kim the president oh sure q within this year the president oh it might happen tomorrow i mean to be honest we won t call it a summit we ll call it a handshake if it does happen i don t know that it will but it could happen i know i think he d like to do it and i wouldn t mind doing it at all i m going to be i m literally visiting the dmz and so but i will as per your question about president xi he s a brilliant leader he s a brilliant man and you know better than i he s probably considered to be one of the great leaders in 200 years in china and we just have a very he s strong he s tough but he s good we have a very good relationship and i said you know we can t have it where the united states loses this kind of money for the privilege of building up china it has to be a fair deal and he understands that but as he said nobody ever came to us it s true no other president came to him this would ve my presidency could be a lot easier not only for that but for many other reasons it d be a lot easier but i don t want it to be easy it s a point in time i have a chance to do things that nobody else has ever done so we re making a deal with china or we re attempting and if we don t we ll go back into you know we have a tremendous ripe field of tremendous money that would be coming into our country but i have a feeling that over a period of time and again i m not rushed and i told him that i want to get the deal right it s extremely i wouldn t even say complicated but very intricate but in the meantime i think our farmers are going to end up being the great beneficiary and what i did with the farmers because they did lose a certain amount of money i went to sonny perdue who is our secretary of agriculture i said sonny how much money in the best year did china spend on our farms in our farms buying he said the best year about 16 billion i said okay well we re taking in much more than that now every year in tariffs and i took 16 billion out of those tariffs and essentially out of those tariffs and we re distributing it among farmers who have been hurt because they have been used as a pawn so that china could get a good deal but in the end the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary but i ve made up for the fact that china was you know targeting our farmers because they know the farmers like me and i like them i love them and they sort of love me i guess when you get right down to it and it was 16 billion billion that s a lot of money but i took it out the tariff money essentially and we are in the process of distributing it the farmers could not be happier other than they re unusual i had them around a table many of the farmers and about five weeks ago and they said we don t want money we want just a level playing field i said you re right most groups want money they ll take any way you want to give it to them they ll take the farmers are in a class by themselves in so many ways they don t want subsidies they don t want a handout all they want to do is have a level playing field they re unbelievable people and as i said they re unbelievable patriots jon q thank you mr president first a quick follow up you ve made this very public invitation to kim jong un will it be a bad sign if he doesn t show up the president no of course i thought of that because i know if he didn t everybody is going to say oh he was stood up by chairman kim no i understood that it s very hard to he follows my twitter q he does the president and it s very hard q he follows you on twitter the president i guess so because we got a call very quickly laughter a lot of people follow it but you know they ve contacted us and they d like to see if they can do something and we re not talking about for you know extended just a quick hello and we get along i get along with him and i get along with other people like you know for instance on jim s question it s a fair question but i really have great relationships with everybody i think you know i said a long time ago that maybe i ll be a sleeper on foreign policy and if you look at what s happened on foreign policy now we are working on iran and we ll see what happens i think they d like to make a deal i think they d be very smart to want to make a deal but we re going to see what happens i m okay i have all the time in the world they re doing very poorly they were doing they were very brutal when i first came in eighteen sites of confliction meaning where they were behind but i think on foreign policy if you look at what s happening and the other thing that s happening is we re not being taken for suckers anymore i mean we have countries where we d lose on defending them because we defend a tremendous percentage of the world and they don t pay us for it and then on top of it we lose money with that same country on trade and it s all changing and they understand it s changing and they expect it to change they can t believe honestly like i d ask prime minister abe i said how did this happen where you send us billions and billions of dollars worth of cars and other things and we send you practically nothing he said nobody ever complained same thing with china i said you know you send a car to us we charge you essentially nothing it s 2 5 percent but basically you don t have to there are ways around that so you send a car to us and you pay nothing we send a car to you made in the united states and we have to pay 45 percent tariff how did that happen he said we just kept lifting it lifting it lifting it i mean they re being honest with me we just kept lifting it and nobody called but i call i call go ahead jon q and i want to ask you about the debate you clearly saw at least some of the democratic debate the president yeah q i m sure you saw the exchange between joe biden and kamala harris the president i did q on the issue of federal busing federally mandated busing biden thought that was a bad policy he tried to stop it kamala harris said it was an important part of desegregation including in her own experience where do you stand on that issue of federally mandated busing the president well first of all before i get into that i thought that she was given too much credit he didn t do well certainly and maybe the facts weren t necessarily on his side i think she was given too much credit for what she did it wasn t that outstanding and i think probably he was hit harder than he should ve been hit biden i thought he was hit actually harder and as far as that i will tell you in about four weeks because we re coming out with certain policy that s going to be very interesting and very surprising i think to a lot of people jennifer do you have a question q but do you think kamala harris would be a tough opponent for you given what you saw in that debate the president you never know who s going to be tough you never know one that you think is going to be tough turns out to be not much and sometimes you think one and i ve seen it because look i had 17 we had actually a total of 18 a lot of people think 17 governor of virginia remember add the governor of virginia wasn t there long previous governor but of the 18 you know many were all their lives they wanted to be politicians i never thought about being a politician until about two days before i decided to run a little before that but not too much before and they you know you looked at some of them they re very talented you look at their résumés it s like great and sometimes the ones that i thought would be the toughest were not the toughest at all i mean i could write a book i should write a book but some of the people that i did in the republican because we had sort of a similar thing we had 18 instead of i guess they have 24 or 25 but some of the ones that i thought would be absolutely absolutely without question the toughest turned out i didn t they were tough at all others that a lot of people said weren t tough they were tough i think she was given far too much credit for what she did that was so out of the can what she said that thing was right out of a box and i thought that he didn t respond great i wouldn t say it was this was not winston churchill we re dealing with okay but it wasn t it wasn t i don t think nearly as bad as they portended it to be jennifer go ahead q thank you mr president the president thank you q could i clarify your negotiations and what you agreed to with china on huawei the president sure q did you agree that huawei can sell to the u s or that u s companies can sell to huawei the president u s companies can sell their equipment to huawei i m talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it but the u s companies can sell their equipment so we have a lot of the great companies in silicon valley and based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment we re letting them sell to huawei q and then on turkey sir will turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the s 400 purchases the president okay so turkey is an interesting case because there s another one jim that i get along with very well and he s a tough cookie okay right president erdogan he s tough but i get along with him and maybe that s a bad thing but i think it s a really good thing because frankly he wanted to wipe out he has a big problem with the kurds as everyone knows and he had a 65 000 man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the kurds who helped us with isis we took out the caliphate we have 100 percent of the caliphate and i called him and i asked him not to do it they are i guess natural enemies of his or turkey s and he hasn t done it they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the isis caliphate with and i said you can t do that you can t do it and he didn t do it so i have a relationship but let me tell you so he goes out during the obama administration he wants to buy our patriot missile right they wouldn t sell it to him he wants to buy even though he s a member of nato and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the president and he s got a big army and he s you know they re fighters turkey is big fighters and we re working on idlib province together because he doesn t want to see 3 million people killed and neither do i in syria but and i mentioned that that was another thing i mentioned folks to president putin i said please take it easy with idlib because you know they ve been encircling that i think if i didn t put out a statement six months ago that would ve been catastrophic but they have 30 000 terrorists in idlib province you have 3 million people and you know getting terrorists is okay but you don t want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists so anyway so we get along great but what happened with turkey and i will tell you when it s fair and when it s not fair he wanted to buy the patriot missile president obama s group said no he kept wanting to buy it they kept saying no no no couldn t buy it now he needed it for defense he needed it so he then went to russia and he bought the s 400 made a deal to buy it because he couldn t get it they wouldn t allow him to buy it they wouldn t allow it this administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it so he goes out he goes to russia and he makes a deal for the s 400 and let s assume it s not nearly as good but he made a deal he paid them money a lot of money put up a lot of money and he bought it as soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said listen we don t want you to use that system because it s not the nato system et cetera et cetera you know all the reasons we don t want you to use that system do us a favor we ll sell you the patriot he said it s too late i already bought it there was nothing he could do he already bought it in the meantime he bought over a hundred f 35s the greatest fighter jet in the world it s stealth you can t see it it s real hard to beat something when you can t see it but he bought over a hundred i think he bought 116 but he bought over a hundred a lot and there s options for more and now he wants delivery he s paid a tremendous amount of money up front to lockheed our company our jobs everything and now they re saying he s using the s 400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the s 400 system russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the f 35 but honestly i m all for our country but he got treated very unfairly he was told you can t buy it you can t buy it you know it s the old secret when you can t have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were they said first they said we ll sell it to you you can have it in four years then they said we ll get it to you immediately but he said i can t do it i bought i ve spent a fortune on buying another system similar system from russia the problem is he already bought the planes and the planes aren t compatible from our standpoint not from the standpoint of compatibility but from our standpoint national security wise so it s a mess it s a mess and honestly it s not really erdoğan s fault so now we have breaking news donald trump loves turkey he loves turkey donald trump is on the side of turkey instead of the united no i m not q you don t seem like you want to go ahead with the president i love our country but i have to tell you president erdoğan who has done he gave me our pastor back pastor brunson nobody else could get him back remember they couldn t get him back president obama he was in jail for 35 years he was going to be in jail forever pastor brunson he was an innocent man i called him and after a very short period of time pastor brunson was standing in the oval office with me and he was back so you know he s been from my standpoint and he s a tough guy okay when you talk about tough he s tough but i get along with him i think he was unfairly treated where you were told you can t have it and then after he bought another system we said we ll sell it to you we ll give it to you right away but he couldn t use it then but by that time he had already bought the plane so it s a complicated deal we re working on it we ll see what we can do q can i ask you one last quick thing on china the president yes go please q so there was a negotiation on huawei welcoming students holding off on tariffs so it sounds like china has agreed to buy more ag but is this a lopsided agreement or what more did china agree to the president no we agreed on china this is actually a good question i did agree to allow our companies you know jobs i like our companies selling things to other people so i allowed that to happen very complex things not easy this is not things that are easy to make very few companies are able to do it but a tremendous amount of money our companies were very upset you know these companies are great companies you know all of them but they weren t exactly happy with it but we re allowing that because that was a national security we re allowing them to sell but we agreed to leave that until the end huawei is a complicated situation we agreed to leave that we re leaving huawei toward the end we re going to see we ll see where we go with the trade agreement yes please q thank you i have a question about the border but i just wanted to follow up quickly on the question about busing do you see it as a viable way of integrating schools does that relate to the policy that you re going to unveil the president well it has been something that they ve done for a long period of time i mean you know there aren t that many ways you re going to get people to schools so this is something that s been done in some cases it s been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove and you know that s part of it but this has been certainly a thing that s been used over the i think if vice president biden had answered the question somewhat differently it would ve been a lot it would ve been a different result because they really did hit him hard on that one so but it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools q and is it does it relate to the policy that you re going to unveil that you just floated the president it relates to everything we re doing and you ll be hearing about it in over the next couple of months q over the next couple of months okay and i want to ask you about the border it seems like there is officially a week to go until the ice raids begin under that deadline that you imposed the president yeah q given that you have a july 4th recess is it realistic to think that you re going to get a deal to actually reform the asylum laws the president no because we could do it in we could do it you know i say to people i used to say 45 minutes i say 15 but we could do it quickly we could do it in a day we could do it in an hour we could reform asylum very quickly we could get rid of the loopholes very quickly these are horrible loopholes and the reason that mexico is so good because they do have very very tough immigration they don t have the kind of things and the kind of stupidity that we have i mean where somebody touches one foot on our sand and we now have to bring them into a court we then have to register them we then have to catch and release them and they go and they live in our country then they re supposed to come back in three years for a court case and about 2 percent come back as you know i mean you know it just as well as anybody i really think maybe better than most but the fact is they come back but nobody comes back two percent come back it s a horrible system now what we re doing is they come in illegally and we re bringing them out legally but at the request of some you know very good democrats they asked me if i could hold it and i did for a couple of weeks and we have a week left but other than the fact that we did get in a very bipartisan way we got and i appreciate speaker pelosi because she really worked with us it was humanitarian money i mean they didn t have any money and we re running don t forget nobody has ever had this problem before we re running hospitals we re running so many different things for the kids and the kids are brought up because under the laws the kids are used legally used to get other people to come in if you have a child it s much easier to come into our country it s easy anyway but if you have a child it s much easier so we have these kids who have been absolutely abused horribly abused and we could stop that with a minor change in the law it s a terrible thing that they re not doing it so here s what s happening so i said all right let s see if you can give that to us now in the meantime we did we just got it approved last night so we have the 4 5 billion in humanitarian aid right and that s good so we have that but we can have that number go way down if we stop people from coming up for instance if we had walls up and if we had it hard the father and the beautiful daughter who drowned and you know the rio grande is a very tough you know that has moments where it can be very calm and then all of a sudden it becomes totally violent and people get swept away but if they thought it was hard to get in they wouldn t be coming up they wouldn t be coming up and so many lives would be saved so essentially if they would change the laws and i said it would take us an hour but let s give you two weeks at the end of the second week we ll be removing people legally removing in other words q so you re still planning for that deadline that deadline is still in place which is now a week from now the president oh yeah unless we do something pretty miraculous but the democrats it seems to me they want to have open borders and for the life of me i cannot figure that out it s one thing because i want people to come into our country we need them because we have all these companies coming in you know we have foxconn in wisconsin we have so many companies coming in auto companies just today i was with president abe he told me another auto company is going to build a big plant they need people so i m all for that the only problem is that they have to come in through a process they have to come in legally it s also very unfair you have millions of people on line for years trying to get into a country they take tests they study they know a lot about our country they read they do they have to go through a very complicated process and these people have worked hard they ve been on line for seven eight nine years and then somebody walks in and they re you know welcome to the united states it s really honestly it s very unfair but yeah we will be removing large numbers of people people have to understand yes the laws are q in a week the president yeah starting in a week after you know sometime after july 4th q so the deal that was just passed does nothing to make you want to step back from that raid the president well that s different that s humanitarian no that s a different that s humanitarian we needed that just to take care because we re running now hospitals i mean the border patrol these are incredible people they re doing what they you know nobody ever thought they were going to be doing this and people are coming up the reason people are coming up is because we re doing so well as a country in past years we weren t doing well in past years mexico was doing better you know they took 32 percent of our car business they were doing better than we were doing in the past now we re the hot country in the world and people are coming up because they want a piece of that action and the other reason children are coming up is because we had a separation policy okay under president obama we had separation president obama built those cells they were in 2014 they were built they all said oh look how horrible then it turned out that it was built by president obama and i m not blaming anybody i m not blaming him i just say this they had a separation policy right i ended it but when i ended it i put out a statement i think it s going to bring more children up because you re ending it you re saying now the child can stay with the parent so i said ending it is nice in one way but in terms of what we re doing it makes it even tougher but the really bad thing is the cartels and i really think that mexico because you know they did 6 000 now they re doing 16 000 on our border i think that mexico is looking to swamp the cartels and those kind of numbers will do it it would be a great thing what mexico is doing for us is great by the way without the tariffs they wouldn t have done it for us we ve been after we ve been after them for many years to do it but they have really so far it s only a week the numbers are way down and so far a lot of good things have happened yes sir please yes please in the second row q thank you mr president two questions about iran the president would you like me to leave now or here s the thing i can stay we can do this for a long time my only problem is this i don t need stories he stayed up there too long if i stay up there quickly they say why did he not give us more time if i stay up for two hours they ll say he stayed up too long i mean if you promise you re not going to say i say because everybody has got a hand up and if you want i ll go on should i go on or should i not go on what you do you think q go on q at least one more the president okay and you re not going to say he went on too long q at least one more the president because we have time you know i have a flight that actually leaves pretty much when i want it to laughter okay let s go q thank you mr president two questions about iran a week ago you called off a strike because you were concerned it would kill iranians the president disproportionately absolutely q disproportionately did the military leaders provide you with any alternative you know some derelict oil rig that could have been hit to the president no no no q to make a point the president oh i had many alt oh yeah i have i ll bet i have 50 alternatives i have many alternatives yeah i mean you know what you don t know what the sites were you said oil rig you don t know what the sites were but i had many alternatives no no military leaders did a great job when we chose and designated certain areas that we were thinking about i said how many people are going to die i mean i m talking about on the other side that means a lot to me too okay how many people are going to die they said probably about 150 you don t know could be much worse than that could be less too i guess but it could be much more than that because this is heavy stuff going in and we would have been 100 percent we have the greatest military in the world i deal with them all the time these people are incredible people lethal and hopefully we don t have to use it much i mean we ve spent if you look at the numbers 716 billion this year we had planes that were so old that we didn t now we have brand new f 35s we have brand new super hornets and f 18s and i mean the equipment we have is incredible the army now has beautiful new things everything is we have a military that s really great hopefully we don t have to use it very much but no they came in and they said this and i asked them a question and they came back a short time later and they said about 150 people i said that s really disproportionate i don t like it q my second question is that here at the g20 summit what can you tell us has the ball been moved in any particular direction towards easing the tensions with iran in some of the meetings that you ve had the president well i have had a lot of countries come up to me france has come up if you look at president macron good guy he came up to me he said you know i do a lot of business meaning france does a lot of business with iran i would love to go see them it s all right anybody can see them i don t mind talking i think talking is great i m not going to say oh don t talk to them don t talk to them i do think john kerry should not have been talking to them i think that s delaying this process a lot i think he violated the logan act actually but i think john kerry speaking to iran a lot maybe saying things like gee you know if you wait another 15 months maybe trump will lose the election and then you can deal with a person that s a lot easier than trump you ll deal with a stiff that will give you everything you want and that makes it a little tougher for me to make a deal but that s okay yeah please go q mr president during the week you tweeted out your displeasure with the supreme court s decision on census and you suggested you may seek to delay the president yeah i think it s very unfortunate q are you in fact going to try to delay the census the president well we re looking at that legally because they re asking us to do a census and you know the census it was shocking to me i figured it would be you know not expensive to do a census it s billions of dollars you know that right billions billions they go knock on doors of every house in the country and they get everything they re not allowed to ask whether or not somebody is a citizen of the united states how horrible and ridiculous is that so we are looking at that yeah sure q do you know if you have the legal authority to do that the president because it wasn t a real decision that boom this is the way it is it was like now right now it depends on it depends on what happens i guess it was a very strange decision it was a very very sad decision not in terms of voting not in terms of just a very sad because it was so convoluted it was to get to that decision had to be very very hard q well justices said that your guys were playing politics when deciding not to count non citizens the president hey who s really playing politics okay check it out you tell me who s playing politics yeah go ahead please q thanks mr president i think i heard you mention earlier the president you re q geoff earle with daily mail it s been a while i think i heard you mention that with vladimir putin you had said you spoke about election interference privately as well did you give did you speak to him in a sterner tone did you tell him there the president no i just q would be serious consequences the president we talked about it hey we talked about it you know we ve talked about it before you know he denies it totally by the way just to i mean how many times can you get somebody to deny something but he has in the past denied it he s denied it also publicly but we talked about it we talked about a lot of other things i tell you we talked about something that i think is very important and that s putting a cap on what he s buying and we re buying from a nuclear standpoint and other arms control we talked a lot about arms control and i think he d like to see arms control and so would we i think it makes a lot of sense q what was the context in which you the president yeah go ahead q did you raise what was in the mueller report did you sort of articulate to him the president oh the mueller report was a very q that you thought that things inaudible the president good report i mean it was a good report i had 18 people that hated me i had mueller who was totally conflicted and obviously didn t like me we had he was totally conflicted and yet no obstruction no collusion and you know that was good report yes please q thank you mr president the president and you know the democrats want a do over or five they want to get it right they re working to get it right they want a do over or five yes please q edward szall with trunews president trump your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the deal of the century my question to you is why were no palestinians members of the white house peace plan committee the president well they are a very important part of it but they don t really have to be we re just getting started we have and as you know we have a very good david friedman a great gentleman one of the most successful lawyers in new york who loves israel david friedman jason greenblatt who worked for me and my company great great lawyer great talent jared kushner and with me being president if you don t get that deal done it will never happen we ll have to see what happens but i think the palestinians basically i m not sure i know they want to make a deal but they want to be a little bit cute and that s okay i fully understand where they re coming from as you know i ve ended the money to that was we were paying them 550 million a year and i ended that money because a year ago i heard they were saying nasty things i said wait a minute we re trying to make a deal we re trying to help them and they re saying these nasty things we re not going to pay now if a deal is made we would go back on a humanitarian basis not so different from the border because you see the problems and what s going on it s terrible but i think we have a very good chance of making a deal and a lot of people think that s probably the toughest deal of all and it may very well be the toughest deal of all a lot of people think it can t be made i mean over the years a lot of people would say that s a deal that can t be made no matter what but you know hey i like to we re going to try but i really believe that i went to other negotiators from past years for many many years they ve been trying to make this deal and i said did you ever take the money away because they were always very hostile and they said no we wouldn t do that that s inappropriate why is it inappropriate i mean they re saying bad things why is it inappropriate and what i ve done is said look as long if you re not negotiating and if you don t want to make peace we re not going to pay you so let s see what happens i think they want to make a deal and i ve had a very good relationship with some of their leaders and obviously i ve had a good relationship with israel now the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with bibi netanyahu s election they thought he won and then all of a sudden they couldn t put together the coalition and now they re back to campaigning again so that was something that came up that who would have expected that maybe something will happen faster but you know that s going to be going on for about three months there s a good chance we could there s a chance i don t want to even say good chance on that one because people say it s the hardest deal i ve heard when i was young i d say what do you think of this they d say oh that s tougher than israel and the palestinians making a deal they used to use that as like the metaphor they used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make so it s probably about the toughest deal to make i actually think that there s a good chance yes sir please go ahead yeah white shirt no the gentleman behind you yeah okay go ahead we ll get to you q thank you the president go ahead that s the man i m looking at q demetri sevastopulo financial times can i just ask first one clarification the president sure q are you saying you re taking huawei off the commerce department entity list the president no not at all no no we re going to be talking about huawei but we are going to be supplying equipment from our companies our companies make billions and billions of dollars worth of equipment but we are not discussing huawei with president xi yet i want to see before we start getting into that i want to see where we end up we have to we have a national security problem which to me is paramount very important q but are you taking huawei off the commerce department entity list the president we re talking about that we have a meeting on that tomorrow or tuesday q and my question is you talk a lot about the economic and the trade practices of china and you re very critical you don t talk so much about the national security concerns about china the president well that s not q what do you worry about china inaudible the president it goes without i think that goes without saying i mean look what i ve done look what who s done what i ve done i took zte off if you remember i was the one i did that that was a personal deal and then president xi called me and he asked me for a personal favor which i considered to be very important he s a leader of a major country and it was very important to him having to do with where the employees are located and his relationship to that area and it was 85 000 employees and they were almost out of business and he agreed to pay 1 2 billion penalty and some other things including a board change and including some management changes et cetera zte which is a you know much smaller than huawei but it s very big and they paid us a billion two 1 2 billion i mean part of the problem is then the democrats go out and say if i got 200 trillion they d say this was terrible what a terrible deal because that s the way politics is it s sort of sad but you know we got 1 2 billion and we closed it we opened it and we had certain changes made as you know they made changes to the board they changed the board they made management changes and they paid a lot of money and they also have to buy american product buying american product is very important to me it s a big it s a big thing q can i just ask you to clarify the president yeah go ahead blue blue shirt q stefan niemann with ard the president are we going to continue onward q yeah the president yes q yes the president does anybody say no huh q thank you stefan niemann with ard german television one question the president we just left angela q i know the president she s another friend of mine people don t think so q and you called her a fantastic woman the president we have a great relationship i hope you know that q yes we will not forget that the president we spent a lot of time together too q you praised this g20 summit as extremely successful yet it was a g19 against one summit if we look at climate change why is it that you still think ignoring the dangers of climate change is in the interest of the american inaudible the president i don t ignore it so we have the best numbers that we ve ever had recently and i m not looking to put our companies out of business i m not looking to create a standard that is so high that we re going to lose 20 25 percent of our production i m not willing to do that we have the cleanest water we ve ever had we have the cleanest air you saw the reports come out recently we have the cleanest air we ve ever had but i m not willing to sacrifice the tremendous power of what we ve built up over a long period of time and what i ve enhanced and revived i m not i m just not willing to do that and they understand where i stand and you know i m not necessarily sure i agree i can tell you i m not sure that i agree with certain countries what they re doing because i think they re losing a lot of the power of what they can do with factories and with and i m not talking about political power although that comes with it i m talking about the powering of a plant it doesn t always work with a windmill when the wind goes off the plant isn t working it doesn t always work with solar because solar is just not strong enough and a lot of them want to go to wind which has caused a lot of problems and you know the problem with wind is in the united states we re subsidizing these wind towers all over the place because wind doesn t work for the most part doesn t work without subsidy and i don t want to be subsidizing things that don t have to be subsidized the united states is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind i don t like it i don t like it i don t want to do that we ll take a few more go ahead go ahead q thank you sir two questions on iran please the president one q one question on iran laughter okay well iran the president pick the better one please q will do sir iran says that it will be on the verge of violating the threshold for uranium enrichment in the jcpoa as soon as potentially next week what will be your response when that happens the president you ll see q okay can i have a follow up the president that s all i can do that s all i can do no but that s all i can do q just the president i can only say you ll see we cannot let iran have a nuclear weapon just can t do it please q thank you mr president celia mendoza from voa latin america you met yesterday with president putin and in the readout it says that you touched the subject of venezuela the president yeah q but can you expand a little bit of what was said during the meeting about venezuela and also the president well first of all we re following venezuela very closely it s a catastrophe it s what socialism can do i use it all the time i mean it s what socialism can do it was one of the richest countries 20 years ago it s got among the largest oil reserves in the world and they don t have food they don t have water it s really actually incredible i discuss it with i ve discussed it with almost every leader this weekend we discuss venezuela because we don t ever want that to happen to us or their countries okay go ahead q you mentioned that change of regime takes time and then in venezuela it has proven the president oh sure it takes time q but do you think that it s a possibility the president the problem is so many people leaving venezuela it s like going to be a ghost town it s a very bad thing that s happening in venezuela nobody has seen anything quite like it actually especially from the standpoint that they were so wealthy they ve gone i know so many people from venezuela living in miami they re incredible people they re incredible incredible a lot of them live in doral miami it s they call it little venezuela i know them so well these are people that are hard workers warm they re just incredible and to see what s happening to venezuela is heartbreaking it s really heartbreaking q mr president do you think that it is a time for change the strategy and do you still believe that juan guaidó is the person to lead the country you have backed him up the president sure you have a lot of strategies i have five different strategies i could change any moment but in the meantime we re helping them from the standpoint of aid we re getting as much aid as we can i think they re making a big mistake because they re not making the aid very easy as you know you know they re not making it easy to get to people but people are starving to death and their water they have no water they have no water they have oil but they don t have any water no we have a lot of things in store if we have to do that we don t want to do anything but you know we don t want to get involved to the extent that you may be thinking but we have a lot of alternatives we have five different alternatives for venezuela and we ll see what happens it s doing very poorly and maduro is doing very poorly obviously it s not it s just not working just not working yes ma am go ahead q anita kumar with politico i just wanted to the president so from where are you q politico anita kumar politico i just wanted to follow up on the questions that were asked jim asked about the president question question question q question about the crown prince that you met with earlier today i didn t hear you answer the question did you raise the killing of jamal khashoggi with him the president i asked yes q and what was the response the president i asked him what was happening and he was telling me that i think he said 13 but could be more and i think he said more are in the works that there are large numbers of people being prosecuted he s very angry about it he s very unhappy about it and i did mention it to him very strongly and he answered very strongly but they re prosecuting large numbers of people that was a bad event okay q and sir the president yeah go ahead please q can i just follow up you mentioned you mentioned that the intelligence community you mentioned that no one had pointed the finger at him but actually the cia did the intelligence community the president i cannot comment on intelligence community i just i m not probably i guess i m allowed to do what i want to do in terms of that right we can declassify unlike hillary clinton she decided to just give it out we can declassify the truth is that i just don t want to talk about intelligence but i will say this a lot of people are being prosecuted and they re taking it very seriously over there and they ve done a great job in saudi arabia from the standpoint of women and from a lot of different things are happening in saudi arabia one of the other things very important with saudi arabia that not only are they an ally not only have they spent tremendous amounts of money coming into our country and they have been a good ally and they have actually bought tremendous amounts of military equipment that we use and that we re able to use but they re also very much now changed their ways as to financing terror which i can t say for a lot of other countries if you look at iran if you look at other countries in that area they re financing terror now it s harder for iran because iran doesn t have the money they used to have and they were given 150 billion they were given 1 8 billion in cash but saudi arabia has come a long way i ll tell you in terms of reform saudi arabia really has come a long way yeah please in the gold yeah you right q thank you very much mr president i m inaudible with china s inaudible media business news organization in china just a little bit of follow up on huawei you say you re going to discuss huawei s entity listing soon is it possible would you say it s a possibility that huawei is going to be removed from the list the president is it going to what q removed from the entity list is it possible the president i don t want to talk about it now i mean we re looking at that very carefully huawei is very much in play in terms of our country and in terms of intelligence and the intelligence community we know a lot about huawei but i don t want to mention that right now i just think it s inappropriate i will say that we re not making it other than what i told you already we re not making it a big subject we re going to save that for later q okay and another question on the big picture of u s china relations what do you think the u s and china should see each other are we strategic partners are we competitors are we enemies what are we the president no i think we re going to be strategic partners i think we can help each other i think in the end we can if the right deal is structured we can be great for each other if china would open up you re opening up a tremendous you know the largest market in the world and right now china is not open to the united states but we re open to china that should have never really been allowed to happen okay yes please q thank you mr president on russia are you planning to go to moscow next spring as president putin invited you the president yes q and do you agree with him that western style liberalism as has been defined over the post war period is now obsolete and no longer relevant to today s world the president well i haven t heard him say that but he did invite me to russia for the defeat of nazis that s a big thing defeat of nazis you know russia lost he said 25 million people i had actually heard 50 million people but he said yesterday that russia fighting the nazis they lost 25 million people you would know better than anybody peter but it was a tremendous you know they suffered greatly and they re having a 75th you could really say celebration of the defeat of the nazis and he invited me and i said i would give it very serious consideration that was a russia went through a lot they lost i guess far more than anybody fighting the nazis in terms of people and he did invite me and i said we would get back but we will give that very serious consideration okay thank you peter q his comments to the financial times right before arriving here was that western style liberalism is obsolete i know you probably haven t read the interview do you think that s true the president well again he may feel that way i mean he sees what s going on and i guess if you look at what s happening in los angeles where it s so sad to look and what s happening in san francisco and a couple of other cities which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people i don t know what they re thinking but he does see things that are happening in the united states that would would probably preclude him from saying how wonderful it is at the same time he congratulated me as every other every other leader of every country did for what we ve done economically because we probably have the strongest economy we ve ever had and that s a real positive but i m very embarrassed by what i see in some of our cities where the politicians are either afraid to do something about it or they think it s votes or i don t know what peter i don t know what they re thinking but when you look at los angeles when you look at san francisco when you look at some of the other cities and not a lot not a lot but you don t want it to spread and at a certain point i think the federal government maybe has to get involved we can t let that continue to happen to our cities ladies and gentlemen thank you very much i ll see some of you in south korea maybe at the dmz but this has been an honor thank you all very much thank you applause source link
a u s flag flies outside the new york stock exchange in november wall street ended a wobbly week with broad gains friday closing the books on june with its biggest monthly gain since january june marked a sharp about face from may when traders fled to safer holdings because of increased anxiety over the u s china trade war and signs of slowing global economic growth advertisement despite lingering worries over trade investors pushed stocks higher much of this month after the federal reserve raised expectations that it is prepared to cut interest rates if needed to keep the economy growing that drove the benchmark standard poor s 500 index to an all time high last week though it has retreated slightly from that mark even after the roller coaster quarter investors are in good shape so far this year the s p 500 is up 17 3 and the technology heavy nasdaq has gained 20 7 it hasn t been maybe as healthy a rally as we saw in the first said brian nick chief investment strategist at nuveen when you look back 10 years from now it s not going to look like the sort of volatile period where we had this good april terrible may and good june it s just going to look like a quarter where you know you made money in stocks you made money in bonds advertisement on friday the s p 500 rose 16 84 points or 0 6 to 2 941 76 the index ended the month with a 6 9 gain the dow jones industrial average rose 73 38 points or 0 3 to 26 599 96 the nasdaq composite rose 38 49 points or 0 5 to 8 006 24 smaller company stocks were big gainers for the second straight day the russell 2000 index climbed 20 02 points or 1 3 to 1 566 57 advertisement every major index finished the week with a loss but ended june with solid gains bond prices were little changed friday the yield on the 10 year treasury note held at 2 the market ended june with a two day winning streak a wave of selling swept over the market earlier in the week as traders shifted money to less risky holdings such as u s government bonds while remaining cautiously optimistic about this weekend s meeting between president trump and china s president xi jinping investors are hoping the talks put the world s two biggest economies on track to resolve their trade war investors need to recognize that the trade situation is unlikely to improve said kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco the best we can hope for is an agreement to continue talks banks led the way higher friday after the federal reserve late thursday approved plans by the country s 18 biggest banks to return more money to shareholders the approvals were part of the fed s annual checkup of the banking system jpmorgan chase shares rose 2 7 bank of america climbed 2 8 advertisement industrial and energy stocks also notched strong gains union pacific rose 1 9 oil companies including chevron and exxon gained ground constellation brands climbed 4 6 after the wine and beer company raised its profit forecast for the year after a blowout fiscal first quarter financial report constellation recently sold some of its lower end wines as it focuses more on its premium wine options and its beer sales secondhand fashion online retailer realreal jumped on its first day of trading the company which offers a marketplace for discounted gucci and other luxury goods surged 44 5 after its initial public offering hit the market at 20 per share advertisement benchmark crude oil fell 96 cents to settle at 58 47 a barrel brent crude the international standard held steady at 66 55 a barrel wholesale gasoline fell 3 cents to 1 92 a gallon heating oil fell 2 cents to 1 93 a gallon natural gas fell 1 cent to 2 31 per 1 000 cubic feet gold rose 1 30 to 1 409 70 an ounce silver rose 5 cents to 15 25 an ounce copper stayed at 2 71 a pound the dollar rose to 107 78 yen from 107 76 yen the euro rose to 1 1378 from 1 1373
move fast and bank things thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe what is libra it s an excellent book by don delillo the american master published in 1988 it is a fictional account of the life of lee harvey oswald president john f kennedy s eventual assassin it s better than white noise but not as good as underworld liz fine it s facebook s new cryptocurrency the point is that you can send money all over the world with lower fees than if you were to engage say western union it s shady as hell though you remember tyler and cameron winklevoss the twins from whom mark zuckerberg ripped the initial idea for facebook yeah so they have a cryptocurrency exchange called gemini as any astrology buff will tell you both libra and gemini are air signs and geminis are stereotypically scarier than libras gemini is the sign of twins and is associated with two faced ness plus it s a mutable air sign which makes it somewhat unstable libra as a cardinal sign is somewhat more stable libra sees both sides gemini tries to be both sides on the other hand astrology is made up on some theoretical third hand so is money what i m trying to say here is that zuckerberg seems to love crushing the dreams of these handsome men so who can say how this will turn out anyway the name seems kind of bitchy is libra a cryptocurrency it s fair enough to say this uses cryptocurrency technology this is kind of a contentious question relative to the us dollar the euro or the yen it s decidedly a cryptocurrency because there s no central bank there s also a public ledger although only some people are allowed to mine the coin so i chatted with some experts to find out whether libra is a cryptocurrency it s fair enough to say this uses cryptocurrency technology says matthew green an associate professor of computer science at johns hopkins university facebook contacted green a few weeks ago and asked him if he d look at its white paper as an outside reviewer this was unpaid work green would have had to sign a nondisclosure agreement to perform he declined it s more restricted in the way the blockchain works but even that s not totally unprecedented compared to the og cryptocurrency bitcoin well it looks less like a cryptocurrency for instance bitcoin is a permissionless system you participate through proof of work by competing to solve a puzzle that lets you add a block to its chain what that means essentially is that anyone can participate this is one of the most significant ideas behind satoshi nakamoto s 2008 paper bitcoin requires consensus not trust i actually agree with the folks who ve been saying that this actually isn t really a cryptocurrency at all libra by contrast is permissioned meaning only a few trusted entities can keep track of the ledger that makes it more like a digital currency rather than a cryptocurrency says lana swartz an assistant professor of media studies at the university of virginia who s studied the bitcoin community extensively i actually agree with the folks who ve been saying that this actually isn t really a cryptocurrency at all swartz says on the other hand libra is assigned to pseudonymous wallets and transfers are done through public key operations says nicholas weaver a researcher at the international computer science institute and a lecturer in the computer science department at the university of california berkeley so yes he told me it is a cryptocurrency weaver also notes that the permissioned model means less computing power is needed bitcoin wastes a lot of energy preventing so called sybil attacks in which an attacker fills the network with computers the attacker controls and wreaks havoc the only conclusion i have come to is that there is no stable definition of cryptocurrency so i am going to just call libra a cryptocurrency for the sake of ease and keep it moving if you d like to put an asterisk on that i can t blame you why is decentralized currency exciting to some people well theoretically removing the central bank from the equation democratizes currency in practice that s not exactly how it works out bloomberg s matt levine has explained this very succinctly so i m just going to paraphrase him it s true that the internet is in some ways decentralized since it s not controlled by the government or a specific corporation but the result is that certain massive tech companies run most of the infrastructure internet search is google email is gmail cloud computing that powers most websites is amazon the democratizing effect of the internet s openness and decentralization is counteracted by its vast economies of scale and network effects which tend to concentrate power in a few big winners levine writes and facebook wants to be cryptocurrency s big winner i ve heard libra is a stablecoin what is that and how does it figure into this libra is a stablecoin kind of unfortunately much like cryptocurrency this is something of a semantic gray area basically any cryptocurrency pegged to either a fiat currency say the us dollar or some kind of government backed security like a bond counts as a stablecoin the idea is that there s more stability hence the name and less volatility than in something like bitcoin which isn t pegged to anything bitcoin is exactly as valuable as people believe bitcoin is which makes it very very volatile the goal is for libra to be more useful than any national currency accepted in more places and with fewer complications pegging it to a single national currency would only hold it back unlike most stablecoins though libra isn t pegged to one specific currency libra is pegged to a group of of low volatility assets including bank deposits and government securities in multiple currencies while there is a libra reserve libra doesn t seem like it s necessarily pegged to its value rather the reserve functions as a kind of lower bound on libra s value that means that there s just one libra no matter where you live levine is great here too so i am going to paraphrase him again if libra does catch on it s likely to displace currencies like the dollar that s because if you spend mostly libra perhaps because you buy most things online you ll only convert your libras into dollars for when you need to spend irl money and the dollar will begin to seem annoying to you since it keeps moving up and down relative to the libra the goal is for libra to be more useful than any national currency accepted in more places and with fewer complications pegging it to a single national currency would only hold it back levine writes what else do i need to know about the reserve again if you think about the classic cryptocurrency bitcoin its monetary policy is pretty sparse there s a finite number of bitcoins that can ever exist and the number of bitcoins that are released by mining decreases over time that is bitcoin s entire monetary policy that s it by contrast the governing members of libra will be setting some kind of policy by picking the basket of investments used for the reserve they have said the association does not set monetary policy it mints and burns coins only in response to demand from authorized resellers but tyler cowen helpfully points out that there s some debate about what monetary policy is under normal circumstances like with a bank deposit you d get to keep the interest but with libra that s not the case the reserve will come initially from facebook and its partners but later if you buy libra libras this also seems semantically unclear to me for cash your cash will be part of the reserve that reserve is then invested in low risk assets that will yield interest over time there s a different hitch here though under normal circumstances like with a bank deposit you d get to keep the interest but with libra that s not the case don t take my word for it this is from libra itself the revenue from this interest will first go to support the operating expenses of the association to fund investments in the growth and development of the ecosystem grants to nonprofit and multilateral organizations engineering research etc once that is covered part of the remaining returns will go to pay dividends to early investors in the libra investment token for their initial contributions so any interest from libra will go primarily to libra and then to early libra investors like facebook isn t that fun it s also how venmo and paypal make money any cash that s held in those systems is cash they get to keep the interest on per their user agreements don t cryptocurrencies typically run on a blockchain does libra let s start by uh defining blockchain just kidding you can t if you look through the white papers you ll notice this like capitalization thing libra blockchain in these papers always takes a capital and while i love capitalizing things for no reason my editors consistently remind me that it makes my copy harder to read and the joke is usually only funny to me now it s possible the itty bitty blockchain committee shares my amazingly sophisticated sense of humor but what seems more likely is that some sleight of hand is going on for instance check out this paragraph from the white paper in order to securely store transactions data on the libra blockchain is protected by merkle trees a data structure used by other blockchains that enables the detection of any changes to existing data unlike previous blockchains which view the blockchain as a collection of blocks of transactions the libra blockchain is a single data structure that records the history of transactions and states over time this implementation simplifies the work of applications accessing the blockchain allowing them to read any data from any point in time and verify the integrity of that data using a unified framework libra blockchain takes capital letters but the regular blockchain doesn t isn t that interesting what s even more interesting is the sentence that starts unlike previous blockchains if the libra blockchain isn t using blocks for transactions is it even a blockchain whatever it is it doesn t work according to this bloomberg piece at least not yet but what it does seem like from these materials is that actually libra isn t very decentralized what do you mean i keep noticing there s this stuff in here about being decentralized in the future but from the jump it s coming out in centralized form they call this centralization permissioned in the paperwork basically the first version of libra is controlled by the founding coiners you know the ones who also get to keep the interest there is a vague plan for expanding this initial cabal in five years or so any new members of the cabal will have to meet its requirements which are substantial ugh that sounds like fiat currency actually it s worse in the white papers there s a possibility that your data could be archived for a fee to save space i am pleased to report that the fed can t pull that shit paper money 4eva the thing about cryptocurrency is that it does everything regular currency does but way slower but it s worse for another reason too the thing about cryptocurrency is that it does everything regular currency does but way slower that s because of the blockchain doing all of that computation slows your transaction libra s setup makes the transactions a little faster but not nearly as fast as traditional payments processors it looks like libra can do about 1 000 transactions per second says green a traditional payments processor like visa can do about 3 000 transactions per second so it might be reasonable for facebook to do something else rather than all those individual transactions aggregate all of its users netflix bills into one giant bill and then allow one giant transaction to cover the whole thing green says so is that private this is facebook your privacy does not exist to facebook if you trust zuckerberg it s worth remembering that he thinks you are dumb fucks he s apologized for this exchange but i have to say in light of how facebook has treated privacy i think he s mostly just sorry we know about it they ve sort of hand waved around the idea that their business model isn t rooted in user data but i can t imagine that there isn t an interest there swartz says french finance minister bruno le maire shares her skepticism this money will allow this company to assemble even more data which only increases our determination to regulate the internet giants le maire said according to bloomberg in the example i just used of a large aggregated netflix bill there s still the problem of facebook itself knowing your transaction history which isn t great but this is the best case scenario there is a vision of libra where people just use it like at physical locations or to send money to individual people and unlike a bank transfer this won t be private information in that world the privacy problem can be pretty bad green says because every business doing anything on that layer is visible then all of a sudden you have twitter for your bank account where everyone in the world learns all the transactions that you make so a lot like venmo yeah but with a much larger user base imagine the scale here which is deliberately international there are almost certainly governments that would be interested in the transaction data particularly if it s granular says green but i don t get privacy at my bank do i well you do and you don t chase is not broadcasting the details of everywhere i sent money so in that sense it s more private but in another important sense chase is less private that s because of the know your customer and anti money laundering laws which in the us mandate that certain parts of my identity be divulged by my bank to the us government and also that my bank assess how likely it is that i m doing crimes like for instance money laundering those laws seem like something facebook should be paying close attention to if it is serious about libra the laws also vary on a country by country basis seems like a lot of overhead for regulatory compliance if you ask me they re seeming to play it both ways so far how libra will deal with those laws is kind of vague they re doing a weird dance between like oh we re kind of going to be light on kyc and super inclusive but also we re going to be really by the book regulatory swartz says they re seeming to play it both ways but that s not all there s also the irs so if libra is a cryptocurrency and again it does kind of seem to be one it s classed by the irs as a commodity like pork bellies or gold that has tax implications weaver tells me remember how cryptocurrencies are usually kind of volatile and libra is designed deliberately to be less so that doesn t necessarily guarantee low or no volatility so if i m taking my paycheck in libra and the value of libra relative to the dollar goes up while the money is being transferred such that i make 100 extra that 100 is taxable that means something for me sure but it also means something for facebook weaver wrote ince any integration into facebook messenger or whatsapp is under the control of facebook facebook should probably file income tax documents and keep track of the otherwise difficult cost basis math on behalf of facebook s customers like other investment brokerages do the irs needs to remind both facebook and the public of these implications and requirements of course this would make libra completely useless in the u s by increasing the cost of using it beyond any utility when we spoke on the phone weaver told me that true financial privacy is a vehicle for bad outcomes what you want is a company that doesn t allow privacy but is good at protecting your data and since facebook is notorious for misusing data the notion of giving facebook insight into a whole bunch of financial transactions is just flat out disturbing it s not just facebook it s also everyone who has a node to help process these transactions right yeah and that brings us to another potential legal hurdle keeping banking and commerce separate facebook has 27 partners including visa mastercard ebay paypal stripe spotify uber lyft and coinbase depending on what data is visible to them there may be some legal kinks to work out writes matt stoller a fellow at the open markets institute since the civil war the united states has had a general prohibition on the intersection between banking and commerce such a barrier has been reinforced many times such as in 1956 with the bank holding company act and in 1970 with an amendment to that law during the conglomerate craze both times congress blocked banks from going into nonbanking businesses through holding companies because americans historically didn t want banks competing with their own customers banking and payments is a special business where a bank gets access to intimate business secrets of its customers as one travel agent told congress in 1970 when opposing the right of banks to enter his business any time i deposited checks from my customers he said i was providing the banks with the names of my best clients imagine facebook s subsidiary calibra knowing your account balance and your spending and offering to sell a retailer an algorithm that will maximize the price for what you can afford to pay for a product imagine this cartel having this kind of financial visibility into not only many consumers but into businesses across the economy such conflicts of interest are why payments and banking are separated from the rest of the economy in the united states yikes yikes is right and that s before we get to the possibility of scammers look the entire draw of cryptocurrency for the nerds who started the bitcoin community was the lack of interference green says but most of us aren t sophisticated enough to function without some kind of safety net and the reality is that bitcoin created a lot of opportunity for scams and extortion remember when all those elon musks showed up on twitter hawking crypto scams also weaver points out cryptocurrency is the preferred vehicle for ransomware most of us aren t sophisticated enough to function without some kind of safety net those were problems among early adopters who tend to be savvier than us normies there s a world in which a billion people adopting libra leads to those problems on an unimaginably huge scale weaver views scams as being of some concern but extortion worries him more for instance he points out a major limiting factor on online drug markets is that paying with bitcoin is a pain in the ass but an easily accessible cryptocurrency one that has privacy protections that keep everyone from seeing who you send money to makes it way easier to pay for illegal drugs online i like to say that cryptocurrency has committed a crime against me weaver says it has made me believe in the need for rigorous enforcement of money laundering laws so can libra be stopped who can say rep maxine waters d ca the chairwoman of the house finance committee is asking house leadership to join her in demanding that facebook halt libra s development until congress reviews libra bloomberg has reported sen mike crapo r id the chairman of the senate banking committee has scheduled a hearing for july 16th facebook has been invited to testify at a hearing of the financial services panel on july 17th so pop your popcorn but legal and regulatory hurdles can be removed in some cases or mark zuckerberg could go all honey badger about it and dare governments to come get him it s 2019 and anything is possible i will say however that i find this all to be very entertaining and i would like to share with you what may be the most implausible way to stop libra and it involves presidential hopeful howard schultz before he decided to run for president schultz was just the billionaire ceo of starbucks during an earnings call last year he said legitimate cryptocurrencies were on their way bitcoin is not legit in schultz s view his comments sounded like a big hint that starbucks was working on cryptocurrencies or at least the blockchain in some capacity people don t trust facebook they do trust starbucks trust is a huge part of how money works swartz tells me starbucks has a greater geographical reach in terms of branches than any bank in the world she says it has a heavily used payment app and some of the most sophisticated fintech in the world so maybe that s the answer starbucks launches starbucks its own branded cryptocurrency and it just massacres libra because we like and trust starbucks and we don t like or trust facebook that s what i m rooting for anyway culled from the verge

with xi at the g20 summit will be productive but said he had not made any promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs everybody is focused on the trump xi meeting and most investors are hoping for a ceasefire ham added at this point it s just a question of how much of a ceasefire we get they re two strong leaders who want to save face they both want to walk away from it claiming victory financial stocks led the gains in the s p 500 and the dow after the big u s banks passed the federal reserve s stress test with the central bank giving the companies a clean bill of health the s p 500

20 summit this weekend in osaka japan for talks that could help resolve a yearlong trade war between china and the united states as signs of its dampening effect on global growth have become more prevalent everybody s anticipating a positive meeting between trump and president xi said denis sandy villere portfolio manager at villere co in new orleans it s priced in as if it s a foregone conclusion it s making us a little nervous that the market s already baked in all that good news economic data on friday showed u s consumer spending increased moderately in may and prices rose slightly pointing to slowing economic growth and benign inflation pressures which could give the federal reserve enough leeway to cut interest rates in july wall street rose buoyed by financial shares

image illustration by alvaro dominguez the u s economy hit a historic high in 2018 and today unemployment is at its lowest rate in five decades yet wage growth for the vast majority of americans has stalled and more people are struggling to afford housing health care education and other basics times are good if you are college educated and working in the right industries in the right locations says economist paul oyer but the last 50 years have been terrible for people with lower skills adjusted for inflation the average earnings of a man who didn t go to college is lower now than it was 50 years ago that s unheard of oyer a professor at stanford graduate school of business teaches a course to mbas focused on causes and complications of u s inequality the course is co taught by lenny mendonca mba 87 who serves as california gov gavin newsom s chief economic and business advisor and oversees the state s office of economic development here they discuss what is driving inequality vet proposed solutions and speculate what will happen if the trend continues q this is the first generation of americans that is expected to fare worse than the prior what s driving this trend oyer a number of factors globalization for one a really good substitute for a manual laborer in the u s is a manual laborer in china or costa rica another factor is technology apple is the canonical example the company is designing their products here so the people who work in engineering are more and more valuable and making more and more money but the people who in the old days might have made computers here that s now done in china mendonca we ve also had a combination of tax and regulatory policy that has encouraged capital formation and increasing returns to capital so labor s share of returns has decreased the last round of tax policy out of washington made this worse q is this level of inequality historically unprecedented oyer you had the same thing with the industrial revolution that concentrated more and more wealth into the hands of capital henry ford the rockefellers leland stanford mendonca j p morgan oyer but the great depression took the wind out of the sails of that inequality was substantially reduced during the 30s 40s and 50s mendonca a large portion of what reduced inequality was the destruction of wealth during world war ii and the fact that the u s benefited afterward from being the last standing industrial economy we had a global environment that was based on american exports today we re in the midst of a transition to a very different economy this time it s much more global particularly in labor markets oyer but as the u s s inequality has grown since the 70s inequality has reduced dramatically around the world q why is inequality dramatically better globally oyer because the low wage jobs that left here are considered really good jobs in china we ve lifted a billion two billion people out of poverty over the past 30 years mendonca we ve lifted more people out of abject poverty in the last 20 years than in the history of the world q headlines announced google has more contract workers than full timers amazon paid zero taxes this year multinationals are so good at tax avoidance some stanford researchers suggest we may underestimate tax evasion by 50 are companies to blame for growing inequality oyer i don t know that it s their fault they re following the rules mostly inequality varies widely between different companies and between different cities there are companies and cities that have done well in the last 50 years and companies and cities that have done poorly apple s done great google s done great general motors has done lousy from the c suite down to the factory workers quote the big payoffs are early interventions getting kids into preschool having them not fall behind there s a lot of evidence that by third grade some kids are far behind and never catch up attribution paul oyer mendonca i don t think most business leaders are worker exploiting uncaring community destroying environment polluting extreme capitalists they re just doing their jobs so we have to create an environment where doing their jobs includes thinking about all those things in a way that s not in conflict with their business interests oyer as a company i m not going to individually fix inequality by overpaying my workers because then someone else is going to come in and undercut me and pay less to their workers we need policy interventions we need to give companies the incentive to do the right thing q so are policy interventions the primary solution oyer we re not going to solve all these problems just through policy too many people have incentives to obstruct the policies that should go through as an economist i m favorable toward certain types of immigration and toward free trade those are good policies if you ask me they re potentially what we call i m throwing out a jargon term pareto optimal meaning if you did it right you could make everyone better off if you suddenly make trade free and that hurts some people you can transfer money to make them better off well everybody always forgets to do that part where they transfer money that s what s led to a lot of inequality there are a lot of good policies that we ve implemented over the years like free trade and immigration that have been efficient and grown the economy but have contributed to inequality automation while not a policy is another example where we say we can have robots and then take care of the people who lose their jobs we always forget to go back and take care of the people who lose their jobs q a much steeper income tax has gotten attention some pitching even 70 is that possible oyer i can t imagine a 70 tax rate and i don t think we ll see a universal basic income for a long time these are hugely expensive ideas q what about a higher minimum wage oyer the neoclassical theory on minimum wage is that if you raise it some low wage workers have more money but others will lose their jobs and be worse off how true is that the answer is for small enough changes when the economy s strong it s not that big of a deal it definitely improves the welfare and buying power of people at the low end of the spectrum but it s really just keeping people out of poverty it s not creating middle class families q what would help create middle class families oyer the big payoffs are early interventions getting kids into preschool having them not fall behind there s a lot of evidence that by third grade some kids are far behind and never catch up for a lot of children when they re 8 years old it s too late if your parents aren t engaged in the education system in 10 years you ll be competing in the labor market against people whose parents sent them to violin lessons and summer programs in the dominican republic there s inequality of opportunity q what happens if inequality continues to grow oyer well i thought the answer was going to be someone like bernie sanders would be elected president but instead it took this very strange turn with donald trump instead of people saying let s steal the rich guys money they said let s blow up the whole system mendonca the consequences of dramatic inequality led to people turning either to authoritarian leaders who promise a return to the past or to alternative economic constructs like socialism neither of which are very good for capitalism q uber driver strikes garnered headlines before the company s ipo should we anticipate more strikes like these oyer the labor movement has been defanged in the process of inequality there s cause and effect questions there so i don t know you would think so but there s not a lot of labor unrest out there like walmart and amazon why aren t they striking or forming unions q what do you hope your students take away from this course oyer in the 20 years i ve been here there s been a lot more interest among our students in solving the world s problems there s a certain arrogance in that but also a hopefulness they re not going to fix the problem but they re going to contribute toward solutions they re going to do their part i hope and that means being more thoughtful in how they run their organizations and influence policy mendonca i hope that some of them as prior students have decide to focus their career on directly addressing economic mobility as important i hope they all come away understanding that all business leaders have a fundamental role in addressing the issue as individual leaders as members of their community and as public voices
the people s president donald trump delivered comments and held a lengthy press conference at the conclusion of the g20 summit prior to traveling to south korea there were hundreds of international media in the audience and president trump answered deliberate and clarifying questions from a variety of foreign and domestic journalists for well over an hour the president was comfortable taking all questions and was in complete command often humorous over all content and subject matter here s the transcript warning it s a long read 14 000 words the president thank you thank you very much appreciate it it s been a really great period of time i ll be leaving now as you know for south korea some of you will be coming with us i understand that we may be meeting with chairman king kim and we ll find out we spoke with the people kim jong un was very receptive he responded and so we ll see because tomorrow we re going to the dmz i said while i m there i ll shake his hand we get along there s been no nuclear tests there s been no long range ballistic tests gave us back our hostages which was great and a lot of good things are happening over there so i let him know we ll be there and we ll see i mean i don t i can t tell you exactly but they did respond very favorably i want to thank everyone for being here today that s a lot of press a lot of press is outside too they re less happy than you are but the g20 summit has been fantastic prime minister abe has done an incredible job as he always does and he hosted it very beautifully you know where it s going to be next year i think do most of you know where it s going to be next year it s going to be in a very great part of the world and we ll be announcing exactly what s happening but this was a really good summit and really well done so professionally done this marks my third visit to japan as president melania and i are we ve just left tokyo a short while ago as you know a very short while ago where we were the first state guests to their majesties the emperor and empress of japan and that was thrilling first time in 202 years that an event like that took place so that was quite exciting and i m thrilled to be back i always like being back in japan we ve had a great relationship we ve never been closer to japan than we are right now over the past two days leaders from the world s largest economies have convened here at osaka which is a tremendous city you fly over and you say does it ever stop it s big it s beautiful it s clean and it s really a the job they do with industrial manufacturing and lots of other things is really incredible we had a very productive conversation with a number of the leaders not only nations but business leaders here in japan and together we put together a lot of ideas and a lot of challenges for the future that we ll be able to meet and get things going very well our meetings also touched on women s economic empowerment you probably saw that ivanka trump was she s done a fantastic job and also a fantastic job in getting jobs for a lot of people within our country almost 10 million people the importance of resilient and secure infrastructure we discussed that at great length the need to uphold the rule of law and the critical importance of achieving a future for international trade that works all of the time for all of the people in addition to the working sessions we had a lot of working sessions many of you were at the working sessions i had tremendous bilateral meetings with many of the heads of state and just some of them are australia japan india germany russia brazil saudi arabia china turkey uk and i met with mexico also with the representatives of mexico who have done an incredible job they ve really stepped up to the plate i appreciate it and i want to thank them they have 6 000 troops at their southern border by guatemala and it s very hard to come in now and they have they just ordered really it was somewhat of a surprise 16 000 troops at our southern border their immigration laws are very strong ours are a disaster ours are a disgrace to our country we have loopholes and asylum that we could fix the asylum very quickly we could get rid of and fix the loopholes but we could get rid of the loopholes and we would have absolutely no problem at the border but if you watch the debates if you call them debates or whatever they were they don t really i think they want open borders i guess even though four years ago they wanted walls to be built i heard we just had another judge rule against us on a section of wall and that s a disgrace we ll appeal it right away ninth circuit as usual they go right into that ninth circuit the good news i put a lot of judges in and a number of them are in the ninth circuit now and it s very unfair it s very unfair when a judge can do what they do where a judge in a certain area can close down a country but we also had a big victory last week with the wall we had a judge in d c who gave us a very big victory so we re building a lot of wall but we had a ruling just yesterday late from a judge in the ninth circuit again so we re immediately appealing it and we think we ll win the appeal there was no reason that that should ve happened and a lot of wall is being built and again mexico is doing a real job our border patrol they ve done incredible work and ice is they re just special people law enforcement generally is just is special so with that i just want to say that these meetings have been great the one that i guess most people are interested in is china we had a great meeting president xi and we ve known each for as long as i m president and many of you were at the event in china a year ago when i ve never seen anything like it the it was beautiful we talked about it we dinner last night president xi and a number of us and it was something really incredible in beijing the red carpet was rolled out for all of us for this country for our country and we had a great meeting and we will be continuing to negotiate and i promised that for at least the time being we re not going to be lifting tariffs on china we won t be adding an additional tremendous amount of we have i guess 350 billion left which could be taxed or it could be tariffed and we re not doing that we re going to work with china on where we left off to see if we can make a deal china is going to start they re going to be consulting with us and they re going to start spending money even during the negotiation to our farmers our great farmers in the midwest i call them the great patriots because that s what they are they re patriots and china is going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product and they re going to start that very soon almost immediately we re going to give them lists of things that we d like them to buy our farmers are going to be a tremendous beneficiary you know if you look at farmers for 15 years before i came into the into this position farms and farmers have had a hard time if you look at that graph it was it was down fairly steeply down and a lot of it was because nafta was a terrible deal and we have i spoke with nancy pelosi last night about the usmca that s mexico and canada and it s now before them and they ll have to make a decision but that s one that the farmers love the manufacturers love the unions love it s a great deal for this country and nafta was i think one of the worst trade deals ever made maybe the wto was worse the wto from the time that happened in 95 from the time that happened china became like a rocket ship it was pretty much flat lined and then all of a sudden they joined the wto and they became they went i mean they went through the roof and very much to our liability it s we lost tremendous amounts of money over the from that time i mean we just lost tremendous amounts it was a terrible deal the wto world trade and if you look at nafta nafta has been a disaster for our country the usmca is a great deal for our country i think canada is happy but they re not happy like we re happy but they re very happy it s a good deal for canada a good deal for mexico they want it mexico just approved it in full canada is waiting for us to approve it i was with the prime minister just left him a little while ago and they re thrilled with the deal and we re thrilled everybody wants it and hopefully it will be a bipartisan deal i view that i told that to nancy pelosi i said view this as a bipartisan deal because a lot of the democrats want it especially i would say the farmers but really the industrial areas also the unions we ve got things on wages and we ve got things on the environment that few people have ever been able to get into an agreement and it s a very big deal it s a very big deal and it s a great deal tremendous support so they have to put it up for a vote and i think you ll get a great vote in the house and you ll get a great vote in the senate and you ll have a tremendous trade deal between the united states and canada and mexico and it s going to be something very special so we spend a lot of time with a lot of countries we do business with a lot of them australia is an example with japan we re negotiating with them because they send us millions of cars and we send them wheat doesn t work but what happens is japan is you probably saw some of the things they re doing but they re opening up many car companies and factories and plants throughout our country especially in michigan we have a lot of activity in ohio beyond japan activity we have a lot of activity now where companies are coming back to our country we re the hot show we re the hottest show in town we re the hottest show in the world right now our economy is the best one thing that every leader virtually every leader that i dealt with said is that congratulations it s incredible what s happened to the american economy we re the best economy in the world and it s something and it started from election day i put it out yesterday because we took a tremendous boost from the day after i got elected the stock market went crazy from that point until essentially now i think we hit in certain of the markets we hit the all time high again for many many times i can t tell you what it was but many many times we broke the record and we re you know our stock market is great our jobs are great we have the best job numbers essentially we ve ever had in some categories definitely we ve ever had the minimum you could say is in 51 years but it s really more than that and now it s going to be more than that african american asian american you saw that hispanic american the best numbers in history the history of our country we have the lowest unemployment numbers best numbers and many others too blue collar workers are doing fantastic they re the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts the blue collar blue collar you know we talk about for the rich it s really for everybody and it s also for big companies where they re moving here and remember who owns the stocks because the people that own the stock it s not the big companies it s the people with 401 k s whose numbers are at 60 percent and 70 percent and 42 percent and all different numbers that are tremendously high where the other spouse thinks that the spouse that s investing in the 401 k is a super genius but those 401 k s are very high and if you listen to what i ve been listening to and we re not going to devote anytime to it but with that kind of an attitude their 401 k s are going to crash and the market would crash because with what they want to do you would crash the market and the amount of wealth that would be lost would be incredible but i d rather wait until later in the campaign to say that because to be honest with you i want them to go and take these policies and bring them up i don t want them to change them anytime soon let them go have a good time but it s been very interesting to watch what s happening actually i found it very interesting so with that we ll take a few questions and then i m heading out to south korea and i may or may not see kim jong un but we ll be heading out to south korea spend about a day and a half there with president moon who is a really good guy he was here too as you know i saw him i met with him also and we ll see what happens please john q mr president thank you so much for joining us here the president yes q we all appreciate it it s always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly can you tell us a little more about how this china deal may work going forward because chinese officials have told fox news that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted they also want relief on huawei they want it taken off the black list they might want you to stop pursuing extradition of meng wanzhou can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding and if you do meet kim jong un at the dmz tomorrow would you step across the border into north korea the president sure i would i would i d feel very comfortable doing that i would have no problem with respect to china basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation which i ended a while back and we re going to continue the negotiation we agreed that i would not be putting tariffs on the 325 billion that i would have the ability to put on if i wanted that where you know we re fairly advanced depending where you want to look at and where you want to start pretty advanced we discussed we did discuss numerous other things we mentioned huawei i said we ll have to save that until the very end we ll have to see one of the things i will allow however is a lot of people are surprised we send and we sell to huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make and i said that that s okay that we will keep selling that product these are american companies john that make product and that s very complex by the way highly scientific and in some cases we re the ones that do it and we re the only ones that do it we re the only ones with the technology what we ve done in silicon valley is incredible actually and nobody has been able to compete with it and i ve agreed and pretty easily i ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so american companies will continue and they were having a problem the companies were not exactly happy that they couldn t sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to huawei so i did do that we talked about education and students somebody was saying it was harder for a chinese students to come in and that s something that if it were it somebody viewed it that way i don t we want to have chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities they ve been great students and tremendous assets but we did discuss it it was brought up as a point and i said that will be just like anybody else just like any other nation and we re actually going to a point where you know we re looking that if you graduate from a college because our great companies we talk about silicon valley and other places we have a problem in this in our country that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country and they say you have to leave we can t keep them and we re going to make it we re going to call it the smart person s waiver but we re going to make it so that they can not only stay but maybe they have access to green cards we want to keep these people here we have to keep yeah go ahead john q but are you concerned that as they did before china took it most of the way down the road and then say the president sure q we re going to pull back inaudible the president that could happen but we re holding on tariffs and they re going to buy farm product so you know so but that could happen john this doesn t mean there s going to be a deal but they would like to make a deal i can tell you that and if we could make a deal it would be a very historic event you know we ve never really had a deal with china we have we ve had tremendous deficits tremendous amounts of money was put into china 500 billion a year and i mean you know not just surplus and deficit i m talking about real hard cash and it should have never ever been allowed to have happened for all of our presidents over the last number of years go ahead please q yes mr president steve herman from the voice of america after your discussions with prime minister abe here are you still thinking about withdrawing from the u s japan security treaty and what did the prime minister say to you about that the president no i m not thinking about that at all i m just saying that it s an unfair agreement and i ve told him that for the last six months i said look if somebody attacks japan we go after them and we are in a battle full force in effect we are locked in a battle and committed to fight for japan if somebody should attack the united states they don t have to do that that s unfair that s the kind of deals we made that s every deal is like that i mean it s almost like we had people that they didn t either care or they were stupid but that s the kind of deals we have that s just typical but i have been i told him i said we re going to have to change it because look nobody is going to attack us i hope but you know should that happen it s far more likely that it could be the other way but should that happen somebody attacks us if we re helping them they re going to have help us and he knows that and he s going to have no problem with that yes please q thank you mr president i actually have a russia question but i wanted to quickly clarify is meng wanzhou s case also going to need to wait until the very end or is it possible the u s would drop the extradition effort the president when what on what q ms meng from huawei the top financial inaudible the president we didn t discuss ms meng we didn t that was not discussed we did discuss huawei but we didn t discuss her situation q okay thank you on russia respectfully it seemed like maybe you didn t really mean it when you said yesterday don t meddle in our elections mr president and then you guys both started laughing the president well i did say it you re to have to take a look at the words i did say it and we had a discussion we had a great actually we had a great discussion president putin and myself i thought it was really a tremendous discussion i think they d like to do trade with the united states and they have great product they have great land they have very rich land and a lot of oil a lot of minerals and the kind of things that we like and i can see trade going out with russia we could do fantastically well we do very little trade with russia which is ridiculous frankly so i could see some very positive things happening yeah but as per your question though i did say it and i did discuss it a little bit after that too yeah please q thank you mr president yesterday former president jimmy carter suggested that your presidency is illegitimate and that you only got the white house with help from russia your reaction to that sir the president russia russia russia isn t it crazy okay jimmy carter look he was a nice man he was a terrible president he s a democrat and it s a typical talking point he s loyal to the democrats and i guess you should be but as everybody now understands i won not because of russia not because of anybody but myself i went out i campaigned better smarter harder than hillary clinton i went to wisconsin i went to michigan the night of the vote i had 32 000 people at 1 o clock in the morning on election day i won michigan i won wisconsin i won pennsylvania i won states that traditionally haven t been won by a republican for many years haven t been won by a republican and this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that i worked harder and much smarter than hillary clinton did now i ll say this jimmy carter i was surprised that he would make a statement i saw it it was not a big thing but i saw the statement and it s you know a lot of democrats like to make that statement he s been trashed within his own party he s been badly trashed i felt badly for him because if you look over the years his party has virtually he s like the forgotten president and i understand why they say that he was not a good president look at what happened with iran that was a disaster what iran did to him they tied him up in knots the reason ronald reagan probably because president so you know it s a democrat talking point yeah please go ahead jim q yes mr president if i could follow up on the question about your comments with vladimir putin the president sure q about russia meddling you did seem to be joking there with the russian president are we taking that to be wrong the president no q and what is it with your coziness with some of these dictators and autocrats at these summits with mohammad bin salman the crown prince of saudi arabia when you were asked about the case of jamal khashoggi you did not respond to that question in front of the saudi crown prince the president i don t know that anybody asked me q were you afraid of offending him on that subject the president no not at all i don t really care about offending people i sort of thought you d know that laughter q well you passed up an opportunity there the president and by the way congratulations i understand your book is it doing well q it s doing very well mr president the president really q i ll get you an autographed copy the president good send it i want to see it q yes sir yeah the president send me a copy no i get along with everybody except you people actually i get along with a lot of people i have a tremendous relationship with president xi nobody else would have the deal that we have we re getting tens of billions of dollars from china coming in a lot of things are happening and despite that we re moving along towards something that could be very historic but i get along with president putin i get along with mohammad from saudi arabia look i spoke to saudi arabia when the oil prices a year ago were getting very high and i wasn t so nice and i said you got to get some more oil into the system because what s happening is no good and they did and the people are driving at you know very low numbers right now you haven t seen in the old days you d have spikes where the gasoline went to 5 and more and it wasn t so good but i also get along with people that would be perceived as being very nice you have a lot of very nice leaders of countries i was with q but mr president isn t the president i was with wait a minute i was with prime minister may today i was with so many you take a look new head of australia look at japan abe prime minister abe is a fine they re all fine as far as i m concerned some are stronger than others some are tougher than others and a lot of people q mr president but if i may though mr president on the case of jamal khashoggi you have a lot of journalists in this room who object to what appears to be the saudi government s complicity and perhaps orchestration of the assassination and dismembering of a journalist the president yeah q and when you were given the opportunity to call mohammad bin salman out on that you did not do it did you do it privately and do you agree that it is despicable for a government to kill a journalist in that fashion the president yes i do i think it s horrible or anybody else by the way q yeah the president but i think it s horrible and if you look and look into saudi arabia and you see what s happening 13 people or so have been prosecuted others are being prosecuted they ve taken it very very seriously and they will continue to and i ve let everybody know i m not i m very unhappy about that whole event but if you look at what s going on and right now within saudi arabia they re prosecuting additional people there s a lot of things happening at the same time i will also say and nobody said nobody so far has pointed directly a finger at the future king of saudi arabia i will say i spoke to his father jim i spoke to his father at great length they ve been a terrific ally they re creating millions of jobs in this country they re ordering equipment not only military equipment but 400 billion worth of and actually even more than that over a period time worth of different things and with that being said i m extremely angry and unhappy about a thing like that taking place but as of this moment more than 13 people are being prosecuted and i hear the number is going to be going up but it s a good question yes please q thank you mr president i m ching yi chan with shanghai media group it s very good to note that you averted the further escalation of trade tension with china and can you share some details of your interaction with president xi this time and also if i may another quick question on north korea do you think it s possible that there will be a third one on one summit with chairman kim the president oh sure q within this year the president oh it might happen tomorrow i mean to be honest we won t call it a summit we ll call it a handshake if it does happen i don t know that it will but it could happen i know i think he d like to do it and i wouldn t mind doing it at all i m going to be i m literally visiting the dmz and so but i will as per your question about president xi he s a brilliant leader he s a brilliant man and you know better than i he s probably considered to be one of the great leaders in 200 years in china and we just have a very he s strong he s tough but he s good we have a very good relationship and i said you know we can t have it where the united states loses this kind of money for the privilege of building up china it has to be a fair deal and he understands that but as he said nobody ever came to us it s true no other president came to him this would ve my presidency could be a lot easier not only for that but for many other reasons it d be a lot easier but i don t want it to be easy it s a point in time i have a chance to do things that nobody else has ever done so we re making a deal with china or we re attempting and if we don t we ll go back into you know we have a tremendous ripe field of tremendous money that would be coming into our country but i have a feeling that over a period of time and again i m not rushed and i told him that i want to get the deal right it s extremely i wouldn t even say complicated but very intricate but in the meantime i think our farmers are going to end up being the great beneficiary and what i did with the farmers because they did lose a certain amount of money i went to sonny perdue who is our secretary of agriculture i said sonny how much money in the best year did china spend on our farms in our farms buying he said the best year about 16 billion i said okay well we re taking in much more than that now every year in tariffs and i took 16 billion out of those tariffs and essentially out of those tariffs and we re distributing it among farmers who have been hurt because they have been used as a pawn so that china could get a good deal but in the end the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary but i ve made up for the fact that china was you know targeting our farmers because they know the farmers like me and i like them i love them and they sort of love me i guess when you get right down to it and it was 16 billion billion that s a lot of money but i took it out the tariff money essentially and we are in the process of distributing it the farmers could not be happier other than they re unusual i had them around a table many of the farmers and about five weeks ago and they said we don t want money we want just a level playing field i said you re right most groups want money they ll take any way you want to give it to them they ll take the farmers are in a class by themselves in so many ways they don t want subsidies they don t want a handout all they want to do is have a level playing field they re unbelievable people and as i said they re unbelievable patriots jon q thank you mr president first a quick follow up you ve made this very public invitation to kim jong un will it be a bad sign if he doesn t show up the president no of course i thought of that because i know if he didn t everybody is going to say oh he was stood up by chairman kim no i understood that it s very hard to he follows my twitter q he does the president and it s very hard q he follows you on twitter the president i guess so because we got a call very quickly laughter a lot of people follow it but you know they ve contacted us and they d like to see if they can do something and we re not talking about for you know extended just a quick hello and we get along i get along with him and i get along with other people like you know for instance on jim s question it s a fair question but i really have great relationships with everybody i think you know i said a long time ago that maybe i ll be a sleeper on foreign policy and if you look at what s happened on foreign policy now we are working on iran and we ll see what happens i think they d like to make a deal i think they d be very smart to want to make a deal but we re going to see what happens i m okay i have all the time in the world they re doing very poorly they were doing they were very brutal when i first came in eighteen sites of confliction meaning where they were behind but i think on foreign policy if you look at what s happening and the other thing that s happening is we re not being taken for suckers anymore i mean we have countries where we d lose on defending them because we defend a tremendous percentage of the world and they don t pay us for it and then on top of it we lose money with that same country on trade and it s all changing and they understand it s changing and they expect it to change they can t believe honestly like i d ask prime minister abe i said how did this happen where you send us billions and billions of dollars worth of cars and other things and we send you practically nothing he said nobody ever complained same thing with china i said you know you send a car to us we charge you essentially nothing it s 2 5 percent but basically you don t have to there are ways around that so you send a car to us and you pay nothing we send a car to you made in the united states and we have to pay 45 percent tariff how did that happen he said we just kept lifting it lifting it lifting it i mean they re being honest with me we just kept lifting it and nobody called but i call i call go ahead jon q and i want to ask you about the debate you clearly saw at least some of the democratic debate the president yeah q i m sure you saw the exchange between joe biden and kamala harris the president i did q on the issue of federal busing federally mandated busing biden thought that was a bad policy he tried to stop it kamala harris said it was an important part of desegregation including in her own experience where do you stand on that issue of federally mandated busing the president well first of all before i get into that i thought that she was given too much credit he didn t do well certainly and maybe the facts weren t necessarily on his side i think she was given too much credit for what she did it wasn t that outstanding and i think probably he was hit harder than he should ve been hit biden i thought he was hit actually harder and as far as that i will tell you in about four weeks because we re coming out with certain policy that s going to be very interesting and very surprising i think to a lot of people jennifer do you have a question q but do you think kamala harris would be a tough opponent for you given what you saw in that debate the president you never know who s going to be tough you never know one that you think is going to be tough turns out to be not much and sometimes you think one and i ve seen it because look i had 17 we had actually a total of 18 a lot of people think 17 governor of virginia remember add the governor of virginia wasn t there long previous governor but of the 18 you know many were all their lives they wanted to be politicians i never thought about being a politician until about two days before i decided to run a little before that but not too much before and they you know you looked at some of them they re very talented you look at their résumés it s like great and sometimes the ones that i thought would be the toughest were not the toughest at all i mean i could write a book i should write a book but some of the people that i did in the republican because we had sort of a similar thing we had 18 instead of i guess they have 24 or 25 but some of the ones that i thought would be absolutely absolutely without question the toughest turned out i didn t they were tough at all others that a lot of people said weren t tough they were tough i think she was given far too much credit for what she did that was so out of the can what she said that thing was right out of a box and i thought that he didn t respond great i wouldn t say it was this was not winston churchill we re dealing with okay but it wasn t it wasn t i don t think nearly as bad as they portended it to be jennifer go ahead q thank you mr president the president thank you q could i clarify your negotiations and what you agreed to with china on huawei the president sure q did you agree that huawei can sell to the u s or that u s companies can sell to huawei the president u s companies can sell their equipment to huawei i m talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it but the u s companies can sell their equipment so we have a lot of the great companies in silicon valley and based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment we re letting them sell to huawei q and then on turkey sir will turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the s 400 purchases the president okay so turkey is an interesting case because there s another one jim that i get along with very well and he s a tough cookie okay right president erdogan he s tough but i get along with him and maybe that s a bad thing but i think it s a really good thing because frankly he wanted to wipe out he has a big problem with the kurds as everyone knows and he had a 65 000 man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the kurds who helped us with isis we took out the caliphate we have 100 percent of the caliphate and i called him and i asked him not to do it they are i guess natural enemies of his or turkey s and he hasn t done it they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the isis caliphate with and i said you can t do that you can t do it and he didn t do it so i have a relationship but let me tell you so he goes out during the obama administration he wants to buy our patriot missile right they wouldn t sell it to him he wants to buy even though he s a member of nato and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the president and he s got a big army and he s you know they re fighters turkey is big fighters and we re working on idlib province together because he doesn t want to see 3 million people killed and neither do i in syria but and i mentioned that that was another thing i mentioned folks to president putin i said please take it easy with idlib because you know they ve been encircling that i think if i didn t put out a statement six months ago that would ve been catastrophic but they have 30 000 terrorists in idlib province you have 3 million people and you know getting terrorists is okay but you don t want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists so anyway so we get along great but what happened with turkey and i will tell you when it s fair and when it s not fair he wanted to buy the patriot missile president obama s group said no he kept wanting to buy it they kept saying no no no couldn t buy it now he needed it for defense he needed it so he then went to russia and he bought the s 400 made a deal to buy it because he couldn t get it they wouldn t allow him to buy it they wouldn t allow it this administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it so he goes out he goes to russia and he makes a deal for the s 400 and let s assume it s not nearly as good but he made a deal he paid them money a lot of money put up a lot of money and he bought it as soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said listen we don t want you to use that system because it s not the nato system et cetera et cetera you know all the reasons we don t want you to use that system do us a favor we ll sell you the patriot he said it s too late i already bought it there was nothing he could do he already bought it in the meantime he bought over a hundred f 35s the greatest fighter jet in the world it s stealth you can t see it it s real hard to beat something when you can t see it but he bought over a hundred i think he bought 116 but he bought over a hundred a lot and there s options for more and now he wants delivery he s paid a tremendous amount of money up front to lockheed our company our jobs everything and now they re saying he s using the s 400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the s 400 system russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the f 35 but honestly i m all for our country but he got treated very unfairly he was told you can t buy it you can t buy it you know it s the old secret when you can t have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were they said first they said we ll sell it to you you can have it in four years then they said we ll get it to you immediately but he said i can t do it i bought i ve spent a fortune on buying another system similar system from russia the problem is he already bought the planes and the planes aren t compatible from our standpoint not from the standpoint of compatibility but from our standpoint national security wise so it s a mess it s a mess and honestly it s not really erdoğan s fault so now we have breaking news donald trump loves turkey he loves turkey donald trump is on the side of turkey instead of the united no i m not q you don t seem like you want to go ahead with the president i love our country but i have to tell you president erdoğan who has done he gave me our pastor back pastor brunson nobody else could get him back remember they couldn t get him back president obama he was in jail for 35 years he was going to be in jail forever pastor brunson he was an innocent man i called him and after a very short period of time pastor brunson was standing in the oval office with me and he was back so you know he s been from my standpoint and he s a tough guy okay when you talk about tough he s tough but i get along with him i think he was unfairly treated where you were told you can t have it and then after he bought another system we said we ll sell it to you we ll give it to you right away but he couldn t use it then but by that time he had already bought the plane so it s a complicated deal we re working on it we ll see what we can do q can i ask you one last quick thing on china the president yes go please q so there was a negotiation on huawei welcoming students holding off on tariffs so it sounds like china has agreed to buy more ag but is this a lopsided agreement or what more did china agree to the president no we agreed on china this is actually a good question i did agree to allow our companies you know jobs i like our companies selling things to other people so i allowed that to happen very complex things not easy this is not things that are easy to make very few companies are able to do it but a tremendous amount of money our companies were very upset you know these companies are great companies you know all of them but they weren t exactly happy with it but we re allowing that because that was a national security we re allowing them to sell but we agreed to leave that until the end huawei is a complicated situation we agreed to leave that we re leaving huawei toward the end we re going to see we ll see where we go with the trade agreement yes please q thank you i have a question about the border but i just wanted to follow up quickly on the question about busing do you see it as a viable way of integrating schools does that relate to the policy that you re going to unveil the president well it has been something that they ve done for a long period of time i mean you know there aren t that many ways you re going to get people to schools so this is something that s been done in some cases it s been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove and you know that s part of it but this has been certainly a thing that s been used over the i think if vice president biden had answered the question somewhat differently it would ve been a lot it would ve been a different result because they really did hit him hard on that one so but it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools q and is it does it relate to the policy that you re going to unveil that you just floated the president it relates to everything we re doing and you ll be hearing about it in over the next couple of months q over the next couple of months okay and i want to ask you about the border it seems like there is officially a week to go until the ice raids begin under that deadline that you imposed the president yeah q given that you have a july 4th recess is it realistic to think that you re going to get a deal to actually reform the asylum laws the president no because we could do it in we could do it you know i say to people i used to say 45 minutes i say 15 but we could do it quickly we could do it in a day we could do it in an hour we could reform asylum very quickly we could get rid of the loopholes very quickly these are horrible loopholes and the reason that mexico is so good because they do have very very tough immigration they don t have the kind of things and the kind of stupidity that we have i mean where somebody touches one foot on our sand and we now have to bring them into a court we then have to register them we then have to catch and release them and they go and they live in our country then they re supposed to come back in three years for a court case and about 2 percent come back as you know i mean you know it just as well as anybody i really think maybe better than most but the fact is they come back but nobody comes back two percent come back it s a horrible system now what we re doing is they come in illegally and we re bringing them out legally but at the request of some you know very good democrats they asked me if i could hold it and i did for a couple of weeks and we have a week left but other than the fact that we did get in a very bipartisan way we got and i appreciate speaker pelosi because she really worked with us it was humanitarian money i mean they didn t have any money and we re running don t forget nobody has ever had this problem before we re running hospitals we re running so many different things for the kids and the kids are brought up because under the laws the kids are used legally used to get other people to come in if you have a child it s much easier to come into our country it s easy anyway but if you have a child it s much easier so we have these kids who have been absolutely abused horribly abused and we could stop that with a minor change in the law it s a terrible thing that they re not doing it so here s what s happening so i said all right let s see if you can give that to us now in the meantime we did we just got it approved last night so we have the 4 5 billion in humanitarian aid right and that s good so we have that but we can have that number go way down if we stop people from coming up for instance if we had walls up and if we had it hard the father and the beautiful daughter who drowned and you know the rio grande is a very tough you know that has moments where it can be very calm and then all of a sudden it becomes totally violent and people get swept away but if they thought it was hard to get in they wouldn t be coming up they wouldn t be coming up and so many lives would be saved so essentially if they would change the laws and i said it would take us an hour but let s give you two weeks at the end of the second week we ll be removing people legally removing in other words q so you re still planning for that deadline that deadline is still in place which is now a week from now the president oh yeah unless we do something pretty miraculous but the democrats it seems to me they want to have open borders and for the life of me i cannot figure that out it s one thing because i want people to come into our country we need them because we have all these companies coming in you know we have foxconn in wisconsin we have so many companies coming in auto companies just today i was with president abe he told me another auto company is going to build a big plant they need people so i m all for that the only problem is that they have to come in through a process they have to come in legally it s also very unfair you have millions of people on line for years trying to get into a country they take tests they study they know a lot about our country they read they do they have to go through a very complicated process and these people have worked hard they ve been on line for seven eight nine years and then somebody walks in and they re you know welcome to the united states it s really honestly it s very unfair but yeah we will be removing large numbers of people people have to understand yes the laws are q in a week the president yeah starting in a week after you know sometime after july 4th q so the deal that was just passed does nothing to make you want to step back from that raid the president well that s different that s humanitarian no that s a different that s humanitarian we needed that just to take care because we re running now hospitals i mean the border patrol these are incredible people they re doing what they you know nobody ever thought they were going to be doing this and people are coming up the reason people are coming up is because we re doing so well as a country in past years we weren t doing well in past years mexico was doing better you know they took 32 percent of our car business they were doing better than we were doing in the past now we re the hot country in the world and people are coming up because they want a piece of that action and the other reason children are coming up is because we had a separation policy okay under president obama we had separation president obama built those cells they were in 2014 they were built they all said oh look how horrible then it turned out that it was built by president obama and i m not blaming anybody i m not blaming him i just say this they had a separation policy right i ended it but when i ended it i put out a statement i think it s going to bring more children up because you re ending it you re saying now the child can stay with the parent so i said ending it is nice in one way but in terms of what we re doing it makes it even tougher but the really bad thing is the cartels and i really think that mexico because you know they did 6 000 now they re doing 16 000 on our border i think that mexico is looking to swamp the cartels and those kind of numbers will do it it would be a great thing what mexico is doing for us is great by the way without the tariffs they wouldn t have done it for us we ve been after we ve been after them for many years to do it but they have really so far it s only a week the numbers are way down and so far a lot of good things have happened yes sir please yes please in the second row q thank you mr president two questions about iran the president would you like me to leave now or here s the thing i can stay we can do this for a long time my only problem is this i don t need stories he stayed up there too long if i stay up there quickly they say why did he not give us more time if i stay up for two hours they ll say he stayed up too long i mean if you promise you re not going to say i say because everybody has got a hand up and if you want i ll go on should i go on or should i not go on what you do you think q go on q at least one more the president okay and you re not going to say he went on too long q at least one more the president because we have time you know i have a flight that actually leaves pretty much when i want it to laughter okay let s go q thank you mr president two questions about iran a week ago you called off a strike because you were concerned it would kill iranians the president disproportionately absolutely q disproportionately did the military leaders provide you with any alternative you know some derelict oil rig that could have been hit to the president no no no q to make a point the president oh i had many alt oh yeah i have i ll bet i have 50 alternatives i have many alternatives yeah i mean you know what you don t know what the sites were you said oil rig you don t know what the sites were but i had many alternatives no no military leaders did a great job when we chose and designated certain areas that we were thinking about i said how many people are going to die i mean i m talking about on the other side that means a lot to me too okay how many people are going to die they said probably about 150 you don t know could be much worse than that could be less too i guess but it could be much more than that because this is heavy stuff going in and we would have been 100 percent we have the greatest military in the world i deal with them all the time these people are incredible people lethal and hopefully we don t have to use it much i mean we ve spent if you look at the numbers 716 billion this year we had planes that were so old that we didn t now we have brand new f 35s we have brand new super hornets and f 18s and i mean the equipment we have is incredible the army now has beautiful new things everything is we have a military that s really great hopefully we don t have to use it very much but no they came in and they said this and i asked them a question and they came back a short time later and they said about 150 people i said that s really disproportionate i don t like it q my second question is that here at the g20 summit what can you tell us has the ball been moved in any particular direction towards easing the tensions with iran in some of the meetings that you ve had the president well i have had a lot of countries come up to me france has come up if you look at president macron good guy he came up to me he said you know i do a lot of business meaning france does a lot of business with iran i would love to go see them it s all right anybody can see them i don t mind talking i think talking is great i m not going to say oh don t talk to them don t talk to them i do think john kerry should not have been talking to them i think that s delaying this process a lot i think he violated the logan act actually but i think john kerry speaking to iran a lot maybe saying things like gee you know if you wait another 15 months maybe trump will lose the election and then you can deal with a person that s a lot easier than trump you ll deal with a stiff that will give you everything you want and that makes it a little tougher for me to make a deal but that s okay yeah please go q mr president during the week you tweeted out your displeasure with the supreme court s decision on census and you suggested you may seek to delay the president yeah i think it s very unfortunate q are you in fact going to try to delay the census the president well we re looking at that legally because they re asking us to do a census and you know the census it was shocking to me i figured it would be you know not expensive to do a census it s billions of dollars you know that right billions billions they go knock on doors of every house in the country and they get everything they re not allowed to ask whether or not somebody is a citizen of the united states how horrible and ridiculous is that so we are looking at that yeah sure q do you know if you have the legal authority to do that the president because it wasn t a real decision that boom this is the way it is it was like now right now it depends on it depends on what happens i guess it was a very strange decision it was a very very sad decision not in terms of voting not in terms of just a very sad because it was so convoluted it was to get to that decision had to be very very hard q well justices said that your guys were playing politics when deciding not to count non citizens the president hey who s really playing politics okay check it out you tell me who s playing politics yeah go ahead please q thanks mr president i think i heard you mention earlier the president you re q geoff earle with daily mail it s been a while i think i heard you mention that with vladimir putin you had said you spoke about election interference privately as well did you give did you speak to him in a sterner tone did you tell him there the president no i just q would be serious consequences the president we talked about it hey we talked about it you know we ve talked about it before you know he denies it totally by the way just to i mean how many times can you get somebody to deny something but he has in the past denied it he s denied it also publicly but we talked about it we talked about a lot of other things i tell you we talked about something that i think is very important and that s putting a cap on what he s buying and we re buying from a nuclear standpoint and other arms control we talked a lot about arms control and i think he d like to see arms control and so would we i think it makes a lot of sense q what was the context in which you the president yeah go ahead q did you raise what was in the mueller report did you sort of articulate to him the president oh the mueller report was a very q that you thought that things inaudible the president good report i mean it was a good report i had 18 people that hated me i had mueller who was totally conflicted and obviously didn t like me we had he was totally conflicted and yet no obstruction no collusion and you know that was good report yes please q thank you mr president the president and you know the democrats want a do over or five they want to get it right they re working to get it right they want a do over or five yes please q edward szall with trunews president trump your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the deal of the century my question to you is why were no palestinians members of the white house peace plan committee the president well they are a very important part of it but they don t really have to be we re just getting started we have and as you know we have a very good david friedman a great gentleman one of the most successful lawyers in new york who loves israel david friedman jason greenblatt who worked for me and my company great great lawyer great talent jared kushner and with me being president if you don t get that deal done it will never happen we ll have to see what happens but i think the palestinians basically i m not sure i know they want to make a deal but they want to be a little bit cute and that s okay i fully understand where they re coming from as you know i ve ended the money to that was we were paying them 550 million a year and i ended that money because a year ago i heard they were saying nasty things i said wait a minute we re trying to make a deal we re trying to help them and they re saying these nasty things we re not going to pay now if a deal is made we would go back on a humanitarian basis not so different from the border because you see the problems and what s going on it s terrible but i think we have a very good chance of making a deal and a lot of people think that s probably the toughest deal of all and it may very well be the toughest deal of all a lot of people think it can t be made i mean over the years a lot of people would say that s a deal that can t be made no matter what but you know hey i like to we re going to try but i really believe that i went to other negotiators from past years for many many years they ve been trying to make this deal and i said did you ever take the money away because they were always very hostile and they said no we wouldn t do that that s inappropriate why is it inappropriate i mean they re saying bad things why is it inappropriate and what i ve done is said look as long if you re not negotiating and if you don t want to make peace we re not going to pay you so let s see what happens i think they want to make a deal and i ve had a very good relationship with some of their leaders and obviously i ve had a good relationship with israel now the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with bibi netanyahu s election they thought he won and then all of a sudden they couldn t put together the coalition and now they re back to campaigning again so that was something that came up that who would have expected that maybe something will happen faster but you know that s going to be going on for about three months there s a good chance we could there s a chance i don t want to even say good chance on that one because people say it s the hardest deal i ve heard when i was young i d say what do you think of this they d say oh that s tougher than israel and the palestinians making a deal they used to use that as like the metaphor they used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make so it s probably about the toughest deal to make i actually think that there s a good chance yes sir please go ahead yeah white shirt no the gentleman behind you yeah okay go ahead we ll get to you q thank you the president go ahead that s the man i m looking at q demetri sevastopulo financial times can i just ask first one clarification the president sure q are you saying you re taking huawei off the commerce department entity list the president no not at all no no we re going to be talking about huawei but we are going to be supplying equipment from our companies our companies make billions and billions of dollars worth of equipment but we are not discussing huawei with president xi yet i want to see before we start getting into that i want to see where we end up we have to we have a national security problem which to me is paramount very important q but are you taking huawei off the commerce department entity list the president we re talking about that we have a meeting on that tomorrow or tuesday q and my question is you talk a lot about the economic and the trade practices of china and you re very critical you don t talk so much about the national security concerns about china the president well that s not q what do you worry about china inaudible the president it goes without i think that goes without saying i mean look what i ve done look what who s done what i ve done i took zte off if you remember i was the one i did that that was a personal deal and then president xi called me and he asked me for a personal favor which i considered to be very important he s a leader of a major country and it was very important to him having to do with where the employees are located and his relationship to that area and it was 85 000 employees and they were almost out of business and he agreed to pay 1 2 billion penalty and some other things including a board change and including some management changes et cetera zte which is a you know much smaller than huawei but it s very big and they paid us a billion two 1 2 billion i mean part of the problem is then the democrats go out and say if i got 200 trillion they d say this was terrible what a terrible deal because that s the way politics is it s sort of sad but you know we got 1 2 billion and we closed it we opened it and we had certain changes made as you know they made changes to the board they changed the board they made management changes and they paid a lot of money and they also have to buy american product buying american product is very important to me it s a big it s a big thing q can i just ask you to clarify the president yeah go ahead blue blue shirt q stefan niemann with ard the president are we going to continue onward q yeah the president yes q yes the president does anybody say no huh q thank you stefan niemann with ard german television one question the president we just left angela q i know the president she s another friend of mine people don t think so q and you called her a fantastic woman the president we have a great relationship i hope you know that q yes we will not forget that the president we spent a lot of time together too q you praised this g20 summit as extremely successful yet it was a g19 against one summit if we look at climate change why is it that you still think ignoring the dangers of climate change is in the interest of the american inaudible the president i don t ignore it so we have the best numbers that we ve ever had recently and i m not looking to put our companies out of business i m not looking to create a standard that is so high that we re going to lose 20 25 percent of our production i m not willing to do that we have the cleanest water we ve ever had we have the cleanest air you saw the reports come out recently we have the cleanest air we ve ever had but i m not willing to sacrifice the tremendous power of what we ve built up over a long period of time and what i ve enhanced and revived i m not i m just not willing to do that and they understand where i stand and you know i m not necessarily sure i agree i can tell you i m not sure that i agree with certain countries what they re doing because i think they re losing a lot of the power of what they can do with factories and with and i m not talking about political power although that comes with it i m talking about the powering of a plant it doesn t always work with a windmill when the wind goes off the plant isn t working it doesn t always work with solar because solar is just not strong enough and a lot of them want to go to wind which has caused a lot of problems and you know the problem with wind is in the united states we re subsidizing these wind towers all over the place because wind doesn t work for the most part doesn t work without subsidy and i don t want to be subsidizing things that don t have to be subsidized the united states is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind i don t like it i don t like it i don t want to do that we ll take a few more go ahead go ahead q thank you sir two questions on iran please the president one q one question on iran laughter okay well iran the president pick the better one please q will do sir iran says that it will be on the verge of violating the threshold for uranium enrichment in the jcpoa as soon as potentially next week what will be your response when that happens the president you ll see q okay can i have a follow up the president that s all i can do that s all i can do no but that s all i can do q just the president i can only say you ll see we cannot let iran have a nuclear weapon just can t do it please q thank you mr president celia mendoza from voa latin america you met yesterday with president putin and in the readout it says that you touched the subject of venezuela the president yeah q but can you expand a little bit of what was said during the meeting about venezuela and also the president well first of all we re following venezuela very closely it s a catastrophe it s what socialism can do i use it all the time i mean it s what socialism can do it was one of the richest countries 20 years ago it s got among the largest oil reserves in the world and they don t have food they don t have water it s really actually incredible i discuss it with i ve discussed it with almost every leader this weekend we discuss venezuela because we don t ever want that to happen to us or their countries okay go ahead q you mentioned that change of regime takes time and then in venezuela it has proven the president oh sure it takes time q but do you think that it s a possibility the president the problem is so many people leaving venezuela it s like going to be a ghost town it s a very bad thing that s happening in venezuela nobody has seen anything quite like it actually especially from the standpoint that they were so wealthy they ve gone i know so many people from venezuela living in miami they re incredible people they re incredible incredible a lot of them live in doral miami it s they call it little venezuela i know them so well these are people that are hard workers warm they re just incredible and to see what s happening to venezuela is heartbreaking it s really heartbreaking q mr president do you think that it is a time for change the strategy and do you still believe that juan guaidó is the person to lead the country you have backed him up the president sure you have a lot of strategies i have five different strategies i could change any moment but in the meantime we re helping them from the standpoint of aid we re getting as much aid as we can i think they re making a big mistake because they re not making the aid very easy as you know you know they re not making it easy to get to people but people are starving to death and their water they have no water they have no water they have oil but they don t have any water no we have a lot of things in store if we have to do that we don t want to do anything but you know we don t want to get involved to the extent that you may be thinking but we have a lot of alternatives we have five different alternatives for venezuela and we ll see what happens it s doing very poorly and maduro is doing very poorly obviously it s not it s just not working just not working yes ma am go ahead q anita kumar with politico i just wanted to the president so from where are you q politico anita kumar politico i just wanted to follow up on the questions that were asked jim asked about the president question question question q question about the crown prince that you met with earlier today i didn t hear you answer the question did you raise the killing of jamal khashoggi with him the president i asked yes q and what was the response the president i asked him what was happening and he was telling me that i think he said 13 but could be more and i think he said more are in the works that there are large numbers of people being prosecuted he s very angry about it he s very unhappy about it and i did mention it to him very strongly and he answered very strongly but they re prosecuting large numbers of people that was a bad event okay q and sir the president yeah go ahead please q can i just follow up you mentioned you mentioned that the intelligence community you mentioned that no one had pointed the finger at him but actually the cia did the intelligence community the president i cannot comment on intelligence community i just i m not probably i guess i m allowed to do what i want to do in terms of that right we can declassify unlike hillary clinton she decided to just give it out we can declassify the truth is that i just don t want to talk about intelligence but i will say this a lot of people are being prosecuted and they re taking it very seriously over there and they ve done a great job in saudi arabia from the standpoint of women and from a lot of different things are happening in saudi arabia one of the other things very important with saudi arabia that not only are they an ally not only have they spent tremendous amounts of money coming into our country and they have been a good ally and they have actually bought tremendous amounts of military equipment that we use and that we re able to use but they re also very much now changed their ways as to financing terror which i can t say for a lot of other countries if you look at iran if you look at other countries in that area they re financing terror now it s harder for iran because iran doesn t have the money they used to have and they were given 150 billion they were given 1 8 billion in cash but saudi arabia has come a long way i ll tell you in terms of reform saudi arabia really has come a long way yeah please in the gold yeah you right q thank you very much mr president i m inaudible with china s inaudible media business news organization in china just a little bit of follow up on huawei you say you re going to discuss huawei s entity listing soon is it possible would you say it s a possibility that huawei is going to be removed from the list the president is it going to what q removed from the entity list is it possible the president i don t want to talk about it now i mean we re looking at that very carefully huawei is very much in play in terms of our country and in terms of intelligence and the intelligence community we know a lot about huawei but i don t want to mention that right now i just think it s inappropriate i will say that we re not making it other than what i told you already we re not making it a big subject we re going to save that for later q okay and another question on the big picture of u s china relations what do you think the u s and china should see each other are we strategic partners are we competitors are we enemies what are we the president no i think we re going to be strategic partners i think we can help each other i think in the end we can if the right deal is structured we can be great for each other if china would open up you re opening up a tremendous you know the largest market in the world and right now china is not open to the united states but we re open to china that should have never really been allowed to happen okay yes please q thank you mr president on russia are you planning to go to moscow next spring as president putin invited you the president yes q and do you agree with him that western style liberalism as has been defined over the post war period is now obsolete and no longer relevant to today s world the president well i haven t heard him say that but he did invite me to russia for the defeat of nazis that s a big thing defeat of nazis you know russia lost he said 25 million people i had actually heard 50 million people but he said yesterday that russia fighting the nazis they lost 25 million people you would know better than anybody peter but it was a tremendous you know they suffered greatly and they re having a 75th you could really say celebration of the defeat of the nazis and he invited me and i said i would give it very serious consideration that was a russia went through a lot they lost i guess far more than anybody fighting the nazis in terms of people and he did invite me and i said we would get back but we will give that very serious consideration okay thank you peter q his comments to the financial times right before arriving here was that western style liberalism is obsolete i know you probably haven t read the interview do you think that s true the president well again he may feel that way i mean he sees what s going on and i guess if you look at what s happening in los angeles where it s so sad to look and what s happening in san francisco and a couple of other cities which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people i don t know what they re thinking but he does see things that are happening in the united states that would would probably preclude him from saying how wonderful it is at the same time he congratulated me as every other every other leader of every country did for what we ve done economically because we probably have the strongest economy we ve ever had and that s a real positive but i m very embarrassed by what i see in some of our cities where the politicians are either afraid to do something about it or they think it s votes or i don t know what peter i don t know what they re thinking but when you look at los angeles when you look at san francisco when you look at some of the other cities and not a lot not a lot but you don t

the great recession as an economist prompting global commentators to commend the expansion of what was earlier a much smaller group of countries with large economies while coordinated action to rescue the world economy was the challenge ten years ago now it is mostly about issues on which a convergence of views is far more difficult still there are some issues that india is expected to push that could find listeners apart from a series of bilateral meetings with other countries india may also go ahead with a couple of trilaterals ric russia india china and jai japan america india on the sidelines of the g20 summit balancing relations appears to be the objective in a world turning too fractious for its own good neutrality could hold power osaka is an opportunity for india to promote

as our best president famously warned and as our worst president daily reminds us you can fool some of the people all of the time indeed donald trump has so mastered the art of the big lie that i doubt democrats will be able to evict him from the white house by trying to fool all of the people any of the time the better strategy will be to follow president abraham lincoln s advice and example and offer honesty integrity dignity and civility binding up the nation s wounds will require a candidate willing to level with the american people in that respect the debate this week among 20 democratic presidential candidates was something of a disappointment to be sure the two night free for all offered moments of anger passion and high drama and did a good job in identifying the serious contenders from the also rans and while there was no shortage of plans and proposals the democratic program that began to emerge contained far too many economic fairy tales let s begin with the candidates description of the economy in which all but the richest are described as working two or three jobs living paycheck to paycheck drowning in college loans and afraid to take their kids to the emergency room yes inequality is a problem and too many people are being left behind but this is also an economy where unemployment is low wages are rising 17 million new cars were sold last year and the reason the middle class is shrinking is that people are moving up as well as down bad diagnoses lead to bad prescriptions there s no better example of this than proposals for tuition free college and wiping out all student debt sen amy klobuchar and mayor pete buttigieg get credit for standing up to the progressive mob and pointing out how regressive it would be for lower income americans who do not have college degrees to help pay the tuitions of higher income americans who do but the bigger reason more children don t complete college isn t the cost it is that the k 12 public education system failed to prepare them which is where the real focus should be as a former denver schools superintendent sen michael bennet might have explained that if he had been given that opportunity and as successful businessmen andrew yang and john delaney might have noted the folly of giving universities and colleges an invitation to increase their costs once the federal government agreed to pick up the tab just because something ought to be a right does not mean it needs to be free and that is as true for health care as it is for a college education when something is free people tend to consume too much of it that is why a progressive tuition system with income based repayment of student loans makes sense for higher education and it is why a progressive and smartly designed system of deductibles and co pays make sense for health insurance there is no free lunch here you can either have patient cost sharing in an effort to reduce unnecessary care and reduce overall health spending or you have higher premiums and taxes whether public or private a smart health insurance plan is one that rewards people for living healthy lives while still providing care to those who get sick through no fault of their own the bigger problem with medicare for all is that the only way it works economically is for the government to dictate prices for medical care that are significantly lower than they are now at least for private insurance going that route however would not only lower the incomes of executives and profits of insurance and drug companies it would also lower the incomes of most doctors nurses and medical technicians to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars a year it would force the closure of hundreds of underutilized and inefficient hospitals along with underutilized and inefficient departments at the hospitals that remain that would lead to a temporary loss of millions of jobs for the people who work at those facilities in addition to those at the insurance companies and human resource departments in every company in america profits at hospitals drug companies medical device makers nursing homes and laboratories would almost surely be cut in half in the long run all of that would probably be an economic plus for most americans and give a competitive boost for the american economy but in the short and medium run it would involve a huge economic dislocation and a huge shift in income candidates pushing medicare for all need to acknowledge those realities rather than peddling the fantasy that the patient experience will remain unchanged and that the only losers will be greedy drug companies and insurers and then there is the green new deal with its promise of not only a saved planet but also millions of new jobs in a clean energy industry i m a little confused about economic math here as i understand it once the investments in research and development have been made and all the right incentives are put in place americans will somehow be consuming less energy producing it at a lower cost while at the same time generating more employment at higher wages sounds like voodoo economics to me recall that barack obama and hillary clinton lost political credibility talking out of both sides of their mouths when it came to climate change vowing to environmentalists that they would wage a war on coal while also denying to blue collar workers that they were doing any such thing as a matter of close approximation every job created by making installing and maintaining solar panels and windmills would be offset by a job lost in the oil gas and coal industries some democratic candidates are making the promise that american firms will dominate the world market and create millions of jobs by exporting our technology but that s a stretch for one thing the rest of the world isn t exactly sitting around waiting for our excellence indeed in some areas the chinese the japanese and the europeans are well ahead of us while in others they are likely to practice the same kind of protectionism to help domestic suppliers just as we do today the inconvenient truth is that industrial sized solar panels and windmills are so expensive to schlep around that they are more likely to be produced assembled and maintained close to where they are used american engineers might lead the way someday in designing and engineering the next generation of clean energy hardware and software but this will be tens of thousands of jobs not millions and they will be jobs for highly educated workers not high school graduates scraping mountaintops in montana refining oil in houston or drilling for gas in pennsylvania and all that money spent to pay americans to plant trees or improve soil conservation or sequester methane from cows and pigs is money that we are not spending to pay people to do something else no issue generated more outrage or more soaring rhetoric about our national values and character than immigration as far as i could tell the only candidate not willing to decriminalize crossing into the country illegally or deporting those who do was bennet who was never pressed on the point if the other 19 candidates weren t for open borders they managed to give a pretty good imitation of politicians who were and they seemed to have no trouble with the idea that there should be no limit to the number of refugees we should accept and provide with food shelter medical care transportation and education for their children until they can find jobs and begin supporting themselves while that may be the humane thing to do it is not without a significant economic cost at least for the first generation and as clinton and the leaders in england france germany and italy have discovered the political costs are even higher what i missed most in this first debate was a more serious debate about american capitalism former governor and brewpub entrepreneur john hickenlooper who earlier in the race embarrassed himself by refusing to call himself a capitalist tried to make up for that gaffe by distancing himself from socialism but only because of the political costs not the economic ones sen kirsten gillibrand at one point took pains to differentiate the kind of healthy capitalism democrats want from the greedy kind of capitalism epitomized by insurance and drug companies that puts profit over people how she might do that was never explored sen elizabeth warren drew applause with her line that the only industrial policy in the united states was to let giant corporations do whatever they want she reprised her call for breaking up tech giants big banks and other monopolies saying it is not a matter of passing new laws but simply having the courage to enforce the ones we already have it was unfortunate that klobuchar did not have the chance to set her straight and explain that it has been decades of rulings by conservative or timid judges that have hollowed out the antitrust enforcement to the point that it will now take legislation to stop the megamergers and adapt the law to a high tech economy prone to winner take all competition since all of the democrats seem to favor raising taxes on the wealthy and big corporations the moderators at one point asked all the candidates to declare whether they would be willing to raise taxes on the middle class to help fund their ambitious agendas i would have thought at least one of the candidates would have taken the opportunity to deliver an impassioned defense of government and its role in improving lives and creating an economy that is both prosperous and fair in short a government that middle class people would be willing to pay a bit more for through higher taxes none however was clever or courageous enough to do so instead they all ducked the question

obama and hillary clinton lost political credibility talking out of both sides of their mouths when it came to climate change vowing to environmentalists that they would wage a war on coal while also denying to blue collar workers that they were doing any such thing as a matter of close approximation every job created by making installing and maintaining solar panels and windmills would be offset by a job lost in the oil gas and coal industries some democratic candidates are making the promise that american firms will dominate the world market and create millions of jobs by exporting our technology but that s a stretch for one thing the rest of the world isn t exactly sitting around waiting for our excellence indeed in some areas the chinese the japanese and the europeans are well ahead of us while in others they are likely to practice the same kind of protectionism to help domestic suppliers just as we do today the inconvenient truth is that industrial sized solar panels and windmills are so expensive to schlep around that they are more likely to be produced assembled and maintained close to where they are used american engineers might lead the way someday in designing and engineering the next generation of clean energy hardware and software but this will be tens of thousands of jobs not millions and they will be jobs for highly educated workers not high school graduates scraping mountaintops in montana refining oil in houston or drilling for gas in pennsylvania and all that money spent to pay americans to plant trees or improve soil conservation or sequester methane from cows and pigs is money that we are not spending to pay people to do something else no issue generated more outrage or more soaring rhetoric about our national values and character than immigration as far as i could tell the only candidate not willing to decriminalize crossing into the country illegally or deporting those who do was bennet who was never pressed on the point if the other 19 candidates weren t for open borders they managed to give a pretty good imitation of politicians who were and they seemed to have no trouble with the idea that there should be no limit to the number of refugees we should accept and provide with food shelter medical care transportation and education for their children until they can find jobs and begin supporting themselves while that may be the humane thing to do it is not without a significant economic cost at least for the first generation and as clinton and the leaders in england france germany and italy have discovered the political costs are even higher what i missed most in this first debate was a more serious debate about american capitalism former governor and brewpub entrepreneur john hickenlooper who earlier in the race embarrassed himself by refusing to call himself a capitalist tried to make up for that gaffe by distancing himself from socialism but only because of the political costs not the economic ones sen kirsten gillibrand at one point took pains to differentiate the kind of healthy capitalism democrats want from the greedy kind of capitalism epitomized by insurance and drug companies that puts profit over people how she might do that was never explored sen elizabeth warren drew applause with her line that the only industrial policy in the united states was to let giant corporations do whatever they want she reprised her call for breaking up tech giants big banks and other monopolies saying it is not a matter of passing new laws but simply having the courage to enforce the ones we already have it was unfortunate that klobuchar did not have the chance to set her straight and explain that it has been decades of rulings by conservative or timid judges that have hollowed out the antitrust enforcement to the point that it will now take legislation to stop the megamergers and adapt the law to a high tech economy prone to winner take all competition since all of the democrats seem to favor raising taxes on the wealthy and big corporations the moderators at one point asked all the candidates to declare whether they would be willing to raise taxes on the middle class to help fund their ambitious agendas i would have thought at least one of the candidates would have taken the opportunity to deliver an impassioned defense of government and its role in improving lives and creating an economy that is both prosperous and fair in short a government that middle class people would be willing to pay a bit more for through higher taxes none however was clever or courageous enough to do so instead they all ducked the question
havana the cuban government said thursday that it is raising state salaries as part of a broader package of economic reforms but it revealed no details of its larger plan beyond increasing worker compensation a salary increase has long been seen as one of the first steps in the unification of cuba s unique dual currency system a process that could be a risky gambit in the face of an economic crisis exacerbated by tightened u s sanctions for the last quarter century cubans have used one peso worth about four cents and another worth nearly a dollar the stronger peso was introduced as a replacement for the dollars traded on the black market during the island s post soviet economic crisis in the 1990s over time the two currencies have come to be used by the communist government to set extremely low prices for goods and services considered basic rights and extremely high prices for others considered luxuries creating distortions that cripple economic growth cuban officials said díaz canel presided over an important meeting of the country s governing council of ministers on june 21 although they did not specify the agenda of the meeting the collapse of venezuela s economy has led to a cut in aid to cuba and sharp slowdown worsened by a series of trump administration measures designed to cut off funding to the island s government a meeting of the council of ministers approved economic measures to overcome the current situation and an increase in the state sector díaz canel wrote on twitter thursday evening he said details would be announced on state television at 8 p m when a state run newspaper tweeted that a wide ranging salary reform had been approved the president quickly responded that this is an incremental salary increase next comes the reform the announcement read on state television said that the minimum salary would be nearly 17 a month while the average salary would increase from 32 to 44 there were also slight rises in state pensions the announcement made repeated references to a variety of measures approved by the council of ministers but said only that in coming days our population will receive more detailed information about the extent of the reforms through various media arturo lopez levy a visiting assistant professor of political science at gustavus adolphus college in minnesota called the announcement a timid start to salary reform he said it could be part of an attempt to create more autonomy and incentives for increased production at state run enterprises whose operations have long been dictated by the central government it could cushion a future monetary unification but it won t really facilitate that by itself he said it helps nothing more under cuba s byzantine pricing system an average water bill denominated in cuban pesos will be a few dollars for example while home internet billed in the stronger convertible peso can cost hundreds of dollars a month while the average cuban must trade 24 or 25 cuban pesos for a convertible one many state run enterprises can obtain a convertible peso for 10 cuban pesos or even one peso a privilege that effectively subsidizes the state sector by many hundreds of millions of dollars a year every cuban has the right to a salary increase said dariel tejeda a 28 year old tour guide the country and all the state workers have needed this for a long time ending the dual currency system is expected to lead to the eventual removal of subsidies and bankruptcy of dozens even hundreds of state enterprises and the loss of many thousands of public sector jobs with lower or no subsidies state companies would be forced to raise prices for that reason a state salary increase has long been seen as a key precursor to monetary unification in cuba follow nbc latino on facebook twitter and instagram

despite his sweater vests and carefully cultivated demeanor sen chuck grassley r iowa has more in common with president trump than is generally appreciated grassley is willing to adopt and broadcast a self evident big lie as he did when he promoted the death panels smear of the affordable care act he is unwilling to apologize when caught out as again was the case in the aca debate and he is a bully unlike trump however grassley chooses his targets judiciously by aiming at those who are least able to defend themselves including congressional staffers grassley s bullying is on full display in his attack on the reliability of the congressional research service s recent in depth analysis of the 2017 tax act s supply side economic effects that is the impact on business investment and economic growth in particular the tax act is usually referred to as the tcja in a june 21 letter grassley demanded a meeting with the crs director to discuss the tone and substance of the crs report the crs report s authors crime was to write a careful 23 page economic analysis complete with numerous original charts and 49 footnotes referencing other work designed to offer a preliminary analysis of the effects of the tcja on the economy including its supply side consequences the supply side narrative in turn is the ideological pole star of the republican party and its principal justification for business tax cuts consistent with other analyses the crs found little if any evidence at this early stage of a strong positive economic impact directly attributable to the tcja there is only one full calendar year of post tcja data in the books and for this reason the crs properly labeled its analysis preliminary the crs is a nonpartisan research organization that supports the work of congress here congress adopted tax legislation that slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent further liberalized tax benefits for investment and permitted the repatriation of some 2 4 trillion of offshore investments all at a projected revenue cost to the treasury department according to the crs s sister organization the congressional budget office of roughly 1 9 trillion over the next 10 years including additional interest on the national debt and taking into account the tcja s projected economic growth effects what could be more urgent than to ask the hard question what have we really bought for this nearly 2 trillion in additional national debt adopting the trumpian people are saying rhetorical device grassley wrote in his letter that i have received comments from others who believe that the crs observations are not entirely nonpartisan in tone or objective it turns out that those others include the white house and the treasury department which wrote to grassley laying out its objections and implicitly egging him on treasury s core argument was that president trump had such a proven political track record when he took office that businesses already had anticipated the tax benefits of the tcja in january 2017 so that looking at 2018 figures alone was unfair of course that the tcja came together in a few weeks in late 2017 with almost no input from the administration should not cloud that story treasury s comments relied on growth in aggregates such as gdp but these tell you nothing about how much tax law changes contributed to those aggregates the whole purpose of the crs report was to disaggregate the data to tease out the role of the tcja as opposed for example to the large fiscal stimulus generated by increased government spending in 2018 grassley plainly intends to pressure the crs to withdraw the report since its conclusions are anathema to the supply side credo there is unfortunate precedent for exactly this strategy in 2012 another crs analyst wrote a report finding that reductions in top tax rates appeared to be uncorrelated with saving investment and productivity growth over a retrospective period spanning many decades but that there was a strong correlation between lower top tax rates and increasing income concentration at the top republican members of congress raised a stink and forced crs management to withdraw the report over the objections of the leadership of the crs economics division other former staffers have written about the environment of fear in which crs analysts now operate thanks to member interventions and the attendant fear of draconian budget cuts whenever the crs produces original analysis that contradicts a member s vested interest to put the crs s conclusions into context let s focus on the early 2018 jump in business investment business investment is volatile and dramatically influenced by larger economic trends as when an uptick in oil and gas development leads to a surge of investment in the necessary equipment but it is the very heart of the supply side tax story crs s conclusions that the tcja did not significantly raise the trendline of business investment are broadly similar to those reached in an important march 2019 working paper by the international monetary fund which concluded that the overriding factor driving has been the strength of expected aggregate demand investment has so far fallen short of predictions based on the postwar relation with tax cuts crs s analysis here is echoed by the work of its colleagues at the cbo in its january 2019 annual budget and economic outlook the cbo wrote in cbo s projections growth in business fixed investment slows markedly after 2018 from 6 8 percent in 2018 to 3 2 percent in 2019 and to an average of 1 7 percent per year between 2020 and 2023 as most of the effect of the factors boosting growth in 2018 wanes in other words business investment may for example have been deferred from late 2017 into 2018 to take advantage of the new tax rules although many other factors also affected these aggregates but the cbo joins crs in being skeptical that the tcja has lifted business investment to a whole new level more directly if sen grassley were genuinely interested in the supply side implications of the tcja he could simply have asked his friends at the national association of business economics he would have learned that in their january 2019 survey of members 84 percent reported that the tcja had no effect on their business investment planning finally grassley s letter questions the crs analysis by suggesting that it is out of step with the work of the crs s sister agencies the cbo and the staff of the joint committee on taxation in light of the conclusions on business investment just summarized that is a truly peculiar claim more generally both the cbo and jct staff made projections at the time the tax law was enacted and cbo in particular elaborated on those projections in its april 2018 and january 2019 annual budget and economic outlooks but the simple fact is that neither cbo nor jct has undertaken a retrospective empirical analysis of the measurable impact of the tcja sen grassley s agenda is plain to follow the 2012 playbook and force crs to withdraw this report his motivation is equaly plain and is identical to that underlying the ugly 2012 incident the supply side story remains at the heart of the republican credo no matter how many tax cuts may have preceeded this one and all research that comes to a contrary conclusion must be eliminated edward kleinbard is a professor of law at the university of southern california s gould school of law and the author of we are better than this how government should spend our money

viewpoints letters opinions governor s vetos by rodney dial june 29 2019 saturday am so the governor has announced his vetoes cutting 444 million from the budget assuming these cuts stand just about everyone will feel some pain and it will have an impact on local taxes let s consider for a moment why these cuts were made first if you want someone to blame for this you should start with the legislators who have had nearly 6 years to address this problem and failed to do so if you are one of the few that believe that total state spending has been reduced by any real amount then they have successfully mislead you i worked in the legislature for a decade and i have watched them pull the following tricks over the last several years consistently compare the current budget for each of the last several years against the fy15 budget to show how much they have cut want to know why because that was the year former gov parnell paid off 3 billion in state retirement liability he didn t increase the cost to operate government he paid down a multi billion dollar debt but it makes the budget larger for that year by doing so he saved over 500 million annually in state pension payments meaning that they falsely imply that government spending was far greater then while ignoring that had parnell not taken this action our budget situation would be far worse now difference 3 billion most of what the legislature is calling cuts are simply spending deferrals the main ones being the capital budget and the oil tax credits unless you believe that most capital projects are non essential then the money will be expended at some point they just pushed off spending to future years to give the appearance of cuts and we all know the capital budget will increase again regarding the oil tax credits gov walker vetoed about 1 billion in credits that must be paid this is the functional equivalent of deciding not to pay your credit card still has to be paid and is not a cut although they called it one difference hundreds of millions annually for capital budget about 1 billion for oil tax credits another trick is when the legislature under funds departments and calls it a cut knowing they will simply make up the difference the following session a recent example is when the democratic house majority in the fy18 budget under funded medicaid and other departments to make it appear as a cut they simply passed a supplemental budget the following legislative session for nearly 100 million extra but of course that amount wasn t included in the fy18 budget total 114 million request for fy18 last fall as gov walker left office he put forward his supplemental budget requesting another 178 million in spending to cover other under funded departments the legislature moves spending between accounts e g ugf to dgf to appear that spending is reduced varies the legislature depleted reserve accounts to make it appear that spending was reduced they did this with the amhs reserve fund that contained millions used as a cushion for the system to deal with variations in fuel prices repairs etc once again not a cut just the appearance of one by depleting reserves tens of millions these are just a few of the smoke and mirror gimmicks employed to make you think they made major spending reductions in truth some things were cut and some things were increased but most of what they claim as cuts are simply budget deferrals and reductions to the projected increases last year an election year total state spending increased by over ½ billion you can go to the state website and see for yourself consider this for a moment your pfd would be about 3000 now if they followed the formula your pfd last year the first year legislation allowed the use of pfd earnings for government was 1600 your pfd this year with the budget the legislature presented to the governor would be about 800 notice the trend because if you don t you are failing to understand the message gov dunleavy is telling you which is state spending is unsustainable if state spending is going down why is your dividend getting smaller the growth of state spending if not corrected will first completely consume your entire pfd then when that is gone they will impose income taxes pass more costs to local governments local tax increases etc and finally when the pfd is gone and taxes can not be raised without diminishing returns then they will be forced to cut an even greater amount than is being cut now that is what unsustainable will lead to guaranteed let me be clear i don t mind part of my pfd being used to fund government if government spending is sustainable if it s not sustainable we could lose our entire pfd and it will only buy us a few years we are too large of a state with too small of a working population with too few paying to tax our way out of this a few thoughts the last version of gov walker s income tax proposal payroll tax would have brought in after expenses roughly 350 million the amount the legislature increased total state spending last year was over 500 million and that is not including the deficit alaska has 0 billionaires and less than 1000 households earning a million or more per year to tax the legislature estimated the number of new state employees required to administer a state income tax as between 60 120 an income tax would not cover a single year of growth in state spending and not even touch the deficit an income tax is not the answer at current oil prices we can not raise oil taxes without depressing the industry and realizing diminishing tax returns you couldn t mail a pair of shoes from prudhoe to valdez via ups for less than what a barrel of oil is selling for today stop believing the anti oil propaganda it s not the tax rate that is the problem it the selling price of oil and the quantity produced only about 320 thousand jobs in alaska varies by season and only 260 thousand alaskans who work many have more than one job the number of working alaskans is about the same as the population of spokane washington alaska is the only state in the union that allows citizens in roughly ½ of the land mass unorganized boroughs to pay no taxes and receive basic services for free if that were not bad enough the state actually pays millions each year to those communities to administer the free services they receive additionally many of the communities in these areas about 150 citizens are allowed to collect welfare for life the remainder of the country has a 5 year lifetime welfare limit under federal law 30 percent of alaskans 219 734 are on state medicaid under gov walker s medicaid expansion enrollee population has grown by 49 719 the expanded group are able bodied adults of working age without children or disabled dependents medicaid expansion has also resulted in a dramatic increase in health care costs in alaska as medicaid does not pay the full cost of treatment resulting in the difference being passed on to insured alaskans in the form of higher costs a local example would be ketchikan teachers health care costs are up 19 this year and that cost will be paid by ketchikan taxpayers just about everyone in ktown has an example of being charged an astronomical amount for local health care medicaid now costs 10 649 per enrollee and per the state is projected to increase by 125 million per year one of gov dunleavy s vetoes is trying to rein in this out of control program by ending one of the optional parts of medicaid dental coverage think about it if you are working or retired you pay a premium for dental care yet the current state medicaid system literally will pay to fly people from the farthest reaches of the state to a hub like anchorage pay cab and hotel costs and sometimes a family escort for a dental cleaning it s insane the other main expense is education and we could easily save millions by simply requiring all areas of the state to form organized boroughs or pay an unincorporated area service tax to help fund education consider that the organized ketchikan borough has one school district the largely unorganized island of prince of wales has five school districts the unorganized area of pelican has its own superintendent for a grand total of 8 students their school built maintained and operated for free the citizens pay no school taxes but we pay lots of taxes for our schools in ketchikan millions per year in fact your entire borough property tax bill goes to education it s a manditory state tax called a required local contribution rlc but only imposed on the ½ of alaska that is organized like ketchikan my complaint is not that we pay it but that only ½ of the state is required to pay it why should the owner of a million dollar house on pow be allowed to pay no tax but a person in poverty in ketchikan be required by the state to pay or face government seizure of their home the aforementioned items and tax disparity across alaska is the main reason state spending is double the national average and why we are facing this massive deficit and now you know probably the most closely guarded secret of alaska government ½ the state pays for basic services ½ doesn t ½ pay a mandatory school tax and ½ don t nearly ½ the communities in the state get lifetime welfare universal income and many other things subsidized ½ don t consider what would happen if the state of california was divided in the middle the more populous south required to pay taxes and for many of their services while the north would pay no taxes and get basic services for free how long do you think california would last before bankruptcy probably not long considering they can barely pay their bills now yet that is exactly what alaska has been doing for decades our fiscal day of reckoning has arrived ½ the state simply can t pay all the bills i ve been saying for years that the deficit plan would eventually result in those paying taxes now to pay more so that those paying nothing can continue to pay nothing my biggest problem with the governor s reductions is that they unfairly target the organized boroughs like ketchikan the ½ of the state that gets their schools built for free could care less about the veto reduction of school bond debt reimbursement because they have no debt quite frankly if the governor wants to discriminate against the organized boroughs like ketchikan that were forced by the state to organize then we may need to look at suing the state again i can accept shared sacrifice governor but not discrimination the school bond debt cut is discrimination just exactly what cuts did the reaas unorganized borough school districts get in your vetoes governor because it looks like to me they are still getting everything for free i can only hope that rep ortiz will finally start to listen to the city council borough assembly and school board who have sent him resolution after resolution for years pleading with him to stand up for us and demand an end to discriminatory taxation and assure the fair treatment of our island had the legislature spent the last five years actually giving alaska a sustainable budget and imposing a shared approach by equal taxation the governors cuts would not have been necessary today and your pfd protected the legislature failed us any other person as governor would have had to make a the same decision dunleavy did watch the dividend go away and taxes to spiral out of control or reduce spending to a sustainable level and maintain a pfd just my thoughts as a private

hong kong cnn business hong kong has long been a conduit between china and global business and finance now that unique status could be under threat from the gradual erosion of political freedoms the annual march to mark the anniversary of britain handing hong kong back to china is expected to draw huge numbers on monday it follows weeks of mass protests against a controversial extradition law that has now been shelved the turmoil has exacerbated worries among hong kong businesses and international executives about the threat to the rule of law and freedom of expression the credibility of hong kong is now on the line tara joseph president of the american chamber of commerce said earlier this month the events have also raised new questions about how china views hong kong does beijing still need the city and if so will it back away from confrontation that could drive business and investors away for multinationals the appeal of hong kong has been the security offered by its semi autonomous status s3studio getty images by some measures hong kong is much less important to china than it was in 1997 the year it was handed back by the british back then hong kong s gdp was about 20 of the size of the mainland economy according to the world bank it has shrunk to about 3 today the relative contraction has coincided with the rise of cities like shanghai and shenzhen in china and the gradual development of financial markets on the mainland hong kong however continues to play a crucial role in the development for china according to zhiwu chen finance professor with hong kong university years ago there was a lot of talk about shanghai taking over hong kong as the global financial center in asia that hasn t happened yet if anything over the last few years there s been a reversal with hong kong playing a bigger and more visible role in finance and other service sectors chen said hong kong has played a pivotal role in the opening up of china s markets by establishing connections with stock markets in shanghai in 2014 and shenzhen in 2016 those links allow international investors to trade shares in both markets through brokers licensed by the hong kong stock exchange they also give chinese investors a way to trade hong kong stocks beyond those programs hong kong continues to be an attractive place for chinese companies to find new sources of funds last year chinese companies raised nearly 35 billion through initial public offerings in hong kong versus about 21 billion on mainland exchanges according to dealogic chinese tech giant alibaba baba which went public in the world s biggest ever ipo in new york in 2014 is now mulling a 20 billion secondary listing in hong kong rather than shanghai or shenzhen that fact alone is very telling by itself already said chen in the next two decades china is expected to invest trillions of dollars globally and hong kong will play a more important role than ever charles li ceo of the hong kong stock exchange wrote in a blog post in 2017 commemorating the 20 year anniversary of the city s handover to china hong kong was in the best position to become china s global wealth management center helping rich chinese invest abroad and diversity their portfolios and would likely become a place where the price of the chinese yuan which is still not fully convertible could be reliably determined according to li china does not have the best reputation on the international stage right now it has been accused of violating international trade norms and taking other liberties that helped its economy become the world s second largest some international companies have accused beijing of stealing their intellectual property and business groups have frequently complained about restricted access to china s vast market the great china market that was promised it turns out not to be so attractive to a number of foreign brands so you can t write off hong kong said philippe le corre senior fellow at the harvard kennedy school but le corre is less optimistic about hong kong s long term prospects saying the city s power as a financial hub was diluted when china included it in a plan to create a megalopolis with eight other chinese cities and macau the so called greater bay area is a region beijing hopes will grow to rival san francisco new york and tokyo in terms of technological innovation and economic success the official narrative is that greater regional integration will drive economic growth opponents see the region and the bridges and roads built to connect the cities as a way for beijing to force assimilation and exert control for hong kong that represents a slow death le corre said

it was one of the greatest waves of democratization ever in 1977 all but three of the 20 countries in latin america were dictatorships of one kind or another by 1990 only mexico s civilian one party state and communist cuba survived several things lay behind the rise of democracy in the region one was the waning of the cold war another was the economic failure of most of the dictators and democracy was contagious one country after another in latin america put down democratic roots as power changed hands between right and left through free elections advertisement the outlook is suddenly much darker nicolás maduro in venezuela like daniel ortega in nicaragua is an originally elected autocrat ruling as a dictator he clings to power with the support of cuba at the cost of wrecking his country and destabilizing its neighbors at least 3 7 million venezuelans have fled economic collapse and repression organized crime and colombian guerrillas flourish there the repressive family despotism into which nicaragua has degenerated under ortega and his wife rosario murillo is almost as nasty these autocratic extremes would be less worrying were not elections across the region showing that there are clear signs of disenchantment with democracy elsewhere election rules are sometimes flouted and independent institutions undermined many voters are turning to populists with little commitment to restraints on power parties of the moderate center are weakening or collapsing immoderate urges an election marked by fraud in honduras saw juan orlando hernández the conservative president win a constitutionally dubious second term in 2017 in guatemala which will hold elections in june the president recently ordered out a un investigative body into organized crime and corruption which had helped to jail two of his predecessors evo morales a leftist who has been bolivia s president since 2006 will seek a fourth term in october also on dodgy constitutional grounds in the same month cristina fernández de kirchner a populist former president of argentina who abused institutions in partisan fashion and faces corruption charges stands a chance of being returned to office and then there are latin america s two giants brazil and mexico both have elected presidents who share a populist disregard for the norms checks and balances and toleration of critics that are necessary for lasting democracy the threat is more obvious in brazil jair bolsonaro an army captain turned far right politician took over on january 1st a seven term congressman bolsonaro is a political insider in brazil but one nostalgic for military rule eight generals sit in his 22 strong cabinet and scores more officers occupy second and third tier posts democracy and freedom only exist when the armed forces want them to he said in a speech in march at a military ceremony this will be news to costa rica its decision to abolish its army in 1948 is widely regarded as having helped it stay free he even ordered the armed forces to commemorate a military coup in 1964 which he calls a revolution evidence is emerging that appears to show ties between bolsonaro s family and paramilitary militias that operate in the favelas of rio de janeiro andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo a veteran populist of the left known as amlo has struck a more moderate tone in his first five months in office mexicans overwhelmingly approve of his promises to sweep away corruption and crime as well as his modest way of life he sits in economy on commercial flights around the country but there are warning signs amlo is not a fan of independent centers of power he has named his own co ordinators to supervise elected state governors cut the salaries of judges and civil servants named ill qualified allies to regulatory bodies and stopped giving public funds to ngos he has also shown deference to the armed forces placing them in charge of a new national guard a paramilitary police force despite the objection of the senate a proposed bill to pack the supreme court would end its independence in march the tax agency threatened the owner of reforma a critical newspaper with a tax investigation over the seemingly trivial matter of owing 12 000 pesos around us 630 from 2015 these steps though some are small scale all come from the populist handbook of disqualifying and intimidating opponents building a political clientele and what steven levitsky and daniel ziblatt of harvard university have called capturing the referees of democracy the measures also hint at a return to what enrique krauze a historian calls mexico s imperial presidency of past one party rule not all of the region is under threat chile and uruguay among others still enjoy stable democracy and most governments remain committed to that goal the region s people are not so sure in 2018 latinobarómetro a multi country poll found that only 48 of respondents saw themselves as convinced democrats down from 61 in 2010 just 24 pronounced themselves satisfied with democracy in their country down from 44 in 2010 see chart 1 how did democracy fall into such disrepute how great is the threat to it and how can democrats fight back the warning signs were clear take eldorado a sprawling suburb of são paulo in brazil s boom of 2005 13 it had hopes of becoming solidly middle class a year ago as the country s election campaign got underway people in eldorado were fed up with rising crime unemployment and a sense of official neglect when we go out we don t know whether we will return alive lamented cleber souza the president of sítio joaninha a former favela in what had been a stronghold of the left wing workers party pt several people said they would consider voting for mr bolsonaro he s a cry for justice from the society said anderson carignano the owner of a large diy shop people want a return to order behind the discontent lies a toxic cocktail of crime corruption poor public services and economic stagnation with only 8 of the world s population latin america suffers a third of its murders in many countries the rule of law remains weak in the 1980s many of the new democratic governments inherited economies bankrupted by debt financed statist protectionism the adoption of market reforms known as the washington consensus provided a modest boost to growth the democratic governments gradually expanded social provision after the turn of the century many economies benefited from a surge in exports of minerals oil and foodstuffs thanks to the vast demand from china poverty fell dramatically while income inequality declined steadily carnival s over the end of the commodity boom has brought a sharp correction taken as a whole the region s economies expanded at an average annual rate of 4 1 between 2003 and 2012 since 2013 that figure has shrunk to only 1 taking income per head with it see chart 2 some countries mainly on the pacific seaboard have done better others have done much worse brazil is barely recovering from a deep recession in 2015 16 argentina is stuck in a long term pattern of economic stop go mexico has grown by only 2 annually for decades the underlying causes include low productivity rigid regulation a lack of incentives for small companies to expand or become more efficient and corrupt political structures benefiting from the status quo for a time an expanding labor force saw the region grow despite the problems that demographic bonus is now mostly spent in many countries the working age population will start shrinking in the 2020s as economies have faltered poverty has edged up and the decline in income inequality has slowed this has exacerbated an existing crisis of political representation against this bleak landscape the worldwide ills of democracy have taken an acute form in latin america there s a kind of repudiation of the whole political class says fernando henrique cardoso a sociologist and former brazilian president political structures don t correspond any more to the moment societies are living in he adds that is partly a result of the digital communications revolution in which social media have bypassed intermediaries political traditions also play a role latin america has a long history of caudillos and populists sometimes embodied in the same person such as argentina s juan perón the strongman tradition stemmed from long and bloody wars of independence two centuries ago and from the difficulties of governing large territories often with challenging terrains and ethnically diverse populations many countries were rich in natural resources latin american societies partly because of the legacies of colonialism and slavery were long scarred by extreme income inequality that combination of natural wealth and inequality bred resentments that populists exploited but there is another political tradition in the region one of middle class democratic reformism honed in the long struggle to turn the constitutionalism present at the birth of latin american republics into a lasting reality in various guises this political current was in the ascendant in many countries for much of the past 40 years now the integrity and competence of the politicians that embodied it have been called into question voters abandoned such dominant parties as brazil s pt and mexico s institutional revolutionary party because they were hypocritical in talking of the public interest while being inward looking self serving and corrupt says laurence whitehead of oxford university corruption usually diminishes as countries get richer yet latin american politics seem for a mainly middle income region unusually grubby the region s states are marked by heavy handed regulatory overkill mixed in practice with wide discretionary power for officials the commodity boom meant more resources flowing into state coffers and thus more money for politicians to steal the investigation known as lava jato car wash originating in brazil into bribery by odebrecht and other construction companies across latin america has exposed the scale of the corruption to the public leading to a widespread perception that the region s entire political class is corrupt in fact the investigations are a sign of overdue change the traditional impunity of the powerful in latin america has been challenged by independent judiciaries and investigative journalism both a product of democracy brazil has seen scores of politicians convicted on charges of corruption in peru four former presidents have been under investigation one of them alan garcía committed suicide last month as police arrived at his house in lima to jail him for alleged corruption off centre ironically populists have been relatively untouched by scandal either because they control the judiciary and the media or because a halo of the savior of the people surrounds them it is often centrist parties that pay the political price that is partly because they have struggled to practice good government the reformist zeal of the early years of the democratic wave has fallen victim to two recent tendencies in politics fragmentation and polarisation brazil s new congress contains 30 parties up from five in 1982 the 130 seats in peru s single chamber parliament are divided among 11 groupings in colombia s parliament once dominated by liberals and conservatives there are now 16 parties even chile s stable system is starting to splinter one reason is latin america s unique and awkward combination of directly elected presidencies and legislatures chosen by proportional representation party switching carries a low cost in some countries politics has become a way of making money or a brazen means to promote private business interests in peru for example such interests often buy their way into parties undermining party solidity and the representative character of the country s democracy according to alberto vergara a political scientist at lima s pacifico university another factor is that the old left right divide is no longer the only cleavage evangelical conservatives are pushing back against liberal secularism on issues such as abortion and gay rights in costa rica which had a two party system until the turn of the century an evangelical christian gospel singer of little previous political experience made it to a run off presidential election last year though he lost as a consequence of fragmentation governments often lack the majorities required to push through unpopular but necessary reforms recent elections have seen a swing to the right in south america and to the left in mexico and central america in both cases that has involved the alternation of power that is normal in democracies but the switch has been accompanied by extreme political polarisation that has been both cause and consequence of the collapse of the moderate reformist center and it risks making politics more unstable yet there are some grounds for optimism latin american democracy is more resilient than outward appearances might suggest opinion polls suggest that only around a fifth to a quarter of latin americans might welcome authoritarian government in some countries checks and balances provide safeguards in brazil for example mr bolsonaro s government is a ramshackle assortment of generals economic liberals and social conservatives bolsonaro isn t a party he isn t anything he s a momentary mood thinks mr cardoso who trusts in the countervailing strength of the legislature a free media and social organizations you have to be forever vigilant but i don t think the institutions here are going to embark on an authoritarian line in mexico where opposition to amlo is weak and checks and balances on executive power are only incipient there may be greater cause for concern but the president s popularity may decline as the economy weakens and the center is not dead everywhere amid the dust from the collapse of old party systems there are glimpses of democratic renewal led by a new generation of activists there s an ecosystem of new politics in brazil explains eduardo mufarej an investment banker who has set up renova a privately funded foundation to train young democratic leaders in politics ethics and policy in the 2018 elections 120 of renova s graduates ran for 22 different parties ten were elected to the federal congress and seven to state legislatures they are trying to convince the public that not all politicians are self serving one was tabata amaral a 25 year old activist for better public education elected as a federal deputy for são paulo she mobilised 5 000 volunteers through social media her campaign cost 1 25m reais 320 000 raised through individual donations to cut costs she has teamed up with two other renova graduates in different parties to share congressional staff her first brush with the old order was to find that the apartment assigned to her in brasília by the congress was illegally occupied by the son of a long standing legislator who refused to move julio guzmán tried to run for president in peru in 2016 he was thwarted when the electoral authority barred his candidacy on a technicality he has spent the time since traveling around the country building a new centrist party he insists that he is engaged in a different way of doing politics in which all members are scrutinized and donations will be made public his morado party is aimed at the new peruvian who looks to the future is entrepreneurial and from the emerging middle classes poles apart polarization in colombia s election last year led to a run off between iván duque the conservative victor and gustavo petro a leftist who until recently was a fan of venezuela s hugo chávez but there too is a demand for a new politics thinks claudia lópez the vice presidential candidate of the centrist green party which narrowly failed to make the run off the task she says is to restore the trust of citizens in politicians that partly involves competing in the emotional terrain occupied by populists but it also means a different approach nobody is interested in being a member of a hierarchical political organization anymore she says those of us in parties have to adapt to citizen causes or we re dead these are green shoots in a forest of dead wood but they are a sign of the dynamism of latin american societies democracy s greatest asset latin america remains the third most democratic region in the world according to the democracy index compiled by the economist intelligence unit the past four decades have created a culture of citizen rights and political participation but democracy s defenses in latin america are relatively frail as venezuela shows all the evidence is that citizens want a new political order in which politicians are more concerned with public services security and the rule of law rather than lining their pockets

by zhang haiyuan china daily updated 2019 06 29 09 31 what affects argentina most is the trade dispute between the united states and china which has had a very strong impact on the grain markets and on the price of soybeans in chicago mercantile exchange the united states has adopted unilateral and trade protectionist measures in violation of established international trade rules and launched a trade war against china and triggered trade disputes with other economies including the european union canada and mexico the us trade protectionist moves are seriously undermining international trade and the world economy and disrupting the global supply and industrial value chains destabilizing the global resource distribution system and harming multinational companies productivity the us protectionist measures have not only intensified trade fictions but also fanned anti globalization passions in several countries true the trade war is hurting chinese enterprises but it is also hurting american enterprises and consumers and the global economy the us moves have also created serious challenges for the sustainable development of international trade and investment according to the international monetary fund s world economic outlook tariffs cannot strike the right balance in bilateral trade instead hiking tariffs on a large scale will weaken the global economy in fact the imf has downgraded its forecast for international trade and global economic growth in 2019 due chiefly to the trade war economic globalization has helped form a comprehensive international division of industry and labor as a result the integrated global supply and industrial value chains have promoted industrial and technological transfer between developed and developing countries in turn the international division of industry and labor has strengthened globalization no matter whether they are american or chinese enterprises all pursue production efficiency by using the international supply and industrial value chains but the us triggered trade war has increased the cost of global trading made it difficult for multinational enterprises to make production decisions and increased the costs of intermediate goods take singapore for example if china s imports reduce by 10 percent singapore s exports will decline by 1 to 2 percentage points which shows the trade war is having a cascading effect on economies the us unilateral and protectionist moves have also lowered the returns on multinational enterprises investments and undermined their confidence multinational companies choose an investment destination based on local infrastructure and demographic factors such as transportation networks information and communication technology and labor supply as well as supporting industrial capacity and consumption market potential and the global supply and industrial chains help the companies to make the right decision yet the us seems determined to rebuild the international industrial chain in so doing it is ignoring the fact that the cost of rebuilding the global industrial chain would be very high and such a move could destabilize the world economy besides many assume that owing to the intensifying trade disputes multinational companies could consider changing their business strategy by re docking with the global supply chain and transferring their purchase and processing bases from china to destinations such as southeast asian countries in order to avoid paying the high tariffs imposed by the us on chinese imports but such a transfer also depends on many other factors such as transportation cost quality management labor force and administrative environment so a large scale transfer of multinational enterprises from china to other countries is unlikely in the short term not least because their production investment and industrial chains are all in china it is also difficult for multinational companies to find a destination that is as business friendly as china which has a comparatively sound supporting industrial system and is deeply integrated with the global value chain as for china to overcome the impact of the trade war on its economy it should deepen its reform and further open up its economy as a matter of fact china s reform and opening up have accelerated in recent years china has deepened the supply side structural reform expedited the construction of an innovation led economy opened up its market wider by shortening the negative list promoted a unified market and fair competition improved government functions and boosted domestic demand it has also taken measures to deepen international cooperation through the belt and road initiative and bilateral as well as multilateral free trade zones in order to create a better environment for domestic as well as global economic development the author is a researcher at foreign trade research institution chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation

the parent has got to be the voice of reason in the parent child relationship this should not come as a surprise but how often do we mess this up and how many children do not get this needed foundation i have heard it said that a parent cannot give their children what they don t have a parent without patience cannot teach patience a parent without joy cannot teach joy and a parent without love cannot teach love for the love of everything lets better ourselves and if you won t do it for yourself at least do it for your kids even when she is most unlovable she needs love and connectedness from her mother but also from her father she needs them to be as calm mature and parental as possible there is no room in their relationship for an out of control screaming confused and scared adult a voice of reason is desperately needed even with a child who has become entirely unreasonable dr james dobson bringing up girls

source xinhua 2019 06 29 08 47 05 editor yang yi video player close osaka japan june 29 xinhua leaders from the group of 20 g20 major economies on the first of a two day summit in the western prefecture of osaka traversed a number of pertinent issues facing the world today with downside risks facing the global economy and the need for increased collectivism very much in focus for many years world leaders have advocated for multilateral trade at g20 summits the nations of which account for roughly 80 percent of the world s economy and in past joint communiques member nations have predominantly stood against protectionist measures amid a number of potential downside risks to the global economy however including but not limited to some moves away from multilateral free trade in favor of more protectionist stances key member nations have continued to trumpet the virtues of multilateralism in line with previous commitments by g20 members we reaffirm our pledge to use all policy tools to achieve strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth and safeguard against downside risks by stepping up our dialogue and actions to enhance confidence we renew our commitment to work together to improve a rules based international order that is capable of effectively responding to a rapidly changing world the g20 leaders declaration stated last year in buenos aires argentina china as the world s second largest economy has long been a proponent of safeguarding multilateralism global collectivism and free trade with experts on the matter referring to the asian economic powerhouse as a champion of these themes i think china is in an interesting position as a result of the trump administration s position it appears as the champion of multilateralism and the free trading system hugo dobson professor of japan s international relations at sheffield university told xinhua friday it was already evident when china was g20 president in 2016 that it was transitioning from a rule taker to a rule maker that seeks to shape international norms rather than just respond to them so china appears to be continuing along this trajectory dobson also head of department of east asian studies said at the index osaka convention center south korea on friday referring to unilaterally triggered trade disputes and rise of protectionist tendencies also called on g20 countries to tackle ongoing trade issues in a concerted and responsible manner partly in light of the imf and the oecd cutting growth forecasts for the global economy the g20 should show leadership again south korean president moon jae in said here friday adding that such challenges can t be resolved on an individual country level japan meanwhile assuming presidency of the g20 leaders summit for the first time has also expressed concern about issues currently weighing on the global economy japanese prime minister shinzo abe after welcoming the leaders of the g20 economies prior to the summit voiced his concern about the current trade environment calling on the g20 to use all policy tools to drive global economy he asserted that a strong message is needed on free fair and nondiscriminatory trade his sentiments were echoed by antonio guterres secretary general of the united nations in a press conference friday who while referencing global warming also referred to global political warming it is also a moment in which there are uncertainties about the global economy uncertainties due to trade conflicts but also uncertainties related to high levels of debt to potential instability in financial markets the risk of slowdown in global growth guterres said but of course the un is not part of the g20 we are not members of the g20 but i am grateful for this opportunity to address the leaders and to convey to them our concerns guterres added abe additionally said he hopes to discuss with leaders the measures on further enhancing the momentum toward the reform of the world trade organization wto european commission president jean claude juncker told a press conference here friday that creating a level playing field in terms of wto reforms would be key we are working closely with the united states and japan as well as china and others on reforming the world trade organization wto and creating a level playing field juncker said this can only be done with the g20 as a core group said juncker launched in 1995 the wto has widely been regarded as symbol of free trade purporting to enhance global trade by eliminating tariffs and other barriers related to levies and establishing rules on trade practices although calls have been rife for the organization s reform and modernization g20 members agreed friday that expediting the reform of the wto was important in twine with a rules based trade system in light of the myriad issues facing the g20 members many nations in favor of a return to international collectivism and multinational consensus based trade policies may take heart in previous comments made by koji tomita a foreign ministry official representing japan here at the g20 summit who was quoted as saying that regaining public confidence in multilateralism is a key goal for the summit in the light of growing economic downturn risks it is obvious that the osaka summit has to focus on this condition tomita said
we re fact checking the second night of the democratic debate which includes contenders like former vice president joe biden sen bernie sanders of vermont sen kirsten gillibrand of new york and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg for full coverage visit nbc news debate hq and download the nbc news app see all the claims and the facts below claim biden claims that under obama the u s built the biggest wind farm in the world in our administration we built the largest wind farm in the world the largest solar energy facility in the world biden said thursday the largest wind power site in the u s the alta wind energy center in california has an operational capacity of 1 548 megawatts with 586 turbines according to 2017 data reported by the u s energy information administration it was built during the obama administration when biden was vice president but china has a bigger wind farm the gansu wind farm also known as the the jiuquan wind power base has 7 000 turbines and an operational capacity of at least 6 000 megawatts according to forbes and plans to expand to 20 000 megawatts by 2020 according to the new york times claim hickenlooper says colorado created the first methane regulations in the country hickenlooper said that in colorado we are working with the oil and gas industry and we ve created the first methane regulations in the country this is true as governor hickenlooper relying on input from environmental defense fund as well as three oil and gas companies that operate in the state noble energy encana and anadarko brokered a deal to implement strict new methane emissions regulations as well as new rules requiring the energy industry to locate and fix leaks at their drilling sites those rules which were in fact the first of their kind in the u s at the time required companies to capture 95 percent of all toxic pollutants and volatile organic compounds they emitted and also led to the repair of 73 000 methane leaks from 2015 to 2017 according to the colorado air pollution control division claim will tariffs cost americans 800 a year on average americans are going to pay on average 800 more a year because of these tariffs buttigieg said on thursday night talking about the impact of president donald trump s trade policies this is true after the president announced new tariffs this year economists said they would cost the average household 831 per year claim sanders record on gun control sanders claimed thursday that he s been a reliable supporter of gun control and said that in 1988 when it wasn t popular i ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact lost that race for congress sanders did lose his 1988 congressional race but multiple outlets have said the reason isn t so clear cut sanders also omits that in the 31 years since that race he has had a voting record that many gun control advocates consider checkered between 1991 and 1993 he voted at least three times against different iterations of the brady bill that required waiting periods for people buying guns he also opposed a 1996 measure that would have funded centers for disease control to conduct research on gun violence in 2005 he voted in favor of a law the protection of lawful commerce in arms act that essentially protected gun makers from lawsuits from the families of victims of gun violence after being roundly criticized for that position during the 2016 democratic primary sanders co sponsored legislation in 2017 to repeal that law in recent years he has taken a stronger stance geared toward gun control speaking including during his campaign launch speech about the need to expand background checks and ban assault weapons claim did vermont reject medicare for all because of the taxes because of those taxes vermont rejected medicare for all bennet said on thursday night part of his argument against the vermont senator s signature proposal this is true though it was not called medicare for all the state s then governor peter shumlin said he was abandoning plans for a universal publicly funded health care system because the taxes would be too high to make the program work according to an associated press report at the time claim did biden work with segregationists to oppose busing you worked with them to oppose busing harris said to biden of segregationists in the senate criticizing him for recent remarks about the reputation of those senators this is true biden fought to stop certain kinds of school busing a method of integration teaming up with segregationists in this effort he has long maintained he supported desegregation however claim sanders wonders why middle class workers haven t seen more money in 45 years sanders said how come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago this is pretty much true the cost of living has steadily increased but the buying power of most americans wages hasn t budged in decades according to a 2018 analysis from pew research center this study says that despite a strong labor market today s real average wage that is the wage after accounting for inflation has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago in addition last year real wage growth the difference between the growth in paychecks and the growth of inflation fell to 0 2 percent meaning that americans were making less than they had before claim did biden negotiate a bipartisan deal to stave off the migrant crisis biden talking about violence in countries like el salvador guatemala and honduras that has prompted thousands of people to flee and seek asylum in the u s said he got a bipartisan agreement to spend 740 million dollars to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place he then said trump disrupted that effort this is mostly true though biden s numbers and timeline are slightly off biden led the white house effort to send aid directly to the northern triangle countries and a bipartisan congress approved 750 million not 740 million in funding to stave off violence in the country and the funding did help slow migration from these countries the u s began diverting that funding in 2019 two years into not exactly immediately into trump s term claim will medicare for all ban private insurance bennet discussing his opposition to sanders medicare for all proposal said that it would make illegal all insurance except cosmetic bernie is a very honest person he has said over and over again that this will ban make illegal all insurance except cosmetic except insurance i guess that s for plastic surgery everything else is banned under medicare for all bennet said this is true the bill bennet is referring to a version of medicare for all introduced and championed by sanders would do away with any private insurance that duplicates a covered benefit the bill proposes covering just about everything from doctors and hospital visits to prescription drugs and rehab claim buttigieg says most americans favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants buttigieg said that most americans support a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants and that there s consensus on the issue this is true according to a plethora of recent polls according to a gallup poll from february 81 percent of americans support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants claim do other major countries spend 50 percent less per capita on health care in most cases are spending 50 percent per capita what we re spending on health care sanders said on thursday night according to the organization for economic co operation and development the u s spends 10 209 per capita on health care far and away more than any other countries reviewed by the oecd most spend at least 50 percent less than the u s per capita on health care according to the oecd data claim hickenlooper says he oversaw drop in teen pregnancy hickenlooper touted a birth control program in colorado saying we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent this is true though there s more to the story while teen pregnancy rates did fall in colorado after the colorado family planning initiative a state program that provided iuds or birth control implants at little or no cost for low income women was put into place hickenlooper would be hard pressed to take all of the credit for it the program was put in place in 2009 two years before he took office according to data kept by the colorado department of public health and environment birth and abortion rates both declined by nearly 50 percent among teens aged 15 to 19 and by 20 percent among young women aged 20 to 24 the birth rate among teens aged 15 19 dropped 59 percent over 2009 to 2017 according to more recent data hickenlooper is correct in making this claim but neglects to mention that the program went into effect under his predecessor democratic gov bill ritter in 2009 claim people in america are working two and three jobs to make ends meet harris says harris and other democrats often make the argument that the economy is not working for everyone highlighting anecdotes of people they ve met on the campaign trail who are working two and three jobs while there is no doubt that this is the reality for some just 5 percent of americans hold multiple jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics that number has risen slightly over the last few years though it is down from 6 percent in 1999 claim hickenlooper says he got colorado near universal health care coverage hickenlooper said thursday that on his watch in colorado we got near universal health care coverage this is pretty accurate using a provision in the affordable care act hickenlooper expanded medicaid in colorado to such a degree that according to his campaign website 95 percent of coloradans have health care coverage a reputable survey in the state the colorado health access survey from 2017 the latest data published found that 93 5 percent of coloradans had health insurance an all time high for the state claim do three people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of america sanders said this and he s right according to a report published by a left leaning think tank institute for policy studies which used data from forbes annual ranking of the 400 richest americans

the european union has eventually struck a free trade treaty with the south american trade bloc mercosur at a time of global concern over growing protectionism by the us officials from both sides met in the japanese city of osaka on friday to conclude two decade of negotiations for the deal the european union and our four friends from mercosur argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay have just reached an agreement eu trade commissioner cecilia malmstrom announced at a news conference on friday european commission chief jean claude juncker described the deal as a historical moment in the midst of international trade tensions we are sending today a strong signal with our mercosur partners that we stand for rules based trade he said adding that the agreement supported open trade eu trade commissioner cecilia malmstrom also told a news conference that the deal sent a loud and clear message in support of open trade together the eu and mercosur are responsible for 720 million people and a quarter of global gross domestic product according to the government of brazil the eu which has for long set its eyes on increasing access for its companies making industrial products is already mercosur s biggest trade and investment partner and its second largest for goods trade the new agreement allows europe to win sharp tariff reductions on goods such as cars exported to the mercosur area preview_thumbnail protesters condemn deal of the century argentine treasury minister nicolas dujovne praised the agreement saying it had enormous potential to increase investments fundamental to sustained growth the deal which is reached after some 40 rounds of talks still needs final approval from mercosur the european parliament and their constituent countries a process that brazil conceded could take years but if ratified the deal will be a great victory of brazil and argentina whose conservative presidents have been proponents of lowering the region s traditionally high tariff barriers brazilian president jair bolsonaro hailed the deal on twitter as historic and described it as one of the most important trade agreements of all time eu has become the first major partner for mercosur to whom the deal offers more avenues for development the deal is apparently meant as a message to the us as a reminder to president donald trump s aggressive policies which have disrupted global trade to protect itself from trump s protectionist policies the eu has started a free trade agreement with canada while striking agreements with japan and mexico and now with the mercosur the deal goes against the surge of protectionism fueled by trump who has imposed tariffs on chinese goods as well as steel and aluminum imports to the us the message conveyed by this agreement is that there are still people who count more on cooperation and open trade said arancha gonzalez director of the international trade center a world trade organization wto agency the agreement also coincides with the g20 summit in japan where trump and chinese president xi jinping will meet later on saturday to address the ongoing trade dispute between their countries washington and beijing are engaged in a trade dispute since last year when trump initiated the row by imposing unusually heavy tariffs on imports from china since then the two sides have exchanged tariffs on more than 360 billion dollars in two way trade earlier this month the us president threatened to impose tariffs on another 300 billion dollars worth of chinese products if xi refused to meet him at g20 summit trump has also tried to convince leaders of japan canada mexico and the eu to negotiate trade policies that are more fair this article has been adapted from its original source

us president donald trump meets with china s president xi jinping at the start of their bilateral meeting at the g20 leaders summit in osaka on saturday reuters photo osaka us president donald trump and china s xi jinping agreed to another truce in their trade war on saturday removing an immediate threat looming over the global economy even as a lasting peace remains elusive the two sides have agreed to restart trade negotiations that broke down last month xinhua news agency reported adding that the united states agreed to put no new tariffs on chinese goods we had a very good meeting with president xi of china trump told reporters after the meeting on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit in japan excellent i would say excellent as good as it was going to be we discussed a lot of things and we re right back on track the return to the negotiating table ends a six week stalemate that has unnerved businesses and investors and at least temporarily reduces fears that the world s two largest economies are headed into a new cold war still it s unclear whether they can overcome differences that led to the collapse of a previous truce reached at last year s g20 meeting both sides appear to have made some concessions in order to get the talks restarted while washington has agreed not to impose any more tariffs on chinese goods china has agreed to buy more farm products according to mr trump meanwhile washington will ease up on its attempt to freeze the chinese telecom equipment giant huawei technologies out of the lucrative global 5g market mr trump said huawei would be allowed to buy products from us suppliers us companies can sell their equipment to huawei he said at a news conference we re talking about equipment where there s no great national security problem with it the us commerce department last month moved to blacklist huawei cutting it off from us suppliers though many companies have managed to skirt the restrictions mr trump said the two leaders discussed huawei as part of their talks i said that s okay that we will keep selling that product these are american companies that make these products that s very complex by the way trump said i ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so that american companies will continue the us has been engaged in a global campaign to block huawei from 5g communications networks calling the company a security threat the trump administration has alleged the chinese government could use huawei s products to spy on countries that use them in their networks the company has denied that it conducts espionage for beijing since the trade talks collapsed on may 10 trump has raised tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 from 10 in recent days he had indicated that the next step could be a 10 tariff on all remaining imports from china some 300 billion worth from smartphones to children s clothes xi spent much of the summit s first day friday promising to open up the chinese economy and chiding though not naming the us for its attack on the global trading system in remarks to african leaders on friday xi took a not so subtle swipe at trump s america first trade policy warning against bullying practices and adding that any attempt to put one s own interests first and undermine others will not win any popularity xi also called out the us over huawei and said the g20 should uphold the completeness and vitality of global supply chains china insisted this week that huawei must be removed from the blacklist under any deal trump used to cite the reduction of america s goods trade deficit with china which reached a record 419 billion last year as his main aim but his administration s focus has shifted to limiting chinese access to us innovation china s government has responded with increasingly harsh rhetoric that underscores its readiness for a long battle other disagreements that caused talks to break down include how to enshrine the chinese reforms demanded by the us over intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies and when and how to lift the tariffs that trump has come to view as his most powerful economic tool despite a backlash from american businesses the president remains convinced that tariffs have given him leverage over trading partners and that they ve helped the us economy while hurting china s i view tariffs differently than a lot of other people trump told fox business network in an interview ahead of his g20 trip and by the way since tariffs have been on our market has gone through the roof if you know what i m talking about
washington we are now passing a significant milestone the current economic expansion has become the longest in u s history previously the record was the decade from march 1991 to march 2001 120 months when the present recovery enters july it will mark the 121st month of expansion just how much longer it will last is anyone s guess but politically this is the question that matters most upon the answer may hang the identity of the next president we are now at the point in the political cycle when swarms of democratic challengers are field testing their many policy proposals all the candidates seek to project an image that will impress the voting public yet the outcome may depend more on the state of the economy than the state of the debate if the economy remains strong for the next 16 months or so president trump s reelection prospects would it seems be enormously enhanced and of course the opposite is also true if the economy slips into recession even a mild one trump s claim to extraordinary economic powers would be devalued all the political maneuvering and posturing may pale beside the visible state of the economy so it s trump against the economy if he can seem to control the economy whatever the reality he may overwhelm his opponent regardless of the case against him no one seems more aware of this than trump who has been building plan b just in case plan a a continuous boom fails plan b of course is to have the federal reserve take the blame if the economy falters he has been attacking jerome jay powell chairman of the federal reserve board for months accusing him and the fed of suffocating economic growth by raising short term interest rates too soon and too much in 2017 and 2018 the fed increased overnight rates seven times they now stand at a range of 2 25 to 2 50 if trump is so vitriolic when the economy is basically strong imagine what he would be like if a recession or a conspicuous slowdown occurred advertisement will a strong economy propel trump into a second term the job of predicting always difficult is especially hard now because the economy seems to be sending contradictory messages the stock market seems robust apparently reflecting confidence in the economy s underlying growth on the other hand bond markets seem to be telegraphing economic weakness evident in low interest rates and a lackluster demand for credit the unemployment rate of 3 6 in may the lowest monthly rate since the 1960s also seems to indicate a widespread need for more workers surely a sign of a healthy economy but the absence of sizable wage and price increases suggests the opposite the economy isn t growing fast enough to generate pervasive scarcities of workers or products that would increase inflationary pressures in may the consumer price index the government s best known inflation indicator was up only 1 8 from a year earlier then there s the uncertain impact of trump s trade wars which have affected not only exports but also business investments tied to trade in 2018 foreign direct investment fdi by multinational firms fell 13 reports the united nations conference on trade and development unctad it was the third consecutive annual decline fdi covers factories mergers and other forms of investment understandably attention is now focused on the first debates but the decisive showdown may be between trump and the economy robert samuelson is a columnist with the washington post send questions comments to the editors
source xinhua 2019 06 29 12 13 26 editor xiang bo video player close by raimundo urrechaga havana june 28 xinhua havana was abuzz on friday with newly announced government measures to spur the economy including wage and pension hikes for public sector workers and retirees the measures which was unveiled late thursday amid an otherwise bleak outlook due to heightened u s sanctions and open hostility from a conservative white house will benefit over 2 7 million cubans state run cuban television reported that starting in july the minimum wage will rise to 400 pesos 17 u s dollars while the average salary will rise to 1 067 pesos 45 dollars it is something all public sector workers really welcome because they have been demanding it for many years madelin guzman an elementary school teacher in havana told xinhua i believe the government and president miguel diaz canel have made an important decision it will become a new work incentive for all state workers she added public sector workers in cuba include those in the sectors of healthcare education culture sports civil service housing and defense emilio ortega a college graduate said the decision reflects the government s determination to implement much needed reforms in cuba salaries will still be low and not as we all expected but it s an important first step that satisfies us ortega said on the government s introduction of a monthly tax for social security that workers need to pay ortega said it seems logical and acceptable that we all contribute to social security because cuba is an aging country the younger workforce isn t enough to replace those who retire and the state will have to assume that economic burden in the future according to economy minister alejandro gil around 1 2 million retired state workers will benefit from the wage hike it s definitely good news although our pensions are still very low considering the price of some goods and services in the country said gladys bustillos a 77 year old retiree the cuban government has pledged to keep a close eye on prices to ensure higher salaries and pensions do not have an inflationary effect the full package of economic measures approved by the council of ministers is to be detailed over the coming days the government said these measures seek to encourage savings bolster domestic production diversify and increase exports and substitute imports promote local development and enhance state companies gil said moving towards the unification of cuba s dual currency system is another goal the minister added for over 25 years cubans have used two pesos the cuban peso cup worth about 4 u s cents and the convertible peso cuc which remains parity with dollar the cuc was introduced after the collapse of the former soviet union in the late 1990s and is used to buy goods at some retail stores putting an end to the dual currency system is expected to lead to the removal of subsidies for state companies higher prices for goods and the loss of thousands of public sector jobs
robin muchetu peter matika senior reporters the government is fed up with unscrupulous businesses that are in the habit of wantonly increasing prices of basic commodities and will soon consider scrapping off import duty on various goods and foodstuffs to allow individuals with free funds to access affordable goods across the country s borders in addition the government will revoke licences of businesses that have shown affinity to frustrate efforts to stabilise the economy by increasing prices without justification the warnings come as the business sector which some analysts now think is bent on deliberately sabotaging efforts by government to revive the economy effected price increases last week following the announcement that the country was abandoning the multi currency basket for local transactions and adopting the local currency before last week s announcement business used to peg their prices in united states dollars or equivalent however after the government s announcement the rate of the zimbabwe dollar to the us dollar tumbled by more than 50 percent from 1 12 to about 1 6 on the black market while it remained at around 1 6 on the interbank instead of reducing prices basing on the exchange rates as the businesses have been doing whenever there was adjustment of the rate most businesses actually increased the prices raising fears that this was unjustified if not a deliberate attempt to create disharmony and kill off all the confidence on the local currency however some businesses in harare had started heeding the call to reduce prices as the new measures to adopt a local currency began to tame runaway speculative activities and upward movements of the parallel market exchanges rates that had become rampant in the economy there are expectations that there will be continued pressure for prices to come down as reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor dr john mangudya said yesterday the central bank would move in to support bureau de changes so that they can operate efficiently and effectively a snap survey by our harare bureau showed that cooking oil prices which breached the 20 price for a 2 litre bottle was retailing between 16 and 18 at various outlets yesterday the price of a 2kg packet of flour had also slipped to between 11 and 12 from the previous range of 15 to 30 a 2kg bag of rice was selling between 10 50 and 11 representing a downward revision from top prices of 24 also prices of a 1kg packet of washing powder had dived to 20 from between 34 and 38 industry and commerce minister nqobizitha mangaliso ndlovu told sunday news on friday that government was surprised by local businesses and the time to continuously treat them with kids gloves was running out we are considering a number of options including reviewing the tariffs regime i don t know if we need to be charging duty for people who go and buy groceries outside the country for use when local businesses are killing the same people with high prices if they continue with this we will remove duty and people can go and buy outside freely he said added minister ndlovu how do you justify a sofa that is selling at r2 500 in south africa going for 44 000 in our own shops and we say when you are coming into the country pay duty for it to try and protect the local industry that cannot be acceptable at all minister ndlovu said the government thought when the exchange rates started going down business would at least maintain the prices if not reduce we have seen that prices are going up even when exchange rates are going down businesses were increasing prices every hour because they were justifying it on the exchange rate but now the exchange rate has gone down and their prices still go up what then is the justification for this sometimes our businesspeople can disappoint and this is a classic example that we are seeing here it also shows you the kind of businesspeople we have now people who are after the bottom line and the bottom line is profits at any cost he said the minister said the calibre of some businessespeople that are there now belong to the old dispensation i don t know where it is coming from but it tells me that there is a lot of mischief going on it tells me that we do not have any discipline in the market and people are taking advantage of our openness to engagement and our drive to create a market based economy where market forces determine prices they are used to a strict kind of approach where there is a heavy hand controlling prices they belong to the old dispensation it tells me that we are still to create business people for this country the minister said government would not continue shielding the greedy businesspeople what is vital is that when they business people realise their mistake it will be too late but we will not continue protecting businesses at the expense of the people they do not realise that the bigger cost to this is the increased eradication of the consumers buying power we will have a situation where consumers will reject those products and it is the businesspeople who will suffer at the end of the day warned minister ndlovu meanwhile a prominent academic nust pro vice chancellor innovation and business development dr gatsha mazithulela defended the re introduction of the local currency dr mazithulela who emphasised that he was speaking in his own capacity said what is clear is that there was no way the multi currency system could have been sustained further the issue of timing should also not be argued on theoretical terms real world situations rarely give any perfect fit to economic or any other theory for that matter argued dr mazithulela managers and leaders all over the world in any field make the best decisions possible using prevailing variables and mainly those that they can control perfect market conditions and the very nice alignment to other decision making matrices is rarely experienced in real life
profoundly heartening and disturbing news from pricewaterhousecoopers nigeria a copy of the talking points of the lecture came to me only a few days ago i am talking of a lecture delivered earlier this week by dr andrew nevin chief economist of pricewaterhousecoopers nigeria pwc at the 80th birthday party for pascal dozie founder of diamond bank chairman of the new nigeria foundation and one of the most successful investors and corporate personalities in nigeria indeed only at a social function for such an icon of nigerian venture capitalism could a talk of such far reaching consequences have been given more of an informal talk than a lecture as such what dr nevin had to say will come as a bracing revelation to any thinking nigerian who gets to read it for this reason my discussion of the talk in this piece is intended to provoke the publication in full of the talk i swear that in my discussion i have tried as much as possible not to distort not to either overstate or understate anything that dr nevin said in his talk at any rate i know for a certainty that this will not be the only commentary or the last word on the talk at least once it is published finally the talking points of the talk that i discuss in this piece were circulated at the party for dozie they are thus already in the public domain of the five talking points discussed in the lecture i will discuss only three in this piece these are remittances from nigerians in the diaspora not oil revenues as our most important source of revenue and the only thing that is keeping nigeria from economic collapse the relentless and seemingly unstoppable shrinking of the public sector in our country in the last few decades the self organization and tremendous resilience of the informal sector of the economy these issues are discussed separately in andrew nevin s talk but that they are all interconnected is something that becomes evident after one has read his observations and reflections on all of them if it is true that facts and data don t lie then consider the significance of the following data in 2018 which happens to be last year remittances from the nigerian diaspora totaled us 22 billion oil revenue for the year remitted to the government by nnpc was at us 11 billion less than half of the remittances from the diaspora meanwhile the estimate of remittances from the diaspora for this year is us 25 billion beyond these consider the fact that data for unofficial remittances through the informal so called aboki system are not included in these official data when they are included remittances from the diaspora are close to us 40 billion this staggering sum is more than triple what the nnpc remits to the government annually remember compatriots that our national currency the naira is among the so called non convertible currencies of the developing world thus we badly need for our revenues from oil to be in dollars the first among the convertible currencies of the world with this in mind think now of the significance of the fact that not only are remittances from the diaspora almost triple oil revenues they are in dollars and are thus crucial to the volume of fx or forex available for exchange and circulation in our national economy in other words far more without the remittances from the naija diaspora our national economy would be so short of forex that it would sooner or later sooner than later collapse why do we keep on regarding oil revenue as our main or primary source of revenue especially revenue designated in forex why are we so extremely slow to recognize and deal with the fact that our main primary export is not oil but people is it because we do not normally think of people as exportable commodities nevin believes that it is because the change from oil to people as our main export item happened so gradually and imperceptibly that we never really became aware that the change was happening or has indeed been irreversibly consummated however while it is one thing to become aware of this momentous change in the structure of our national economy it is another thing entirely to decide the terms in which we should conduct a productive national conversation on it i shall come back to this point later in this piece after discussions of the other two issues earlier indicated for now let me make this preliminary observation nigeria is not the only country in the world wherein export of people of nationals has become a major if not the primary export commodity or item this situation is indeed similar to or congruent with the experiences of many other developing countries of africa the middle east south asia and latin america with regard to the second issue the relentless shrinking of the public sector i must confess that although i was very aware of its occurrence i simply had no idea that it was as catastrophic as the figures and data supplied by dr nevin imply here s one statistic between 2000 2002 public sector expenditure in nigeria averaged 25 of the gdp in 2017 public sector expenditure at n13 2 trillion naira was only about 12 of the gdp since n1 3 trillion of that sum went into debt servicing and the national assembly alone cost us n125 billion naira it means that only about 10 of the gdp was spent for public expenditure here is another stat a monster of a stat 10 of the gdp for public sector expenditure works into about n70k per capita which means that only n70 000 seventy thousand naira per person was spent at all levels of government in a whole year for everything including health education public sanitation infrastructures and utilities policing armed security services and social welfare services this is one of the worst figures for per capita public sector expenditure in the world the severe shrinkage of the public sector means that for the most part in the last few decades what the public sector no longer provides nigerians have had to provide for themselves and this also includes nearly everything this observation leads to the third of the three issues discussed by dr nevin in his talk that i wish to discuss in this article let me remind the reader what this is the self organization and tremendous resilience of the non governmental informal sector logically this arises from the shrinkage of the public sector with the attendant monumental decrease in what the government the public sector actually can and does provide for nigerians in their millions after all nature abhors a vacuum right yes but this is more than merely filling a vacuum it is nothing short of a true measure of what nigerians can do in the face of the great challenges that they face day in day out this section of dr nevin s talk is simply the best part and by a long shot in nigeria people are getting poorer and poorer the government and or the public sector provides an absolute minimum of services needed for a modern society and the little that it provides is grossly inadequate moreover life is full of insecurities and the young are restless and desperate by all rational calculations nigeria should be a failed state a collapsed society but it isn t nevin asks why and he says it is primarily due to the great resilience of the informal sector which turns out to be doing for oneself what the government or the formal sector cannot or will not do this is of course not the first time that our informal sector has been praised for doing what the formal sector the public sector cannot or will not do what makes dr nevin s take on the issue so compelling is the fact that his profile of the informal sector is juxtaposed to his stunning account of the shrinkage of the public sector after all against white black appears more black and white itself more white in other words if we didn t have the tremendous ingenuity and self organization of this informal sector if all that we had was the gross insufficiency and the mediocrity of the formal sector run by the government nigeria would long ago have gone the way of so many other nations of africa and other parts of the developing world where again and again the nation has proved to be a limit beyond which the people cannot go in nigeria according to nevin things seem to be going in the other direction the people constitute the tremendously unbounded limit against which the nation must be measured in bringing this discussion to an end i wish to extrapolate some logical conclusions of dr nevin s talk that he does not make himself even though they are in my opinion crying to be made in his talk not the government not the leaders and not even any segments of the social and political elites but the nigerian people themselves at home and in the diaspora are the real heroes although it is nigerians in the diaspora that are deliberately singled out for hero worshipping by nevin he comes near to expressing the same sentiments in his comments on the informal sector based on this the whole talk seems to be framed by an unspoken but palpable nigerian exceptionalism since we do know ourselves that we are prone to uncritical exceptionalism when we think of or talk about our destiny on the african continent and indeed in the world we ought to be wary of it when it is being argued by a foreigner who has evidently been mesmerized by a heavy dose of naijaphilia such caution is all the more necessary given the fact nevin seems almost completely oblivious of neoliberalism as the global and historic context for all his claims and reflections in his talk people becoming our primary export commodity to displace oil from that august position the unending shrinkage of the public sector the informal sector coming to the rescue in the wake of the collapse the chaos and mediocrity of the public sector not a single one of these happened without the overdetermining savage war of neoliberalism against the nations and peoples of the world principally the peoples and nations of the developing world at first but later on all the nations and peoples of the world we became a debtor nation or a debt ridden nation thanks to neoliberalism everything else followed from that historic fact and datum of course don t blame it all on neoliberalism but don t excuse neoliberalism completely from blame either comrade egbon adieu for abiodun molara ogundipe 1930 2019 when she died last week the world of scholarship lost a great colleague and an irreplaceable pathfinder i called her comrade egbon and she called me comrade aburo one reason was because we were namesakes also when she taught at ui she briefly dated my maternal uncle the late mr sunday ajayi obe and for a while there was hope of a marital union between them at least as far as my uncle was concerned but it was primarily because from the first time or day that i met the person behind the legendary figure i felt a closeness of spirit which she also apparently felt one of our first prolonged discussions was about feminism and its many phases she checked me out thoroughly intellectually i think that she found me not too wanting and accepted me as a man in feminism she was of a generation of the nigerian and african literati that was overwhelmingly male dominated this in an age when crude gender discrimination plain rudeness and smarmy condescension of virtually all men towards all women was the order of the age though she was actually rather soft spoken she was nonetheless feisty feisty and heaven it was that could rescue any man that made the mistake of condescending to her as a woman she was a gifted lyrical poet and it always saddened me that she did not give to poetry what the medium demanded of her gifts sustained work and attention i often think of one of my favorites among her poems firi she was also a first rate critic and an inspired theorist one of our best no less when she defended her doctoral dissertation on narratology in the poetry of okot p bitek at leyden university i was the external examiner

us president donald trump meets with china s president xi jinping at the start of their bilateral meeting at the g20 leaders summit in osaka on saturday reuters photo osaka us president donald trump and china s xi jinping agreed to another truce in their trade war on saturday removing an immediate threat looming over the global economy even as a lasting peace remains elusive the two sides have agreed to restart trade negotiations that broke down last month xinhua news agency reported adding that the united states agreed to put no new tariffs on chinese goods we had a very good meeting with president xi of china trump told reporters after the meeting on the sidelines of the group of 20 summit in japan excellent i would say excellent as good as it was going to be we discussed a lot of things and we re right back on track the return to the negotiating table ends a six week stalemate that has unnerved businesses and investors and at least temporarily reduces fears that the world s two largest economies are headed into a new cold war still it s unclear whether they can overcome differences that led to the collapse of a previous truce reached at last year s g20 meeting both sides appear to have made some concessions in order to get the talks restarted while washington has agreed not to impose any more tariffs on chinese goods china has agreed to buy more farm products according to mr trump meanwhile washington will ease up on its attempt to freeze the chinese telecom equipment giant huawei technologies out of the lucrative global 5g market mr trump said huawei would be allowed to buy products from us suppliers us companies can sell their equipment to huawei he said at a news conference we re talking about equipment where there s no great national security problem with it the us commerce department last month moved to blacklist huawei cutting it off from us suppliers though many companies have managed to skirt the restrictions mr trump said the two leaders discussed huawei as part of their talks i said that s okay that we will keep selling that product these are american companies that make these products that s very complex by the way trump said i ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so that american companies will continue the us has been engaged in a global campaign to block huawei from 5g communications networks calling the company a security threat the trump administration has alleged the chinese government could use huawei s products to spy on countries that use them in their networks the company has denied that it conducts espionage for beijing since the trade talks collapsed on may 10 trump has raised tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 from 10 in recent days he had indicated that the next step could be a 10 tariff on all remaining imports from china some 300 billion worth from smartphones to children s clothes xi spent much of the summit s first day friday promising to open up the chinese economy and chiding though not naming the us for its attack on the global trading system in remarks to african leaders on friday xi took a not so subtle swipe at trump s america first trade policy warning against bullying practices and adding that any attempt to put one s own interests first and undermine others will not win any popularity xi also called out the us over huawei and said the g20 should uphold the completeness and vitality of global supply chains china insisted this week that huawei must be removed from the blacklist under any deal trump used to cite the reduction of america s goods trade deficit with china which reached a record 419 billion last year as his main aim but his administration s focus has shifted to limiting chinese access to us innovation china s government has responded with increasingly harsh rhetoric that underscores its readiness for a long battle other disagreements that caused talks to break down include how to enshrine the chinese reforms demanded by the us over intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies and when and how to lift the tariffs that trump has come to view as his most powerful economic tool despite a backlash from american businesses the president remains convinced that tariffs have given him leverage over trading partners and that they ve helped the us economy while hurting china s i view tariffs differently than a lot of other people trump told fox business network in an interview ahead of his g20 trip and by the way since tariffs have been on our market has gone through the roof if you know what i m talking about
the worry recently was that the trump administration was ginning up fake intelligence about iran blowing up oil tankers in the strait of hormuz to justify a war against iran then this week president donald trump said the iranian attacks weren t a big deal the episode is another indication of the underlying modesty not a very trumpian word of the administration subtract trump s taste for nonstop controversy and rhetorical brinkmanship and you re left with an incrementalist center right government that has pursued an expansionary fiscal policy and avoided foreign war for a period of peace and prosperity that in any other universe would be at the core of a stay the course reelection message for a while the obama doctrine was don t do stupid stuff the trump team has built out the doctrine to privately consider and sometimes openly threaten stupid stuff but at the end of the day don t do it usually the mexico tariff threat was typical if trump had gone through with the steadily escalating tariffs it would have been a blow to our own economy and that of an ally instead he got what might prove to be meaningful concessions from mexico even if he hadn t he easily could have found some reason to delay or call off the tariffs the thing about a trump threat is that he always controls whether he s going to go through with it or not he s going to pull out of the north american free trade agreement actually no he s not he s going to impose auto tariffs on canada well not really what he s going to do is sign a new trade deal with mexico and canada that s a somewhat altered version of nafta and urge congress to pass it allies might be understandably appalled or at times alarmed by his habit of berating them and squeezing them for concessions but the alliance system a product of deeper forces than the persona of any one president remains intact in the middle east trump accelerated an anti isis campaign that he inherited announced a withdrawal from syria that he didn t fully follow through on and kept troops in afghanistan steady as she goes pulling out of the iran nuclear accord is a big deal and given that it s not entirely clear how the administration imagines resolving the crisis genuinely a shot in the dark although trump says he wants to talk another gamble is the trade war with china a truly significant departure from the old bipartisan consensus yet even here trump presumably has the off ramp of a fig leaf deal should he decide that he wants to take it at home in terms of the economy everything except for the tariffs has been geared to preserving and boosting the recovery from the tax cuts to the deregulation to the lack of interest in cutting spending to trump s jawboning of the federal reserve to keep rates low the action on immigration is heavily focused on the border with the goal of diminishing a growing crisis rather than fashioning a transformation trump has kept the senate occupied with a steady diet of judicial nominations approved by the conservative legal establishment any political fence sitter inclined to consider this a solid record of accomplishment has the competing information to consider of trump s constant tweeting and lurid yet meaningless controversies given the choice you d prefer that people believed that your administration was cautious and incremental while it undertook far reaching changes rather than believe it s on the verge of careening out of control while pursuing a fairly reasonable path the careening out of control has seemed a real possibility at times of course and his shambolic confrontational governing style could yet catch up to him for now he can plausibly make a reelection pitch that despite what you might have gathered he s been a steward of a country enjoying markedly good times rich lowry is a creators syndicate columnist

putting a chill on investment the cpb netherlands bureau of economic policy analysis reported this week that global trade volumes decreased by 0 7 per cent in april but there is a feeling among some analysts that the fed s pivot toward stimulus over the past couple of weeks is more about insurance than need the u s economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 1 per cent in the first quarter an acceleration from 2 2 per cent in the previous quarter and there is little reason to anticipate a collapse consumption is the primary driver of u s growth and consumers are in better shape than they ve been since before the great recession the labour market is the strongest is decades household debt is under control and wage growth is showing signs of life by indicating it would cut interest rates the fed calmed equity markets offsetting the discomfort caused by president donald trump s latest wave of tariff threats the fed also might have raised interest rates higher than it needed to as

what affects argentina most is the trade dispute between the united states and china which has had a very strong impact on the grain markets and on the price of soybeans in chicago mercantile exchange the united states has adopted unilateral and trade protectionist measures in violation of established international trade rules and launched a trade war against china and triggered trade disputes with other economies including the european union canada and mexico the us trade protectionist moves are seriously undermining international trade and the world economy and disrupting the global supply and industrial value chains destabilizing the global resource distribution system and harming multinational companies productivity the us protectionist measures have not only intensified trade fictions but also fanned anti globalization passions in several countries true the trade war is hurting chinese enterprises but it is also hurting american enterprises and consumers and the global economy the us moves have also created serious challenges for the sustainable development of international trade and investment according to the international monetary fund s world economic outlook tariffs cannot strike the right balance in bilateral trade instead hiking tariffs on a large scale will weaken the global economy in fact the imf has downgraded its forecast for international trade and global economic growth in 2019 due chiefly to the trade war economic globalization has helped form a comprehensive international division of industry and labor as a result the integrated global supply and industrial value chains have promoted industrial and technological transfer between developed and developing countries in turn the international division of industry and labor has strengthened globalization no matter whether they are american or chinese enterprises all pursue production efficiency by using the international supply and industrial value chains but the us triggered trade war has increased the cost of global trading made it difficult for multinational enterprises to make production decisions and increased the costs of intermediate goods take singapore for example if china s imports reduce by 10 percent singapore s exports will decline by 1 to 2 percentage points which shows the trade war is having a cascading effect on economies the us unilateral and protectionist moves have also lowered the returns on multinational enterprises investments and undermined their confidence multinational companies choose an investment destination based on local infrastructure and demographic factors such as transportation networks information and communication technology and labor supply as well as supporting industrial capacity and consumption market potential and the global supply and industrial chains help the companies to make the right decision yet the us seems determined to rebuild the international industrial chain in so doing it is ignoring the fact that the cost of rebuilding the global industrial chain would be very high and such a move could destabilize the world economy besides many assume that owing to the intensifying trade disputes multinational companies could consider changing their business strategy by re docking with the global supply chain and transferring their purchase and processing bases from china to destinations such as southeast asian countries in order to avoid paying the high tariffs imposed by the us on chinese imports but such a transfer also depends on many other factors such as transportation cost quality management labor force and administrative environment so a large scale transfer of multinational enterprises from china to other countries is unlikely in the short term not least because their production investment and industrial chains are all in china it is also difficult for multinational companies to find a destination that is as business friendly as china which has a comparatively sound supporting industrial system and is deeply integrated with the global value chain as for china to overcome the impact of the trade war on its economy it should deepen its reform and further open up its economy as a matter of fact china s reform and opening up have accelerated in recent years china has deepened the supply side structural reform expedited the construction of an innovation led economy opened up its market wider by shortening the negative list promoted a unified market and fair competition improved government functions and boosted domestic demand it has also taken measures to deepen international cooperation through the belt and road initiative and bilateral as well as multilateral free trade zones in order to create a better environment for domestic as well as global economic development the author is a researcher at foreign trade research institution chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

assemblyman todd gloria and san diego councilwoman barbara bry photos by dustin michelson and vito di stefano the big local political story of the week is probably the big political story of the decade for local democrats housing housing housing as democrats ascend to dominance in local public affairs they will hardly be unified and this week some of the cracks in the coalition blew up with just one sentence from mayoral aspirant and san diego city councilwoman barbara bry they re coming for our homes democrats are not united on housing a young vocal group of democrats calling itself yimbys really wants to make it easier to build denser more walkable neighborhoods to alter our transportation habits and make housing more affordable assemblyman todd gloria is lining up with them another group has some skepticism about that and are worried deeply about protecting the character height limits and feel of the communities they bought into the mayor s race may very well be a referendum on this divide bry is lining up with them that s the fear she was tapping into with they re coming for our homes be sure to check out our discussion on this in this week s podcast we have some follow ups to the story we posted tuesday on all this first bry s nuances one of the yimby theories is that local politicians have no incentive to approve this kind of development there will always be pushback in neighborhoods to any kind of more dense housing project thus the state should come up with ways to streamline projects that comply to broader principles but state lawmakers were apparently the they in they re coming for our homes but bry had once supported the state s role in addressing housing we quoted bry s own op ed about it in discussing these issues it is important to remember that the housing crisis cannot be solved entirely at the local level reforms in state planning laws would ensure more efficient local land use practices and simpler environmental reviews for affordable housing she wrote she explained in a follow up statement how she s not being contradictory the views barbara expressed in that commentary are 100 consistent with her views today wrote her spokesman jared sclar and he passed along a written statement from her these actions will have to be in concert with community plans to ensure neighborhoods are engaged in this process since an increase in density is not always a good thing think one paseo a 23 acre project in carmel valley that would require changing the community plan current residents understandably do not want to see wholesale changes in their communities the key to making new development welcome is linking it to community benefits which gives residents good reasons to support reasonable growth these incentives may take the form of new parks street improvements or convenient transit services and would be identified by residents through the planning process based on more effective interaction between city planners and the community the community benefits should be delivered before or concurrently with new development another follow up the nimby heart attorney cory briggs argues a case against the city of san diego in superior court photo by sam hodgson several people on twitter saw they re coming for our homes as hysterical bigotry that sounds like the type of fearmongering you would hear from 45 wrote eric morrison smith recognize when people use the language of an oppressor but people concerned about protecting neighborhoods and residents voice in what comes to them have been pushing back on this for a while cory briggs the attorney who briefly ran for mayor took some exception to our tuesday piece when we summarized his position that housing should be built somewhere else he said in a written message that he supports adding housing in many neighborhoods subject to a number of reforms and protections for the communities absorbing the extra density we based the paraphrase on takeaways from a debate march 6 meeting of the la mesa foothills democratic club the conversation was between briggs and affordable housing developer ginger hitzke over yimby vs nimby at one point there briggs addressed height limits the mayor has proposed easing building height limits around transit areas there is such a thing as community character you will hear people say that is code for bigots and racists i just think that s not true there are bigots and racists all over the place in lots of different things but to dismiss the concerns of people who have made their single biggest investment for most folks in a certain place saying i like this place to dismiss their desire to maintain the place where they put they re single biggest investment as a bunch of racists or bigots is frankly like calling half the country deplorables it s not a recipe for making progress on an important issue height is part of what gives a place character when you think about manhattan you think about a big tall skyline you don t think about beaches and when you think about sd what s in our dna is that we re a beach city not a high rise city now maybe that needs to change and that s a separate question but it s not illegitimate to say i like my neighborhood how it is when scott asked him if san diego is growing much from our own procreation where should the people live briggs had a ready response i would be densifying downtown downtown is not nearly dense enough they re dense at city hall but that s a different density he said you can listen to that tape here edc chair housing one prominent business leader in town was aghast over bry s email four star general allen leader of the brookings institute says that the demise of the middle class is a national security threat lack of affordable housing undermines the middle class density is patriotic said janice brown the chairwoman of the san diego regional economic development corp coming this summer morena boulevard the council vote a vacant lot next to a new planned trolley station at clairemont drive and morena boulevard has been home to years of development fights photo by jamie scott lytle bry made it clear this week that she was staking her bid for the mayor s office on a message directed at residents who aren t eager to welcome new development into their neighborhoods especially if those neighborhoods are filled with single family homes one of those communities is along morena boulevard where the city has for years been preparing a new set of development regulations meant to encourage dense housing near two planned transit stations along the 2 1 billion mid coast trolley line through the area that project has been working its way through the city long enough that it s been a focal point of two elections in that city council district it s finally expected to come before the city council for a final vote this summer the vote the city council is planning a special meeting on thursday aug 1 to consider two separate land use plans that together cover the linda vista bay park and pacific beach communities near new trolley line the city s plans which have already been approved by the planning commission seek to create dense neighborhoods near the new trolley stops they would increase the amount of development allowed around the existing morena linda vista station on the green line at two planned stations on the new blue line one near the jerome s furniture on tecolote road and one on the western side of i 5 at the balboa avenue station in pacific beach the city has delayed making similar changes at the clairemont drive station and on the east side of i 5 and the balboa avenue station until it adopts a new set of development regulations for the entire clairemont community the mayor s race bry has decided to become a voice for those who don t want the city to increase development she ll get a chance to stand on that principle when the proposal comes to the council in august then again she said in an email to supporters this week that she supports increasing density along transit corridors and in neighborhoods like downtown where it s meant to be maybe that means she ll support the proposal to upzone around the new trolley stations despite the community s organizing against it for years gloria as an assemblyman doesn t have a vote on the city council anymore but now that housing and development are taking center stage in the mayor s race maybe he ll come back from sacramento to speak during public comment on the proposal quite an argument some weekend reading for

irrespective of his occupation they wrote sandag s board makes formal plans to keep fighting san diego county supervisor kristin gaspar and sandag executive director hasan ikhrata photos by adriana heldiz and megan wood ok that s not fair they scheduled another discussion item for their biggest disagreement but it s clear things are still awfully rocky at the regional planning agency ever since hasan ikhrata sandag s director announced his 5 big moves for remaking the region s transportation system elected officials on the agency s board have been at odds friday county supervisor kristin gaspar asked the board to schedule a hearing sometime soon to discuss whether they approve of the direction of the 5 big moves opening the door to a vote in which the board tells ikhrata to abandon the idea before staff spends more time working on it the concept broadly calls for making transit more frequent fast and useful throughout the county while abandoning some highway projects that cities in the northern and eastern parts of the county have been expecting especially since they were included in a 2004 voter approved sales tax for transportation transnet gaspar and others didn t like the idea initially but have only grown more oppositional to it in the months since arguing that it is too focused on transit improvements and not enough on alleviating freeway congestion it needs to come back and we need to agree as a board that we agree on these five big moves gaspar said when we have stuff going out to state legislature and it all references this direction it concerns me because we haven t agreed this is what we re doing poway mayor steve vaus and county supervisor jim desmond joined gaspar in pushing for the discussion which was approved by the full board but even some officials who support the vision said it would be fine to bring it back to the board for more discussion we ve come a long way on transparency said san diego mayor kevin faulconer this is incredibly important direction and i believe when we have this discussion it ll get considerable support from this table never fear the talk of definitions that ll give us clarity the definitions problem had already reared itself earlier in the meeting the board needed to let staff seek a state grant for an i 5 project that like the existing lanes on the i 15 would let cars use new hov lanes to avoid traffic for a price the state hasn t provided the funds yet and it s long been the plan for the i 5 project but it got caught up in the ongoing fight over the 5 big moves since congestion pricing is part of that plan friday board members were relieved to hear that the congestion pricing on i 5 would be limited to hov lanes they said it s possible they might not hate ikhrata s plan as much as they think if only they can hear a bit more detail about it santee mayor john minto for instance said ikhrata recently settled some of his fears when he confirmed there would still be some transnet funding to alleviate freeway congestion even though ikhrata had previously said transnet was out of money and the freeway projects included in it that haven t broken ground yet weren t likely to happen until we hear that in a board meeting i don t think anyone will really understand what we re talking about he said that s what i d like to talk about things i was told will be done until we hear them and it s memorialized in a board meeting until we do that there can be no absolute understanding that ll happen if you have any tips or feedback for the politics report email scott lewis voiceofsandiego org

on june 13 tanzania s minister of finance and planning phillipo mpango announced the decision to reinstate a tax on sanitary pads in the 2019 2020 budget triggering a major debate on the impact this tax will have on girls and women last year the same minister proposed scrapping the sanitary pad tax his recent announcement sparked public outrage especially from women who see the tax as gender based discrimination the minister explained that the tax exemption implemented last year had not achieved the intended effect to enable access to sanitary pads at affordable prices and therefore ensure better menstrual health management but the exemption did not reduce the retail price of sanitary pads instead it allowed traders to raise the rate of pads and increase their profits the minister stated that with this budget the government will reduce corporate income tax by 5 percent from 30 percent to 25 percent for investors who manufacture sanitary pads locally the purpose is to attract investors create employment opportunities for locals and reduce dependency on imports of menstrual sanitary products the price of periods the sanitary pad tax announcement comes months after the deputy minister of finance and planning ashatu kijaji hinted that it was a possibility on april 23 the deputy minister explained that her ministry had received complaints from consumers that sanitary pads were still highly priced she insisted that the ministry was looking for better options that would benefit both women and the government and mentioned the sanitary pad tax as a possibility earlier this year ummy mwalimu minister of health community development gender the elderly and children stated that her ministry had received letters urging the reduction of high prices on sanitary pads the average cost of having a period in tanzania is 36 000 tanzanian shillings or 15 63 united states dollars per year the current prices for disposable sanitary pads range from 2 000 tzs 87 usd to 4 000 tzs 1 74 usd depending on the brand in response to these complaints mwalimu wrote letters to the ministry of finance and planning and the ministry of trade and industry requesting them to direct manufacturers to reduce the prices on sanitary pads early this month upendo peneza a member of parliament requested the government to set indicative prices on sanitary pads an average fixed rate but the minister of industry and trade joseph kakunda explained that the government is only responsible for setting indicative prices for public goods and services and sanitary pads do not fall under that category mp peneza then requested a sit down between the government and stakeholders to discuss how sanitary tax exemption can reflect the needs of consumers instead of rushing to reinstate

pads in this country and these traders with illustrations informed us that they had reduced prices the problem was on the retail end that is where the pricing has not been reduced in her speech mp peneza s said the government has considered women s opinions it has considered tanzanians opinions it has considered the opinions from members of this parliament and that is why the tax was scrapped let us go back and sit down with the stakeholders dealing with sanitary pads from distributors consumers and other organisations so we can figure out how this reduction can benefit the citizens however rushing this is not right in 2016 i said that exempting tax alone is not enough however the government must come up with a system of how to protect the interests of consumers this was my move in 2016 this was my move in 2018 when i contributed on this same issue various parliamentary leaders also spoke against the reinstatement of the sanitary pads tax zitto kabwe mp representing kigoma ujiji argued that menstruation was biological and taxing sanitary pads was an injustice to women special seat mp sonia magogo said that one year was not enough time for the government to conclude that

especially in rural regions cannot afford sanitary pads and have to live without them dhalia mbaga a health specialist cited studies that show 91 percent of shops in rural areas in tanzania do not even sell pads and affordability remains the biggest challenge according to the daily nation period poverty is one cause of absenteeism among schoolgirls in rural areas some girls have never seen a sanitary pad and at times one pad is cut in half to share among two girls most times schoolgirls in rural areas use inappropriate and unhygienic materials such as rags raw cotton and maize cobs according to surveys conducted by snv netherlands development organization poor access to water and basic sanitation facilities in schools is one reason why school girls in rural tanzania choose to stay home when they have their period according to raleigh tanzania less than half the population have access to clean water and as little as 16 percent have access to adequate sanitation facilities in an editorial for the citizen writer anna bwana supported the use of reusable menstrual products such as cloth pads and menstrual cups because they last 3 to 10 years however in rural areas where

for better or worse iconic gayborhoods are getting way more expensive pricing out lgbt people in the process neighborhoods such as san francisco s castro district or new york s greenwich village have cultural and historical significance for the lgbt community and house a large lgbt population a home in the castro district values at nearly 1 8 million according to the housing app zillow while comparable homes in other neighborhoods in the city average 1 3 million that s a half million dollar difference the gayer the block the faster it rises in value amin ghaziani told usa today ghaziani is a professor of sociology at the university of british columbia and author of there goes the gayborhood constantly feeling on edge anti lgbt hate crimes are rising the fbi says but it gets worse ghaziani researched the increased gentrification and rising cost of gayborhoods and his findings show that areas with larger populations of same gender households correlate to real estate values that are higher than the average research by zillow released in may echoes these findings most gay neighborhoods have higher home values than their surroundings sometimes to the tune of double or triple the home value evidence also suggests the neighborhoods gay identities are eroding cleve jones a longtime lgbt activist in san francisco has said in recent years that the castro has largely sloughed off its gay identity in favor of a largely heterosexual techie population in time there will be gay flags but no gay people he told the financial times how did this happen historically lgbt people who have been unable to reside in well off neighborhoods whether due to high costs or discriminatory practices have flocked to urban neighborhoods even as many heterosexual families began relocating to the suburbs lgbt people formed their own enclaves in these areas building thriving businesses and booming communities and soon after families began moving back to cities pride month companies launch rainbow themed products and donate to lgbtq nonprofits the amenities and jobs near and in those urban centers made cohesive tolerant gayborhoods especially attractive places to live driving up housing costs in these communities sarah mikhitarian a senior economist at zillow told usa today the overall cost of living in big cities has risen drastically but ghaziani told usa today that developers and investors looked to where lgbt people are located in metropolitan cities as a strategy to increase their return on investment as masses of straight people wanted to move back to big cities he says that moneyed individuals looking to cash in on the urban boom followed the gays this is an exploitive strategy one that reduces the humanity of lgbtq people to their economic potential he said to usa today the spirit of equality and social justice is absent in this type of thinking his findings have shown that the population of lgbt people in gayborhoods has fallen research by florida state university professor petra doan shows that once the lgbt population has been ousted due to gentrification former gayborhoods become less welcoming to lgbt people contrary to the notion that gayborhood residents are affluent said ghaziani lgbt people are more likely to be in poverty while these neighborhoods still provide a sense of community and social acceptance residents often pay a hefty premium to live there mikhitarian said it s not just straight people a slew of housing conflicts are taking place not only just from straight transplants to gayborhoods but also between specific sects of the lgbt community the rising costs of gayborhoods disproportionately affect people of color women and trans women mikhitarian said for people at the intersection of any of these identities it s even worse because the pay gap is even larger she said 50 years after raid stonewall veterans return to new york city to celebrate pride additionally trans people are often harassed and attacked out of existing gayborhoods by its gay lesbian and bisexual population less than half of trans people doan surveyed felt that the gayborhoods they lived in are safe she found and though the lgbt population faces poverty as a whole wealth is further stratified within the lgbt community a study published in 2018 by the williams institute at the ucla school of law found that lesbian gay and bisexual people are more likely to be living in poverty than their straight peers lesbian and bisexual women however are worse off compared with gay and bisexual men making matters worse transgender people face higher rates of poverty than the rest of the lgbt population what can be done lgbt people must be able to afford living in a gayborhood if its culture is to be preserved and experts and community members say local governments can do more to help ghaziani said that city officials can do more for lgbt people in gayborhoods than just adorn it with rainbows while symbolic strategies like rainbow crosswalks help to mark a neighborhood as queer we need queer residents and business owners to convert a symbolic space into one that has real material significance in the lives of lgbtq people he told usa today these strategies include rent control for existing neighborhoods and financial incentives for lgbt owned businesses funded by local governments as policies shift toward ensuring that all areas of a city are safe for the lgbt community the human rights campaign conducts a municipal equality index annually which looks at how inclusive city laws policies and services treat a city s lgbt population opinion why we owe pride to black transgender women who threw bricks at cops and even if it can t be found in so called gayborhoods lgbt people still need access to safe affordable housing organizations such as the sf lgbt center and detroit s ruth ellis center offer housing services for lgbt people aiding in searches for affordable housing for poor lgbt folks and resources for first time lgbt homeowners it s important that we work on all fronts to ensure economic and cultural viability for the lgbtq community said rebecca rolfe sf lgbt center s executive director this includes advocating for strong affordable housing policies and direct service programs that break down economic barriers by providing trainings economic assistance or temporary housing options to those most in need
at the democratic presidential debate this week voters got a preview of how democrats will handle what for now is an uphill battle against president trump that challenging hill is the economy because it s doing well right now at least by the headline numbers unemployment is at 3 6 percent the lowest it s been in about 50 years and growth is still moving at a good clip consumer confidence is generally high despite a recent slip on top of that one key point despite trump s approval rating being stuck in the mid 40s he tends to do better on the economy all that could make trump s path to another term much easier so democrats are trying to thread a tricky needle telling voters that while the economy is doing well it is doing disproportionately well for the rich in other words the current good economy should be benefiting all of you more the economy is doing okay so what to improve there s evidence that the economy particularly bears on voters choices yale economist ray fair has a relatively well known model for predicting the popular vote based on economic indicators his latest prediction as of april that the democratic nominee will get 45 percent of the popular vote all of which is to say that if the economy is still doing well next year democrats may have to figure out how to tell people how things could be even better that s where the the economy isn t working for everyone idea comes in it s an idea that got a lot of play during the two debates it s of course been at the core of vermont sen bernie sanders stump speech for years it s a huge part of massachusetts

candidates a range of others this week minnesota sen amy klobuchar former texas rep beto o rourke entrepreneur andrew yang to name several made similar arguments one challenge they face is connecting with voters on this idea that the economy is fundamentally broken and in need of structural change one political problem with that argument is that it doesn t have a distinct villain just the 1 percent of richest americans or corporations thus far the candidates seem to have found two ways to address that problem and one is the trump tax cuts harris took aim at these at the debate stressing that the republican tax bill benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in america new york sen kirsten gillibrand and sanders likewise made similar arguments it s a line of attack that seizes on a concrete policy that at least as of tax day 2019 was broadly unpopular so it s easy to see this being a key line of attack for a democratic nominee in 2020 once again though it s easy to see how the argument that the rich are doing too well might not move voters who themselves feel more or less fine about the economy another line of attack democrats took in the debates was to connect the economy to particular topic areas like health care when it comes to their personal finances americans list health care costs as their top concern according to gallup it s perhaps no coincidence

disney heiress calls for wealth tax we have to draw a line it may come as no surprise that a strong majority of americans support a wealth tax a higher tax rate for a small number of millionaires and billionaires but what might be a surprise is that some of those millionaires and billionaires are calling for a wealth tax themselves abigail disney is one of those people her grandfather was roy disney co founder of the multi billion dollar entertainment conglomerate that bears her family name though she currently has no formal role with the company the activist and filmmaker has been speaking out on the issue of income inequality and specifically at disney she was one of 18 people in the top one tenth of the wealthiest 1 who first signed a recent letter to the 2020 presidential candidates supporting a tax for households with 50 million or more in assets nothing in history ever moved forward just because people advocated for their own interests disney tells all things considered things really change when people are traitors to their class and my class needs some really good traitors these days interview highlights on why she signed the letter we re not in a democracy all assigned with the task of advocating for ourselves we re assigned with the task of trying to create the best and strongest and fairest country we can create and what i ve watched over the last 30 years is rich people going from terribly rich to awfully rich to obscenely and insanely rich and we have to draw a line on why she prefers a wealth tax over philanthropic spending here s the world i want to live in i want to live in a world that doesn t need philanthropy and if jeff bezos earned less and paid his people more and didn t have 37 billion to put into a philanthropy and figure out what to do with there really wouldn t be that much philanthropy that was needed i would rather not to be needed as a philanthropist and i will never stop feeding the hungry and housing the homeless and all the other things that i want to do but i would so much prefer that public schools function that roads don t break your axle that people have health care which they have a right to have that low income people who work full time at minimum wage don t need food stamps to get through their days that s the world i want to live in on the crux of why she s speaking out against disney i know that company pretty well when you re in what is setting up to be the largest media and entertainment conglomerate on the planet in the history of the world and when you have record profits when your stocks are at record highs and you re going home with obscene amounts of money and i have no objection to obscene amounts of money in and of themselves my objection is you have 15 an hour workers who cannot buy enough food to eat they are rationing their insulin they are sleeping in their cars how do you jibe one thing with the other when you re running such an enormous conglomerate can you not break from orthodoxy what if you made less money and everybody else made some more you don t have to create a foundation to go feed those hungry people because you ve paid them fairly i have literally sat in a room with the people who pour your soda and the people who clean your room and scrape gum off the sidewalks who have told me i have to ration my insulin i have sat with them and i have felt a kind of rage that i don t even know how to describe to you those were the people that i was taught to revere so i m not really in fact in the business of just attacking disney because i can attack disney i know that if i say something about disney people pay more attention i could say something about ibm i could say something about walmart i could say something about a lot of things nobody would care and the fact is disney is kind of the last shame able company in a lot of ways on why the critique of disney has a different kind of power it s a different kind of brand this is a brand people feel actual love for i use the word love very mindfully here love and when somebody loves something they expect more of it than just the minimum allowable legal thing and so when you say to somebody about the disney brand the people pouring your soda cannot afford their insulin and the man in charge of them is coming home with a nine figure paycheck they do feel an outrage that is very visceral and i think that given that there are so few companies that can be shamed anymore this is a really important place to start a bigger broader conversation about all of these companies the thing is bob iger is kind of a nice guy and everybody around him are nice people what has become thought of as normal and the kind of thing nice people do isn t nice and somebody has to say the emperor s wearing no clothes somebody just has to say it i ve traveled everywhere in the world and everywhere you go you find a hands drawn painting of mickey mouse on the side of a children s school he has jumped out of the celluloid and he exists and he is a citizen of the world and everybody understands what he means and what he s for this is not true of any other brand that i can think of and so we have a special responsibility and that s why i feel the weight of this when i went last year and met with the workers at disneyland i could not shed the weight i was carrying once i went home from there i couldn t say nothing
it may come as no surprise that a strong majority of americans support a wealth tax a higher tax rate for a small number of millionaires and billionaires but what might be a surprise is that some of those millionaires and billionaires are calling for a wealth tax themselves abigail disney is one of those people her grandfather was roy disney co founder of the multibillion dollar entertainment conglomerate that bears her family name though she currently has no formal role with the company the activist and filmmaker has been speaking out on the issue of income inequality and specifically at disney she was one of 18 people in the top one tenth of the wealthiest 1 who first signed a recent letter to the 2020 presidential candidates supporting a tax for households with 50 million or more in assets nothing in history ever moved forward just because people advocated for their own interests disney tells all things considered things really change when people are traitors to their class and my class needs some really good traitors these days interview highlights on why she signed the letter we re not in a democracy all assigned with the task of advocating for ourselves we re assigned with the task of trying to create the best and strongest and fairest country we can create and what i ve watched over the last 30 years is rich people going from terribly rich to awfully rich to obscenely and insanely rich and we have to draw a line on why she prefers a wealth tax over philanthropic spending here s the world i want to live in i want to live in a world that doesn t need philanthropy and if jeff bezos earned less and paid his people more and didn t have 37 billion to put into a philanthropy and figure out what to do with there really wouldn t be that much philanthropy that was needed i would rather not to be needed as a philanthropist and i will never stop feeding the hungry and housing the homeless and all the other things that i want to do but i would so much prefer that public schools function that roads don t break your axle that people have health care which they have a right to have that low income people who work full time at minimum wage don t need food stamps to get through their days that s the world i want to live in on the crux of why she s speaking out against disney i know that company pretty well when you re in what is setting up to be the largest media and entertainment conglomerate on the planet in the history of the world and when you have record profits when your stocks are at record highs and you re going home with obscene amounts of money and i have no objection to obscene amounts of money in and of themselves my objection is you have 15 an hour workers who cannot buy enough food to eat they are rationing their insulin they are sleeping in their cars how do you jibe one thing with the other when you re running such an enormous conglomerate can you not break from orthodoxy what if you made less money and everybody else made some more you don t have to create a foundation to go feed those hungry people because you ve paid them fairly i have literally sat in a room with the people who pour your soda and the people who clean your room and scrape gum off the sidewalks who have told me i have to ration my insulin i have sat with them and i have felt a kind of rage that i don t even know how to describe to

weight of this when i went last year and met with the workers at disneyland i could not shed the weight i was carrying once i went home from there i couldn t say nothing on how her story would be told in a disney film about the granddaughter of the co founder turning against the empire i m turning against the empire itself it s like the empire went off in its own direction it s almost unrecognizable to me now and we have no family engagement on the company anymore there s nobody from the family on the board it s still my name i still use my credit card and i still feel all that comes with that and the expectations and people still say to me you must have had such a happy childhood oh how wonderful the gifts your grandfather and uncle gave to the world those are very lovely feelings and if i am welcoming to those kinds of perceptions i also have an obligation to attend to the rest of the ways in which it s not engaging with the world in a good way and it s actively promoting something that s really deleterious not just to the low income people they re destroying the middle class and they re having a go at democracy itself the walt disney co has responded to
