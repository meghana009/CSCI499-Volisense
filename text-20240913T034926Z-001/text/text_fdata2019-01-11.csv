pound sterling volatility dampened as brexit debates continue amid data heavy session pound sterling gbp price action was subdued during thursday s session with the pound sterling us dollar gbpusd exchange rate hovering just below the weekly high of 1 28036 while versus the euro eur the gbpeur x rate remained constrained to the mid lower part of the range which has capped price action over the last month volatility expectations declined as seen by the implied volatility following tuesday and wednesday s double defeats for the government on the brexit front which while no closer to a resolution saw mps back two votes which create further barriers to a no deal brexit scenario alvin tan fx strategist at societe generale commented the vote implies that parliament is taking a more muscular approach and asserting itself on the policy process which in turn implies the probability of a no deal brexit has fallen adding you can see that reflected not so much in the spot exchange rate but in the implied vol friday s session will see brexit debates resume in the house of commons ahead of the january 15th meaningful vote with pm may seemingly no closer to securing majority backing for her withdrawal agreement speculation has been growing over a motion of no confidence in the current government which if backed could prompt a general election and while leader of the opposition jeremy corbyn hasn t specified when such a motion will be tabled it s a case of when not if the distinct lack of volatility despite continued political turmoil is according to bnp paribas because enough downside is priced in for now in our view the fx market appears to have priced in enough political and economic uncertainty it s also a data heavy session for the pound sterling gbp and while economic statistics have taken a backseat to brexit developments over recent session investors will be paying attention to the myriad releases monthly gdp figures are expected to hold a static

pushing the gbpcad exchange rate to a fresh 3 week low in early friday trading given that oil exports account for around 10 of canadian exports the loonie s coupling with oil prices with a 3 month

trading with both west texas intermediate crude oil futures and brent crude oil firmly above 50 and 60 usd per barrel respectively hosen marjee senior portfolio manager at manulife asset management commented one thing that is going for canada right now is oil prices that a bit of a correlation is coming back that with the rally in the oil market we are benefiting friday s agenda lacks any

colombian financial services firm grupo aval nyse aval has disappointed investors like clockwork since it listed its shares on the new york stock exchange in september 2014 the company valued at 15 billion at the time of the ipo has a market capitalization of around 7 2 billion although dividend payments have been received along the way the price decline of the shares in usd has been 53 for the initial two years after its ipo aval traded down in line with bancolombia cib its nearest peer since then however its poor returns have also lagged on a relative basis as the below chart shows aval data by ycharts over the same period of time the colombian peso has declined in value by 39 from 1 998 cop to 1 usd to 3 249 effectively then bancolombia s stock has gained in local currency while aval has been lower by an additional twenty percentage points that relative underperformance has cost grupo aval s shareholders 3 billion in market capitalization it has also taken the valuation of the company to valuations that appear at least on the surface to be extremely cheap it now trades for about the same ratio to book value as bancolombia despite consistently earning higher returns on equity and on the basis of forward earnings aval is at a discount of 32 despite trading at a premium earnings valuation until the beginning 2018 aval pe ratio forward data by ycharts overview there are of course good reasons for the stock s poor performance most notably aval s declining fortunes can be traced to fears of escalating legal troubles at its investment banking subsidiary corficolombiana due to a partnership between a subsidiary of that company and brazilian firm odebrecht odebrecht has been found to have paid bribes in exchange for contracts in multiple countries throughout latin america that ongoing overhang coupled with emerging market concerns in 2018 have punished the stock despite the risks facing the company as well as the inherent volatility of emerging market banks aval is a well managed financial conglomerate with dominant market shares in both colombia and central america that regularly earns at least a mid teens return on equity it seems more likely than not that current prices present an attractive entry point for the shares although a return to historical multiples for aval is unlikely until the finality of the issues pressuring the stock should that happen it would imply a fair value for aval s adr of more than 10 a 55 increase from current prices over the next twenty four months sources of value luis carlos sarmiento founded grupo aval and continues to own approximately 80 of the company s shares in addition to owning minority stakes in many of the companies grupo aval consolidates in its financial statements his son now runs the company sarmiento began his business career in real estate development and expanded into the banking industry in the early 1970s at least in part to help provide financing options for his developments and in part because banking proved to be a fundamentally superior business to construction the predecessor to banco av villas was founded by him in 1972 and the year before that he purchased banco de occidente a bank based in cali colombia a banco de bogota branch in the city of cucuta source after continuing to make acquisitions of financial services companies grupo aval was formed as a means of consolidating these interests within one company and to create a shared platform to guide the overall group s operations and strategy aval might best be translated as surety and describes situations when a bank will guarantee payment on behalf of another party acciones y valores means shares and values the full name of the company grupo aval acciones y valores therefore seems to mean little more than being a literal statement of the fact that aval is a holding company and that the group s expertise and financial strength should be thought of inseparably from that of its constituent companies grupo aval s primary assets are its equity stakes in six financial companies five of which trade on the colombian stock market banco de bogota 69 ownership banco de occidente 72 banco popular 94 banco av villas 80 and corficolombiana 8 the first four companies are commercial banks while corficolombiana is a merchant bank the company additionally owns a 20 stake in non listed pension and severance fund asset manager porvenir aval relies on interlocking share ownership within its structure banco de bogota owns large stakes in corficolombiana 32 and porvenir 47 as well as full ownership of central american banking group bac credomatic additionally banco de occidente owns stakes in corficolombiana 4 and porvenir 33 while banco popular has a stake in corficolombiana 5 so analytically it makes more sense to look at grupo aval s subsidiaries from a look through perspective or indirectly rather than directly this is done so below by subtracting the equity amounts attributable to ownership in other subsidiaries from the core book value of the subsidiary for example in banco de bogota s case after subtracting the equity of bac credomatic and equity attributable to banco de bogota through its ownership in porvenir and corficolombiana a little less than 2 2 billion in equity remains 68 7 of which equals close to 1 5 billion the normalized roe figure is an estimate of what each subsidiary will earn on its book value in a normal year and is based on performance over the previous five years while different business segments may deserve different earnings multiples the share of normalized income for the group by each subsidiary is a good proxy for its contribution to the economic value of aval based on these normalized earnings the banking subsidiaries in colombia constitute 54 of grupo aval s gross asset value or the total value of the group before giving consideration to holding company assets and liabilities the central american banking operations constitute 26 asset management constitutes 18 and merchant banking 7 subsidiary contribution to grupo aval s equity and earnings power source grupo aval 2017 annual report and author estimates in addition to past annual reports of grupo aval the holding company also holds cash and a portfolio of loans to its subsidiaries as well as maintaining a debt balance the net amount of liabilities at the holding company net of its cash and loan portfolio is roughly 600 million this double leverage will amplify somewhat the returns being generated by the subsidiaries themselves using the income figures from above the group s normalized return on equity is about 13 however the current levels of leverage at the holding company mean that this figure for the group as a whole is actually about 15 strong positioning colombian commercial banking what potential investors ought to like about grupo aval is that in every segment it participates in it tends to have a dominant market position these strong positions by the subsidiaries are a major factor driving the generally strong economic returns outlined in the previous section although favorable conditions within the markets they operate in has also played a role in the group s success there is little question that the colombian banking system has been a profitable place from which to operate for some years now answering why is not as simple as it first appears of course it is true that banking there is a relatively concentrated industry the three main banking groups grupo aval bancolombia and davivienda control two thirds of the entire banking system while that is extremely high when compared to the united states where generally banks are not allowed to hold more than 10 of commercial banking deposits it is not as unusual around the world the chart below gives a handful of data points on many banking systems throughout latin america as well as some of the world s largest banking systems in order to give some context banking data overview for latin american nations in addition to select countries globally source bankscope database 2010 2016 except for largest bank and largest bank market share which is based on deposits which is compiled by the author from a variety of sources there are obviously a few significant factors that largely determine bank profitability market power along with the general level of interest rates and steepness of the yield curve and funding mixes help determine net interest margin market power is a major driver of non interest income while the size of the overall banking market and that of an individual firm can be a good indicator of efficiency there is an important note to make here in general concerning net interest margins they are not all created equal because not all lending is done in the same currency many american banks would be thrilled to have a net interest margin of 6 5 just not in argentine pesos banks that operate in less trusted currencies and within economies that are likely to experience high inflation need to demand relatively high net interest margins taking this all into account it is pretty clear that colombia s risk adjusted net interest margin has tended to be fairly mediocre for the part of the world in which it is located efficiency also tends to be only slightly better than regional peers clearly among the things that are different in colombia is the amount of non interest income captured by the commercial banking industry which is higher than all other latin american countries except argentina and nicaragua chart compiled from the data presented in the above chart fees may be a big reason why colombian banks are so profitable but it does not yet answer the question of why it cannot simply be a matter of market power a partial explanation may come from idiosyncratic factors and management decisions specific to colombia regulation also plays a major role despite there being a usury cap in colombia that gets reset every three months there is no specific regulation limiting banking fees ultimately some mix of the yield curve general economic conditions market concentration market size regulation and management skill combine to determine the profitability of a country s banking system and the concoction in colombia has been favorable to investors for many years of course aval s positioning within the colombian market matters immensely as well and it is extremely strong ranking first in deposits and second in loans its profitability is more than 40 higher than its peers market shares of colombia s leading banks as well as return on average assets for the year 2017 source grupo aval 2017 annual report and banco de la republica note that the roaa figure is post tax whereas the previous data presented by country was pre tax the individual banks that make up grupo aval are focused on individual business lines and geographical areas on an unconsolidated basis they are the second fifth eighth and tenth largest banks in the country banco de bogota and banco de occidente are more focused on making commercial loans with banco de occidente somewhat more focused on small and medium enterprises while banco popular and banco av villas are more focused on the consumer side banco popular lends significantly to the public sector and also specializes in payroll loans while banco av villas is the strongest aval entity in mortgages mix of loans by bank 2017 source grupo aval 2017 annual report the segment with the highest share is highlighted in aggregate grupo aval is the clear leader in consumer lending in the country while also coming in a relatively close second to bancolombia in commercial lending market shares of colombian banks in loans by loan type the bank with the highest share in the segment is highlighted source grupo aval 2017 annual report while i am very positive on grupo aval prospects in aggregate i am not particularly positive on this aspect of their strategy it is true that utilizing shared services helps to limit inefficiency and the aval brand is often used in conjunction with the individual subsidiaries in colombia customers of one bank can also access the group s overall atm and branch network but it is still the case that in terms of brand building competitors can focus on nurturing and building a single brand s value and having four brands means duplicitous branches for companies that have relatively similar market shares as grupo aval and bancolombia do aval has nearly double the branches at 1 427 versus 727 grupo aval is stronger in consumer banking which requires relatively more branches but even if commercial loans are excluded grupo aval has about 9 0 million in net loans outstanding per branch versus 13 5 million for bancolombia it is hard to believe that opportunities do not exist to rationalize this network somewhat even without consolidating brands the company is not unaware of this opportunity and is focused on driving expenses lower both through branch closures and driving some transactions online efficiency will be a key area for investors to monitor in the future central american commercial banking aval s central american banking unit bac credomatic is the largest in the region according to the company that statement is simultaneously true and misleading since the company s position does not come from being the largest bank in any of the countries in which it operates but instead from operating in every country in the region the small country of belize is the only one in central america that grupo aval does not have a presence in total bac credomatic has a 10 share of central american loans and 9 share of deposits bancolombia operating in panama el salvador and guatemala has 9 of loans and 8 of deposits banco general primarily operating in panama has 8 of loans and 7 of deposits and banco industrial guatemala s largest bank has 6 of loans as well as deposits bac credomatic s position by country the net income figures are before central group costs market rank is sourced from various sources while the remaining figures are from grupo aval s 2017 annual report in no country does aval hold the leading share ranging anywhere from 2nd to 4th but it does have greater diversification than any other group in the region the benefits of diversification will vary from situation to situation and sometimes concentration has greater benefits in central america though periodic volatility means that a broadly diversified business can be greatly beneficial in aggregate the bank has been incredibly profitable as well operating in some very attractive banking markets while return on equity has been a little lower than in colombia the bank does carry goodwill from aval s acquisition and its return on tangible equity is somewhat higher than its reported return on equity merchant banking and asset management through corficolombiana the group is exposed to investment banking and corficolombiana performs most of the typical functions associated with investment banking such as activity in capital markets trading brokerage services and treasury operations when investment banks were first established in colombia in the late 1950s the government chartered them as vehicles to help spur activity in the real economy by making equity and debt investments and then providing consulting and advisory services to those companies to improve efficiency in important sectors corficolombiana building bogota source author s own photo corficolombiana s private equity portfolio today is heavily concentrated in energy and infrastructure investments while also having some exposure to agriculture and hotels among the energy investments is a 50 stake in colombia s largest natural gas transmission and distribution business promigas which transports half of colombia s natural gas as well as having a large distribution business in both colombia and peru the infrastructure investments include several road concessions as well as the airport in cartagena corficolombiana s mix of assets and profits source corficolombiana obviously the investment portfolio is of much greater importance to the company than the financial activities it performs bancolombia s banca de inversion has a similar model to corficolombiana although with a different portfolio focus after those two companies the largest investment banks in the country who seem to purely focus on traditional investment banking are jp morgan bnp paribas and itau the asset management business is divided into mandatory severance and individual categories author s own photo mandatory funds operate similarly to the social security system in the united states both individuals and their employer make contributions required by law in order to provide for an eventual pension currently the employer contributes 12 of an employee s salary and the employee contributes an additional 4 the difference in colombia is that private companies play a role in managing these funds employees can select a private fund manager or a public entity to manage their funds while individuals can change their selection of which entity manages their fund they generally cannot simply withdraw their funds from the system prior to retirement severance funds also arise from legal requirements employees are entitled to one month severance for each year of service to their company if their employment is terminated these funds are required to be deposited with a fund manager so they are available in the event an employee is terminated the severance fund manager is chosen by the employer voluntary funds arise as a result of a voluntary benefit provided by an employer or the result of a voluntary fund created by an individual porvenir s market share overall and within each category in which it operates source grupo aval 2017 annual report like the other businesses grupo aval participates in this one is oligopolistic and grupo aval has the leading position within that oligopoly the private industry is composed of only four firms meaning that even in situations when a public option is considered porvenir s competition is limited to four other entities besides itself its position is first overall and first in mandatory and severance funds and third in voluntary funds porvenir s principal competitor is proteccion which is part of grupo sura colombia s largest insurer grupo sura is a part of the same business group that bancolombia belongs to although the two are separate entities the other two competitors are colfondos a part of the scotiabank colpatria organization and old mutual a south african insurance and investment group porvenir s economics may be among the best within grupo aval its earnings stream is directly tied to growth in the labor force and wage growth and it participates in a regulated oligopoly providing a mandatory service little wonder it earns returns on equity of around 25 per year ruta del sol and potential legal problems despite discussing so far the impressive positioning of many of the entities within grupo aval there are obviously some serious risks to the stock if not then there would not be an opportunity to purchase shares at a potential discount one enormous overhang has been corfocolombiana s past relationship with brazilian construction firm odebrecht the relationship dates back to 2009 when a company that was majority owned by odebrecht and minority owned by a subsidiary of corficolombiana won a concession to construct the second sector ruta del sol a road connecting central colombia to the caribbean in 2016 odebrecht reached a settlement with the united states switzerland and brazil in which it admitted to paying almost 800 million in bribes throughout multiple countries odebrecht originally admitted to paying 11 million in bribes within colombia but this figure has now been revised to more than 30 million early in 2017 the former vice minister of transportation in colombia gabriel garcia morales was arrested for accepting bribes from odebrecht including a bribe of 6 5 million to steer the ruta del sol contract their way then in may of the same year the former ceo of corficolombiana jose elias melo was also charged based on prosecutors belief that he was aware of and participated in the payment grupo aval has steadfastly maintained that it had no knowledge of this bribe by odebrecht until december 2016 when the united states justice department released its findings but odebrecht has disputed this the colombian superintendency of industry and commerce sic made two formal charges against grupo aval and some employees this past september the company was charged with collusive practices and individuals including sarmiento were charged with benefiting from a conflict of interest things again took a turn this past november when jorge enrique pizano was found dead of a heart attack pizano was the controller for the ruta del sol project and he has stated that as far back as 2013 he warned about irregular payment activity related to it following his death additional documents and recordings circulated widely including recordings of conversations that he had with corficolombiana s legal counsel who is now colombia s attorney general the recordings indicate that information was ultimately passed to luis carlos sarmiento a united states probe of the project followed in december potentially worrisome because investors know that the united states justice department is far more likely to take action than colombian authorities stripping out the drama of the story what fundamentally matters here to investors there are a few scenarios to be wary of for one a corporation s name constantly appearing in the headlines in connection to corruption is generally bad for business it is possible that even without any findings of guilt on the part of grupo aval customers could leave the bank secondly the company could be liable for monetary penalties in the case of the sic charges aval could be on the hook for 24 5 million finally if significantly more serious wrongdoing is found to have taken place more drastic consequences could follow odebrecht for example was fined 250 million and banned from government contracts for ten years the final scenario seems far fetched odebrecht admitted to paying bribes in an amount equal to about six times that of the amount in question regarding ruta del sol additionally with such a significant time passing since the revelation of corruption regarding the ruta del sol project it is becoming less and less likely that a smoking gun emerges it should also be stated that being aware of payment irregularities is not equivalent to having an understanding of precisely what odebrecht was doing grupo aval has stated that it will defend itself against the charges of the sic but a settlement of some kind resulting in monetary damages less than the maximum amount would not result in direct catastrophic damage to the company that leaves the first scenario to be most nervous about at least through the third quarter it does not appear to have come to fruition but a great deal of action occurred in q4 and investors should continue to be mindful of the trends here comparison of bancolombia s top and grupo aval s bottom q3 loan growth by segment within colombia versus the prior year aval s growth exceeded bancolombia s source grupo aval and bancolombia q3 earnings reports the colombian economy and tax reform the general economic climate in colombia as well as central america is obviously important to the company s performance but the level of the colombian peso and tax reform in the country are two important areas of focus after complicated and controversial negotiations a tax reform package has been signed into law and effective with the first of the year while earlier renditions of the bill would have been more favorable to grupo aval the final version is still modestly positive the previous corporate income tax rate was 33 but that did not include a 4 surcharge on companies earning over a certain threshold the new law eliminates this surcharge and gradually reduces the corporate income tax rate to 30 by 2022 offsetting this reduction is a new 4 surcharge on financial institutions that will also gradually recede each year the net effect will be a 37 tax rate in 2019 the same as 2018 35 in 2020 and 33 in 2021 the general economic situation remains less robust than it was prior to oil s 2014 collapse but has firmed in 2018 crude oil makes up about a quarter of the country s exports followed by coal coffee refined petroleum gold and flowers in addition to influencing the current account deficit and thus the value of the currency commodity prices also impact the fiscal balance in a large way because of the government s 88 ownership of ecopetrol ec which controls a majority of the country s oil production lower oil prices have meant fiscal consolidation detracting from the private economy source oecd predicting oil prices is a fool s errand and while shale production in the united states probably caps prices current oil prices are causing some supply to be removed valuation and downside risks the most straightforward means of valuing grupo aval is to look at where it has traded historically which is at a 12x earnings multiple and 1 8x book multiple averaging those two approaches gives a fair value of about 9 per adr aval s 2019 earnings are based on the company s guidance of a 16 5 return on equity in the year grupo aval s fair value based upon historical multiples and 2019 earnings and 2020 earnings in 2020 we will see about a 3 lift in earnings from a lower tax rate continued efficiency gains and strong loan growth which should push earnings higher perhaps to around 0 90 per share yielding a future value at that time of more than 10 per adr further my own estimates are hardly euphoric although only followed by two analysts currently their estimates have aval earning 0 87 in 2019 and 0 95 in 2020 there is little doubt that significant upside exists but of course the opportunity is existing because of risks to the valuation it would be wise for investors to consider the downside somewhat more than the upside the most significant risk comes from the ongoing ruta del sol scandal and quantifying this risk is not easy the 24 5 million in direct penalties faced by the company is equivalent to only between 02 and 03 per adr so it is not significant the fall out for the company if the investigation turns up more damaging revelations could be far worse corficolombiana makes up 6 of the company s value so in the extreme example of corficolombiana going to zero the company would actually survive pretty much in tact but grupo aval controlled that company and would be held indirectly responsible for its actions let s consider a doomsday scenario in which corficolombiana s value is completely eroded the fallout causes the company s corporate loan book to decline by 5 and a 250 million fine is levied against the company the same as odebrecht further we can assume that the stench of the scandal would prevent the market from re rating shares back to its historical multiple of 12x earnings this would add up to a little more than 11 of the current market cap of the company even this seems like a wildly improbable scenario a fine equivalent to odebrecht s would be extremely high given the seriousness of their conduct remember odebrecht ran an intentional scheme of defrauding governments over multiple years grupo aval is essentially being accused of becoming aware of odebrecht s scheme in a particular instance and either not disclosing it or actively deciding to play along and the evidence thus far seems to indicate that the company became aware of accounting irregularities but not necessarily the source of those irregularities while not being able to assign specific probabilities to each scenario investors are essentially facing scenario a which is overwhelmingly likely that the stock gradually moves back to its historical multiples in the range of 12x earnings and a price of around 9 per adr with kickers in future years for efficiency initiatives and a better tax rate versus an extremely improbable scenario in which the stock re tests its lows around 10 15 beneath its current price in the range of 5 75 per adr conclusion risk creates opportunity there are certainly some risks currently embedded within shares of grupo aval that have been discussed in this article the biggest of those risks would be further fallout from the ruta del sol investigations in either the united states or colombia or adverse findings from those jurisdictions secondarily emerging market weakness and dollar strength could continue into 2019 and cap any us dollar gains made by grupo aval i think currently that these risks do not surmount the opportunity in the shares presently the company is guiding to a 16 5 return on equity in 2019 at the present exchange rate that implies earnings per adr of between 0 78 and 0 79 meaning the adr s trade at just 8x earnings they also trade at a mere 1 36x book value of 4 75 after trading at an average multiple of 1 8x for an extended period of time that implies a fair value of 9 per adr before considering coming tax benefits and efficiency gains other risks besides the company s own legal risks may actually be favorable to the shares as oil prices have been at a relative low and the federal reserve now appears poised to halt interest rate rises for the time being both of those factors in addition to banco de la republica s likelihood of raising interest rates in colombia this year are likely to be supportive of a stronger colombian peso versus the u s dollar finally there are some company specific positives to be mindful of the company has a great opportunity to drive efficiencies throughout its massive network over the next several years and tax reform means that starting in 2020 the group will have an earnings tailwind each year of 200 bps equal to about 2 5 in earnings it certainly does not hurt that the company pays a monthly dividend equivalent to an annualized 5 yield grupo aval presents more risk than a typical security at present but for those willing to assume it there are good reasons to believe that near term rewards will be even greater
content supplied by the world gold council as we look ahead we expect that the interplay between market risk and economic growth in 2019 will drive gold demand and we explore three key trends that we expect will influence its price performance financial market instability monetary policy and the us dollar structural economic reforms against this backdrop we believe that gold has an increasingly relevant role to play in investors portfolios 2018 ups and downs gold s price seesawed in 2018 as investor interest ebbed and flowed despite steady growth in most sectors of demand gold faced significant headwinds for most of the year the dollar strengthened the fed continued to hike steadily while other central banks kept policy accommodative and the us economy was lifted by the trump administration s tax cuts these factors fuelled positive investor sentiment which in turn pushed us stock prices higher at least until the start of october but as geopolitical and macroeconomic risks continued to increase emerging market stocks pulled back eventually developed market stocks followed in a selloff led by us tech companies this resulted in short covering in gold with its price ending the year near us 1 280 oz 1 y o y as of 31 december 2018 based on named indices wti front future bbg commodities index new frontier global balance index lbma gold price bloomberg barclays global treasury index solactive long usd gold index potential for growth and heightened risk in 2019 we expect that many of the global dynamics seeded over the past two years and the risks that became apparent later in 2018 will carry over and with them we see a set of trends developing that will be key in determining gold s demand in turn their interplay will be most relevant for gold s short and long term price behaviour focus 1 we expect increased market uncertainty and the expansion of protectionist economic policies will make gold increasingly attractive as a hedge while gold may face headwinds from higher interest rates and us dollar strength these effects are expected to be limited as the fed has signalled a more neutral stance structural economic reforms in key gold markets will continue to support demand for gold in jewellery technology and as means of savings 1 financial market instability globally there were net positive flows into gold backed etfs in 2018 while north american funds suffered significant outflows in q2 and q3 this trend started to shift in q4 as risks intensified chart 2 we believe that in 2019 global investors will continue to favour gold as an effective diversifier and hedge against systemic risk and we see higher levels of risk and uncertainty on multiple global metrics expensive valuations and higher market volatility political and economic instability in europe potential higher inflation from protectionist policies increased likelihood of a global recession focus 1 drivers of gold gold has a dual nature consumption and investment and gold price drivers can be grouped into four categories wealth and economic expansion market risk and uncertainty opportunity cost momentum and positioning as a consumer good and long term savings vehicle gold demand historically has been positively correlated to economic growth as a safe haven its demand historically has been strongly responsive to periods of heightened risk in the short and medium term however the level of rates or the relative strength of currencies as well as investor expectations can either enhance or dampen gold s performance see the relevance of gold as a strategic asset january 2018 as of 31 december 2018 first despite the recent market correction many stock valuations remain elevated especially in the us after almost a decade of almost uninterrupted price appreciation yet bond yields remain stubbornly low chart 3 even in the us the 10 year treasury yield is 1 5 below its 2008 pre lehman crisis level providing investors less cushion in case of further market volatility indeed volatility metrics have begun to creep up with the vix jumping from an average of 13 in q3 2018 to an average of 21 in q4 as of 30 november 2018 second while european growth has recovered from the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis it has failed to reach the level of the us economy making it more vulnerable to shocks and explaining why europeans have been adding gold to their portfolios steadily since early 2016 today europe is facing major challenges the most obvious is brexit not only has it imposed a continuous level of unease among investors but its timing and implications both for the uk and for continental europe are best left to diviners what is certain however is that clarity will not come any time soon in addition continental europe continues to face internal turmoil france is grappling with social unrest spain is fending off secessionism and fragile political alliance and italy s populist government continues to highlight the inherent instability of the monetary union to name just a few third more and more governments around the world seem to be embracing protectionist policies as a counter movement after decades of globalization and while many of these policies can have a temporary positive effect there are longer term consequences that investors will likely grapple with in the coming years for example higher inflation protectionist policies are inherently inflationary either as a result of higher labour and manufacturing costs or as a result of higher tariffs imposed to promote local producers over foreign ones they are also expected to have a negative effect on long term growth and although so far investors have taken some of the trade war rhetoric as posturing it is not without risk to restrict the flow of capital goods and labour as of 30 november 2018 combined these trends have increased the risk of recession for example in the us there are a few signs that investors are becoming wary a good percentage of the growth seen in 2018 was a byproduct of tax cuts but similar measures may be more difficult to enact with a split congress there has also been a deterioration of credit markets with spreads widening by more than 70bps 50 since the january 2018 lows while credit conditions for consumers are tightening in addition the us treasury curve is very flat the 2s 10s curve currently stands at 13bps a level of curve flattening last seen before the 2008 financial crisis with some economists predicting its inversion in the first half of 2019 while an inverted yield curve does not cause recessions it has generally preceded them albeit with a long lead and it indicates that bond investors are concerned about the sustainability of long term growth 2 the impact of rates and the dollar while market risk will likely remain high two factors could limit gold s upside higher interest rates and us dollar strength higher us interest rates alone are not enough to deter investors from buying gold as seen between 2004 and 2007 or 2016 and the early part of 2018 and while higher interest rates combined with a strong dollar can dampen gold s performance there are reasons to believe that the upward trend of the us dollar may be losing steam first the us dollar dxy index which measures the relative direction of the dollar against a basket of key currencies has already appreciated by almost 10 from its 2008 lows a similar trend in 2016 was followed by a significant correction as of 30 november 2018 second the positive effect of higher us rates on the dollar will diminish as the fed policy stance becomes neutral especially since the recent us dollar strength was fuelled in part by the more accommodative monetary policy maintained by other central banks chart 5 third the trump administration has often voiced frustration about competitive disadvantage caused by a strong us dollar finally emerging market central banks continue to diversify exposure to the us dollar 3 structural economic reforms emerging markets making up 70 of gold consumer demand are very relevant to the long term performance of gold and among these india and china stand out these two countries have begun to implement economic changes necessary to promote growth and secure their relevance in the global landscape china s belt and road initiative for example is focused on promoting regional economic development boosting commodity markets and upgrading infrastructure see the economic outlook for china gold investor october 2018 india has been active in modernising its economy reducing barriers to commerce and promoting fiscal compliance in fact india s economy is expected to grow by 7 5 in 2018 and 2019 outpacing most global economies and showing resilience to geopolitical uncertainty given its unequivocal link to wealth and economic expansion we believe gold is well poised to benefit from these initiatives we also believe that gold jewellery demand will strengthen in 2019 if sentiment is positive while increase marginally should uncertainty remain similarly efforts to promote economic growth in western markets are expected to result in positive consumer demand as has been observed generally in the us since 2012 why gold why now gold s performance in the near term is heavily influenced by perceptions of risk the direction of the dollar and the impact of structural economic reforms as it stands we believe that these factors likely will continue to make gold attractive in the longer term outlook gold will be supported by the development of the middle class in emerging markets its role as an asset of last resort and the ever expanding use of gold in technological applications in addition central banks continue to buy gold to diversify their foreign reserves and counterbalance fiat currency risk particularly as emerging market central banks tend to have high allocations of us treasuries central bank demand for gold in 2018 alone was the highest since 2015 as a wider set of countries added gold to their foreign reserves for diversification and safety more generally there are four attributes that make gold a valuable strategic asset by providing investors a more tactical opportunity in addition gold speculative positioning in futures markets remains low by historical standards after hitting record lows in the final months of 2018 cme managed money net long positions stand near record low since 2006 when data was first broken down by investor type furthermore net combined speculative positions which go back further are negative for the first time since december 2001 and large net short positions have historically created buying opportunities for strategic investors as such positions are prone to short covering adding momentum to rallies in the gold price chart 6

by ra√∫l ilargi meijer an editor at automatic earth originally published at automatic earth in the new year after a close to the old one that was sort of terrible for our zombie markets do prepare for a whole lot of stories about china on top of brexit and yellow vests and many more windmills fighting the donald and don t count on too many positive ones that don t originate in the country itself beijing will especially be full of feel good tales about a month from now around chinese new year 2019 which is february 5 and we won t get an easy and coherent true story it ll be bits and pieces stitched together what will remain is that china did the same we did just on steroids it took us 100 years to build our manufacturing capacity they did it in under 20 and made ours obsolete it took us 100 years to borrow enough to get a debt to gdp ratio of 300 they did it in 10 in the process they also accumulated 10 times more non productive assets than us idle factories bridges to nowhere and empty cities but they thought that would be alright that demand would catch up with supply and if you look at how much unproductive stuff we ourselves have gathered around us who can blame them for thinking that perhaps their biggest mistake has been misreading our actual wealth situation they didn t see how poorly off we really are xiang songzuo a relatively obscure economics professor at renmin university in beijing expressed some dire warnings about the chinese economy in a december 15 speech he didn t get much attention not even in the west not overly surprising since both beijing and wall street have a vested interest in the continuing china growth story but with the arrival of 2019 that attention started slowly seeping through former associate professor of business and economics at the peking university hsbc business school in shenzhen christopher balding left china 6 months ago after losing his job at the time he wrote china has reached a point where i do not feel safe being a professor and discussing even the economy business and financial markets and noting a change that very much seems related to what is coming down the road one of my biggest fears living in china has always been that i would be detained though i happily pointed out the absurdity of the rapidly encroaching authoritarianism a fact which continues to elude so many experts not living in china i tried to make sure i knew where the line was and did not cross it there is a profound sense of relief to be leaving safely knowing others chinese or foreigners who have had significantly greater difficulties than myself there are many cases which resulted in significantly more problems for them i know i am blessed to make it out a few days ago balding wrote this on twitter most experts dismissed the speech by xiang songzuo claiming chinese gdp growth could be as low as 1 67 as implausible no we didn t the gs pe guy and the pku dean have every reason to deny it car and mobile phone shipment down 2 and 16 are not a 6 5 growth economy that certainly sets the tone of the discussion gdp growth of 1 67 vs the official 6 5 smartphone shipments down 16 car sales slumping not the kind of numbers you ll hear from beijing and balding does know china whether they like it or not on monday bloomberg where he was is a regular contributor published this from his hand china has a dangerous dollar debt addiction officially china lists its outstanding external debt at 1 9 trillion for a 13 trillion economy that s not a major amount but focusing on the headline number significantly understates the underlying risks short term debt accounted for 62 of the total as of september according to official data meaning that 1 2 trillion will have to be rolled over this year just as worrying is the speed of increase total external debt has increased 14 in the past year and 35 since the beginning of 2017 external debt is no longer a trivial slice of china s foreign exchange reserves which stood at just over 3 trillion at the end of november little changed from two years earlier short term foreign debt increased to 39 of reserves in september from 26 in march 2016 the true picture may be more precarious china s external debt was estimated at between 3 trillion and 3 5 trillion by daiwa capital markets in an august report in other words total foreign liabilities could be understated by as much as 1 5 trillion after accounting for borrowing in financial centers such as hong kong new york and the caribbean islands that isn t included in the official tally circumstances aren t moving in china s favor the nation s companies rushed to borrow in dollars when there was a 3 to 5 spread between chinese and u s interest rates and the yuan was expected to strengthen borrowing offshore was cheaper and offered the additional bonus of likely currency gains now the spread in official short term yields has shrunk to near zero and the yuan has been depreciating for most of the past year refinancing debt in dollars has become harder and more risky beijing s policies have exacerbated the buildup of foreign debt to promote xi jinping s belt and road initiative the president s landmark foreign policy endeavor china has been borrowing dollars on international markets and lending around the world for everything from kenyan railways to pakistani business parks with this year and 2020 being the peak years for repayments china faces dollar funding pressure to repay their dollar debts chinese firms will either have to draw from the central bank s foreign exchange reserves a prospect beijing is unlikely to allow or buy dollars on international markets this creates a new set of problems there are only 617 billion yuan 90 billion of offshore renminbi deposits in hong kong available to buy dollars if china was to push firms to bring debt back onshore this would necessitate significant outflows that would push down the yuan s value against the dollar the xiang songzuo speech was also noted by the financial times this week their conclusions are not much rosier recent us imports from china look good only because both buyers and sellers try to stay ahead of tariffs and whole some truce or another there may smoothen things a little china must launch a massive stimulus against the background of twice as much investment being needed for a unit of gdp growth nervous markets how vulnerable is china s economy a relatively obscure economics professor at renmin university in beijing sparked a minor furore last month when he claimed a secret government research group had estimated china s growth in gdp could be as low as 1 67 in 2018 far below the officially published rate of 6 7 for the year up to september most experts dismissed the speech by xiang songzuo as implausible despite longstanding doubts about the reliability of china s official gdp data yet although discussion of his claims was quickly scrubbed from the chinese internet the presentation has been viewed more than 1 2m times on youtube an indication of the raw nerve mr xiang touched with his doom laden warnings the question that is hanging over global markets is just how vulnerable is china to a much sharper slowdown ominously the recent downturn has occurred even though the expected hit to chinese exports from the trade war has not yet materialised in fact analysts say exports probably received a one off boost in recent months as traders front loaded shipments to beat the expected tariff rise from 10 to 25 that us president donald trump threatened would take effect in january that rise is now on hold due to the 90 day truce that mr trump agreed with chinese president xi jinping at the g20 meeting in argentina last month the amount of new capital investment required to generate a given unit of gdp growth has more than doubled since 2007 according to moody s analytics in other words investment stimulus produces little bang for beijing s buck even as it adds to the debt levels they will soon have no choice but to launch massive stimulus says alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist at natixis in hong kong they do not want to give away their credibility because they said they wouldn t do it but there is no time to be cautious any more not having growth is ultimately the worst outcome of all christopher whalen picks up on xiang songzuo s speech as well and quotes him saying that chinese stock market conditions resemble those during the 1929 wall street crash whereas the china beige book states that sales volumes output domestic and export orders investment and hiring fell on a year over year and quarter over quarter basis which leads to the conclusion that deflation is or should be beijing s main worry oh and chinese consumer demand has weakened something we ve seen more off recently reuters headlines china to introduce policies to strengthen domestic consumption today but that headline could have come from any of the past 5 years or so domestic consumption is precisely china s problem and they can t achieve nearly enough growth there china s stability is at risk foreign investors have convinced themselves that the chinese communist party ccp is superior in terms of economic management this despite ample evidence to the contrary thus accepting the official view is easy but also increasingly risky in a december 15 speech renmin university s xiang songzuo warned that chinese stock market conditions resemble those during the 1929 wall street crash he also suggested that the chinese economy is actually shrinking china growth tesla profitability or the mystical blockchain all require more credulity than ever before for example in the first half of 2016 global capital markets stopped due to fear of a chinese recession credit spreads soared and deal flows disappeared but was this really a surprise in fact the chinese government had accelerated official stimulus in 2015 and 2016 to counter a possible slowdown and particularly ensure a quiet domestic scene as paramount leader xi jinping was enshrined into the chinese constitution today western audiences are again said to be concerned about china s economy and this concern is justified but perhaps not for the reasons touted in the financial media the china beige book cbb fourth quarter preview released december 27 reports that sales volumes output domestic and export orders investment and hiring fell on a year over year and quarter over quarter basis cbb is a research service that surveys thousands of companies and bankers on the ground in china every quarter contrary to the positive foreign narrative about growth in china cbb contends that deflation is the bigger threat compared to inflation because of china s structural problems deflation has very clearly emerged as the bigger threat in a slowing economy than inflation consumer demand has weakened and you see that reflected in retail and services prices cbb managing director shehzad qazi said in an interview so china phone shipments are down 16 as per balding but tim cook says apple s never done better still if that 16 number is correct either apple or its chinese suppliers are doing worse not better and 16 is a lot despite recent battering tim cook says apple s ecosystem has never been stronger apple inc stock has taken a beating in recent months but chief executive tim cook defended his company tuesday and expressed optimism that trade tensions with china would soon ease apple shares have fallen by more than one third since their peak on oct 3 and tumbled further last week after the tech giant warned of disappointing iphone sales in its holiday quarter but in an interview tuesday with cnbc s jim cramer cook said the company was still going strong and its naysayers were full of bologna here s the truth what the facts are cook said about reports of slow iphone xr sales according to a cnbc transcript since we began shipping the iphone xr it has been the most popular iphone every day every single day from when we started shipping until now i mean do i want to sell more of course i do of course i d like to sell more and we re working on that slower sales in china also contributed to apple s lowered forecast and cook said tuesday he believes that situation to be temporary we believe based on what we saw and the timing of it that the tension the trade war tension with the u s created this more sharp downturn he said cook said he s very optimistic a trade deal between the u s and china will be reached i think a deal is very possible and i ve heard some very encouraging words he said 16 fewer phones that gets you the second production cut at apple and its magnificent ecosystem in short order now sure cook can try and blame the tariffs but samsung s q4 2018 sales fell 11 and its operating profit fell by 29 it s a bigger and wider issue and china is at the heart of it apple cuts q1 production plan for new iphones by 10 apple which slashed its quarterly sales forecast last week has reduced planned production for its three new iphone models by about 10 for the january march quarter the nikkei asian review reported on wednesday that rare forecast cut exposed weakening iphone demand in china the world s biggest smartphone market where a slowing economy has also been buffeted by a trade war with the united states many analysts and consumers have said the new iphones are overpriced apple asked its suppliers late last month to produce fewer than planned units of its xs xs max and xr models the nikkei reported citing sources with knowledge of the request the request was made before apple announced its forecast cut the nikkei said and very much not least there was this graph of chinese investments in africa what are the conditions at what point will they call back the loans and when countries can t pay back what s the penalty how much of this has been provided by beijing in us dollars it doesn t have nearly enough of it s like the much heralded belt and road project or silk road 2 0 isn t it where the first batch of participating nations have started sounding the alarm over loan conditions yes it sounds great i admit but i have long said that in reality belt road is china s ingenious scheme to export its industrial overcapacity and force other countries to pay for it it s like the model rome had and the us still do just all in one single project and this one has a name and it can be expanded to africa but no i don t see it i think china s debt combined with the vast distance it still has from owning a global reserve currency will call the shots not xi jinping china won t be taking over at least not anytime soon

with reis thebault the ticker the trump administration s bid to seize more unilateral tariff power from congress looks dead on arrival key lawmakers from both parties are throwing cold water on the proposal which the administration is weighing whether to roll out in the state of the union address later this month bloomberg news reports if anything members of congress appear inclined to seize some agency back from the trump team when it comes to trade policy but the fact that the white house is considering requesting the authority to issue new tariffs product by product underlines a bracing reality even as trump officials appear to be making progress in trade negotiations with beijing the administration s wider trade war is far from over the commerce department for example is still preparing a recommendation on imposing duties on imports of autos and parts a move if it comes that would represent a major escalation of trump s offensive with european trading partners and

by a truth about movements is they move they morph evolve and move around a country or even around the globe this occurs over months and often over years the us occupy encampment era occurred ten months after the arab spring and six months after the spanish indignado movement early versions of occupy it started in new york and then spread across the united states and to other countries it was a global revolt against the 1 that changed politics in the united states and continues to have impacts today the yellow vest gilets jaunes movement in france is having a major impact and gaining international attention already spreading to other nations with some nations like egypt banning the sale of yellow vests to prevent the protest from spreading there the movement is showing that disrupting business as usual gets results will it come to the united states what form would it take here what could spark the equivalent of the yellow vests in the us social movements create global waves of protest it is common for a protest to develop in one part of the world and move to another country this is even more common in modern times as the economy has become globalized and communication across different countries has become easier the us revolution against great britain was part of the age of enlightenment which questioned traditional authority and emphasized natural rights of life liberty and equality as well as sought self government and religious freedom the french revolution followed 13 years after the us in 1789 it led to political changes in the uk germany and across europe this coincided with the great liberator simon bolivar freeing colonies from the spanish empire including venezuela colombia panama ecuador and peru they became independent and briefly united as a single nation the democratic revolutions of 1848 known as the springtime of peoples were part of a widespread revolutionary period that impacted 50 nations in europe beginning in france and spreading without any evident coordination the issues were about democratic and worker rights as well as human rights and freedom of the press it led to the abolition of serfdom in some nations and ended monarchy in denmark the french monarchy was replaced by a republic constitutions were created and empires were threatened by countries seeking sovereignty in the era of decolonization of africa and asia 1945 and 1960 three dozen new states achieved autonomy or outright independence from their european colonial rulers in africa a pan african congress in 1945 demanded an end to colonization there were widespread unrest and organized revolts in both northern and sub saharan colonies protests revolutions and sometimes peaceful transition ended the era of colonization the 1960s were an era of protest that peaked in 1968 around the world multiple issues came to the forefront including for labor rights and socialism the feminist movement protests against war and militarism and against racism and environmental degradation protests occurred in the united states europe the soviet bloc asia and latin america more recently economic globalization and the internet have accelerated global protests an example of this is the anti globalization movement itself as corporations took control of trade agreements and began to write trade for transnational corporate profits people around the world saw how this impacted their communities and fought back the zapatista uprising in chiapas mexico on january 1 1994 was an uprising that coincided with the beginning of the north american free trade agreement nafta the zapatista army of national liberation was an uprising by the indigenous local population against being exploited by global trade their action was an inspiration to others and an anti nafta movement developed in the united states growing into an anti globalization movement the 1997 financial crisis in southeast asia followed by the international monetary fund restructuring the debt in ways that brought austerity led to protests across the region in korea indonesia and thailand against economic globalization and the undue influence of transnational capital these combined into the battle for seattle in 1999 at the world trade organization meetings where 50 000 people from the us and around the world protested on the streets of seattle for four days shutting down the meetings this was a movement of movements moment that united many single issue groups into a force too powerful for the elites to overcome wto meetings since then have been met with mass protests as have imf and other economic meetings this evolved into making it very difficult to pass corporate trade agreements in the united states e g the people stopped

up of working people who are protesting the unfair economy every saturday the 8th act held this saturday was larger than expected as the government and media were claiming the movement was dying down over the holidays despite the movement saying they were not over and were just getting started the movement began as a protest against a gasoline tax but it quickly became evident that this was just the final straw against a series of policies that have made people economically insecure president macron has aggressively pursued a neoliberal agenda on behalf of the wealthy lowering their taxes

to step down macron s popularity is down into the twenties in polls while a majority of french people want the yellow vest protests to continue the movement is exposing contradictions in france that cannot be solved by the current economic and political systems macron while making concessions has also called the protesters thugs and agitators police tactics have been aggressive and violent in the face of mostly nonviolent protests they arrested a yellow vest participant eric drouet who the media has labeled a leader on flimsy charges of protesting without a permit stoking more outrage the media calls him a leader while saying the leaderless movement will fail because it lacks a leader this reminds us of similar treatment during occupy the movement has blown up political divides because there are people from the extreme left extreme right and everywhere in between participating it includes young and old male and female it shows people uniting in a revolt over the unfair economic system and its impact on workers they are also calling for participatory democracy by demanding citizen initiatives where people can vote on legislation firing political appointees or even changing the constitution if they gather enough signatures the yellow vests are showing system wide problems that require both the economic and political systems to change will yellow vest protests come to the united states many of the problems the french people suffer are also felt in the united states the us economy has been designed for the wealthy for decades and billionaire president trump era policies have made that reality worse people never fully recovered from the 2008 economic collapse when millions lost houses and jobs got lower income and higher debt the globalized economy that has been designed for transnational corporations has not served the people in the united states well the fly over states of the midwest have been left hollowed out rural hospitals are closing as the economy disappears in urban areas across the country decades of neglect and lack of investment have created impoverished conditions racist and violent policing have been used to prevent rebellion and contain the unrest people are struggling addiction and suicide rates are up there is vast hopelessness and despair an economic collapse is on the horizon as alan woods writes in new year new crisis the question is not if it will happen only when the us economy is dominated by wall street which ended the year in crisis citigroup s share price declined 30 percent from where it started the year goldman sachs declined 35 percent morgan stanley 24 percent bank of america 18 percent and jpmorgan had a 10 loss woods points to china s economy slowing as is germany s and problems in other european nations all point to a global slow down which those in power do not have tools to respond to as interest rates are already low and government debt is already high when the recession hits the economic insecurity of the people will worsen like the people in france the rich are getting obscenely richer and avoiding taxes by hiding billions offshore and the government is doing the opposite of what is needed e g reducing taxes on the wealthy when there should be a millionaire s tax of 70 and blocking the green new deal and when the economic crisis hits people will blame trump many voters supported him because he promised to break from a system that is designed to favor the wealthy they will know from their own experience that he did the opposite stop trumpism will become an even louder rallying cry and a president whose popularity always hovered around 40 will find himself in polls at 30 or lower as a presidential campaign kicks into high gear the economy is often the trigger event as it was for occupy and we already know there are going to be mass teacher strikes in 2019 indeed plans to strike in la are expected to escalate more broadly the 40 000 people who lose their jobs as a result of four us general motors factories closing could face losing their homes and have other economic stresses causing them to revolt congress refusing to take national improved medicare for all seriously when tens of thousands of people are dying every year simply because they are uninsured could light the spark people in the us might not be wearing yellow vests but we know from other recent protest movements people are willing to shut down streets and highways and stop business as usual more may participate if a radicalizing moment ensues now that they have seen the model work in france there are many triggers that are likely to spark aggressive mass protests in 2019 get ready

regular sales of 2 5 million barrels besides the positive impact from the thaw in us china trade tensions federal reserve chairman jerome powell took the spotlight amid a fedspeak frenzy echoing his recent comments from last week that the central bank s commitment was to proceed with caution on the monetary policy mr innes said in a morning look at commodity prices which of course was viewed very

this morning supported once again by a weaker dollar mr erlam said the greenback did pare some of wednesday s losses yesterday but that s all it was with the break the day before looking quite significant from a technical standpoint and potentially opening up a move back towards the july and september lows he said that means the us 1 300 resistance level for gold is looking very vulnerable and could be a case of when rather than if it breaks risk aversion has been supportive for gold but as we re seeing now it s primary driver is the dollar and the dollar softening as trade relations between the u s and china improves should continue to lift gold he said currencies the canadian dollar was higher in early going helped by rising crude prices and a weaker greenback the day range on

source growing unrest exposes official posturing the zimbabwe independent january 11 2019 failure by government to address the unrelenting currency crisis has come back to haunt the country as evidenced by widespread unrest triggered by the rising cost of living by kudzai kuwaza finance minister mthuli ncube s maiden budget statement presented under the theme austerity for prosperity in november last year introduced a number of cost saving measures such as the slashing of salaries of senior government officials by 5 the retirement of more than 2 000 youth officers and the reduction of foreign embassies he was however silent on measures to address currency volatility which has wreaked havoc on the economy ncube indicated that he left currency reforms untouched because he wanted to first fix macro economic fundamentals and critical issues like the budget and current account deficits money supply and inflation through austerity measures and fiscal consolidation before tackling the currency crisis we only need to do currency reforms when economic fundamentals are strong this means the budget deficit should be under control current account deficit is under control inflation is under control and so forth ncube said so this is the roadmap however ncube s remarks in the budget that the united states dollar remains at 1 1 to real time gross settlements rtgs and bond notes despite announcing measures that are contrary to that notion have had devastating repercussions for not only business but also for the economy at large the failure to address the currency crisis which worsened after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz announced the separation of rtgs and forex accounts on october 1 last year has resulted in the depreciation of the value of the local currency as well as the shortage and skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities it has also seriously eroded the salaries of the majority of zimbabweans who are paid in rtgs and bond notes this also resulted in a crippling 40 day strike by doctors which ended yesterday the doctors had listed payment in us dollars as one of their demands to go back to work which the government baulked at the strike which threw the health sector into turmoil and endangered the lives of thousands of patients forced president emmerson mnangagwa to abort his annual leave after acting president constantino chiwenga failed to resolve the impasse government held a meeting with its restive workforce this week in a desperate bid to avert a strike over salaries government revealed that it had an offer ready for civil servants that will be tabled at the national joint negotiating council teachers like doctors also want to be paid in the greenback or at least 3 000 in the surrogate bond currency the failure by government to address the currency crisis has put it in fire fighting mode this is evidenced by the panic created by the decision by beverage giant delta corporation to price its products in foreign currency in order to sustain our operations the company advises the retail and wholesale customers that its products will be charged in hard currency with effect from friday january 4 2019 part of the circular by delta management read the new fiscal and monetary policy framework in place since october 2018 does not provide for easy access to foreign currency by non exporters the company has only received limited foreign currency allocations from banking channels which have not been adequate to fund the import requirements this resulted in government hastily arranging a meeting with delta management the beverage manufacturer rescinded its decision to sell in forex after receiving assurances from the central bank that the listed company will receive adequate foreign currency allocations for its operations government s efforts to address the current economic decline will remain futile as long as it does not address the issue of currency reforms according to business consultant simon kayereka the government can skip around issues but what is needed are currency reforms kayereka said without currency reforms 2019 is going to be a very tough year kayereka s fears that the year will be difficult are not without foundation as evidenced by the continued shortage of fuel which has resulted in long winding queues at service stations countrywide as a result of government s inability to address the currency conundrum motorists are spending several hours queueing for either diesel or petrol an increasing number of fuel stations are now selling fuel in the greenback with others rejecting payment in rtgs and swipe this has resulted in the hike in public transport fares in some cases threefold further whittling the disposable income of the commuting public the currency crisis has resulted in drugs being sold in foreign currency at pharmacies or in the rtgs bond equivalent a pricing structure which has made life saving drugs unaffordable to the majority of zimbabweans the fiction that the local currency is equal to the unites states dollar has also rendered useless medical aid cards as the prices of medicines have rocketed beyond the reach of medical aid societies government has failed to instill confidence through its continued failure to address the currency crisis according to economist john robertson the confidence needed to make the forex stay in the country or to bring it in the country has not been created by government robertson noted it is hard to predict what happens next he said 2019 will be a difficult year with no solution to the currency crisis giving rise to a rising tide of anger by the generality of the population
president nicolas maduro took the oath of office thursday morning for a second six year term under conditions of mounting social unrest within venezuela and a concerted drive by the us the european union and the right wing governments of latin america to force him from power maduro was sworn in before the venezuelan supreme court and not as is customary before the congress which is controlled by his right wing political opposition and with foreign backing is promoting itself as the foundation for an alternative government thursday s ceremony was boycotted by the us and eu as well as most latin american governments present were presidents miguel diaz canel of cuba evo morales of bolivia salvador sanchez ceren of el salvador and nicaragua s daniel ortega also attending were representatives of russia china and turkey as well as an embassy level official from mexico us secretary of state mike pompeo issued a tweet denouncing maduro s inauguration while making a thinly veiled appeal for a military coup in venezuela the u s condemns maduro s illegitimate usurpation of power and urges those who support the venezuelan regime including security forces sworn to support the constitution to stop enabling repression and corruption the time is now for a return to democracy in venezuela pompeo issued the tweet from cairo where he gave a speech that consisted of a full throated defense of us imperialist intervention along with praise for the egyptian dictator gen abdel fattah el sisi who seized power in a bloody 2013 coup that saw the massacre of some 1 600 supporters of the ousted elected president mohamed mursi and the subsequent roundup and imprisonment of at least 60 000 people for political reasons washington has no problem with the legitimacy of sisi s regime nor with that of the other members of its anti iranian axis in the arab world a collection of dictatorial monarchies to whom pompeo is paying call last week the so called lima group consisting of the governments of 13 latin american countries and canada voted for a resolution demanding that maduro renounce his second term and surrender power to the opposition controlled congress the sole dissenting vote was cast by mexico which warned of the consequences for venezuelans of measures that seek to interfere in internal affairs while the united states is not a member of the lima group a video link was established to allow the participation of pompeo the former director of the us central intelligence agency which is responsible for countless military coups and right wing dictatorships in latin america in the run up to the lima group session pompeo staged a three day trip to latin america to meet with the newly inaugurated jair bolsonaro the fascistic former army captain who has assumed the presidency of brazil and colombia s right wing president ivan duque for discussions that reportedly involved prospects for regime change in venezuela shortly after the ceremony at the supreme court in caracas the organization of american states osa convened in an extraordinary session and voted for a resolution to not recognize the legitimacy of maduro s second term in office it called for the convening of new elections under international supervision the measure passed with 19 votes just one more than the minimum needed for approval maduro s claim to a second term is based upon a may 2018 election that expressed the widespread popular hostility and disgust of the population toward the entire political setup in venezuela it saw the highest abstention rate on record and a boycott by the majority of the right wing opposition which knew that it had nowhere near the necessary support within the population to win an election maduro won three times the number of votes cast for his closest rival but this represented just 28 percent of venezuela s eligible voters of course the trump administration which is denouncing the venezuelan president s election as illegitimate came to power with fewer votes than democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and the support of just 26 percent of us eligible voters maduro won his first term by a narrow margin in 2013 in an election convened one month after the death of his predecessor hugo chavez who had himself come into office in 1998 chavez before dying of cancer had anointed maduro as his chosen successor for continuing his so called bolivarian revolution and twenty first century socialism which consisted of a series of fairly modest social assistance programs funded by rising oil prices while guaranteeing unprecedented profits to both domestic and foreign finance capital and overseeing a social order that saw the share of the national income going to the employers actually rise compared to that of labor it had nothing to do the claims of its pseudo left supporters notwithstanding with socialism instead the chavez and maduro governments succeeded in building up a new ruling class layer the so called boliburgesia which consisted of elements of the military the principal pillar of the government state officials trade union bureaucrats bankers and corporate executives who enriched themselves off of financial speculation and their relations to the state siphoning off vast amounts of the country s oil income with the collapse of oil and commodity prices in 2014 the country s economy more dependent upon oil exports than ever before began a downward spiral the international monetary fund predicts that venezuela s economy will shrink by five percent next year with inflation reaching an unfathomable 10 million percent oil exports last year fell 33 percent compared to 2017 while venezuelan refineries are reported to be operating at one third capacity the maduro government has sought to impose the full burden of this deep crisis onto the backs of the venezuelan working class it introduced an adjustment program last august that consisted of the slashing of real wages and benefits of workers while awarding tax breaks to both venezuelan capitalists and transnational corporations the previous social assistance programs were largely gutted meanwhile the maduro government has sought to open up oil and mineral exploitation to foreign transnationals and has faithfully met payments to the international bankers on venezuela s huge foreign debt according to one estimate debt service payments now consume up to 75 percent of export income the largest share in the world the value of the monthly minimum wage has been reduced to less than us 10 while there have been widespread layoffs and plant shutdowns sixty four percent of the population is living under conditions of extreme poverty some 2 6 million venezuelans have emigrated because of the economic crisis within the country there have been growing numbers of strikes and protests led not by the right wing parties whose activities were given huge prominence by the global capitalist media in 2017 but by workers and the poor they have been met with repressive force by a government that steadfastly defends private property the aim of washington and its allies is not to alleviate the desperate conditions confronting the masses of working people in venezuela but to deepen them through the imposition of ever tightening economic sanctions aimed at destabilizing and toppling the government and for all of the cries from the imperialist powers and the right wing capitalist governments in latin america about democracy and legitimacy their aim is to transfer power to a right wing layer that has no broad base of support within the country washington s regime change objectives are bound up with the drive by us based energy conglomerates to reassert their previous unchallenged hegemony over venezuela s oil the largest proven reserves in the world as well as the pentagon s strategy of global confrontation with the so called revisionist powers china and russia which have established economic and political ties with caracas the principal means of achieving these aims consist of military force trump himself has declared that the military option remains on the table in

russia s central bank dumped 101 billion in u s holdings from its huge reserves shifting into euros and yuan last spring amid a new round of u s sanctions the central bank moved the equivalent of 44 billion each into the european and chinese currencies in the second quarter according to a report published on late wednesday by the bank of russia which discloses the data with a six month lag another 21 billion was invested in the japanese yen the chinese currency accounted for 15 percent of total holdings at the last reading up from 5 percent at the end of the first quarter according to the report that puts russia s yuan share at about ten times the average for global central banks with its total holdings of the currency accounting for about a quarter of world reserves in yuan according to international monetary fund data morgan stanley estimated russia was the main buyer of chinese bonds last year russia is making a strategic shift in its reserves towards holding fewer dollars and more assets in other currencies said benn steil director of international economics at the council on foreign relations in new york the data reveal a dramatic acceleration in a policy russia has been pursuing for several years of reducing exposure to assets that could be affected by u s restrictions tough sanctions on major russian companies in early april hammered the ruble and spurred fears that more restrictions could follow such as measures to cut moscow off from global payment systems russian holdings of u s treasuries dropped by about 81 billion in may and june according to u s data russia isn t alone in its bid to reduce reliance on the world s reserve currency amid increasing attempts by washington to use economic leverage for geopolitical ends in a deepening trade war with america china sold a large portion of its u s treasury holdings last year and officials in europe put forward proposals to increase the use of the euro in regional transactions ditching the dollar we aren t ditching the dollar the dollar is ditching us russian president vladimir putin said in november the instability of dollar payments is creating a desire for many global economies to find alternative reserve currencies and create settlement systems independent of the dollar we re not the only ones doing it believe me the central bank data show russia also cut the share of its reserves held in the u s to just 10 percent of the total from 29 percent at the end of march suggesting some of the remaining dollar assets are now held in other countries this aligns with data compiled by the u s treasury which shows an increase in american bond holdings in belgium and the cayman islands last year russia s reserves are among the 10 largest in the world totaling 458 billion at the end of june 2018 the data suggest russia accounted for 90 percent of the inflows into the chinese bond market in the first half of 2018 analysts at morgan stanley wrote in a research note published thursday the shift has reduced the credit quality of russia s reserves with the share of aa rated assets dropping to 27 percent from 43 percent according to the central bank report yields were higher on the yuan holdings at 3 2 percent versus 0 35 percent for dollar assets in a purely economic sense the cost benefits of a massive shift to the the yuan aren t clear said elina ribakova a fellow at the bruegel think tank in brussels but it makes sense if you take geopolitics into account source bloomberg

president nicolas maduro took the oath of office thursday morning for a second six year term under conditions of mounting social unrest within venezuela and a concerted drive by the us the european union and the right wing governments of latin america to force him from power maduro was sworn in before the venezuelan supreme court and not as is customary before the congress which is controlled by his right wing political opposition and with foreign backing is promoting itself as the foundation for an alternative government thursday s ceremony was boycotted by the us and eu as well as most latin american governments present were presidents miguel diaz canel of cuba evo morales of bolivia salvador sanchez ceren of el salvador and nicaragua s daniel ortega also attending were representatives of russia china and turkey as well as an embassy level official from mexico us secretary of state mike pompeo issued a tweet denouncing maduro s inauguration while making a thinly veiled appeal for a military coup in venezuela the u s condemns maduro s illegitimate usurpation of power and urges those who support the venezuelan regime including security forces sworn to support the constitution to stop enabling repression and corruption the time is now for a return to democracy in venezuela pompeo issued the tweet from cairo where he gave a speech that consisted of a full throated defense of us imperialist intervention along with praise for the egyptian dictator gen abdel fattah el sisi who seized power in a bloody 2013 coup that saw the massacre of some 1 600 supporters of the ousted elected president mohamed mursi and the subsequent roundup and imprisonment of at least 60 000 people for political reasons washington has no problem with the legitimacy of sisi s regime nor with that of the other members of its anti iranian axis in the arab world a collection of dictatorial monarchies to whom pompeo is paying call last week the so called lima group consisting of the governments of 13 latin american countries and canada voted for a resolution demanding that maduro renounce his second term and surrender power to the opposition controlled congress the sole dissenting vote was cast by mexico which warned of the consequences for venezuelans of measures that seek to interfere in internal affairs while the united states is not a member of the lima group a video link was established to allow the participation of pompeo the former director of the us central intelligence agency which is responsible for countless military coups and right wing dictatorships in latin america in the run up to the lima group session pompeo staged a three day trip to latin america to meet with the newly inaugurated jair bolsonaro the fascistic former army captain who has assumed the presidency of brazil and colombia s right wing president ivan duque for discussions that reportedly involved prospects for regime change in venezuela shortly after the ceremony at the supreme court in caracas the organization of american states osa convened in an extraordinary session and voted for a resolution to not recognize the legitimacy of maduro s second term in office it called for the convening of new elections under international supervision the measure passed with 19 votes just one more than the minimum needed for approval maduro s claim to a second term is based upon a may 2018 election that expressed the widespread popular hostility and disgust of the population toward the entire political setup in venezuela it saw the highest abstention rate on record and a boycott by the majority of the right wing opposition which knew that it had nowhere near the necessary support within the population to win an election maduro won three times the number of votes cast for his closest rival but this represented just 28 percent of venezuela s eligible voters of course the trump administration which is denouncing the venezuelan president s election as illegitimate came to power with fewer votes than democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and the support of just 26 percent of us eligible voters maduro won his first term by a narrow margin in 2013 in an election convened one month after the death of his predecessor hugo chavez who had himself come into office in 1998 chavez before dying of cancer had anointed maduro as his chosen successor for continuing his so called bolivarian revolution and twenty first century socialism which consisted of a series of fairly modest social assistance programs funded by rising oil prices while guaranteeing unprecedented profits to both domestic and foreign finance capital and overseeing a social order that saw the share of the national income going to the employers actually rise compared to that of labor it had nothing to do the claims of its pseudo left supporters notwithstanding with socialism instead the chavez and maduro governments succeeded in building up a new ruling class layer the so called boliburgesia which consisted of elements of the military the principal pillar of the government state officials trade union bureaucrats bankers and corporate executives who enriched themselves off of financial speculation and their relations to the state siphoning off vast amounts of the country s oil income with the collapse of oil and commodity prices in 2014 the country s economy more dependent upon oil exports than ever before began a downward spiral the international monetary fund predicts that venezuela s economy will shrink by five percent next year with inflation reaching an unfathomable 10 million percent oil exports last year fell 33 percent compared to 2017 while venezuelan refineries are reported to be operating at one third capacity the maduro government has sought to impose the full burden of this deep crisis onto the backs of the venezuelan working class it introduced an adjustment program last august that consisted of the slashing of real wages and benefits of workers while awarding tax breaks to both venezuelan capitalists and transnational corporations the previous social assistance programs were largely gutted meanwhile the maduro government has sought to open up oil and mineral exploitation to foreign transnationals and has faithfully met payments to the international bankers on venezuela s huge foreign debt according to one estimate debt service payments now consume up to 75 percent of export income the largest share in the world the value of the monthly minimum wage has been reduced to less than us 10 while there have been widespread layoffs and plant shutdowns sixty four percent of the population is living under conditions of extreme poverty some 2 6 million venezuelans have emigrated because of the economic crisis within the country there have been growing numbers of strikes and protests led not by the right wing parties whose activities were given huge prominence by the global capitalist media in 2017 but by workers and the poor they have been met with repressive force by a government that steadfastly defends private property the aim of washington and its allies is not to alleviate the desperate conditions confronting the masses of working people in venezuela but to deepen them through the imposition of ever tightening economic sanctions aimed at destabilizing and toppling the government and for all of the cries from the imperialist powers and the right wing capitalist governments in latin america about democracy and legitimacy their aim is to transfer power to a right wing layer that has no broad base of support within the country washington s regime change objectives are bound up with the drive by us based energy conglomerates to reassert their previous unchallenged hegemony over venezuela s oil the largest proven reserves in the world as well as the pentagon s strategy of global confrontation with the so called revisionist powers china and russia which have established economic and political ties with caracas the principal means of achieving these aims consist of military force trump himself has declared that the military option remains on the table in relation to venezuela and has repeatedly asked his advisers as well as latin american heads of state about the feasibility of a military intervention to overthrow the venezuelan government meanwhile

after the global financial crisis the federal reserve embarked on a massive easing policy experiment with the long term effects largely still unknown the fed has injected trillions in liquidity into the banking system in an effort to push down long term bond yields and interest rates there are long run inflationary risks to such policies the transmission mechanism of quantitative easing qe flowed through multiple channels for one it pushed up inflationary expectations it also lowered treasury yields because bonds were purchased in size and led a currency depreciation in the u s dollar this effectively pushed real inflation expectation adjusted interest rates lower providing risk on sentiment in u s equities and emerging markets though the qe program was effective in countering the deflationary forces in the world after the crisis it has led to imbalances in asset prices and global monetary flows particularly in dollar denominated emerging market debt china for example has a large amount of usd denominated corporate debt it made sense to borrow in u s dollars given the federal reserve policy during the qe era interest rate spreads were wider meaning it was cheaper for chinese companies to borrow offshore while usd was expected to depreciate thereby lowering the real burden of the debt this has now become a massive global risk since usd was one of the few assets with positive returns in 2018 this can be expected to continue as the federal reserve is currently engaging in the opposite policy of qe a balance sheet roll off known as quantitative tightening by no longer reinvesting maturing securities if the federal reserve continues unwinding its balance sheet and moves faster than priced in by raising rates multiple times in 2019 it will create a further slowing of the global economy an appreciation in the us dollar and an emerging market financial downturn this risk to growth assets right now is not a recession in the united states it is an appreciation in the u s currency and a hard landing in china chinese data has underperformed apple s guidance downgrade confirmed the slowing in the chinese economy that chinese pmi gdp growth fixed asset investment and retail sales data have shown there will likely be a recapitalization of the chinese banking system as a result of npls the chinese authorities have expressed a grand rebalancing plan but the problem with rebalancing to a consumer based economy is that bank loans are mostly lent to the old industrial economy firms in china are facing a slowing chinese economy tariffs and global trade tensions and high corporate debt at around 170 of gdp corporate profits are likely to decelerate and unemployment in china is likely to rise thereby increasing non performing loans for chinese banks which are already likely vastly understated i believe the usd cny will reach at least 7 00 in 2019 as the pboc people s bank of china responds to a hard landing in the country s economy by lowering rates and recapitalizing banks chinese banks are isolated from the united states so there is little contagion risk to the core us economy though financial markets and risk assets would respond to the situation negatively the federal reserve should in my opinion look through the downturn likely to worsen in china and focus on domestic us data and continue tightening this divergent monetary policy between the pboc and federal reserve would in theory narrow the interest rate differential between chinese and u s bonds weakening the yuan against the us dollar the us economy is resilient and the us consumer is in good shape with lowered debt to income ratios and fiscal stimulus that isn t going to fade near term as larry kudlow recently stated i expect the u s economic data to perform at or above the long term trend allowing the fed to continue normalizing many will say there is no significant inflation but my response would be to pose the question where would inflation be if the federal reserve weren t consistently raising rates over the past two years in short i believe the federal reserve should welcome the potential emerging market and growth risk asset downturn as a way to keep inflation expectations and asset prices in check while getting back to a normal monetary policy stance this tightening and temporary air pocket in the global economy avoids an inflationary overshoot that would be difficult to rein back in after several years of qe and prolonged low rates the risk to the u s expansion is obviously not a federal funds rate slightly above neutral or non performing loans in the contained chinese banking system the real risk is an inflationary overshoot requiring significantly higher rates which would push the economy into a recession similar to the volcker years
an employee works at a private manufacturing enterprise in xingtai hebei province on december 20 2018 xinhua to make financing more accessible for micro small and private enterprises and to manage liquidity during a period of new year celebrations as well as tax deductions china s central bank slashed the reserve requirement ratio rrr for financial institutions and will implement an encore later this month the people s bank of china pbc announced on january 4 that the share of deposits financial institutions are required to hold in reserve will be cut by 1 percentage point the pbc cut the rrr by 0 5 percentage point on january 15 and will repeat the act on january 25 which will collectively inject 800 billion yuan 116 6 billion into the market to increase loan funding sources for domestic enterprises it will also reduce the cost of bank interest payments by around 20 billion yuan 2 9 billion annually which will help lower financing costs for the real economy the measure will ease liquidity constraints since the forthcoming period will mark the maturity of commercial banks medium term lending facility funds that can support financial institutions in seeking additional capital and see tightened liquidity as people exchange cash gifts during the chinese lunar new year zong liang chief researcher with bank of china boc told beijing review this can help offset liquidity fluctuations before the spring festival and allow financial institutions to improve the support for small micro and private businesses to better serve the real economy zong said the pbc said the move is a moderate change amid monetary easing following the central economic work conference the annual meeting to chart the course for the economy in 2019 which highlighted the goal to maintain sound liquidity the bank said it will continue to implement a prudent monetary policy and refrain from using a deluge of stimulus a farmer consults a bank clerk on micro loans in rizhao shandong province on december 24 2018 xinhua easing fund access facing downward pressure and mounting uncertainties in the external market the chinese economy has been experiencing a growth slowdown partly caused by contraction in the manufacturing sector according to data from the national bureau of statistics the purchasing managers index dropped to a record low of 49 4 in late december 2018 the first time in recent years it dropped below the 50 point threshold dividing contraction and expansion it suggests that domestic entrepreneurs lack confidence in the market due to the burden caused by taxes and fees and difficulties in financing gong yuhang dean of the china enterprise finance research institute told the media to boost market confidence the priorities chinese policymakers unveiled at the economic conference included improving countercyclical adjustments cutting taxes and fees and supporting private enterprises since small micro and private enterprises play a key role in propelling economic growth and employment such companies will be offered more access to funds so that their debt default risks can be reduced the central bank said financial institutions will support privately owned small and micro companies through a range of financial tools including bonds bank lending and equity before the rrr announcement it already eased evaluation rules on january 2 to encourage inclusive financing for small and micro enterprises rural residents and low and middle income urban groups financial institutions can deposit less in the central bank as reserve money if they lend a certain share of their loans to small and micro firms each borrowing less than 10 million yuan 1 46 million the threshold was previously set at 5 million yuan 730 000 according to lian ping chief economist of the bank of communications bocom one of china s largest commercial banks more efforts are needed to make inclusive financing more effective the most prominent problem of inclusive financing in china is that the financial structure is not full fledged the direct financing system and banks targeting small and micro enterprises need to be improved lian told beijing review the central bank will continue to tighten its regulation on financial holding companies this year to defuse risks caused by shadow banking and internet financing in 2018 measures to regulate shadow banking√¢ lending and other financial activities by unregulated institutions or under unregulated conditions√¢ saw initial achievements in deleveraging and risk control but there was a downside as well small and private businesses funding resources became constrained since the shadow banking sector provides easier financing the authorities have now recognized the role of shadow banking and are trying to develop it under regulations the sector has facilitated the financing of private enterprises in recent years making it deserve more room to develop as long as appropriate regulation is in place xu xueming vice president of the postal savings bank of china said at a forum on december 23 2018 positive signals in 2018 the pbc cut rrr four times injecting a total of 2 3 trillion yuan 337 8 billion into the market the cuts this year a follow up move still focus on boosting the real economy while avoiding over escalation of monetary easing the rrr cuts were mostly launched later in the previous years boc s zong said but the early move this year signals determination to resolve prominent economic problems and boost the confidence of private enterprises laying a solid foundation for steady economic performances in 2019 he added besides supporting the private sector the move can also help ease the real estate market the fundamental policy of controlling speculation will remain consistent said yan yuejin research director of the e house china r d institute a property research agency bocom s lian said the rrr cuts this year may see a smaller margin and lower frequency than in 2018 and the possibility of cutting rmb benchmark interest rates for deposits and loans is slim as trade talks between china and the united states progress and the momentum of the dollar s strengthening weakens the depreciation pressure on the renminbi will ease a report by the guanghua school of management of peking university on january 3 said the central bank is expected to reduce rrr by around 2 percentage points altogether in 2019 and adopt various monetary policy tools to adjust liquidity with a focus on improving the monetary transmission mechanism to smooth funding channels lian said greater focus is needed to ensure capital flow into the real economy since large scale monetary easing may not exert considerable effect due to adequate liquidity in addition to the targeted rrr cuts measures such as improving the supply of low cost loans can be adopted to cut financing costs for domestic enterprises to inject more capital into the real economy the financial structure needs to be improved mainly in terms of direct financing especially boosting the stock market while stability of the domestic market needs to be maintained he added copyedited by sudeshna

the west is rotting yes maybe but what a nice smell old soviet joke stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost in your recent article the year the planet flipped over you paint a devastating picture of the state of the empire it is already safe to declare trump s plan to make america great again maga a failure beneath the rosy statistics of us economic growth hides the hideous fact that it is the result of a tax holiday granted to transnational corporations to entice them to repatriate their profits while this hasn t helped them their stocks are currently cratering it has been a disaster for the us government as well as for the economic system as whole tax receipts have shrunk the budget deficit for 2018 exceeds 779 billion meanwhile the trade wars which trump initiated have caused the trade deficit to increase by 17 from the year before plans to repatriate industrial production from low cost countries remain vaporous because the three key elements which china had as it industrialized cheap energy cheap labor and low cost of doing business are altogether missing government debt is already beyond reasonable and its expansion is still accelerating with just the interest payments set to exceed half a trillion a year within a decade this trajectory does not bode well for the continued existence of the united states as a going concern nobody either in the united states or beyond has the power to significantly alter this trajectory trump s thrashing about may have moved things along faster than they otherwise would have at least in the sense of helping convince the entire world that the us is selfish feckless ultimately self destructive and generally unreliable as a partner in the end it won t matter who was president of the us it never has among those the us president has succeeded in hurting most are his european allies his attacks on russian energy exports to europe on european car manufacturers and on europe s trade with iran have caused a fair amount of damage both political and economic without compensating for it with any perceived or actual benefits meanwhile as the globalist world order which much of europe s population appears ready to declare a failure begins to unravel the european union is rapidly becoming ungovernable with established political parties unable to form coalitions with ever more numerous populist upstarts it is too early to say that the eu has already failed altogether but it already seems safe to predict that within a decade it will no longer remain as a serious international factor although the disastrous quality and the ruinous mistakes of europe s own leadership deserve a lot of the blame some of it should rest with the erratic destructive behavior of their transoceanic big brother the eu has already morphed into a strictly regional affair unable to project power or entertain any global geopolitical ambitions same goes for washington which is going to either depart voluntarily due to lack of funds or get chased out from much of the world the departure from syria is inevitable whether trump under relentless pressure from his bipartisan warmongers backtracks on this commitment or not now that syria has been armed with russia s up to date air defense weapons the us no longer maintains air superiority there and without air superiority the us military is unable to do anything afghanistan is next there it seems outlandish to think that the washingtonians will be able to achieve any sort of reasonable accommodation with the taliban their departure will spell the end of kabul as a center of corruption where foreigners steal humanitarian aid and other resources somewhere along the way the remaining us troops will also be pulled out of iraq where the parliament angered by trump s impromptu visit to a us base recently voted to expel them and that will put paid to the entire us adventure in the middle east since 9 11 4 704 439 588 308 has been squandered to be precise or 14 444 for every man woman and child in the us the biggest winners in all of this are obviously the people of the entire region because they will no longer be subjected to indiscriminate us harassment and bombardment followed by russia china and iran with russia solidifying its position as the ultimate arbiter of international security arrangements thanks to its unmatched military capabilities and demonstrated knowhow for coercion to peace syria s fate will be decided by russia iran and turkey with the us not even invited to the talks afghanistan will fall into the sphere of the shanghai cooperation organization and the biggest losers will be former us regional allies first and foremost israel followed by saudi arabia my question for you is this where would you place the usa or the empire on your 5 stages of decline and do you believe that the usa or the empire can reverse that trend collapse at each stage is a historical process that takes time to run its course as the system adapts to changing circumstances compensates for its weaknesses and finds ways to continue functioning at some level but what changes rather suddenly is faith or to put it in more businesslike terms sentiment a large segment of the population or an entire political class within a country or the entire world can function based on a certain set of assumptions for much longer than the situation warrants but then over a very short period of time switch to a different set of assumptions all that sustains the status quo beyond that point is institutional inertia it imposes limits on how fast systems can change without collapsing entirely beyond that point people will tolerate the older practices only until replacements for them can be found stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost internationally the major change in sentiment in the world has to do with the role of the us dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and the yen the other two reserve currencies of the three legged globalist central banker stool the world is transitioning to the use of local currencies currency swaps and commodities markets backed by gold the catalyst for this change of sentiment was provided by the us administration itself which sawed through its own perch by its use of unilateral sanctions by using its control over dollar based transactions to block international transactions it doesn t happen to like it forced other countries to start looking for alternatives now a growing list of countries sees throwing off the shackles of the us dollar as a strategic goal russia and china use the ruble and the yuan for their expanding trade iran sells oil to india for rupees saudi arabia has started to accept the yuan for its oil this change has many knock on effects if the dollar is no longer needed to conduct international trade other nations no longer have hold large quantities of it in reserve consequently there is no longer a need to buy up large quantities of us treasury notes therefore it becomes unnecessary to run large trade surpluses with the us essentially conducting trade at a loss further the attractiveness of the us as an export market drops and the cost of imports to the us rises thereby driving up cost inflation a vicious spiral ensues in which the ability of the us government to borrow internationally to finance the gaping chasm of its various deficits becomes impaired sovereign default of the us government and national bankruptcy then follow the us may still look mighty but its dire fiscal predicament coupled with its denial of the inevitability of bankruptcy makes it into something of a blanche dubois from the tennessee williams play a streetcar named desire she was always dependent on the kindness of strangers but was tragically unable to tell the difference between kindness and desire in this case the desire is for national advantage and security and to minimize risk by getting rid of an unreliable trading partner how quickly or slowly this comes to pass is difficult to guess at and impossible to calculate it is possible to think of the financial system in terms of a physical analogue with masses of funds traveling at some velocity having a certain inertia p mv and with forces acting on that mass to accelerate it along a different trajectory f ma it is also possible to think of it in terms of hordes of stampeding animals who can change course abruptly when panicked the recent abrupt moves in the financial markets where trillions of dollars of notional purely speculative value have been wiped out within weeks are more in line with the latter model stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost within the us there is really no other alternative than the market there are a few rustic enclaves mostly religious communities that can feed themselves but that s a rarity for everyone else there is no choice but to be a consumer consumers who are broke are called bums but they are still consumers to the extent that the us has a culture it is a commercial culture in which the goodness of a person is based on the goodly sums of money in their possession such a culture can die by becoming irrelevant when everyone is dead broke but by then most of the carriers of this culture are likely to be dead too alternatively it can be replaced by a more humane culture that isn t entirely based on the cult of mammon perhaps dare i think through a return to a pre protestant pre catholic christian ethic that values people s souls above objects of value stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost all is very murky at the moment but i would venture to guess that most people in the us are too distracted too stressed and too preoccupied with their own vices and obsessions to pay much attention to the political realm of the ones they do pay attention a fair number of them seem clued in to the fact that the us is not a democracy at all but an elites only sandbox in which transnational corporate and oligarchic interests build and knock down each others sandcastles the extreme political polarization where two virtually identical pro capitalist pro war parties pretend to wage battle by virtue signaling may be a symptom of the extremely decrepit state of the entire political arrangement people are made to watch the billowing smoke and to listen to the deafening noise in the hopes that they won t notice that the wheels are no longer turning the fact that what amounts to palace intrigue the fracas between the white house the two houses of congress and a ghoulish grand inquisitor named mueller has taken center stage is uncannily reminiscent of various earlier political collapses such as the disintegration of the ottoman empire or of the fall and the consequent beheading of louis xvi the fact that trump like the ottoman worthies stocks his harem with east european women lends an eerie touch that said most people in the us seem blind to the nature of their overlords in a way that the french with their jillettes jaunes movement just as an example are definitely not stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost i have been saying for some years now that within the us social collapse has largely run its course although whether people actually believe that is an entire matter entirely defining your people is rather difficult the symbols are still there the flag the statue of liberty and a predilection for iced drinks and heaping plates of greasy fried foods but the melting pot seems to have suffered a meltdown and melted all the way to china at present half the households within the us speak a language other than english at home and a fair share of the rest speak dialects of english that are not mutually intelligible with the standard north american english dialect of broadcast television and university lecturers throughout its history as a british colony and as a nation the us has been dominated by the anglo ethnos the designation ethnos is not an ethnic label it is not strictly based on genealogy language culture habitat form of government or any other single factor or group of factors these may all be important to one extent or another but the viability of an ethnos is based solely on its cohesion and the mutual inclusivity and common purpose of its members the anglo ethnos reached its zenith in the wake of world war ii during which many social groups were intermixed in the military and their more intelligent members fantastic potential was unleashed when privilege the curse of the anglo ethnos since its inception was temporarily replaced with merit and the more talented demobilized men of whatever extraction were given a chance at education and social advancement by the gi bill speaking a new sort of american english based on the ohio dialect as a lingua franca these yanks male racist sexist and chauvinistic and at least in their own minds victorious were ready to remake the entire world in their own image they proceeded to flood the entire world with oil us oil production was in full flush then and with machines that burned it such passionate acts of ethnogenesis are rare but not unusual the romans who conquered the entire mediterranean basin the barbarians who then sacked rome the mongols who later conquered most of eurasia and the germans who for a very brief moment possessed an outsized lebensraum are other examples and now it is time to ask what remains of this proud conquering anglo ethnos today we hear shrill feminist cries about toxic masculinity and minorities of every stripe railing against whitesplaining and in response we hear a few whimpers but mostly silence those proud conquering virile yanks who met and fraternized with the red army at the river elbe on april 25 1945 where are they haven t they devolved into a sad little subethnos of effeminate porn addicted overgrown boys who shave their pubic hair and need written permission to have sex without fear of being charged with rape will the anglo ethnos persist as a relict similar to how the english have managed to hold onto their royals who are technically no longer even aristocrats since they now practice exogamy with commoners or will it get wiped out in a wave of depression mental illness and opiate abuse its glorious history of rapine plunder and genocide erased and the statues of its war heros criminals knocked down only time will tell stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost the term culture means many things to many people but it is more productive to observe cultures than to argue about them cultures are expressed through people s stereotypical behaviors that are readily observable in public these are not the negative stereotypes often used to identify and reject outsiders but the positive stereotypes cultural standards of behavior really that serve as requirements for social adequacy and inclusion we can readily assess the viability of a culture by observing the stereotypical behaviors of its members do people exist as a single continuous inclusive sovereign realm or as a set of exclusive potentially warring enclaves segregated by income ethnicity education level political affiliation and so on do you see a lot of walls gates checkpoints security cameras and no trespassing signs is the law of the land enforced uniformly or are there good neighborhoods bad neighborhoods and no go zones where even the police fear to tread do random people thrown together in public spontaneously enter into conversation with each other and are comfortable with being crowded together or are they aloof and fearful and prefer to hide their face in the little glowing rectangle of their smartphone jealously guarding their personal space and ready to regard any encroachment on it as an assault do people remain good natured and tolerant toward each other even when hard pressed or do they hide behind a fa√ßade of tense superficial politeness and fly into a rage at the slightest provocation is conversation soft in tone gracious and respectful or is it loud shrill rude and polluted with foul language do people dress well out of respect for each other or to show off or are they all just d√©class√© slobs even the ones with money observe how their children behave are they fearful of strangers and trapped in a tiny world of their own or are they open to the world and ready to treat any stranger as a surrogate brother or sister aunt or uncle grandmother or grandfather without requiring any special introduction do the adults studiously ignore each others children or do they spontaneously act as a single family if there is a wreck on the road do they spontaneously rush to each others rescue and pull people out before the wreck explodes or do they in the immortal words of frank zappa get on the phone and call up some flakes who rush on over and wreck it some more if there is a flood or a fire do the neighbors take in the people who are rendered homeless or do they allow them to wait for the authorities to show up and bus them to some makeshift government shelter it is possible to quote statistics or to provide anecdotal evidence to assess the state and the viability of a culture but your own eyes and other senses can provide all the evidence you need to make that determination for yourself and to decide how much faith to put in the goodness of humanity that is evident in the people around you cultural and social collapse are very far along financial collapse is waiting for a trigger commercial collapse will happen in stages some of which food deserts for instance have already happened in many places political collapse will only become visible once the political class gives up it s not as simple as saying which stage we are at they are all happening in parallel to one extent or another conclusion connecting the dots or not the word catastrophe has several meanings but in its original meaning in greek the word means a sudden downturn in greek katastrophƒì overturning sudden turn from kata down strophƒì turning as for the word superpower it also has several possible definitions but my preferred one is this one superpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position which is characterized by itsor project power on a global scale this is done through the combined means of economic military technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence traditionally superpowers are preeminent among the great powers this one an extremely powerful nation especially one capable ofand the acts and policies of less powerful nations or this one an international governing body able to i have mentioned the very visible decline of the usa and its associated empire in many of my articles already so i won t repeat it here other than to say that the ability to exert influence and impose its will is probably the best criteria to measure the magnitude of the fall of the usa since trump came to power the process was already started by dubya and obama but it sure accelerated with the donald but i do want to use a metaphor to revisit the concept of catastrophe if you place an object in the middle of a table and then push it right to the edge you will exert some amount of energy we can call e1 then if the edge of the table is smooth and you just push the object over the edge you exercise a much smaller amount of energy we can call e2 and in most cases if the table is big enough you will also find that e1 is much bigger than e2 yet e2 coming after e1 took place triggered a much more dramatic event instead of smoothly gliding over the table top the object suddenly falls down and shatters that sudden fall can also be called a catastrophe this is also something which happens in history take the example of the soviet union some readers might recall how alexander solzhenitsyn repeatedly declared in the 1980s that he was sure that the soviet regime would collapse and that he would return to russia he was of course vitriolically ridiculed by all the specialists and experts after all why would anybody want to listen to some weird russian exile with politically suspicious ideas there were rumors of monarchism and anti semitism when the soviet union was an immense superpower armed to the teeth with weapons with an immense security service with political allies and supporters worldwide not only that but all the respectable specialists and experts were unanimous that while the soviet regime had various problems it was very far from collapse the notion that nato would soon replace the soviet military not only in eastern europe but even in part of the soviet union was absolutely unthinkable because ideologically poisoned analysis leads to intellectual complacence a failure of imagination and generally an almost total inability to even hypothetically look at possible outcomes this is how almost all the soviet specialists got it wrong the kgb by the way had predicted this outcome and warned the politburo but the soviet gerontocrats were ideologically paralyzed and were both unable and often unwilling to take any preventative action the kerensky masonic regime in 1917 russia the monarchy in iran or the apartheid regime in south africa also collapsed very fast once the self destruction mechanism was in place and launched you can think of that regime self destruction mechanism as our e1 phase in our metaphor above as for e2 you can think of it as whatever small push like event which precipitates the quick and final collapse apparently with great ease and minimum energy spent at this point it is important to explain what exactly a final collapse looks like some people are under the very mistaken assumption that a collapsed society or country looks like a mad max world this is not so as it has reached all the 5 stages of collapse as defined by dmitry orlov in his seminal book the five stages of collapse survivors toolkit where he mentions the following 5 stages of collapse having personally visited argentina in the 1970s and 1980s and seen the russia of the early 1990sand in the most expensive top deck cabins a pretty luxurious lifestyle can be maintained by the elites but for most of the passengers such a collapse results in poverty insecurity political instability and a huge loss in welfare furthermore in terms of motion a half sunk ship is no ship at all here is the crucial thing as long as the ship s pa systems keep announcing great weather and buffet brunches and as long as most of the passengers remain in their cabins and watch tv instead of looking out of the window during the e1 phase outlined above most passengers will be kept in total ignorance lest they riot or protest and only when e2 strikes totally unexpectedly for most passengers does reality eventually destroy the ignorance and illusions of the brainwashed passengers i have lived in the usa from 1986 1991 and from 2002 to today and there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the country has undergone a huge decline over the past decades in fact i would argue that the usa has been living under e1 condition since at least dubya and that this process dramatically accelerated under obama and trump i believe that we reached the e2 edge of the table moment in 2018 and that from now on even a relatively minor incident can result in a sudden downturn i e a catastrophe still i decided to check with the undisputed specialist of this issue and so i emailed dmitry orlov and asked him the following question here is dmitry s reply dmity concluded his reply by summarizing his view like this my own totally subjective opinion is that the usa has already reached stages 1 through 4 and that there are signs that stage 5 has begun mainly in big cities as us small towns and rural areas trump s power base by the way are still struggling to maintain the norms and behaviors one could observe in the usa of the 1980s when i have visitors from europe they always comment how friendly and welcoming us americans are true i live in small town in east central florida not in miami these are the communities which voted for trump because they said we want our country back alas instead of giving them their country back trump gifted it to the neocons frankly the dots are all over the place it is really hard to miss them however for the doubleplusgoodthinking ideological drone they remain largely invisible and this is not due to any eyesight problem but due to that drone s total inability to connect the dots but until that moment they will keep on denying the obvious no matter how obvious that obvious has become in the meantime the us ruling elites are locked into an ugly internal struggle which only further weakens the usa but no they are still completely stuck in their old ways and the same gang of gerontocrats continues to rule the party apparatus that is another surefire sign of degeneracy when a regime can only produce incompetent often old leaders who are completely out of touch with reality and who blame their own failures on internal deplorables and external the russians factors again think of the soviet union under brezhnev the apartheid regime in south africa under f w de klerk or the kerensky regime in 1917 russia it is quite telling that the political leader whom the anglozionists try to scare the most simply thinks of them as first rate idiots it is not eventually the usa will rebound i have no doubts about that at all this is a big country with millions of immensely talented people immense natural resources and no credible threat to it s territory but that can only happen after a real regime change as opposed to a change in presidential administration which itself is only going to happen after an e2 catastrophe collapse until then we will all be waiting for godot
news national by staff reporter failure by government to address the unrelenting currency crisis has come back to haunt the country as evidenced by widespread unrest triggered by the rising cost of living finance minister mthuli ncube s maiden budget statement presented under the theme austerity for prosperity in november last year introduced a number of cost saving measures such as the slashing of salaries of senior government officials by 5 the retirement of more than 2 000 youth officers and the reduction of foreign embassies he was however silent on measures to address currency volatility which has wreaked havoc on the economy ncube indicated that he left currency reforms untouched because he wanted to first fix macro economic fundamentals and critical issues like the budget and current account deficits money supply and inflation through austerity measures and fiscal consolidation before tackling the currency crisis we only need to do currency reforms when economic fundamentals are strong this means the budget deficit should be under control current account deficit is under control inflation is under control and so forth ncube said so this is the roadmap however ncube s remarks in the budget that the united states dollar remains at 1 1 to real time gross settlements rtgs and bond notes despite announcing measures that are contrary to that notion have had devastating repercussions for not only business but also for the economy at large the failure to address the currency crisis which worsened after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz announced the separation of rtgs and forex accounts on october 1 last year has resulted in the depreciation of the value of the local currency as well as the shortage and skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities it has also seriously eroded the salaries of the majority of zimbabweans who are paid in rtgs and bond notes this also resulted in a crippling 40 day strike by doctors which ended yesterday the doctors had listed payment in us dollars as one of their demands to go back to work which the government baulked at the strike which threw the health sector into turmoil and endangered the lives of thousands of patients forced president emmerson mnangagwa to abort his annual leave after acting president constantino chiwenga failed to resolve the impasse government held a meeting with its restive workforce this week in a desperate bid to avert a strike over salaries government revealed that it had an offer ready for civil servants that will be tabled at the national joint negotiating council teachers like doctors also want to be paid in the greenback or at least 3 000 in the surrogate bond currency the failure by government to address the currency crisis has put it in fire fighting mode this is evidenced by the panic created by the decision by beverage giant delta corporation to price its products in foreign currency in order to sustain our operations the company advises the retail and wholesale customers that its products will be charged in hard currency with effect from friday january 4 2019 part of the circular by delta management read the new fiscal and monetary policy framework in place since october 2018 does not provide for easy access to foreign currency by non exporters the company has only received limited foreign currency allocations from banking channels which have not been adequate to fund the import requirements this resulted in government hastily arranging a meeting with delta management the beverage manufacturer rescinded its decision to sell in forex after receiving assurances from the central bank that the listed company will receive adequate foreign currency allocations for its operations government s efforts to address the current economic decline will remain futile as long as it does not address the issue of currency reforms according to business consultant simon kayereka the government can skip around issues but what is needed are currency reforms kayereka said without currency reforms 2019 is going to be a very tough year kayereka s fears that the year will be difficult are not without foundation as evidenced by the continued shortage of fuel which has resulted in long winding queues at service stations countrywide as a result of government s inability to address the currency conundrum motorists are spending several hours queueing for either diesel or petrol an increasing number of fuel stations are now selling fuel in the greenback with others rejecting payment in rtgs and swipe this has resulted in the hike in public transport fares in some cases threefold further whittling the disposable income of the commuting public the currency crisis has resulted in drugs being sold in foreign currency at pharmacies or in the rtgs bond equivalent a pricing structure which has made life saving drugs unaffordable to the majority of zimbabweans the fiction that the local currency is equal to the unites states dollar has also rendered useless medical aid cards as the prices of medicines have rocketed beyond the reach of medical aid societies government has failed to instill confidence through its continued failure to address the currency crisis according to economist john robertson the confidence needed to make the forex stay in the country or to bring it in the country has not been created by government robertson noted it is hard to predict what happens next he said 2019 will be a difficult year with no solution to the currency crisis giving rise to a rising tide of anger by the generality of the population

article content in fact the entire chinese economy may not only be falling short it may never have performed as well as claimed many believe that china s official economic growth rate a fabulous 6 5 per cent is more a fable a world bank estimate for 2016 put china s economic growth at 1 1 per cent with other estimates showing low or even negative growth also worrying is the potentially catastrophic hidden debt that fuelled china s growth as much as us 6 trillion by china s local governments alone according to s p global ratings which called it a debt iceberg with titanic credit risks many authorities point to the trade war to explain in part these poor metrics typically adding that trade wars are always lose lose yet while china clearly seems a loser the same can t be said for the u s whose economy is on fire in contrast to the 15 and 20 year lows logged by china s economic indicators the u s is racking up 20 30 40 and 50 year highs wages are up especially for those traditionally worse off while unemployment rates for blacks hispanics and women are at lows not seen in decades the u s economy has added 4 8 million jobs since donald trump was elected president with u s manufacturers last year adding 284 000 jobs the most in more than 20 years americans are ditching food stamps and disability payments for well paying jobs put it together and this is the best time

while china s demise and america s rise can t all or even mostly be attributed to trump s tariffs the tariffs clearly hurt china s economy more than america s for one thing the tax that tariffs represent has mostly been paid by china according to a recent policy brief from econpol europe a network of researchers in the european union u s companies and consumers will pay only 4 5 per cent of the 25 per cent tariffs on us 250 billion of chinese goods with the other 20 5 per cent falling on chinese producers the econpol report found that the trump administration selected easily replaced

personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up and now back to this morning s topic what s going on with markets so far this year whatever the fundamentals markets are rallying hard there s still plenty of caution on markets but there s no question that they ve turned around since their bout of christmas eve panic every market tells the same story the s p 500 rose for the fifth session in a row yesterday that makes for a gain of 9 over that period european markets have rallied during that time too our own ftse 100 is nudging closer to getting back above the 7 000 mark then there s the oil price brent crude rose for the ninth session in a row yesterday that s equal to its longest winning streak ever according to the ft the benchmark has now risen by more than 14 since the start of this year why the burst of optimism forget the flow of news this has got very little to do with us china trade talks and it has very little to do with the us government shutdown as for oil it s not really got much to do with any supply or demand imbalances it s all about central banks as usual the federal reserve has backed down somewhat from the very punchy stance it took in autumn last year jerome powell was much more conciliatory towards markets in recent speeches hinting that he admired janet yellen s ability to change course quickly in 2016 when markets were gripped by a similar panic to the one we saw in december we then had a set of fed meeting minutes that also suggested the fed is a lot more hesitant about raising rates any further than the mood music had previously indicated why does this matter because markets have spent the last ten years gradually getting used to the idea that whatever happens the fed will always have their backs when that idea was threatened when the central bank put was going to be taken away markets panicked the hope now is that powell gets it he understands what the deal is between markets and the central bank and he s going to be a good little central banker from now on the weakening us dollar is good for markets now the fed hasn t actually done anything yet it is still reducing its balance sheet ie it is still enacting quantitative tightening and while there might not be any more interest rate rises any time soon the market had already been sceptical about that prospect anyway but what the fed s newfound attitude has done is to help send the us dollar lower and right now if anything can give us a steer on whether this rally will last it s the strength of the american currency i ve said this lots of times before but i keep repeating it because it s important if you want to get a good idea of how tight global monetary policy is you just need to look at the dollar the dollar is the most important currency in the world everyone needs it so if it gets more expensive that means money gets tighter around the world of course it s more complicated than that but as a rule of thumb it works pretty well for example the weakening dollar means that we get a stronger chinese yuan that s good news because a chinese devaluation is one thing that markets really are nervous about a slump in the chinese currency would be very deflationary for the global economy and deflation is still the big bogeyman as far as investors are concerned right now a weaker dollar and a rising oil price is also inflationary at least in the short term the oil price is a little more complicated in that higher petrol prices hit disposable income for consumers and therefore arguably act as a tax but a rising oil price certainly makes it harder for companies to keep prices down overall what markets want to see right now is inflationary pressure economic strength combined with a supportive fed so what lies ahead keep an eye on the us dollar we do this every saturday in money morning along with lots of other charts but in terms of what could impact this i think we re looking at two main things one is the strength of us economic data and two is the way in which the fed reacts to this the market basically wants the fed to always be dovish relative to economic conditions if the economy looks as though it is growing strongly then the market will give the fed a bit more leeway if the economy looks wobbly markets will immediately expect the fed to react in some way i suspect by promising to adjust the pace of qt in other words investors want the fed to stay behind the curve that mentality won t change until they view inflation as being a greater risk than deflation and even then it might not change the big question and i don t think we have the answer to this yet is whether or not the fed will play along hints from powell that he will indeed follow in the footsteps of yellen ben bernanke and alan greenspan are what has driven this latest rally my gut feeling is that he ll be called upon to back this up with action at some point in the near future and when that happens i reckon he will capitulate possibly using the government shutdown as the ideal excuse to extend fed support for the us economy but we ll see that s what to watch and just a reminder it d be nice to see you on 12 february so book your ticket now
newly elected representative alexandria ocasio cortez d n y argued on monday that modern monetary theory mmt ought to be a part of the conversation when it comes to funding major social policy initiatives such as her proposed green new deal stephanie kelton former economic advisor to bernie sanders has likewise insisted that mmt should replace our current thinking about government finance yet what is mmt and is it really as revolutionary as its proponents claim at its heart mmt is a way of describing the federal budget and the federal reserve as if they were unified under a single executive authority in describing the system so the dangers of federal deficit spending are no longer that it crowds out private investment and slows economic growth but that it leads potentially to excess inflation yet modern monetary theorists then invariably argue that inflation is not and indeed could not be a major problem for the united states many hard core adherents go so far as to propose a job guarantee program paid for by the federal government which they argue will virtually eliminate both unemployment and the possibility of runaway inflation the tenets of mmt should be familiar to an older generation of fiscal conservatives before the 1980s central banks such as the federal reserve were controlled far more directly by their governments as a result they could and often did bail out profligate governments by simply printing more money to cover the government s debt this led to massive currency devaluation runaway inflation or both in the early 1980s however central banks in the developed world were granted independence in the hopes that doing so would stop the spiraling inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s in the u s fed chairman paul volcker was spectacularly successful at this so were to varying degrees most central banks in the developed world some holdouts existed notably in southern europe a situation that would come back to haunt them decades later but mmt waves away the significance of these developments instead focusing attention on several technical facts first when the federal government wants to spend money it does so by having the treasury issue checks these checks are processed by the federal reserve bank of new york frbny second the frbny does this literally by marking up the value of digital reserves in an account belonging to the check recipients bank and marking down the account of the treasury by an equal amount these two operations are in theory separate there is no technical reason why the frbny has to mark down the treasury account it only does so because laws require the federal government to meet all of its obligations such laws argue modern monetary theorists cannot bind congress which after all has the power to alter them mmt advocates argue that congress should ask the treasury to sell treasury bonds to cover any of its outstanding obligations this is not however because they think it is necessary to fulfill the government s obligations but because doing so would help stabilize the macroeconomy all well and good but at some point won t the debt become so large that merely paying interest on it will require issuing additional debt won t this process feed on itself until all the borrowing capacity in the economy is soaked up no mmt advocates reply because the government can simply stop issuing debt meeting its obligations instead by having the federal reserve simply create money on its behalf indeed this is what distressed governments have traditionally done when their liabilities add up and the result has typically been hyperinflation modern monetary theorists argue that this need not be the case their exact reasoning differs at times they argue that hyperinflation only occurs in countries that borrow from abroad in debt denominated in a foreign government s currency i don t know enough about every single instance of hyperinflation to verify this claim but it is true that the worst incidences of hyperinflation are typically associated with borrowing from abroad when a country prints money in an attempt to fund the government the international exchange value of its currency collapses if the country owes debt denominated in a foreign currency that debt becomes more difficult to pay down as its own currency falls then the country has to print even more money to meet its debt payments which of course causes the exchange value of its currency to fall further creating a vicious circle that ends in hyperinflation modern monetary theorists argue that this can t happen to the united states because all of our debt is in the form of treasury bonds that are denominated in dollars if the international exchange value of the dollar falls that does not change the value of our debt it does however mean that foreigners will be repaid in a currency that will be worth much less to them foreign bondholders are not stupid they would regard this as a type of unofficial default after experiencing this type of default through currency devaluation they would be much less willing to buy treasury bonds or indeed any type of american security again this is precisely the situation that italy spain and greece found themselves in during the 1980s both countries had regularly devalued their currency as a way to get out from underneath foreign debts and were increasingly locked out of international markets the euro was created at least in part in an effort to solve this it could ultimately be printed only with the authority of the european central bank meaning that neither italy spain greece nor any other member country could avert a debt crisis by devaluing its currency instead they would have to raise taxes to meet their obligations that brings us to the second argument mmt advocates invoke when arguing that we should not worry about excessive debt leading to inflation if inflation becomes a problem the federal government can simply raise taxes slowing down the economy which in turn will cool inflation but there are two problems with this approach first it is political suicide at a time when consumers are facing ever rising prices it would seem cruel beyond measure to slap them with a tax increase very few governments would have the nerve to do this if anything history shows us that governments will instead resort to spending money on subsidies to ease the burden of rapidly rising prices second committing to this approach would risk an economic calamity in 1973 opec placed an embargo on the united states that resulted in the price of oil quadrupling overnight the sharply rising price of oil led both to a slowing economy and an increase in inflation a dangerous mix a slowing economy lowers tax revenues making it more difficult for the government to meet its debt payments suppose at a time when the economy was slowing but inflation was rising the u s government had firmly committed itself to mmt principles and refused to waver in that case it would not be able to resort to money printing because inflation was rising instead it would be obligated to raise taxes both to meet its debt payments and to slow the rate of inflation sharp increases in taxes during a recession however can be self defeating this is exactly the situation that greece and to a lesser extent italy and spain found themselves in during the great recession the crises lowered revenue which worsened their budget deficits as a result the government was forced to raise taxes and lower spending during the recession this caused the economy to contract further which caused tax revenue to fall so much that the budget deficit actually rose in the case of greece this self defeating cycle of higher taxes and lower revenues caused the government to ultimately default on its debts anyway that of course worsened the economic crisis the country was already facing in the face of such a calamity no sovereign government would or perhaps even should refrain from devaluing its currency and inflating away at least some of its debts for that reason governments have designed institutions to avoid falling into this trap in the united states that means both making the federal reserve independent and not subject to the direct authority of the treasury and requiring the treasury to meet all of its obligations with cash raised from tax revenues or treasury bond sales in effect we ve outlawed the methods of modern monetary theory and with good reason more from national review

leaders say cannot be renegotiated and is the only one available will almost certainly be rejected if so uncertainty paralysis and the likelihood of a disorderly no deal brexit will rise volatility is nothing new to sterling friday being a microcosm of how the fx market is playing brexit a media report that britain s departure could be delayed sent the pound shooting up nearly a cent to its highest since nov 29 then minutes later may s spokeswoman ruled out any delay and the pound fell right back again one month implied options volatility in sterling is much higher than euro vol and that s

in 1988 the economist magazine ran an article on ireland titled the poorest of the rich the title was well deserved that year irish per capita gdp was just 70 percent of the figure for the united kingdom and 52 percent that of the united states the unemployment rate was 16 2 percent compared to 8 5 percent in britain and 5 5 percent in the united states irish government debt amounted to 85 percent of gdp compared to 60 percent in the united states and 37 percent in the united kingdom but when the economist next came to write about ireland s economy in 1997 they called it the celtic tiger europe s shining light this title was equally well deserved the irish economy grew at an average annual rate of 9 4 percent between 1995 and 2000 real gdp growth outpaced that in the united kingdom in every year from 1989 to 2003 and that of the united states in every year after 1993 while ireland s gdp grew by 229 percent between 1987 and 2007 in the united states the figure was 161 percent and in the united kingdom it was 152 percent this led to a surge in the level of irish per capita gdp after 1993 in 1997 ireland overtook the united kingdom on this score and by 2007 was 27 percent above it and up to 96 percent of the united states s level unemployment tumbled after 1993 between 1993 and 1999 about 415 000 extra jobs were filled an increase of 35 percent virtually all of it in the private sector by 1999 ireland s unemployment rate was below that of the united kingdom by 2001 it was below that of the united states so long an exporter of people ireland became an importer net migration changed from a loss of 5 000 in 1993 to a gain of 22 800 in 1998 this increased prosperity worked wonders for ireland s government indebtedness from 1993 government debt as a share of gdp fell rapidly reaching 25 percent in 2007 by 2002 it was lower than the ratio in both the united states and the united kingdom what happened the irish hadn t found the mysterious pot of gold they had simply embraced sound fiscal and monetary policies according to economist dermot mcaleese in the years prior to the economist s 1988 diagnosis ireland had been plagued by high taxes low confidence high labour costs excessive regulation and anti competitive practices and no matter how high tax rates were spending was higher still which meant large fiscal deficits by the beginning of the 1990s it had become apparent that this could no longer continue acting boldly the government with wide support slashed spending and made credible commitments not to engage in deficit spending or inflate the currency it deregulated and drastically lowered tax rates the 2002 index of economic freedom published by the wall street journal and the heritage foundation ranked ireland the world s fourth freest economy mcaleese highlighted the importance of getting government spending under control the espousal of fiscal rectitude and new consensus economic policies was not in fact new what was new was the decision to attack the debt by controlling public spending rather than by increasing taxes for a small open economy curbing public spending proved a far more productive way forward it created room for tax cuts while simultaneously lowering the debt ratio another ploy was the introduction of a tax amnesty following on the high tax policy of the 1980s and the reorientation in fiscal policy it proved hugely successful in terms of revenue generation domestic interest rates fell steeply as investor confidence grew thus starting off that rare occurrence in modern economics an expansionary fiscal contraction fears that strong fiscal contraction would prove deflationary were confounded though precisely why this was so remains the subject of controversy one of the headline cuts was to ireland s corporate tax until the late 1980s the standard rate of corporate profits tax cpt was 50 percent with a 10 percent rate on all corporate profits for export oriented manufacturing and traded services ireland replaced this system in 1997 with a 12 5 percent rate of corporation tax for trading income from january 1 2003 these low rates brought high revenues in 2004 corporate income taxes accounted for 13 percent of all tax revenue in ireland compared to 6 percent in the united states and 8 percent in the united kingdom that s gratitude for you this is now under threat you might have expected ireland s partners in the european union eu to look at that country s success and think here is something to be emulated instead they see it as something to be stopped as businesses choose to locate in ireland rather than high tax jurisdictions elsewhere in the eu those higher tax countries are attempting to force higher tax rates upon the irish via the eu in the eu votes are not opportunities for electorates to make decisions but for them to rubber stamp decisions already taken by eu leaders until now the irish have doggedly defended this in 2008 the irish voted to reject the european constitution because among other things they wanted to safeguard their successful low tax policies but in the eu votes are not opportunities for electorates to make decisions but for them to rubber stamp decisions already taken by eu leaders so the irish were made to vote again they were given assurances that the new lisbon treaty the renamed constitution would among other things affect their taxation policies in 2009 they dutifully voted yes to lisbon of course the eu never abandons an idea it only delays it and the eu started the year by coming for ireland s low taxes once more at present some decisions on tax policy have to be taken unanimously giving countries like ireland a veto but the european commission the unelected executive body of the eu is moving to end that the low taxes upon which ireland s modern economic miracle are based are unlikely to outlive unanimity by very much unsurprisingly many irish are not keen on being stripped of the ability to set their own tax rate ireland has used tax policy as a vital tool for economic development since 1956 says ian talbot chief executive of chambers ireland as a small open island at the edge of europe it remains important that we retain some independent tools for competitiveness a province once again the irish citizen army which fought against british rule in the easter rising of 1916 flew a banner reading we serve neither king nor kaiser but ireland by contrast leo varadkar s fine gael government has loyally done as the eu told it to during the brexit negotiations if the irish were hoping that their reward would be tolerance towards their low tax economic model it looks as though they will be disappointed

it doesn t guarantee investors will be happy the last round of results which began to arrive in october showed even faster growth but did little to stem the stock market s rapid sell off at the end of the year that s in part because wall street is looking ahead how factors like a global slowdown and rising interest rates will affect future profits next week will bring results from banks including jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs as well as companies like delta and netflix on thursday friday aedt cautionary statements from macy s and american airlines weighed on their shares and those of other department stores and airlines here are some of the questions investors will be seeking answers to as they weigh whether they went too far with the sell off will china s slump hurt america s businesses cautionary statements from macy s and american airlines weighed on their shares on thursday friday aedt mary altaffer for much of 2018 investors were surprisingly willing to shrug off risks posed by the trade war that erupted between china and the united states the world s two largest economies advertisement but as the dispute has dragged on and stretched from its original focus on america s yawning trade deficit with china to seemingly intractable questions over technological and geopolitical dominance it s starting to take a toll china s economy is showing signs of weakness and that s bad news for companies that count the country as a major market apple recently slashed its sales forecast for the first time in 16 years citing weak sales of iphones in china where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a decade south korean giant samsung a huge producer of both smartphones and semiconductors similarly cut its profit outlook citing weak global growth and the impact isn t limited to tech ford fedex starbucks and tiffany have all noted weakness in china as a risk in recent months furthermore it isn t just china the slowdown is rippling through other economies germany s industrial engine which exports high end autos and industrial equipment to china is sputtering and dragging on european growth and japan s economy the world s third largest contracted in the third quarter what s the mood of american consumers for companies that aren t heavily exposed to foreign markets the outlook for domestic consumption which accounts for roughly two thirds of america s economic activity is what matters on that front the news is still mostly good advertisement last year consumer sentiment measures showed americans to be largely inured to a noisy political and economic climate there are good reasons this resilience could continue wages are rising gas prices have fallen and americans who stand to benefit from the trump administration s tax overhaul could start to see higher tax refunds roll in over the coming months it s tough to again have a recession when consumers are getting more money from tax refunds and oil prices are lower said keith parker head of us equity strategy at ubs companies have confirmed that view in its earnings report last month darden restaurants the parent company of olive garden noted that consumers were splurging adding to their entrees and buying up right now we think the consumer is in a really good place eugene lee darden s chief executive said on a conference call after the company s earnings release still stock market moves typically lead consumer sentiment meaning december s sharp sell off could take some of the fizz out of the mood of american shoppers even after a recovery in the early days of 2019 the s p 500 remains more than 10 per cent below its september peak advertisement the federal shutdown could also dampen spirits previous episodes of government dysfunction such as the 2011 fight over raising the debt ceiling and the 2013 government shutdown were associated with sharp drops in consumer confidence what s the impact of rising wages and other costs for large employers rising wages will cut into profits unless they find a way to get customers to pay higher prices a plan by amazon to pay a us15 21 hourly wage to its 250 000 employees in the united states as well as roughly 100 000 seasonal workers is expected to take a significant chunk out of its profits in november tjx companies the parent of retailers like marshalls t j maxx and homegoods all of which appeal to consumers because they keep prices low also offered cautious guidance for the fourth quarter in the face of rising labor and shipping costs wages aren t the only things rising increasing commodity prices transportation costs and interest rates are typical conundrums for corporations in latter stages of an economic expansion advertisement the emergence of those pressures on corporate profits is one reason investors have grown increasingly worried about stocks will executives sit on their hands executives don t mind paying more for wages raw materials and shipping if sales keep rising as the economy continues to grow but if the outlook darkens executives will be quick to snap their wallets shut the us economy still looks strong more than 300 000 jobs were created in december unemployment remains below 4 per cent through the third quarter the economy was on track for its best annual performance since 2005 still uncertainty about what s to come could dissuade some decision makers from pulling the trigger on new investments in real estate plants and equipment such capital spending is crucial to keeping the economic expansion on track making any broad pause in spending a potential pitfall for growth there are signs that the outlook is becoming increasingly murky while reporting earnings wednesday homebuilder lennar said it couldn t offer investors a forecast for 2019 because of continued softness and uncertainty in the housing market which has been squeezed by rising mortgage rates such comments as well as any mentions of plans to delay production or expansion plans will be of intense interest to investors this earnings season both for the individual companies involved and for the possible impact of those decisions on the u s economy that could itself lead to a future slowdown said maneesh deshpande head of us equity strategy at barclays
spread the love harare finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube yesterday said the country will have its own currency within the next 12 months as government is frantically working on raising enough foreign currency to anchor it addressing delegates at a road to davos townhall meeting in the capital yesterday prof ncube said adopting the united states dollar or the south african rand would not solve the country s macro economic problems on the issue of raising enough foreign currency to introduce the new currency we are on our way already give us months not years he said asked to give a timeline on when currency reforms would be implemented prof ncube said it would be done in less than 12 months he said separating the parity between real time gross settlement accounts rtgs and foreign currency accounts fca was the beginning of currency reforms which are necessary for pushing the country s economy in the right direction there is a balance between preservation of value and removing price distortions said prof ncube the separation of accounts between the fca and rtgs accounts was the beginning of currency reform prof ncube said he was no longer in favour of adopting the rand as that would still depend on the availability of us dollars i also hear that the citizens are pushing towards adopting the rand i even argued for it years ago and there was a reason you know if we are going to assume the rand as our currency we first of all have to acquire the rand and we need us dollars first to purchase the rand in the long term zimbabwe needs its own currency he said our job is to introduce a currency that will be stable and less volatile dealing with the fiscal side is the first order to move towards a stable currency after all what we have now is fiscal policy and now monetary policy and we have to tighten the belt on the currency volatility adopting the united states dollar as the country s sole legal tender is not the way to solve zimbabwe s macro economic challenges said prof ncube this comes as different companies and individuals have been pushing for the re dollarisation of the economy with claims that the shortage of hard currency is choking business operations recently delta corporation announced that it would start selling its products in hard currency citing that operations were being adversely affected by foreign currency shortages the decision was later reversed after consultations with the government instead prof ncube said zimbabwe s solution lay in currency reforms the issue is shortage of forex with the corporates the silver bullet is about currency reform if we get that right the corporates can access foreign currency whenever they need it the currency reform agenda is also impeding foreign investment if investors cannot take their money out of the country then we cannot attract investors he said a long term solution to the crisis is currency reforms currency reforms and currency reforms and ending arbitrage opportunities in the market accepting the us dollar as the only legal tender is not currency reform its submission as a nation if we accept us dollar as our sole currency then it means that we are afraid of currency reform and that s capitulation this also comes at a time when industry has also raised a red flag towards re dollarisation confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe is on record saying re dollarising the economy is counter productive as it stifles growth and could halve the size of the economy we see more companies wanting to sell in us dollars but the issue is that we don t need dollarisation as an economy said mr jabangwe the economy will shrink by as much as 50 percent if we dollarise so for me it is not the right way to go we have seen it with us dollars in the past that we won t be competitive when using the us dollar an economist with a local commercial bank joseph mverecha has on countless times weighed in disapproving the re dollarisation of the zimbabwean economy re dollarisation will sustain disintermediation and dislocation in the economy to the extent that foreign exchange access is non existent for the vast majority of zimbabweans who are non exporters and constitute the largest segment of the population said dr mverecha share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading

zimbabwe currency in 12 months us as only legal tender is not currency reform ncube kudakwashe mhundwa and princess ncube finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube yesterday said the country will have its own currency within the next 12 months as government is frantically working on raising enough foreign currency to anchor it addressing delegates at a road to davos townhall meeting held in the capital yesterday prof ncube said adopting the united states dollar or the south african rand would not solve the country s macro economic problems on the issue of raising enough foreign currency to introduce the new currency we are on our way already give us months not years he said asked to give a timeline on when currency reforms would be implemented prof ncube said it would be done in less than 12 months he said separating the parity between the real time gross settlement accounts rtgs and foreign currency accounts fca was the beginning of currency reforms which are necessary for pushing the country s economy in the right direction there is a balance between preservation of value and removing price distortions said prof ncube the separation of accounts between the fca and rtgs accounts was the beginning of currency reform prof ncube said he was no longer in favour of adopting the rand as that would still depend on the availability of us dollars i also hear that the citizens are pushing towards adopting the rand i even argued for it years ago and there was a reason you know if we are going to assume the rand as our currency we first of all have to acquire the rand and we need us dollars first to purchase the rand in the long term zimbabwe needs its own currency he said our job is to introduce a currency that will be stable and less volatile dealing with the fiscal side is the first order to move towards a stable currency after all what we have now is fiscal policy and now monetary policy and we have to tighten the belt on the currency volatility adopting the united states dollar as the country s sole legal tender is not the way to solve zimbabwe s macro economic challenges said prof ncube this comes as different companies and individuals have been pushing for the re dollarisation of the country s economy with claims that the shortage of hard currency is choking business operations recently beverages giant delta corporation announced that it would start selling its products in hard currency citing that operations were being adversely affected by foreign currency shortages the decision was later reversed after consultations with government instead prof ncube said zimbabwe s solution lay in currency reforms the issue is shortage of forex with the corporates the silver bullet is about currency reform if we get that right the corporates can access foreign currency whenever they need it the currency reform agenda is also impeding foreign investment if investors cannot take their money out of the country then we cannot attract investors he said a long term solution to the crisis is currency reforms currency reforms and currency reforms and ending arbitrage opportunities in the market accepting the us dollar as the only legal tender is not currency reform its submission as a nation if we accept us dollar as our sole currency then it means that we are afraid of currency reform and that s capitulation this also comes at a time when industry has also raised a red flag towards re dollarisation confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe is on record saying re dollarising the economy is counter productive as it stifles growth and could halve the size of the economy we see more companies wanting to sell in us dollars but the issue is that we don t need dollarisation as an economy said mr jabangwe the economy will shrink by as much as 50 percent if we dollarise so for me it is not the right way to go we have seen it with us dollars in the past that we won t be competitive when using the us dollar an economist with a local commercial bank joseph mverecha has on countless times weighed in disapproving the re dollarisation of the zimbabwean economy re dollarisation will sustain disintermediation and dislocation in the economy to the extent that foreign exchange access is non existent for the vast majority of zimbabweans who are non exporters and constitute the largest segment of the population said dr mverecha
