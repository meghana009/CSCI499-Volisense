mar 7 2019 alasdair macleod the explanation for the sudden halt in global economic growth is found in the coincidence of peak credit combining with trade protectionism the history of economic downturns points to a rerun of the 1929 32 period but with fiat currencies substituted for a gold standard government finances are in far worse shape today and markets have yet to appreciate the consequences of just a moderate contraction in global trade between new issues and liquidation by foreigners domestic buyers will need to absorb 2 trillion of us treasuries in the coming year so qe is bound to return with a vengeance the last hurrah for fiat currencies however china and russia have the means to escape this fate assuming they have the gumption to do so introduction it may be too early to say the world is entering a significant economic downturn but even ardent bulls must admit to it as an increasing possibility financial analysts both bovine and ursine face a complex matrix of factors when judging the future effect of any downturn on currencies and of the prospects for the dollar in particular some will take the view that a global downturn will continue to drive foreign currencies to be sold for dollars because dollars are perceived to be less risky and required to repay debt some will point to the tension in the euro from the extra twist an economic downturn gives to the debt crisis forced on italy and the other three pigs compared with the relative stability of the hanseatic nations some analysts will expect china to get her come uppance when her debt fuelled economy implodes into crisis as a recession progresses it is conventional to think of the dollar as a safe haven for a brief time relative to other currencies this might be true but what then those that succeed in their analysis beyond the short term will do so by discarding all bias they could then observe that in the event an economic downturn gathers pace a split could emerge in relative outcomes between east and west the effect of a downturn on the asian bloc led by china russia and now joined by india is likely to differ from the effect on america and europe it is the new versus the old asian mercantile states that provide minimal welfare differing from the more mature welfare heavy nations when we consider these two groups we tend to analyse the situation through the lens of our own prejudices remove this predisposition and it should become clear that whatever the starting point in terms of debt to gdp and other metrics the prospects for welfare light nations are considerably better in a global economic downturn than they are for nations burdened by extensive welfare obligations china and other asian states will not face the same degree of debt escalation as america japan the uk and the european nations furthermore asia has far more dynamic economies with the potential for a continuing industrial revolution government finances will be central to outcomes given that all government finances deteriorate during economic downturns the starting point and the pace of debt escalation are what should concern us china s overall debt to gdp ratio at approximately 260 compares with that of the us which is around 360 so on that score china s total debt is significantly less the us government s debt to gdp stands at over 100 while china s is estimated to be under 45 yet western analysts perceive china to be in a weaker debt position than the us america s principal strength which everyone cites is the reserve role of her currency everyone needs dollars all countries without sophisticated financial markets in their own currencies borrow in dollars which must eventually be repaid everything from commodity prices to global financial markets is referenced in dollars the dollar has also become weaponised the means of enforcing america s foreign policy it is the king rat of the currency world so long as the world enjoys continual economic growth the dollar is difficult to challenge when the economic tide turns everything becomes different in this article i explain why the global economy is heading for a crisis which could be similar in scale to the great depression if this analysis is correct then the dollar s prospects as the global reserve currency even its continuing existence will be threatened and must be reassessed in that light peak credit is coinciding with trade protection in a previous article i pointed out the catastrophic danger of combining trade protectionism with the top of the credit cycle this combination was devastating when the smoot hawley tariff act was passed by congress in october 1929 particularly when compared with the relatively minor consequences of the fordney mccumber tariffs of 1922 the difference was fordney mccumber was introduced early in the credit cycle and smoot hawley at its peak this dissimilarity was the principal driver behind the viciousness of the wall street crash and the subsequent global depression we have a situation today so similar to smoot hawley and its coincidence with the top of the credit cycle in 1929 that we should be deeply concerned what is particularly alarming is that international trade appears to have already stopped expanding almost as if it has run into a brick wall a comparison with the 1929 experience suggests this result as extremely likely that precedent warns us today s international trade may be rapidly sliding from expansion into severe contraction with dire consequences for the whole global economy smoot hawley and the top of the credit cycle in 1929 combined into the motive force that made the great depression unnecessarily deep global and intractable the impact on government debt funding will be immense the question then arises as to how a top of the credit cycle event combined with an escalation of trade protectionism will impact the us economy today particularly with regard to funding an increasing budget deficit when americans have become used to foreigners buying the bulk of new treasury bonds to appreciate the full implications we must revisit the connection between trade and budget deficits under the recessionary assumption that the budget deficit will rise while trade volumes contract but before examining the consequences we must set the scene by explaining why and how the twin deficits are linked the easiest way to do so is to imagine a world of sound money where the total of money and credit is fixed and the preference for holding money relative to goods does not alter if the quantity of money and credit is constant all imports must be paid for by exports in other words trade imbalances cannot arise if there are no changes in the total of circulating money if credit is extended to an importer it must be sourced from savers prepared to defer their spending instead of being created out of thin air as is the case with fractional reserve banking at the same time the government can only finance its spending by raising taxes and borrowing from private individuals the banking system in our sound money example can only act as intermediaries and cannot increase the quantity of money or credit to pay for government spending nor can it expand credit to finance trade therefore the sound money condition that makes a trade imbalance impossible is the same one that makes a budget deficit impossible it follows from this that if the quantities of money and credit are allowed to expand imbalances develop for trade or government budgets or both one deficit does not have to lead to the other but to the extent it does not then the difference must be reflected in a change in the savings rate savings must be spent in order to increase the consumption that leads to trade deficits alternatively they must be invested or spending deferred in order to reduce them if a government spends more than it receives in taxes and the resulting budget deficit is not reflected in a similar deficit on the balance of trade it is because individuals defer their spending and increase their savings by buying government bonds their spending on consumer items thereby becomes curtailed restricting demand for imported consumer goods obviously there are other investment media such as corporate bonds and new issues which attract savings which is why the twin deficits will never be exactly equal but generally if there is no change in the savings rate both trade and budget deficits will approximate with each other in today s world of fiat currencies a budget deficit still has to be financed in the absence of an increase in savings the two sources of non saver finance are the purchase of government debt by the banking system and the reinvestment of surplus dollars accumulating in foreign hands mainly as a result of the trade deficit so long as foreigners are willing to reinvest their dollar surpluses instead of selling them the twin deficits are not destabilising the trouble comes when that condition ceases which is most likely to happen when the credit cycle turns and tariffs are imposed or threatened furthermore government finances deteriorate rapidly when an economic slump develops table 1 below is an idealised illustration of how the government funding requirement increases during a relatively minor recession due to a changing combination of the twin deficits our starting point is the us fiscal year to october just ended the demise of unbacked fiat currencies us residents and banks would only have had to find 184bn in fiscal 2018 to fill the federal government s funding gap this is the domestic funding requirement assuming the changes listed in the notes to table 1 apply to fiscal 2019 the domestic funding requirement rises to over a trillion dollars an increase of more than fivefold crucially this assumes capital surpluses accumulating in foreign hands from the us s trade deficit are fully recycled into treasury bonds an escalation of domestic funding requirements will be repeated in all other countries that habitually run trade deficits and face rising welfare obligations these dynamics are certainly not factored into market expectations because bond yields have yet to reflect the increase in supply and the price of gold has not suggested the inflationary implications of the quantitative easing certain to be reintroduced in all the advanced economies returning to our analysis of the us position the increase in the domestic funding requirement implies capital imports would have to rise sharply even in a moderate recession if a funding crisis is to be avoided that is unlikely to happen assuming that global trade is beginning to contract as our thesis suggests it is more likely foreigners will be repatriating funds into their own currencies instead of investing them in dollars earlier bullish assumptions by foreign corporations about trade expansion will inevitably lead to a downwards reassessment of their dollar requirements rising budget deficits and the emergence of malinvestments in their own jurisdictions will require funding as well the potential for a government funding crisis to go global is very real until only recently foreign investors have continually increased their investments in us treasury bonds expecting uninterrupted growth in cross border trade this has changed with america s new protectionist policies and the chinese and european responses to them we saw evidence of this in the us treasury s tic data for december when foreigners were recorded as net sellers to the tune of 91 4bn representing nearly twice the previous month s trade deficit this may be early evidence that capital flows are already reversing out of us dollars without capital inflows it will be the american banking system and private investors that will have to fund the whole budget deficit and absorb further dollar liquidation from abroad just to be clear table 1 above tells us the domestic funding requirement will switch from 184bn last year to financing the whole budget deficit of over 1 500bn if foreigners stop buying additionally there is the prospect of extra capital outflows if december s tic figures are any guide at that rate foreigners will liquidate a significant portion of their existing dollar investments which includes the disposal of treasury bonds these dollar sales are likely to be significant and could easily take total required purchases of us treasuries by domestic sources to well over 2 000bn foreigners have accumulated substantial dollar investments over the years and at the last date of record end june 2018 they totalled 19 4 trillion to which we can add cash funds held through correspondent banks and short term money instruments totalling a further 5 2 trillion as at last december at over 110 of gdp the total of 24 6 trillion in investments and cash is the highest dollar exposure ever recorded in foreign hands we must also mention the feedback of contracting international trade on other economies because that will undermine us exports even more as well as their import export trade with each other countries with an exporting surplus will therefore take a hit on their trade from a general contraction but as countries such as japan and germany have consistently proved the savings habit which is part and parcel of their trade surpluses will otherwise limit their difficulties to considerably less than those faced by the welfare spendthrifts who have euthanised their savers britain france and the mediterranean states are at particular risk and the prospects for currency dislocation from the additional strain on the euro system can be expected to escalate into a european currency and banking crisis in a short time the negative feedback from these chains of events is likely to further undermine state finances everywhere by deepening the trade contraction reducing tax income and increasing welfare commitments table 1 above will reflect just the opening salvo in a deepening slump an outcome that is likely to become impossible to avoid with serious consequences for currencies as central banks respond with an increasing pace of monetary inflation the coincidence of smoot hawley tariffs and the top of the credit cycle in 1929 occurred under a gold standard the mythology of that experience has left the gold standard blamed for the depression and fed into the inflationist policies we see today in truth it is a confusion of effect with the cause and few economists appreciate the destructive role tariffs played at the peak of the credit cycle nevertheless everyone knows what the policy response from central bankers this time will be they will fund their governments deficits in conjunction with increasing the reserves of the commercial banks by the tested expedient of quantitative easing the precedent of qe for resolving difficulties of this type was the policy response to the great financial crisis it is impossible for american and other savers who are all but euthanised anyway to fund escalating budget deficits when they are personally in debt becoming unemployed and their financial investments are suffering from vicious bear markets the neo keynesian dictum is to encourage spending to the exclusion of saving driven by the belief the great depression was exacerbated by a tendency to save instead inflationism will replace savings accelerating the destruction of personal wealth in short the central banks see no alternative to throwing the inflationary dice just one more time despite repeated failures to achieve anything positive in the past other than their states survival while politically there appears to be no alternative to squeezing the last drops of blood from the productive private sector to support governments and the international banking system the escalation of monetary inflation could finally destroy unbacked fiat currencies instead of repeating the gold induced collapse of commodity and raw material prices in the 1930s eventually prices will rise as fiat currencies sink giving only a brief appearance of price stability so after an initial financial shock it is likely that residential property values mining stocks and the share prices of businesses that can survive a currency collapse might begin to recover measured in devaluing currency terms if so it resolves nothing the most pressing problem besides the economic slump and the currency collapse is the continuing crisis in government finances it is commonly assumed that the devaluation of existing government obligations favours government this naïve view does not take into account the cost escalation of future legally mandated obligations on governments to provide continuing welfare and other services it is difficult to envisage welfare driven governments having the authority to reverse the socialising legislation of the last ninety years sufficiently in order to stabilise their finances however an increase of the quantity of base currency by the central bank through qe and the accompanying expansion of bank reserves will continue to be seen as a practical monetary policy it is only later the horrors for the general price level will become fully apparent by then it will be too late if it is not already to address a growing loss of public trust in the currency s purchasing power in the case of the dollar as soon as foreigners overexposed to it become aware of its trending direction they are likely to accelerate their selling on the foreign exchanges realising their losses on us treasuries this particularly applies to the chinese and japanese america s largest creditors whose focus will have shifted from kowtowing to america s trade policies to supporting their domestic economies with a falling dollar measured in yuan yen and even euros if that currency still exists by then the general price level in america will begin to rise at an accelerating pace which can no longer be concealed through statistical management and so the difference between the collapse that started in 1929 and the current hiatus is gold ninety years ago through the medium of the dollar prices were measured in gold at one ounce for 20 67 it led to a 40 devaluation of the dollar in january 1934 today while the actual tariffs proposed are less than those of smoot hawley and not yet fully implemented the monetary inflation behind the credit cycle has been considerably more extreme if the combination of the two in 1929 remains a valid precedent for what is going to pass in the next year or two today s unbacked fiat dollars face a full frontal challenge not only to financial asset values but also to international and the american public s faith in the dollar as a viable currency escaping the fiat collapse from the foregoing it is clear that a series of events has now commenced that threatens to spark a worldwide cyclical credit crisis centred on that king rat of currencies the dollar other currencies face similar problems twin deficits a lack of savers escalating government welfare commitments and a decline in tax income these currencies are threatened with the same fate as the dollar but perhaps not concurrently this will not come as a surprise to followers of austrian business cycle theory but western central banks vaguely understanding another credit crisis is likely have tried to seal off the escape routes they have largely persuaded their populations that gold is no longer money they have instructed banks to limit cash withdrawals they have protected their governments from a future systemic crisis by tightening regulations and enacting legislation for bail ins to replace bail outs the effect of these measures in a crisis can only be guessed at but they are likely to accelerate the destruction of a currency s purchasing power if instead of encashing deposits meaning people exit the banking system but not the currency people are forced to exchange bank balances for physical goods and perhaps cryptocurrencies in order to escape systemic risk you might argue that small depositors are protected by deposit insurance but it is not the small depositors that will start a stampede into alternatives to bank deposits it will be larger depositors and holders of bank bonds who will protect themselves from bail ins currencies issued by nations which have retained a saving culture and whose governments are not obligated to provide expensive welfare for their citizens can survive if they take appropriate action undoubtedly they will face persuasion by their own neo keynesian inflationists to keep their currencies competitive at least initially when this leads to escalating domestic interest rates these policies are likely to be abandoned in favour of sound money in the form of gold backing and the inflationists side lined the currencies most likely to end up with gold backing are likely to be the chinese yuan and russian rouble both china and russia have embraced gold as the time honoured money superior to ever expanding fiat currencies besides stabilising the pan asian monetary situation for the benefit of eurasian trade a credible gold exchange standard introduces monetary discipline and reduces interest rates towards those mutually agreed between lenders and borrowers of gold while we cannot forecast this outcome with certainty we can see that the opportunity to escape currency destruction for asia will be available we can go even further and say there will be no credible alternative and that there are today specialists in the russian and chinese establishments far sighted enough to understand the point after all russia has already sold her dollars for gold and china deliberately moved to control the global market for bullion furthermore the last three months reports on the status of her reserves show china appears to have stopped accumulating dollars and instead is selling them for gold importantly now she does not mind advertising it china and russia are in a similar position to britain following the napoleonic wars following the formal reintroduction of the gold standard in 1821 the gold sovereign had been introduced in 1816 the value of government debt in private hands rose as interest rates fell and the government s financial credibility improved the wealth creation from this simple act of securing sound money was a major contributor to the success of the industrial revolution which propelled britain into her global pre eminence china has similar ambitions for the industrialisation of asia furthermore she understands it is only by allowing her citizens to accumulate personal wealth that her economic objectives can be achieved she would be stupid not to follow

catching up with the neighbors the leaders of asean member states pose for a group photo at the opening ceremony of the 33rd asean summit in singapore afp jewel samad catching up with the neighbors the leaders of asean member states pose for a group photo at the opening ceremony of the 33rd asean summit in singapore afp jewel samad c ountries in east and southeast asia are committed to strengthening the region s financial integration as an effort to improve economic stability close the infrastructure financing gap and ultimately decrease their dependence on foreign currency the united states china trade tensions uncertainty over brexit china s slowing economy and tightening monetary policies last year caused economic instability throughout the globe including in southeast asia during those times currencies like the indonesian rupiah philippine peso and chinese yuan for example were heavily depreciated because of a stronger us dollar luckily the turbulence only lasted during the first half of 2018 as the greenback lost its might toward the end of the year although lasting for only a few months the asean 3 member countries consisted of the 10 southeast asian countries along with china japan and korea were anxious when they remembered the nightmare of the 1997 asian financial crisis as last year s threats were projected to continue in 2019 to prevent the crisis from happening again the 13 countries have undertaken multiple efforts to strengthen the region s economic resilience one of which was a multilateral swap arrangement called the chiang mai initiative multilateralization cmim according to the asean 3 macroeconomic research office amro the initiative was established in 2000 as the chiang mai initiative that involved a network of bilateral swap and repurchase agreements among members the initiative was later multilateralized in 2010 into a single contractual agreement to act as a safety net for member countries amro deputy director yasuto watanabe said recently the multilateralization was expanded and it had collected us 120 billion any member country could withdraw 20 percent of the maximum amount if the international monetary fund imf did not support them known as the imf de linked portion whenever they face any balance of payment problems the members then agreed to strengthen the cmim by doubling its size to 240 billion and increasing the de linked portion to 30 percent he said during a seminar in jakarta on east asian financial cooperation the assistant governor of the central bank of the philippines monetary stability sector wilhelmina mañalac said the member countries were open to the possibility of increasing the total size and de linked portion in the future but he declined to reveal by how much they would raise them as the multilateral organization was still discussing the matter bank indonesia bi international department deputy director haris munandar told the jakarta post that the government was very supportive of the initiative as it acted as the country s second line of defense to maintain its financial stability it also enables us to provide funds to any countries that need the assistance he said adding that indonesia had committed to provide 9 billion to the initiative so far switzerland based financial firm ubs senior asean economist edward teather told the post the cmim was able to provide some sense of security to the member countries but he was unsure if those countries were keen on rushing to access the funds the scale of funds countries can access without conditionality isn t very big for most southeast asian countries he said the level of foreign exchange reserves by indonesia the philippines singapore malaysia and thailand is all far higher than they can get from cmim in a very short term besides focusing on maintaining stability the asean 3 countries are also committed to developing the region s financial market through the bond market in 2003 the countries set up the asian bond market initiative abmi to help create supply and demand as well as to mitigate local currency bonds in the region adb financial sector specialist kosintr puongsophol said the abmi provided information dissemination on local currency bond markets of the asean 3 members promoted and encouraged the issuance of local currency bonds and guaranteed more than 20 bonds issued in 2016 to 2018 in indonesia singapore thailand vietnam and the philippines however indonesia stock exchange senior researcher poltak hotradero said the promotion of the region s bond market has become more necessary nowadays as its potential was getting bigger day by day in 2017 alone he said global pension funds reached a total value of more than 41 trillion this created a huge opportunity for the asean 3 bond markets as big pension fund institutions were looking for more investment opportunities everywhere including in this region despite all of these efforts asean secretary general lim jock hoi said there was a pressing need to further integrate the region s financial markets to make them more resilient especially to natural disasters as southeast asian countries were particularly vulnerable to this threat he also said the integration among the asean 3 countries was needed to close the infrastructure financing gap as it would hopefully create more innovative investment instruments and products he added that countries should also make use of the rapid digital financial technology growth to play a big role in the integration process to increase financial inclusion in the region haris of bi said he also hoped the stronger financial cooperation between east asian countries would ultimately help reduce their dependence on foreign currency resulting in stronger resilience to external negative sentiments in the future

kornferry com with that i ll turn the conference over to mr burnison please go ahead gary burnison chief executive officer okay thank you anna good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us i would say that the quarter was very good for korn ferry we grew the top line 10 at constant currency and the profitability was outstanding this is my 67th earnings call it kind of feels like number six but today korn ferry is a much much different company we are an organizational consultancy that helps companies look at their talent and strategy together most clients can come up with a sound strategy but many struggle to make it stick because their talent strategy they re not in sync and that s exactly where we come in we help companies make sure that they have the right people in the right places for the right rewards that bring their strategy to life how do we do that well we do it by redesigning their org structure by helping them hire and hold onto the best people with the right skills and mind set for the future and also most importantly by motivating the people to not just fulfilled but to exceed their potential and as i ve said before strategy without talent is hopeless but talent without strategy is helpless and we connect those dots that s what korn ferry does and so on the 67th earnings call i see a substantially different company today than even two or three years ago with a completely different profile number one we re 50 bigger more than half of our revenues now generated from outside the us 61 of our colleagues are women 53 are millennial and only 14 of us are baby boomers our advisory business is over 800 million in revenue which alone is bigger than any other search firm and in fact it s about the size of our entire firm 10 years ago and most importantly i think we ve got a much more balanced and less cyclical company an evolution that s taken place all while our flagship search business has thrived it operates at the highest level and you would look to that not by hyperbole but you d actually look at your average fee and our average fee is 125 000 and we re generating more revenue by far than any industry competitor this company today is not a cyclic binge or bust company we re now a firm for all seasons whether the challenge is globalization cost synergies m a digital transformation we can help organizations make an impact in any kind of economic environment and the breadth and depth of our company is substantial our organizational strategy capabilities it s about 11 of the company today with that we help companies align their strategy with their people to their organizational structure our succession and assessment offerings we help clients close the gap between the talent they have and the talent they need nearly 50 million people have been assessed by korn ferry the assessment and succession offerings represent about 12 of our firm every year we develop 1 2 million executives we have almost 1 000 colleagues every single day the only thing they re doing is leadership development that accounts for about 10 of the company s footing we have reward data on 25 million people we know what it takes to keep your best talent our rewards business is about 10 of the company so we absolutely have the foundation for a multi billion revenue opportunity so the real question is well what do you do to get there and it has to start outside and it has to start with pursuing enduring scalable meaningful client relationships engagements that deliver measurable results for our clients today about 18 of our clients utilize more than one line of business so we got a lot of runway with the remaining 80 but specifically we got to relentlessly focus on five areas one the centerpiece has to be the approach to client development and it starts with our marquee accounts those companies where we have a strong opportunity for impact today those clients represent about 20 of the company the growth rate for those marquee accounts have been twice the rate of the remaining portfolio and as part of our one kf strategy that we announced last summer we are now in the process of expanding this account program to another 200 regional accounts which is approximately about another 200 million of revenue we re going to continue to develop and add account leaders to ensure that we bring the full weight of the firm to these clients and gain more wallet share secondly we ve guided take those single the smaller clients so we got to make them doubles and triples we re doing that practically right now through solution training and again as part of the one kf initiative last month we kicked off a firm wide program to educate every single colleague in the company at every level about all of our solutions we have over 100 trainers with about 330 sessions already scheduled across the globe today the third piece of the growth strategy is the product business when you look at advisory that 820 million 840 million business today on a run rate basis two thirds of it is consulting and one third of it is product so it s about a 250 million product business today those products are much less cyclical they are substantially profitable and we ve got the opportunity to scale that fourth as you know m a has been a pretty consistent pillar we re continuing to explore opportunities at the intersection of talent in strategy and then the final piece is about our own people i spent a full two days with colleague advisory council almost 50 people from around the world at all levels and we have to have a commitment to developing our own talent and providing growth opportunities for everybody and at the same time we have to continue to bring in world class consultants and then finally in addition to the m a we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital year to date we ve allocated about 18 million to dividends and 37 million to share repurchases representing a payout of about 25 of ebitda our return on invested capital has continued to improve it s up about 200 basis points from the end of fiscal 2018 and as i ll let bob get into this but the board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program that would take us up to 250 million so with that i m going to turn it over i m joined here by gregg kvochak and bob rozek and so bob i ll turn it over to you robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer great thanks gary and good afternoon everyone as gary said we re pleased with what we delivered this quarter and as usual i must start with a couple of highlights so demand for our industry leading solution remained solid in the third quarter and what is our seasonally slowest quarter we ended calendar year 2018 with new business growth in both november and december and transitioned into the beginning of 2019 within the acceleration in new business activity for january giving us a great start toward achieving what should be record revenue in our fourth quarter in the third quarter our global fee revenue reached 475 million which was up 10 year over year at constant currency this marks the sixth consecutive quarter in which we achieved double digit revenue growth measured at constant currency growth continued to be broad based with each of our operating segments benefiting from synergies realized by tying our solutions together in constant currency rpo and professional search grew 19 executive search grew 10 and revenue growth for advisory was 6 more importantly our results in the third quarter continue to demonstrate the earnings power of our business with adjusted ebitda growing at a pace faster than revenue and adjusted ebitda margin reaching a record high of 16 4 adjusted ebitda in the third quarter is approximately 78 million which is an improvement of 6 3 million or 9 measured year over year and finally consistent with our policy to maintain balanced approach to capital allocation in the third quarter we repurchased approximately 353 000 shares of our stock spending about 14 6 million and our board approved a declaration of a quarterly dividend of 0 10 per share in addition as gary mentioned our board of directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program bringing the amount available to repurchase under the program up to approximately 250 million now turning to new business trends globally in the third quarter executive search new business totaled approximately 191 million that s up 6 year over year driven by strength in north america and emea for advisory global new business in the third quarter was 221 million and that s up 5 year over year and we saw growth in north america europe and asia pacific and finally in the third quarter rpo and professional search secured 104 million of total new business that s the best quarter of new business so far in fiscal 2019 total new business consists of 78 million of long term rpo awards and 26 million of professional search the 78 million of rpo awards consist of approximately 59 million of contract expansions and renewals with existing clients and approximately 19 million of new client contracts at the end of the third quarter total cash and marketable securities were 623 million that s up approximately 94 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 18 excluding amounts reserved for deferred comp and for accrued bonuses our investable cash balance at the end of the third quarter was approximately 296 million that s up approximately 54 million year over year and 52 million quarter sequential the firm had outstanding debt at the end of the third quarter of approximately 223 million last adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the third quarter were 0 81 that s up 0 11 or 16 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 18 on a gaap basis which includes the final month of the amortization of retention bonuses related to our acquisition of hay group our fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were 0 80 i m going to turn it over to greg now to review the operating segments in more detail gregg kvochak investor relations thanks bob despite calendar year and holiday seasonality fee revenue for executive search continue to grow in the third quarter improving to over 193 million globally compared year over year and measure at actual exchange rates global executive search fee revenue grew 13 million or 7 2 in third quarter and 10 measured at constant currency growth for our executive search segment remained broad based at constant currency north america was up 12 europe was up 3 asia pacific was up 10 and latin america was up 34 by specialty market growth was mixed in the third quarter compared to the third quarter a year ago at actual exchange rates our financial services and technology practices were each up 25 our industrial practice was up 7 while our life sciences and healthcare and consumer goods practices were down 13 and 3 respectively the total number of dedicated executive search consultants worldwide at the end of the third quarter was 552 up 16 year over year annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the third quarter improved year over year to 1 4 million and the number of new assignments opened worldwide in the third quarter was 1 608 which was up approximately 3 year over year ebitda for the executive search in the third quarter was 48 2 million which was up 10 9 million or 29 year over year the consolidated ebitda margin for executive search in the third quarter of fiscal 19 was 24 9 compared to 20 7 in the third quarter of fiscal 18 now turning to advisory in the third quarter global fee revenue for advisory reached 201 5 million which was up 6 year over year measured at constant currency by geographic region growth in the third quarter was strongest in both the europe and asia pacific regions similar to executive search the advisory segment was impacted by year end holiday seasonality were fewer working days resulted in fewer billable hours with clients as previously mentioned to start calendar year 2019 global new business awards accelerated for advisory january new business was up nearly 11 year over year providing a solid backlog to begin the fourth quarter advisory earnings and profitability trends also remained strong in the third quarter adjusted ebitda for advisory was 38 2 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 18 9 finally turning to rpo and professional search we re in the third quarter growth continued at double digit pace the rpo and professional search segment generated 79 6 million of fee revenue in the third quarter which was up 19 4 year over year at constant currency all geographic regions continued to grow double digits in the third quarter led by north america and asia pacific which were up 23 and 20 respectively at constant currency as previously mentioned in the third quarter the rpo and professional search segment secured a total of 104 million of new business consisting of 78 million of larger long term rpo assignments and 26 million of smaller shorter term professional search assignments earnings also improved sharply in the third quarter for the rpo and professional search segment ebitda in the third quarter was 13 1 million with an ebitda margin of 16 4 which were both up sharply year over year now i ll turn the call back over to bob to discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter fiscal 19 robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer great thanks greg following the seasonally slower month of december new business activity to begin calendar year 2019 has ramp back up january and february new business across all our operating segments has been strong providing us with a solid backlog to start the fourth quarter which in a typically year is our seasonally strongest quarter for executive search global new business awards in the month of january and february combined were up 6 year over year with growth in every region if monthly new business patterns are consistent with prior years we expect march to be one of the best months for new business this fiscal year and that we will finish the year with a solid april for advisory the fiscal fourth quarter is also typically a seasonally stronger quarter where both backlog and new business awards combined with more hours with clients to execute assignments drives a quarter of strong revenue to start the fourth quarter advisory global new business awards for the month of january february combined were up 6 year over year with regards to rpo and professional search a number of large rpo contracts early the backlog are ramping up in the fourth quarter and the pipeline of potential new business opportunities remained strong we expect both of those facts to combine on a combined basis will drive a stronger quarter of revenue growth considering these factors and assuming worldwide economic conditions financial markets foreign exchange rates remained steady and assuming a 25 26 effective tax rate for the quarter we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 to range from 485 million to 505 million and we expect our consolidated diluted earnings per share to range from 0 85 to 0 93 when comparing to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year it should be noted that our fourth quarter revenue guidance reflects a significantly stronger us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound and the euro finally the amortization of retention bonuses associated with a hay group acquisition over three years ago ended in december of 2018 therefore in the fourth quarter there will no longer be adjustments to earnings per share presented under us gaap for this item that concludes our prepared remarks and we re glad to take any questions that you may have questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from tobey sommer with suntrust please go ahead joseph charles suntrust analyst hi this is joseph charles ph on for tobey sommer this evening i have one quick question about consultant productivity last quarter i think you referenced that consultant productivity is lot higher in the us than it is in a lot of the other countries in which you operate are there any particular regions or industries that you d like to highlight that you think you still have runway for growth thank you gary burnison chief executive officer well i think first overall when you say consultant productivity i don t know if you re talking about our consulting business joseph charles suntrust analyst executive search consultants gary burnison chief executive officer the executive search consultants today it s about the overall global average is about 1 4 million or so average fee per assignments 125 000 obviously we have a much a far reaching footprint probably more level than any other search firm so when you look at regions around the world you re going to find a great disparity in the level of executive pay so our fee and our productivity is going to vary substantially from mexico to china to ecuador to belgium to the united states and i would just say that when you look at it the overall average of 1 4 million there is clearly room for productivity now whether that is 15 whether that s 20 i m not going to put an exact number but clearly there s still headroom there joseph charles suntrust analyst got it and do you see that headroom more so in the developing markets you re in or the developed markets you re in thank you gary burnison chief executive officer sorry no it s look it s in both i mean just look at when i started at this place the i think the average search fee was like i don t know 55 000 or 60 000 today we re at 125 000 a part of that has been wage growth part of it has been our strategy but if you just look at the underlying dynamics what are you seeing well you re seeing career nomads so new people coming out of college are going to work for 30 different employers so there is going to be more and more churn so i think that both bodes very well for this company over the long term in the united states there is 7 million unfilled jobs i mean there is a ton of jobs out there high skilled good paying jobs we re seeing that in our rpo and professional search business where the demand for talent is robust and people are finding they are having to pay much more for talented people than what they thought joseph charles suntrust analyst got you operator our next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse please go ahead kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst great thanks hi gary or bob kind of heading into the last kind of inflection point in the cycle you folks did a real nice job of kind of acquiring assets that really prove to really differentiate the firm through this up cycle any thoughts on that just within the context of boosting the buyback because it seems like a pretty sizable step up in the buyback just any thoughts on that relative to the acquisition strategy is that just a function of you got the footprint you need just any thoughts on that would be super helpful gary burnison chief executive officer we re going to continue to we ve followed a pretty consistent playbook we ve made 10 acquisitions over a 10 year period of time and we are continuing to follow that playbook and so we have to have a balanced approach to capital we have to think of stakeholders we have to think of our clients we have to think of our colleagues and we have to think of our shareholders and we ve got to make sure we ve got the right balance so we did think that the buyback we only had about 50 million left and so we thought it prudent to raise that so i think you re going to see us have a very balanced approach to capital deployment but now we very much have an appetite to make investments that would increase our breadth and depth robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer and kevin this is bob kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst hi bob robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer just put a little bit more hi how are you doing a little more color on it when we first put the buyback authorization in place back in 2014 it was roughly somewhere between 10 12 of our market cap and so the number that we re at today is roughly the same obviously we re a bigger company today and hence you get the larger authorization amount kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst and then maybe bob just any thoughts on within the context of the q4 guidance what gets you to the upper end of the range versus the low end and conversely on the eps just any kind of factors that would kind of swing it toward the upper end or the lower end robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer yeah i think the as we sit here today what s going to push us toward the upper end of the range is our ability to convert our advisory backlog into revenue is one factor they ve had strong new business in q2 strong new business in this past quarter q3 and what we re seeing is as they sell larger engagements the conversion to revenue takes a little bit longer we ve also seen a bit of a change in mix in that business where the leadership development is a higher proportion of the mix and that takes a little bit longer so our ability to actively manage proactively manage that and convert it to revenue is one area and i think the other area that s going to get us to the higher end of the range is in the rpo business they ve sold a number of large engagements that were standing up now so our ability to execute against those successfully will help us get there as well kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst got it and then any sense of any color on kind of upticks across any segments or any thoughts around that gary burnison chief executive officer yeah we haven t seen much change in executive search in upticks it s been pretty consistent i mean over the past couple of years they ve drifted up but not remarkably we re seeing a little bit more uptick activity on the positive side is in the professional search area again that it s not remarkably different but we re starting to see a little bit of upward advancement in professional search kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst you bet thank you operator our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs please go ahead george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good afternoon you indicated that your marquee accounts are growing at twice the rate of the overall business and that you re expanding the program to another 200 regional accounts which would yield another 200 million in revenues can you elaborate on the rollout of this expanded program and the timing of when this 200 million in incremental revenues will be achieved gary burnison chief executive officer well the 200 million in revenue is from those existing it s the run rate so it s from the existing portfolio of regional accounts today so today we ve got 100 marquee accounts and that represents about 20 of the company s overall footings we re now expanding that to include another couple hundred accounts where we would have dedicated account leaders people that we are either recruiting from outside the firm that have account management responsibility experience or promoting from within and so today the run rate on those 200 accounts without real dedicated account ownership would be 200 million so you could look at the whole piece of the dedicated account program and say today ok that s something like 600 million or 30 of the overall company so you would think about the growth from that kind of starting point and definitely the marquee accounts the performance of those accounts the growth of those accounts has outperformed the rest of the portfolio george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful in the advisory business the growth there decelerated from 11 8 constant currency in fiscal 2q to 6 this quarter can you help unpack the quarter specifically if there were certain onetime items that weighed on growth and if not what strategies you have to accelerate the growth robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer yeah i think george this is bob how you are doing i think the if you go back to how we responded to kevin s question the conversion of backlog into revenue as we move our solutions to larger scalable solutions does take a bit longer so that had some impact and as the change in mix of leadership development again takes a bit longer to convert so that had some impact and then the only other piece is if you look at the number of days in way that the holidays fell this year we had one less business day so they had obviously if you re not working you can t judge your time and generate revenue george tong goldman sachs analyst got it any other active strategies you have to improve the growth performance there because it sounds like the exit rate for january february sounds relatively comparable at 6 in terms of new business trends gary burnison chief executive officer yeah no it s i would say it s ok i mean am i satisfied with the growth no but when you look at it today you ve got an 820 million advisory business that 10 years ago was a 10th of the size but i think when you look at it at a moment in time and you say ok well what do you have to believe how did you get there well you look at the components we ve got an organizational strategy component that s 10 of the company that has to be a much bigger percentage being able to link business strategy with organizational strategy so that has absolute runway the assessment and succession is about 12 we ve got a lot of different instruments and we ve assessed 50 million people we can do anything from simulations to onsite i mean we ve got it we ve got great ip there if we were to pick something up that s fine but we re not out purposefully looking for that the leadership development area if you look at the market opportunity that s the biggest area i mean when you look at hr services that is a substantial market and so for us today that s call it a couple hundred million dollar business i mean that s got a lot of headroom then the other piece is rewards which again is about 10 and so when you look at the business one of the things that we have to solve for is to moving to bigger more impactful engagements and so today you ll find a lot of the volume is actually sub six digit engagements and a lot of that comes from the heritage of assessments and so we re doing thousands of assessments and so you have to believe that you can move that portfolio toward bigger more impactful assignments and so when you look this last quarter at the dollar volume 50 of the new business was for engagements that were over 500 000 so that s something you have to believe the whole reason for the account strategy i mean is for this very reason is we have incredible relationships we re dealing with 10 000 clients a year but the reality is only 18 of those are using us for one thing so you ve got to have a purposeful strategy with dedicated leaders that are working those clients all the time that are walking the halls that has to be something that you really have to believe in and you ve got to execute and then finally when i come to the north american market we ve got fabulous people we don t have enough people i mean just plain and simple so the market opportunity is absolutely there and we ve demonstrated that we can cross introduce people from different parts of the organization the solution training that we re doing is the whole reason for that solution training is to get at the very question that you ask george tong goldman sachs analyst very helpful thank you operator our next question is from tim mchugh from william blair please go ahead trevor romeo william blair analyst hi thanks it s actually trevor romeo in for tim thanks for taking the question so first just wanted to clarify are those new business growth rates you provided for january and february in constant currency or is that reported growth and how much of an impact are you expecting from currency in the fourth quarter gary burnison chief executive officer yeah so the first question it is an actual dollars the rates that we quoted if you go back and you look at sort of q4 of last year the rates that were in place at that point in time and you kind of compare that to what we did for january we did it for february rate and it s about a 4 percentage point impact trevor romeo william blair analyst okay got it thank you and then it seems like your revenue in europe has held up fairly well despite kind of some of the softer economic data lately so what is your assessment of the demand environment there given some of that recent economic weakness gary burnison chief executive officer i think that s one of the strengths of the company today is that when people say the brand korn ferry you kind of think of one thing but the reality is the portfolio is way more balanced today than it was say a decade ago so you ve got a products business that is definitely going to be less cyclical for sure so you ve got a different profile and even when you look at it you know you look at it on a regional basis you would draw that same conclusion and so even like look at new business in china in february yes search was down a little bit but guess what we were up overall because we had a couple other parts of the business that made up for it the european business i think is probably what i m most proud of it s an incredible business and the uk believe it or not i mean the uk in the quarter grew this is again constant currency but i think it s the most comparable way to do it it was up 14 in the quarter so which you would find very very hard to believe so i think it s the balanced nature of the portfolio between the consulting business the products business the rpo and the search business in europe there was weakness in france that you would probably guess even on a total portfolio basis but the uk has held up better than you would have thought trevor romeo william blair analyst okay great thanks and then maybe if i could just sneak in one more have you seen any meaningful change in turnover in the advisory segment since the hay group retention program ended gary burnison chief executive officer no that the business there is going to looks like the firm does today it s completely different so you ve got an employee base that today is now 53 millennial and so for the company overall that s why we re on college campuses now recruiting them and then we just had our winter start class we put them through eight weeks of training consistent training around the entire solution footprint of the organization they just graduated a couple days ago that s why we re ramping that up in a very big way because i really think that for young people coming out of graduate or undergrad they re going to be career nomads and the challenge for any company is to identify the high potentials to develop them and that s a business opportunity actually for us trevor romeo william blair analyst okay thank you that s all very helpful operator our next question comes from greg mendez with baird please go ahead gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst hi thanks this is a greg on for mark marcon thanks for taking the question i guess first just going back to the talent piece that you ve been discussing gary with what you guys are accomplishing and building how are you thinking about just the mix of the talent that you need to add you mentioned folks coming from college but the balance between experienced versus new new and then given the labor environment how tough is it to find right now you know those experienced folks gary burnison chief executive officer yeah it s definitely look it s tough i mean there s no doubt about that i think that the one of the things that we re very very focused on is bringing people that have account management experience so that has we ve got a big focus on that today and that s something we re going have to do i think secondly we have an eye on consulting talent that can sell and deliver bigger more impactful engagements in other words they can sell the integrated solution so that the crossover between org strategy assessment succession leadership development and more integrative business outcome solutions then the final piece that we have to get right is promoting from within because this does need to look like a professional services firm where where you do hire lots of people off graduate or undergraduate campuses and give them the right kind of development and the right kind of opportunity to grow and so that s not only for the consultants it s for the entire organization but we have to have a real orientation on that that s why we ve got all these solution training sessions scheduled to this day we ve got 330 of them scheduled it s to give everybody to try to give everybody a lens into pivot points around clients how to broaden the conversation and all that gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst that s great and on the profitability side you ve done a really good job of continuing to expand the margins with a focus on marquee with the focus on product as we see that subscription model build over the coming quarters i mean how assuming the economy stays where it s at how do you think about profitability then over the next two three years or maybe just the aspiration if we can guess product goes to 40 or 50 of advisory for example and we see the continued strength in the from marquee accounts gary burnison chief executive officer yeah the way that we it is about the way we kind of manage our activities is we have this concept we call flow through and we look at things on an incremental basis and so as an overall company if our margins in this quarter were 16 4 so on the incremental revenues that we generate if we re not driving margins on those dollars at the 20 25 then we re not growing our profitability so we set targets for the whole company as well as for each individual line of business because they re all they have different profit profiles but we manage to the flow through and generally rule of thumb i would set it somewhere between 20 and 25 overall for the company gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst okay great and then just my last question i know you did the rebranding in a few other countries in january that continues to go on just any update there on that initiative gary burnison chief executive officer now listen i think it continues to and we ve got a playbook that it s like when we did the hay acquisition put a playbook in place in the integration i mean it was a lot of hard work but it went without a hitch and that s what we re seeing on the one korn ferry initiatives that we ve got under way i mean the legal entity rationalization which is what you just referred to we did six countries we re in the process of doing another seven or eight countries now and we ve got it down to a science and so there s no i ll say just continuing and again a lot of hard work but we re not encountering any real issues that are sticking points gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst great thanks a lot operator and our next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti please go ahead marc riddick sidoti analyst hi good afternoon gary burnison chief executive officer hi marc marc riddick sidoti analyst quick question i guess maybe a pivot toward some of the things that we saw with financial services i was wondering if you could share some thoughts there because it certainly seemed as though at least from year over year perspective that those were very strong words there and then maybe if you could sort of touch a little bit on what that the that sort of continued as far as i mean growth that outpaced the rest of the company and then i had a couple of follow ups there gary burnison chief executive officer well when you look at the quarter i mean clearly that too from an industry perspective year over year you would look to financial services and technology and both of those were actually they were good and the advisory the financial service was pretty good then the advisory but actually both of them were driven in north america and were driven by search so in particular financial services we ve got an incredible commercial banking business investment banking business asset management and so there s not any single large engagement so i wouldn t point anything that was wow this is kind of one off or anything but it was good growth in north american search marc riddick sidoti analyst is it fair to think about the pace of part of the business being as strong as it is to think that back of continued into the beginning of this quarter gary burnison chief executive officer i don t have the confirms broken down by february i ll tell you overall for the search business it was kind of up 10 i want to say right in february it is right so we don t i don t have it broken down by industry again i think it s kind of the and hopefully we re building a company that is not binge or bust and that one part can kind of compensate for another that kind of growth i would not at all quarter on quarter i wouldn t kind of factor that in by any means marc riddick sidoti analyst okay that s fair and then i was wondering if you could touch a little bit going back to the ambition of expanding to another 200 accounts under another marquee program i was wondering if there s sort of a similarity or differences that you would call out as to the mix of that customers and maybe what it might look like whether it s be it industry vertical or geographic or is there any type of mix differential for that next 200 accounts that we should be thinking about gary burnison chief executive officer well there is definitely a series of screens that were run against the 10 000 clients that we have and so there was a very systematic process and so out of the 10 000 we picked another couple hundred more where we really believe we have the opportunity for impact there wasn t any and it would follow a pretty much follow the geographic distribution of the company there wasn t any there wasn t something that was over weighted in terms of geography we hope to see more out of asia so i would i have a personal bias there but i wouldn t say there was anything over weighted from an industry perspective no i mean there are some practicalities i mean our life sciences business is unbelievable i mean we re it s almost 17 18 of the company something like that it s got incredible penetration i mean we have to be mindful just how far that can go so maybe there was going to be a little bit less in life science but that would really be about it at a very very high level marc riddick sidoti analyst okay great and then last one from me i was wondering if you could just sort of give us a bit of an update on capex year to date and what you might be looking at for full year thanks robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer marc it s bob our capex year to date and that includes stuff we re doing on the it platform what we re doing lease holds as well as some of the investors who make it into the products area to date it s somewhere around 35 million that i would expect on a run rate basis to continue through the course of the rest of this year we re just kicking off our annual operating plan process for fiscal 20 right now and so we ll set our thinking around capital for next year as we go through that process but i wouldn t expect there to be a dramatic change up or down at this point in time assuming the economy everything holds as we see it today marc riddick sidoti analyst okay great i appreciate thank you very much robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer yeah operator that appears there are no further questions mr burnison please go ahead for any closing comments gary burnison chief executive officer okay thank you anna for moderating this and for everybody on the line look we re redefining

first down week since january for s p 500 as unease spreads another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last nine days the sell off which lost some strength toward the end of the day followed a surprisingly weak jobs report and more signs that the global economy is hitting the brakes on friday a report showed chinese exports plunged 20 percent last month far more than economists expected on thursday europe s central bank said it was doing a policy reversal and restoring measures to shore up that region s economy energy stocks led the market s slide as crude oil prices declined health care companies and retailers also pulled the market lower most homebuilders rose following a big jump in january housing starts the u s jobs report is the latest batch of discouraging economic news to give investors a reason to sell and pocket some of their recent gains as they wait for the next positive headline or economic data to pave the way for stocks to move higher again said mark watkins regional investment strategist at u s bank wealth management we ve had a very solid run and there are investors who are going to be taking a little bit of money off the table watkins said the s p 500 dropped 5 86 points or 0 2 percent to 2 743 07 the benchmark index has fallen five days in a row its longest losing streak in nearly four months the dow jones industrial average lost 22 99 points or 0 1 percent to 25 450 24 the average briefly fell more than 220 points the nasdaq composite declined 13 32 points or 0 2 percent to 7 408 14 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 1 74 points or 0 1 percent to 1 521 88 major european indexes closed lower the market s momentum has stalled this week after enjoying a sharp bounce back at the start of this year this week s losses for the s p 500 are the worst since december but not as severe as they were then when worries were peaking about a slowing global economy and that interest rates may rise too quickly since then the federal reserve helped calm some of the worries by pledging to be patient in raising rates still investors are feeling increasingly uneasy about the global economy the organisation for economic co operation and development said this week that it expects global growth to be 3 3 percent this year down from the 3 5 percent that it had forecast just four months ago the oecd said economic prospects are weaker in nearly all the countries that make up the g20 than previously expected and it cited a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing among other reasons the united states and china have been locked in a particularly tense trade dispute though the countries say they re making progress in negotiations analysts are debating whether the u s stock market s latest moves are the last gasps for the longest bull market on record for u s stocks which began 10 years ago this weekend or just the latest challenge for it muddle through right now the u s economy is gradually slowing and earnings are trending a little bit lower watkins said any news that has been coming out that hasn t been that strong has been a little bit of a negative catalyst for the market to have a reason to move back just a little bit the strong u s labor market has been a major pillar of support for the stock market s run in recent years but friday s jobs report was surprisingly bad employers added just 20 000 jobs last month when economists were expecting something closer to 180 000 last month s job growth was also a sharp slowdown from january s 311 000 a number that the government revised higher on friday a slower global economy wouldn t need as much oil and the price of crude sank friday along with expectations for demand benchmark u s crude fell 1 percent to settle at 56 07 per barrel brent crude the international standard lost 0 8 percent to close at 65 74 per barrel the sharp decline sent energy companies to double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the s p 500 they ended 2 percent lower also hurting the sector was a decision by norway s 1 trillion wealth fund to dump shares in some oil and gas companies the move would exclude companies that operate solely in exploration or production but it will continue to own the biggest companies in the energy industry noble energy and eog resources tumbled 5 4 percent new u s residential construction data gave traders reason to be more optimistic about homebuilder stocks the commerce department said housing starts jumped

trade deficit hits record levels despite trump s tariffs notwithstanding president trump s tariffs america s trade deficit hit a record level last year doug mataconis 18 comments despite the president s trade war and his promise that increased tariffs would benefit american manufacturing the latest statistics make clear that the u s trade deficit actually increased to record levels in 2018 washington the united states imported more goods than ever last year including a record amount from china ballooning america s trade deficit with the rest of the world to 891 3 billion and delivering a setback to president trump s goal of narrowing that gap the increase was driven by some factors outside mr trump s control like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the united states dollar both of which weakened overseas demand for american goods but the widening gap was also exacerbated by mr trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut which has been largely financed by government borrowing and the trade war he escalated last year the trade deficit is the difference between how much a country sells to its trading partners and how much it buys mr trump has long boasted that his trade policies would reduce that gap which he views as a measure of whether partners like china and the european union are taking advantage of the united states a diagnosis that few economists share instead in a year when mr trump imposed tariffs on steel aluminum washing machines solar panels and a variety of chinese goods the trade deficit grew by 12 5 percent from 2017 or nearly 70 billion dollars the commerce department said wednesday the deficit in goods which mr trump particularly targets grew to 891 2 billion for the year its highest level in history in december the overall goods and services deficit rose to 59 8 billion up 19 percent from the previous month it was the highest monthly trade deficit in a decade the united states also imported a record amount of goods from china last year despite mr trump s trade war with china and the imposition of tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods the trade gap in goods between the united states and china hit 419 billion in 2018 deepening a bilateral deficit that has been a particular source of anger for mr trump the widening gap appears to reflect uneven results from the administration s trade war with beijing american exports to china declined falling by nearly 50 percent in december compared to the same month a year before american companies that sell products in china were hurt by a slowdown in the chinese economy and retaliatory measures that beijing has leveled on american goods to counter mr trump s tariffs a stronger american dollar and a weaker chinese yuan also offset some of the impact of mr trump s tariffs mr trump views the trade deficit with china as a sort of economic scorecard for which country is on top most economists disagree with this perspective viewing trade deficits as neither a sign of economic strength nor weakness but a function of macroeconomic factors like investment flows fluctuations in the value of currency and relative growth rates as the trade deficit widens mr trump s focus on it has resulted in a particular irony by his own metric the president is failing to right america s global trading relationships yet many of the president s critics don t blame him for this saying some fluctuations in the trade deficit are largely beyond his control jennifer rubin comments president trump doesn t understand that the trade deficit is not an accounts payable that the united states must settle by writing a big check he insists money is being taken out of the united states that s just wrong it s also wrong to assert that a big trade deficit means high unemployment or a rotten economy in fact trump has proved as much maybe trump will go back to german chancellor angela merkel for one more tutoring session on trade when we purchase more german or chinese or whoever s goods than they purchase of ours they have a whole lot of u s dollars which they use to invest in our economy create jobs and generate more wealth no matter how many times merkel points to german plants in the u s producing cars and employing americans trump doesn t get it for all of the tariff wars and fights with allies trump didn t even accomplish his goal but he did inflict pain on farmers who now require billions in taxpayer subsidies and increase costs for american consumers including u s based businesses that rely on foreign suppliers in sum his entire trade policy has failed and has in fact been counterproductive he set out to fix a non problem a trade deficit and created real ones including international conflict higher consumer prices and gross inefficiency in our economy when certain businesses have lobbying clout to get tariff exemptions and others do not republicans in congress have been too timorous to claw back tariff power to stop this economic idiocy and too many democrats have been on the protectionist bandwagon to credibly criticize trump here s an idea republican presidential primary challengers and democratic contenders should go after trump for hurting americans what s he got against hard working farmers middle class consumers struggling to buy a washer and dryer and american car companies who have to pay extra for steel and aluminum which in turn gets passed on to consumers trump may think he s winning but he s apparently too dim to realize americans are losing as nearly any economist on either side of the political aisle will tell you the trade deficit is in and of itself a meaningless number while trump and other trade protectionists claim that a trade deficit is an indication that money is being taken out of the u s economy the truth is that it isn t nearly as important as the protectionists would have you believe in the end the trade deficit is the gap between how much the united states imports in good and services and how much it exports however the fact that we have a deficit with the world as a whole or with a specific country such as mexico or china does not mean that we lost money to those nations as president trump and his protectionist supporters would have you believe the primary reason for this is that the same international trade that results in a trade imbalance also brings things of value to the importing nation that presumably consumers and businesses value more than the cash that was sent overseas or across the border in the case of china and many other nations for example we get less expensive consumer goods and other items saying that we have a trade deficit with china because we give them money and they send us consumer goods like iphones and other things makes no more sense than saying i have a trade deficit with my local grocery store because they give me food i want in exchange for pieces of paper with pictures of presidents on them additionally trade deficits are influenced by a number of factors that have nothing to do with international trade itself such as the rates of economic growth in the two countries currency valuation and the rates of saving and investment finally a reduction in a trade deficit isn t necessarily a good thing for example our trade deficit shrunk significantly during the great recession due to the fact that consumer demand and spending were both negatively affected but nobody seriously suggests that we should throw the economy into a recession so we could have a lower trade deficit despite all of this president trump has focused repeatedly on the trade deficit as a measure of the success of his trade policies and has insisted that his higher tariffs would bring about lower trade deficits and economic growth in some sense though these two goals are arguably contradictory since higher economic growth is likely going to lead to increases in consumer and business spending including increases in spending on items that originate overseas and thus lead to increases in the trade deficit in any case while trump has claimed in recent speeches that the trade deficit was increasing these numbers tell us the exact opposite therefore the only conclusion we can reach is that trump s trade policies have been a failure all of this began of course just over a year ago when the trump administration announced aluminum and steel tariffs that at the time were primarily aimed at china and a handful of other nations while exempting for the time being allies in europe as well as canada and mexico not surprisingly that announcement was received negatively on wall street which until then had been largely headed upward on fears that we were witnessing the beginning of a trade war that threatened to undo much of the progress that had been made on international trade since the end of world war two several weeks later the president announced a series of new tariffs on china which quickly led china to announce retaliatory tariffs of its own many of them aimed at industries such as agriculture that had been heavily pro trump in the 2016 election several days after this announcement trump said that the united states was considering additional tariffs against the chinese amounting to as much as 100 billion dollars the chinese trade ministry quickly responded to these statements from the president saying that we do not want to fight but we are not afraid to fight a trade war indeed as steven lee myers noted when these statements were made the chinese are confident that they could win a trade war for example just two months after the steel and aluminum tariffs were announced the wall street journal reported that prices for both foreign and domestic steel and aluminum were increasing and this was having a negative impact on manufacturers that rely on these raw materials for their products other reports have indicated that american pork farmers were increasingly nervous about their overseas business with nations like china due to the fact that beijing was threatening to hit american agriculture with retaliatory tariffs in iowa it was reported that chinese retaliation for the tariffs could cost soybean farmers 624 million this year alone with the prospect of larger losses if the retaliation continues beyond this year this has led many leaders in iowa and elsewhere including senator chuck grassley to express concern about the impact of the trade war on republican fortunes in the fall this is especially true given the fact that the tariffs seem to be expressly targeted toward trump voters and middle class americans in the time since then we have also seen that the tariffs have had a negative impact on other american businesses and has even led an iconic american brand like harley davidson to announce that they are moving some production overseas in response to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the european union most recently last month trump announced a new round of tariffs on chinese goods and the chinese responded immediately with another round of retaliatory tariffs impossible to completely shield chinese companies and consumers from the full impact of a trade war most recently of course the president slapped another 200 billion in tariffs on chinese goods and the chinese responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own as if this wasn t bad enough the president saw fit to expand his trade war and this time he aimed his fire at the most illogical targets of all our closest allies and trading partners at the end of last may the president announced that he was revoking the exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs that had been announced back in march that applied to american allies in europe as well as canada and mexico seemingly bizarrely the president claimed that this was being done for national security reasons objectively speaking of course the idea that these allies are a national security threat to the united states or that we could not rely on them as a source for aluminum and steel in the event of a national emergency or military threat is absurd but because of the way american law and applicable trade treaties are worded national security is the only ground available to the president to impose tariffs without having to seek congressional authorization and without violating the applicable treaties needless to say this didn t go over very well with our allies in europe and elsewhere canada s foreign minister called the new tariffs absurd for example and european union officials announced retaliatory tariffs against american goods things got even more bizarre in this regard as trump exchanged harsh words with canadian prime minister justin trudeau prior to the g 7 summit once he was at the summit trump essentially did everything he could to alienate america s closest allies thereby seemingly achieving a goal that russia and before it the soviet union had only dreamed of driving a wedge between the united states and its allies after the singapore photo op summit trump continued his tirade against trudeau while polling revealed that canadian public opinion about the united states was suffering as a result of american actions and the president s rhetoric finally it was reported at the same time that the president was considering what would effectively be a ban on german built luxury automobiles while some of these tariffs have been removed since they were imposed the vast majority of them remain in place and as the times article linked above notes they are continuing to have a negative impact on the economy additionally the tariffs have had a negative impact on other american businesses and has even led an iconic american brand like harley davidson to announce that they are moving some production overseas in response to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the european union as i have noted before president trump once famously claimed that trade wars are good and easy to win and he apparently continues to believe this nonsense notwithstanding more than two centuries of economists dating back to adam smith and including economists today on both the left and the right who agree that the kind of protectionism this president is pursuing is ultimately self destructive now we re all beginning to pay the price for his ignorance

tax havens are locations around the world where wealthy individuals criminals and terrorists as well as governments and government agencies such as the cia banks corporations hedge funds international organizations such as the vatican and crime syndicates such as the mafia can stash their money so that they can avoid regulation and oversight and very often evade tax according to nicholas shaxson tax havens are now at the heart of the global economy which is why as he explains it the term tax haven is a bit of a misnomer because such places aren t just about tax what they sell is escape from the laws rules and taxes of jurisdictions elsewhere usually with secrecy as their prime offering see the tax haven in the heart of britain a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction then is a place that seeks to attract business by offering politically stable facilities to help people or entities get around the rules laws and regulations of jurisdictions elsewhere see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world tax havens are a vitally important part of the global infrastructure of corruption and criminality see giant leak of offshore financial records exposes global array of crime and corruption that enables privileged individuals and their organizations to legally and illegally steal money from the rest of us particularly those in developing countries and to have the services of a vast network of accountants bankers lawyers and politicians often from captured legislatures to help them do it and to ensure that they get away with it how many tax havens are there where are they how much money do they have who uses them why how do they work why does all this matter to us and what can we do about them tax havens how many and where are they in his book treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world author and financial journalist nicholas shaxson identified about sixty secrecy jurisdictions or offshore groups around the world which he divided into four categories as follows the most important category by far is those tax havens that form the spider s network of havens centred on the city of london it has three main layers there are two inner rings britain s crown dependencies of jersey guernsey which includes the sub havens of sark alderney and brecqhou and the isle of man and its overseas territories such as the cayman islands bermuda the british virgin islands and gibralter which are substantially controlled by britain the third layer is an outer ring with a more diverse array of havens like hong kong singapore the bahamas dubai and ireland which are outside britain s direct control but have strong historical and current links to that country and the city of london which i will discuss below this network controls almost one half of all international bank assets the second category of tax havens is those in europe notably including switzerland luxembourg see explore the documents luxembourg leaks database the netherlands belgium and austria as well as microstates such as liechtenstein and monaco while geneva bankers had sheltered the secret money of european elites since at least the eighteenth century the european havens got going during world war i as governments raised taxes sharply to pay for the war the third category of tax havens is that focused on the united states it has three tiers as well at the federal level the us government offers a range of tax exemptions secrecy provisions and laws designed to attract foreign money this means for example that us banks can legally accept proceeds from a range of crimes as long as the crimes are committed overseas the second tier involves individual us states such as florida where central south american elites do their banking and the countries adversely impacted are prevented by us secrecy provisions from accessing relevant data and where much mob and drugs money is hidden too delaware nevada and wyoming where even terrorist money is protected by secrecy provisions the third tier of the us network is the overseas satellites such as the american virgin islands the marshall islands liberia and panama with the latter according to jeffrey robinson being one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as shaxson notes offshore finance has quietly been at the heart of neoconservative schemes to project us power around the globe for years few people have noticed the fourth category of tax havens identified by shaxson includes those that do not fit in the categories above such as somalia and uganda the incomplete list of tax havens on the website tax havens of the world will give you some idea of where these secrecy jurisdictions are located but there are important omissions in this list notably including the city of london corporation for a brief look at 15 tax havens again notably excluding some of the most important and some of the corporations that use them see what are the world s best tax havens and for a highly instructive and utterly sobering video documentary on british tax havens see the spider s web britain s second empire this documentary will inform you among many more important things that the building housing her majesty s revenue and customs the uk tax office is owned by an offshore company in bermuda to summarize the central aspect of the development of tax havens following world war ii the british establishment an old boys network of privileged elites had carved out a lucrative vehicle for themselves in the offshore world after the demise of empire they transformed themselves from administrators of empire to financial handlers for the global elite and multinational corporations see the spider s web britain s second empire before concluding this section it is worth emphasizing that as shaxson explains it the offshore world is not a bunch of independent states exercising their sovereign rights to set their laws and tax systems as they see fit it is a set of networks of influence controlled by the world s major powers notably britain and the united states each network is deeply interconnected with the others he goes on the world s most important tax havens are not exotic palm fringed islands as many people suppose but some of the world s most powerful countries shaxson quotes marshall langer a prominent supporter of secrecy jurisdictions it does not surprise anyone when i tell them that the most important tax haven in the world is an island they are surprised however when i tell them that the island is manhattan moreover the second most important tax haven is located on an island it is called the city of london the city of london corporation what is the city of london corporation also known as the square mile it is a 1 22 square mile slab of prime central london real estate that stretches from the thames at victoria embankment clockwise up through fleet street the barbican centre then to liverpool street in the north east then back down to the thames just west of the tower of london see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world according to shaxson the city of london corporation the modern period of which dates from 1067 yes that is not a typing error is the local government authority for the 1 2 square mile slab of prime real estate in central london that is the city of london the corporation is an ancient semi alien entity lodged inside the british nation state a prehistoric monster which had mysteriously survived into the modern world as a 19th century would be city reformer put it importantly shaxson explains the role of the city of london corporation as a municipal authority is its least important attribute this is a hugely resourced international offshore lobbying group pushing for international financial deregulation tax cutting and tax havenry around the world moreover it is the hub of a global network of tax havens sucking up offshore trillions from around the world and sending it or the business of handling it to london notably so powerful is the city of london that no sovereign or government of britain in a thousand years has had the courage to seriously take it on and attempt to subject it to british government control see the tax haven in the heart of britain how much money is in tax havens so how much of the world s wealth is stashed in tax havens around the globe according to the tax justice network in its 2012 report written by james s henry the price of offshore revisited new estimates for missing global private wealth income inequality and lost taxes a significant fraction of global private financial wealth by our estimates at least 21 to 32 trillion as of 2010 has been invested virtually tax free through the world s still expanding black hole of more than 80 offshore secrecy jurisdictions we believe this range to be conservative he goes on to emphasize that this is just financial wealth a big share of the real estate yachts racehorses gold bricks and many other things that count as non financial wealth are also owned via offshore structures where it is impossible to identify the owners henry also notes that given that credit suisse estimated global wealth in 2011 at 231 trillion the amount of money in secrecy jurisdictions is conservatively estimated at 10 of global wealth but other figures do indeed suggest this estimate is low shaxson cites compelling evidence that more than half of world trade passes at least on paper through tax havens over half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore moreover as long ago as 2008 the us government accountability office reported that 83 of the 100 biggest corporations in the usa had subsidiaries in tax havens and the following year using a broader definition the tax justice network discovered that ninety nine of europe s hundred largest companies used offshore subsidiaries and in each country the largest user by far was a bank see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world in any case the most recent estimate by the tax justice network indicates tax losses to profit shifting by multinational companies a pplying a methodology developed by researchers at the international monetary fund to an improved dataset of around 500 billion a year see new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals to reiterate then on the understanding that these estimates are probably quite low by 2010 between us21 and us32 trillion had been taken out of circulation so that it was beyond the laws financial regulations and taxes that the rest of us cannot escape but that figure has been added to by half a trillion dollars each year since by moving more money into tax havens and don t forget this figure does not include non financial wealth how many gold bricks yachts artworks and racehorses do you own and have stashed away somewhere free of scrutiny who uses tax havens and why as i mentioned above tax havens are used by wealthy individuals including businesspeople sports and pop stars criminals and terrorists as well as governments and their agencies banks corporations such as amazon and google international organizations and crime syndicates such as the medellin cartel while motives vary in essence the lack of regulation and oversight as well as tax evasion are the reasons that individuals and organizations use them an individual might want to hide stolen wealth to evade tax or cheat a divorced spouse out of their share of the family fortune a bank corporation crime syndicate international or terrorist organization might want to evade scrutiny of the source of their money and or evade tax on windfall or even ongoing profits legal and or otherwise a government might want to hide the dirty money it uses to finance black ops that is illegal and secret military violence such as that carried out by the cia but there are myriad explanations in john christensen s analysis of over 100 offshore clients of accounting firm deloitte touche he studied in jersey he found that the clients were engaging in insider trading market rigging failure to disclose conflicts of interest weapons trading illicit political donations contract kickbacks bribery fraudulent invoicing trade mispricing and tax evasion see the spider s web britain s second empire most people have heard of the money stashed away by corrupt dictators like suharto in indonesia ferdinand marcos in the philippines and mobuto sese seko of zaire now democratic republic of the congo each of whom stole from the people of their country however they could only do this with the help of western enablers and ongoing elite resistance to developing country attempts to create a more transparent and fairer process for collecting tax on cross border financial flows as a result alex cobham of the tax justice network observes worldwide developing nations lose in excess of 1trillion per year in capital flight and tax evasion to wealthy countries see the spider s web britain s second empire but these more public examples while terrible tend to obscure two important facts the amount stolen from sub saharan africans for example between 1970 and 2008 was at least five times the total amount of their foreign debt during that period see the spider s web britain s second empire and by highlighting these examples attention is drawn away from even worse and ongoing examples of such criminality by those corrupt criminal individuals and organizations including banks accountancy and legal firms corporations international organizations crime syndicates and governments committed to using outright theft fraud money laundering and other devices to steal wealth from ordinary people all over the world so for example if one follows the money trails of various lucrative financial operations some technically legal but immoral and others simply illegal apart from the world s major corporations one quickly comes across the names of the major and well known banks and financial institutions such as the bank of england barclays goldman sachs jpmorgan chase the big four accountancy firms deloitte ernst young ey kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers and elite lawyers such as those in london s magic circle like clifford chance mourant du feu jeune and slaughter and may see for example treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals and looting with putin apparently like major corporations and crime syndicates few banks accountancy firms and lawyers have ethics policies that require them to follow the law and to exercise due diligence check out a client before signing a contract so that they can steer clear of handling illegal and immoral profits especially if they are monstrous in fact according to a us senate report virtually every major bank in the world especially the biggest in north america and europe holds accounts for offshore banks and or banks in suspect jurisdictions see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as eva joly mep vice chair of the panama papers committee of the european parliament succinctly puts it ordinary people are paying taxes rich people are not see the spider s web britain s second empire the vatican but perhaps the example which best illustrates the moral depravity of those who use tax havens is the vatican in his carefully researched book operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafiaauthor paul l williams recounts the efforts of the cia former nazis the sicilian american mafia the vatican and even freemasonry to resist an anticipated postwar invasion of western europe by those godless communists in the soviet union by establishing stay behind units clandestine military and paramilitary units throughout the countries of europe belgium denmark italy netherlands norway portugal led by former nazis and composed of die hard fascist fanatics this alliance to fight the cold war against the former soviet union and the rising tide of progressive governments in europe and the rest of the world particularly as the us war on vietnam gathered pace led as williams chillingly puts it to the toppling of governments wholesale slaughter and financial devastation around the world it was also of course the forerunner to its equivalent operation condor to resist and destroy if possible the spread of progressive movements ranging from communism to liberation theology throughout central south america while the vatican played a number of unsavory roles in this alliance including its facilitation of massive numbers of heroin addictions its use of counterfeit securities participation in false flag attacks that killed thousands and strings of gangland slayings support of military juntas that massacred tens of thousands and the purging of progressive priests including archbishop óscar romero of san salvador and two jesuit priests denounced by fr jorge mario bergoglio now pope francis in argentina see who is pope francis jorge mario bergoglio and argentina s dirty war and causing the financial destitution of thousands of families one of its key ongoing functions designed to maximize the vatican s power while highlighting its moral and spiritual bankruptcy was to act as god s banker for many of these operations see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia it did this for example by accepting mafia medellin cartel collected drugs money for a 15 20 cut into the vatican bank technically istituto per le opere di religione or institute for the works of religion and then laundering it through its shell companies such as cisalpine overseas bank astolfine sa united trading corporation erin sa bellatrix sa belrose sa starfield sa and nordeurop establishment in tax havens in the bahamas liechtenstein luxembourg panama and switzerland with the cia providing services such as the transport of mafia medellin cocaine to drug dealers in the us its share of the drug profits cycled through its own cia controlled banks including continental illinois castle bank trust and bank of credit and commerce international but eventually involving many of the most prestigious banks in the us as the money was passed to the vatican bank were used to finance key aspects of operations gladio and condor with weapons also supplied by the cia from nato arsenals but there was plenty of vatican money in these operations too as an aside so devastating was the fallout from the ongoing exposure of the many aspects of vatican corruption that by the beginning of the twenty first century roman catholic membership was falling by 400 000 per year in the usa alone but the trend was even stronger in europe with magnificent churches and cathedrals becoming museums visited solely by tourists parishes being boarded up seminaries and convents closed and parochial schools consolidated and this was before the plague of pedophilia had fully hit further decimating the church s tattered reputation to this day the vatican bank remains one of the world s leading laundries for dirty money see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia how do tax havens work each tax haven offers its own unique combination of services after all it is a tough market competing for the world s wealth and so each jurisdiction has developed its own set of services designed to maximize its attractiveness to potential clients in essence this means that there is some ongoing competition to reduce regulatory and oversight requirements so that each tax haven can attract clientele this has become so extreme that basic requirements of banking for those who do it legally such as proof of identity are not required in the offshore world in fact even your true name can be withheld if you wish it is easier to avoid any risk of embarrassment from exposure this way as a result virtually any jurisdiction will open an account or as many accounts as you want in whatever names you specify then usually employing a variety of devices ranging from secret bank accounts nominee directors usually locals who play no part in the organization bar give it their name and structures such as shell companies that exist on paper and perhaps a wall plaque somewhere but nothing else and trusts which unlike the legitimate version appear to separate responsibility and control from the benefits of ownership but actually do not to processes such as transfer pricing a technique by which companies shift paper profits into low tax countries and costs into high tax countries to minimize or eliminate tax payments and often employing a convoluted process that rapidly shifts monies through several jurisdictions so that it becomes untraceable because authorities must get permission to access each jurisdiction in turn in any effort to trace the money profits are effectively hidden and any accountability to authorities of any kind utterly eliminated see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world for one simple example of such a strategy employing a technique known as the double irish dutch sandwich which is legal see google shifted 23bn to tax haven bermuda in 2017 filing shows but you can read other examples here the tech giants will never pay their fair share of taxes unless we make them and 7 corporate giants accused of evading billions in taxes why does the existence of tax havens matter to us well the simple answer to this question is that just a fraction of the money hidden in tax havens would feed clothe house and provide clean water medical care and educational opportunities to everyone on earth it would eliminate the 100 000 deaths by starvation related diseases each day it would eliminate poverty and homelessness and as one byproduct of having these material needs met it would facilitate the emergence of an informed engaged and empowered human population to tackle the vast range of environmental climate and military threats that currently threaten biosphere collapse and imminent human extinction see human extinction by 2026 a last ditch strategy to fight for human survival as professor prem sikka puts it more simply because of the penetration by financial services executives of the british state including the treasury it deprives people of opportunities to have healthcare education security justice and ultimately a fulfilling life see the spider s web britain s second empire fundamentally then tax havens and their secrecy are at the heart of those elite institutions and processes that functionally undermine democracy and give extraordinary power to certain anonymous individuals and their entities without accountability see the spider s web britain s second empire of course the elites that control the tax haven networks are not about to let this change tax havens are simply too important as part of the global infrastructure for maintaining elite profit power and privilege and for resisting grassroots efforts to bring peace justice and ecological sanity to our world and that is why they are protected by government legislation and legal systems with an army of accountants auditors bankers businesspeople lawyers and politicians ensuring that they remain protected so don t forget laws are designed to control and punish you no matter how trivial your infringement a parking fine a littering offence a petty theft but if you have enough money the law simply does not exist and you can evade taxes legally and in the full knowledge that your vast profits even from immorally acquired wealth such as sex trafficking gun running endangered species trafficking conflict diamonds and drug trafficking are lawful and will escape regulation and oversight of any kind see the rule of law unjust and violent let me give a personal example i have been a war tax resister since 1983 i have a conscientious objection to paying taxes to the australian government to deploy military forces in other countries to kill people in my name so instead of paying taxes to kill for many years i donated the equivalent amount to organizations engaged in peace development environment and human rights work and to pay the rent for my use of indigenous land as some of many outcomes to this conscientious and highly public resistance garnering national media attention at times in 1991 i was bankrupted in 1992 i was convicted of contempt of court for my conscientious refusal to cooperate with the bankruptcy trustee and in 1993 my passport was seized in 1999 i was advised that i will be bankrupt forever because of my ongoing conscientious refusal to finance the killing in the same period since 1983 trillions and trillions of dollars of tax have been illegally and secretly evaded as wealthy individuals and corporations criminals and crime syndicates international organizations and governments channel their incomes and profits through tax havens laws and legal systems throughout the world make this possible and provided it is done correctly it is quite straightforward to avoid any penalties for secretly evading payment of taxes or hiding money acquired through criminal activity but the point as you can see is that tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations meant that many of these individuals and corporations didn t pay taxes to kill people either they just didn t pay taxes at all of course their motive was personal gain their way was legal they incurred no penalty and of course they didn t pay an equivalent amount to support peace and justice causes more fundamentally however the trillions of dollars they took from the global economy were made by killing and exploiting people and the planet in a significant variety of other ways ranging from sex trafficking gun running conflict diamonds and trafficking in drugs and endangered species to simply starving people to death at the rate of 100 000 people each day by managing the global economy using tax havens as a primary tool to extract maximum profit richard brooks documents how this legal exploitation occurs in another way in his book the great tax robbery how britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business the vast tax evasion by elites in britain including by diverting funds through tax havens attracts just five prosecutions each year per 1 billion of evasion of direct taxes in contrast benefits fraud by those on unemployment and disability pensions attract 9 000 prosecutions each year per 1 billion of fraud so theft by the poor warrants the full force of the law but not theft by elites who write the law and largely control the political and legal processes in relation to it hence under the guise of relationship taxing that is building a relationship between tax authorities and corporate executives and tailoring tax payments to corporate wishes to the extent the law allows corporations have long known that if you don t like the law we ll see what we can do as is obvious from this example attempts at government reform including to defeat tax havens in the direction of making elites financially and legally accountable both nationally and internationally for the responsibilities which the rest of us cannot escape are invariably for show and in any case achieve zero of substance for example the attempt to approve a blacklist of tax havens at the g20 gathering in 2009 was resisted by the chinese premier on behalf of chinese elites who like other national elites keen to have political control but judicial separation from their offshore centres opposed the listing of notorious havens hong kong and macau see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world the global elite is clearly in control with national governments and international organizations powerlessly doing as instructed so complete is this control in fact that brooks notes that in britain anti tax avoidance laws had to be relaxed to accommodate companies tax avoidance schemes brooks concludes that british taxation policy really had been so comprehensively captured by the world s biggest corporations that screw the poor policies could be written into the statute books at their whim without a pang of conscience being felt anywhere in whitehall clearly however his comment can be applied to virtually any government in the world so does it matter to you that these tax havens exist and do what they do what can be done about tax havens authors such as nicholas shaxson and richard brooks suggest a raft of measures to correct the large number of faults that facilitate the secrecy protection from regulation and tax evasion that individuals corporations organizations criminals and terrorists utilize in tax havens for shaxson these include financial reforms such as blacklisting of tax havens so that their rogue state status is public knowledge greater transparency for example through government sharing of information about the local income and assets of each other s citizens and by requiring multinational corporate activities in each country to be made visible rather than hidden behind international figures promoting the needs of developing countries which need their tax bases protected far more than they need aid or debt relief confronting the british spider s web of tax havens by abolishing the city of london corporation and submerging it into a unified and fully democratic london taxing an entire multinational group as a single unit and then allocating the appropriate amounts of its income out to the different jurisdictions in which it was earned and allow it to be taxed as each jurisdiction decides onshore tax reform such as a land value tax because land cannot be moved offshore and so tax on it must be paid locally and by a direct distribution of mineral wealth in any country to each of its inhabitants who can then be taxed tackling the enablers the accountants lawyers individual bankers businesspeople and not just the clients so that they go to jail rethinking the meaning of corporate responsibility because corporations are given a wealth of capital in public infrastructure an educated and healthy workforce with which to work so that corporations are transparent about their affairs and pay tax as part of their corporate responsibility re evaluating the meaning of corruption insiders abusing the common good in secrecy and getting away with it and so worsening inequality and entrenching vested interests and unaccountable power so that we see more clearly all of the actors and their activities and changing the culture that fawns over people who abuse the system for personal gain see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world and some progress appears to be occurring along lines he suggests for example a version of automatic information exchange aie by which governments make sure that essential information is made available to other jurisdictions as a matter of routine has been discussed by the oecd and while full of loopholes see loophole usa the vortex shaped hole in global financial transparency some commitments have been made for the list of commitments as at november 2018 see aeoi commitments however the usa has not made this commitment and while switzerland for example finds this objectionable see the u s hasn t signed the aeoi agreement reciprocity demanded the reality is that it makes little difference for example ico services which specializes in the formation of offshore companies and offshore banking will assist you to get around the aeoi requirement their website advertises that asset holders need to start looking for alternative jurisdictions for protecting their assets there are some reputable jurisdictions that are still outside the aeoi e g cyprus but u s states of delaware and some others shouldn t be dismissed but if you want a more established name to help you take advantage of a tax haven in the usa you really can t go past rothschild co so to check out what they are offering here is rothschild s primer how to launder money in u s real estate and avoid blacklists moreover the aeoi agreement outlaws bank secrecy but not trust secrecy which dates from the crusades on which the british model is based the trust lies at the core of the british secrecy model so it does not address the cornerstone of british tax haven secrecy and explains why the british were happy to see the cayman islands commit to the aeoi in short the british government would be happy to kill off bank secrecy so that they can capture a larger market share based on trust secrecy see the spider s web britain s second empire separately from this initiative in 2018 the uk parliament enacted a new law requiring its overseas territories including notorious tax havens like bermuda the cayman islands and the british virgin islands to start disclosing the owners of corporations they register by 2020 in theory this could shut down a huge amount of offshore tax evasion and other financial crimes because individuals from anywhere in the world including the united states have long been able to set up secret corporations in these tax havens to stash their money see new uk law may shut down the biggest tax havens aside from the u s however while the report pointed out that the new law obviously does not impact the usa or of course switzerland or and the easy rerouting options available if these havens are effectively or even actually shut down it failed to mention that this initiative does not in any way address the city of london corporation so the impact of this initiative must be very limited unless it is followed by some pretty drastic initiatives in westminster washington bern and elsewhere in summary while one cannot disagree with any of shaxson s fine suggestions or be displeased that public pressure has led to some effort being made by the oecd and the uk parliament to address elements of the tax haven scourge the reality is that the extent of the changes necessary are not going to happen without enormous grassroots pressure strategically applied and they are very unlikely to happen as reforms of the existing capitalist system this is simply because the global elite is solidly in control of the institutions and processes of global capitalism including its compliant governments and international organizations and will readily stymie any attempt at serious reform of tax havenry particularly given the number of major reforms needed and the number of nations in which these reforms must be enacted to state two obvious examples the city of london corporation has not existed for 1 000 years because it has no defense and the changes noted above have only made the us more attractive as a secrecy jurisdiction meanwhile with the aim of promoting financial innovation switzerland has recently made things easier for smaller financial technology companies thus making tax havenry more attractive to those who might not have otherwise considered it see swiss watchdog to propose looser anti money laundering rules for fintechs so given that most tax havens are protected by host government legislation and there is no international mechanism to control them the tax haven industry generally is not under threat of being held to account in any significant way and despite the more elaborate explanation offered above there is a simple reason for this unofficially of course illegal money laundered through tax havens has become an essential and sometimes stabilizing element of the global financial system see drug money saved banks in global crisis claims un advisor so what can we do that will make a difference given the deeply entrenched and long standing nature of this problem clearly it needs to be addressed at various levels fundamentally we can nurture our children so that we do not destroy their conscience see my promise to children remember all of those corrupt criminal accountants bankers businesspeople priests and popes lawyers and politicians that kept creeping up in the discussion above the people who maintain the entire infrastructure that allows tax havens to exist and those who manage and profit from it too do they care about you do they care about the people in africa asia and central south america who starve as a result of the types of policies that allow tax havens to exist and function do they care about those driven into poverty and homelessness in modern industrial economies because vast sums are drained out of them and hidden in secrecy jurisdictions do they care about the people killed by the military and other violence from which they profit and then hide the proceeds to evade tax do they care about the earth fundamentally do they care about themselves of course not but this is only because they are extraordinarily psychologically damaged individuals see the global elite is insane revisited with a more complete explanation in why violence and fearless psychology and fearful psychology principles and practice if we inflict enormous violence on a child throughout their childhood to compel their obedience how can we expect them to grow up to lead a life of integrity based on their conscience courage compassion empathy and love those who use tax havens are truly poor little rich boys and girls see love denied the psychology of materialism violence and war and why set up a shell company in panama the psychology driving illicit financial flows beyond tackling the problem at its source however we can also tackle manifestations of the problem but not by lobbying elites and their political agents there are no votes in it in any case to control this depravity for which they are well rewarded for a start we can boycott all of the major private banks in favor of those smaller or member owned banks that have a serious commitment to peace justice and ecological sustainability or we can seek out equivalent institutions like credit unions we can also create public banks based on ethical principles see what are public banks and how do they operate an introduction we can boycott large corporations like amazon apple gap google ikea microsoft and starbucks that use tax havens none of these corporations is a monopoly there are alternatives which can be investigated and employed assuming we can t go without some version of the product or service they offer whenever you can find a locally owned outlet that offers a local product or service we can boycott the catholic church god does not ask that you morally or financially support a corrupt organization that doesn t understand or represent morality and spirituality remember it was jesus who threw the moneychangers out of the temple if our conscience speaks loudly enough we can decline employment by any organization that is unethical such as those that use tax havens we can refuse to gamble refuse to buy the services of a sex worker who might even be illegally trafficked into the work refuse to buy the products of endangered species see for example killing elephants for pet food condemned and refuse to use illicit drugs these products and services are virtually always offered by industries controlled by criminal organizations so by buying them you are only harming yourself and or other people or species about whom you could choose to exercise a duty of care while also not contributing to the diversion of financial resources into tax havens we can encourage unions with members who work for organizations using tax havens to take a stand on the issue we can support existing organizations that work on the problem preferably those that offer grassroots alternatives the tax justice network an activist think tank and its sister organization the global alliance for tax justice campaign for systemic change if we are genuinely ambitious we can develop comprehensive nonviolent strategies to compel particular individuals and organizations to desist from using tax havens or even compel countries to close down tax havens see nonviolent campaign strategy this can easily be part of a larger strategy to transform the global economy into one that satisfies human and ecological needs particularly given the imminence of biosphere collapse as noted above see the flame tree project to save life on earth if violence and exploitation in all of their guises concern you consider signing the online pledge of the people s charter to create a nonviolent world so here is a final question for you to consider what might the world look like if all those trillions of dollars were being shared and spent where they are most needed robert j burrowes has a lifetime commitment to understanding and ending human violence he has done extensive research since 1966 in an effort to understand why human beings are violent and has been a nonviolent activist since 1981 he is the author of why violence his email address is flametree riseup netand his website is here
u s president donald trump hates trade deficits as a candidate seeking the republican presidential nomination and now as president trump has said trade deficits show a loss of u s power and has cited them in imposing tariffs against china and on other countries on wednesday the u s commerce department reported the largest monthly trade deficit for the united states in more than a decade along with a record annual deficit the u s trade deficit with china increased 3 2 billion to 38 7 billion in december as u s exports grew by 400 million to 7 7 billion and imports increased 3 6 billion to 46 4 billion but trump s huge tax cut and other economic policies â including tariffs â likely played a role in those high numbers the u s trade deficit â the difference between how much a country sells in goods and services to its trading partners and how much it buys from foreign nations â may be a sign of economic strength and not reflect policy failure as for the numbers in december the u s international trade deficit in goods and services increased by 19 percent over the prior month to a seasonally adjusted 59 8 billion and an annual deficit of 891 3 billion the commerce department said the u s economy is booming while much of the rest of the world struggles with slow or no growth the u s dollar the world s reserve currency is strong that makes foreign made goods attractive to u s buyers because they re cheap but it makes american goods more expensive for overseas buyers who must pay in local currencies weaker than the dollar in short it takes fewer dollars for americans to buy foreign made goods but more local currency to purchase u s made products sold abroad and the trump tax cut put extra money in americans pockets the result a growing u s trade deficit against a backdrop of record low unemployment increased consumer spending and higher federal tax revenues generated by a growing economy trump signed the tax cut bill into law in december 2017 the measure cut corporate tax rates encouraged u s companies to bring profits earned abroad back to the u s and expanded the standard deduction for individuals that resulted in higher consumer spending and increased business investment that boosted the economy â and the trade deficit in january 2018 trump imposed stiff tariffs on chinese made washing machines and solar panels to back his america first trade policy overall trump imposed tariffs on chinese goods valued at about 250 billion and threatened an additional 267 billion in tariffs but he didn t impose them it s clear that tariffs imposed by both nations are a negotiating tactic and neither washington nor beijing would benefit from a trade war but some reports showed that trump s threat caused a surge in u s imports as companies sought to get ahead of any possible tariff increases which in turn increased the trade gap like trump many politicians abhor trade deficits but many economists don t the basic question is do trade deficits matter the key to assessing a trade deficit isn t the dollar amount or monthly fluctuations but its size in relation to the economy in 2018 the international monetary fund said the u s has the world s largest economy at 20 4 trillion if correct what s a mere 891 3 billion trade deficit unless of course you work in an industry clobbered by cheaper foreign competition the current u s trade deficit appears large when compared with deficits immediately following world war ii but much of the industrialized world was in ruins capital mobility was limited and the world economy wasn t integrated now much of the money american consumers spend on foreign goods returns to the u s in investments real estate purchases or cash deposits the shift of manufacturing to more productive sites results in lower costs benefits consumers boosts spending and expands the economy that produces investment in infrastructure new technologies and natural resources in this respect a trade deficit may be a sign of a growing and robust economy george alessandria an economist at the philadelphia federal reserve wrote in a research paper contact the writer at scottreeves chinadailyusa com

following improved rolling margins and favorable metal spreads increased adjusted ebitda approximately 23 million a 10 percent increase in total volumes improved mix and favorable absorption in europe increased adjusted ebitda approximately 13 million the volume increase included 67 percent and 21 percent increases in global automotive and aerospace shipments respectively as well as increased north america building and construction and transportation volumes shipments from our new north america automotive assets strong operating performance in europe and customer model launches drove an increase

destocking ends we are returning to normal demand patterns and benefiting from our multi year supply agreements favorable productivity in europe and our continuous cast business in north america was more than offset by the impact of the ramp up of automotive production and the higher cost structure of the lewisport facility as we absorb costs previously considered start up expense in addition labor costs and energy prices increased and north america freight costs were significantly higher these factors combined to decrease adjusted ebitda approximately 14 million and and our continuous cast business in was more than offset by the impact of the ramp up of automotive production and the higher cost structure of the facility as we absorb costs previously considered start up expense in addition labor costs and energy prices increased and freight costs were significantly higher these factors combined to decrease adjusted ebitda approximately and a stronger dollar favorably impacted adjusted ebitda approximately 2 million in addition net loss was favorably impacted by the following in the prior year we recorded a 23 million impairment of receivables held in escrow from the sale of our former recycling business that did not recur in 2018 impairment of receivables held in escrow from the sale of our former recycling business that did not recur in 2018 a 15 million favorable

change in unrealized derivative gains approximately of unrealized gains in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to of unrealized gains in the fourth quarter of 2017 a 15 million decrease in start up costs as the north america autobody sheet abs project at our lewisport kentucky facility the north america abs project substantially exited the start up phase during the third quarter substantially all of the costs previously considered start up expense have been absorbed within adjusted ebitda as discussed in the productivity section above and decrease in start up costs as the autobody sheet abs project at our facility the north america abs project substantially exited the start up phase during the third quarter substantially all of the costs previously considered start up expense have been absorbed within adjusted ebitda as discussed in the productivity section above and a 12 million decrease in the tax provision these favorable changes to net loss were partially offset by a 5 million increase in interest expense resulting primarily from increased borrowings related to the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2018 increase in interest expense resulting primarily from increased borrowings related to the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2018 4 million of income from discontinued operations recorded in the prior year period and of income from

million which consisted of approximately 353 million of availability under our abl facility 109 million of cash on hand and 7 million of cash restricted for the payment of the china loan facility both our borrowing base and abl facility utilization may fluctuate on a monthly basis due in part to changes in seasonal working capital and aluminum prices north america north america segment income

respectively as a result of favorable demand and improved operating performance and our continuous cast operations continued to deliver solid productivity gains and improved operational performance however these improvements were more than offset by wage inflation significantly higher freight costs and unfavorable productivity at our lewisport facility productivity at the lewisport facility was affected by the automotive ramp up the absorption of costs previously considered start up expense and a cost structure designed for a manufacturing rate at which the facility is not yet producing we believe these factors are transitory and combined to decrease adjusted ebitda approximately 12 million europe europe segment income increased to 29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 26

agreement subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions there can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated on the expected timing or at all full year results key financial highlights for the year ended december 31 2018 include revenues of 3 446 million compared to 2 857 million for the prior year period the increase was primarily attributable to increased

higher adjusted ebitda a favorable change in unrealized gains on derivatives a decrease in the provision for income taxes and lower start up costs the majority of which have been absorbed in adjusted

relates to 86 million of cash from earnings offset by cash used to fund a 64 million increase in net operating assets the increase in net operating assets was primarily due to higher inventory resulting from increased aluminum prices and the ramp up of production in lewisport partially offset by increased deferred revenue associated with 60 million of capacity reservation fees received in

prior year period as the north america abs project has been substantially completed full year outlook for 2019 we expect that segment income and adjusted ebitda will be higher than 2018 as north america volumes continue to benefit from the mix shift to higher value added abs products and stable u s housing industry conditions while global aerospace volumes are expected to benefit from a return to growth and higher volumes from our new multi year contracts in addition beginning in 2019 common alloy products made by our north america segment are expected to benefit from recent duties imposed on imported common alloy products we expect full year capital expenditures of approximately 120 million to 140 million as a result of these factors we expect to generate positive cash flow in

required by law non gaap financial measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with gaap this press release includes information regarding certain non gaap financial measures management uses ebitda adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and commercial margin collectively the non gaap measures as performance metrics and believes these measures provide additional information commonly used by the holders of the 2023 junior priority notes and parties to our term loan facility and the abl facility with respect to the ongoing performance of our underlying business activities as well as our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital needs in addition ebitda with certain adjustments is a component of certain covenants under the credit agreement governing the term loan facility and the indenture governing the 2023 junior priority notes adjusted ebitda including the impact of metal price lag is a component of certain financial covenants under the credit agreement governing the abl facility management also uses commercial margin as a performance metric and believes that it provides useful information regarding the performance of our segments because it measures the price at which we sell our aluminum products above the hedged cost of the metal and the effects of metal price lag thereby reflecting the value added components of our commercial activities independent of aluminum prices which we cannot control our ebitda calculations represent net income and loss before interest income and expense provision for and benefit from income taxes depreciation and amortization and income and loss from discontinued operations net of tax adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda excluding metal price lag unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments restructuring charges currency exchange gains and losses on debt stock based compensation expense start up costs loss on extinguishment of debt impairment of amounts held in escrow related to the sale of the recycling business and certain other gains and losses segment adjusted ebitda represents adjusted ebitda on a per segment basis ebitda as defined in the credit agreement governing the term loan facility and the indenture governing the 2023 junior priority notes also limits the amount of adjustments for cost savings operational improvement and synergies for the purpose of determining our compliance with such covenants adjusted ebitda as defined under the abl facility also limits the amount of adjustments for restructuring charges and requires additional adjustments be made if certain annual pension funding levels are exceeded commercial margin represents revenues less the hedged cost of metal and the effects of metal price lag the non gaap measures as we use them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies we calculate the non gaap financial measures by eliminating the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other items you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis however the non gaap financial measures are not financial measurements recognized under gaap and when analyzing our operating performance investors should use the non gaap financial measures

gold and the political theater is the tail wagging the dog as the old saying goes politics is a show business for ugly people fair enough but what does it have to do with gold let s jump right in and find out there is no trade war economic reports are rarely fun but when we read the latest us trade report we could not help but laugh it turns out that the us goods and services deficit was 59 8 billion in december up 9 5 billion or almost 19 percent from 50 3 billion in november for 2018 the goods and services deficit was 621 0 billion an increase of 68 8 billion or 12 5 percent from 2017 in other words despite trump s america first policies and trade wars including tariffs aimed at shrinking the trade deficit the us trade gap has widened actually it surged to a 10 year high last year as one can see in the chart below as if that was not enough the shortfall with china hit a record peak isn t that funny chart 1 us trade balance from january 1992 to december 2018 well it s a laugh through tears we have two options here the first is that trump s administration is economically illiterate as students of economics learn a trade deficit simply reflects that a country chooses to consume more than it produces so it must import the difference from the rest of the world a trade deal will not help here if the chinese buy more us goods the bilateral trade with china will shrink but the us total trade deficit will not decline unless americans reduce total demand by saving more let s reiterate to make it crystal clear the real reason why the us has massive trade deficit is not the foreign import barriers but the fact that americans are spending more than they produce they can do that because foreigners lend them money to finance their net purchases and because the us dollar is an international reserve currency eagerly accepted by and sought after other countries both to finance their international trade needs and to maintain their reserve positions in so please note another funny thing the us households benefit as a whole from trade deficits after all they can consume more than they produce they get real stuff in exchange for their greenbacks despite blaming china its government actually subsidizes american consumers but there is also the second option more probable there is no trade war at all yes you heard it well it s just a smokescreen or a political theater the whole us china dispute is not about trade deficits but about the dominance in supply chains uncle sam does not care about its trade imbalance after all the tax cuts boosted consumer spending while the increased federal deficit exacerbates the deficit of savings the aim of tariffs was rather to induce china to end stealing us technology so gold investors should not focus on trade deficits and the whole buzz around them it s just a show for the public interest rates are not at neutral the us monetary policy is another great spectacle yesterday john williams the new york fed president said that the federal funds rate is neither accommodative nor contractionary so there is no hurry in hiking interest rates in a speech at the economic club of new york he said my current estimate for r star is 0 5 percent so when you adjust for inflation that s near 2 percent the current federal funds rate of 2 4 percent puts us right at neutral well we do not know how mr williams calculates the neutral rate but he definitely does not use the atlanta fed s estimations of a taylor rule as you can see in the chart below the prescription is much higher indicating that the federal funds rate should be around 4 percent to be neutral chart 2 actual federal funds rate blue line and taylor rule s prescription green line from 2000 to 2019 we are of course aware that there are many taylor rule prescriptions but virtually all of them suggest that the fed s monetary policy is still accommodative as one can see in the table below despite different inputs used in calculations all methods indicate that the federal funds rate should be higher table 1 atlanta s fed heatmap for taylor rule for q1 2019 so does williams not know taylor s rule is he economically illiterate we doubt it what he is saying is just a theater the fed does not want to raise interest rates further because of the 5 7 trillion corporate borrowing binge this is what robert kaplan dallas fed president admitted on tuesday it s something that i m aware of which sort of reinforces for me why i feel we should be taking no action for some period of time the us central bank is simply afraid of bursting the bubbles it previously created maintaining the interest rates too low for too long the cautious stance is worse for gold than aggressive hiking as it postpones the day of reckoning on the other hand more dovish fed and lower interest rates are supportive for the yellow metal as an alternative for the yield bearing assets implications for gold the implication for gold is clear politics is a theater or show business for ugly people as the old saying goes hence do not take what policymakers say at face value look at data our gold analyses are always data based and one more thing people love spectacles so the political factors may often dominate the markets but all shows eventually end when the curtain falls the fundamental factors of the precious metals market should come to the fore don t focus on the buzz but look deeper then your gold investments will shine and remember today the ecb holds its regular monetary policy meeting it is expected to loosen its stance so we could

haiti haiti s energy woes creating monthly panic as government struggles to keep lights on two women stand among empty propane tanks used to mark the owners places in line during violent protests that shut down the county for 10 days in february 2019 port au prince residents were forced to endure long lines for fuel as well as water throughout the capital city cjuste miamiherald com haiti is running out of fuel again gas stations are stockpiling and rationing gasoline the poor are running out of kerosene to cook private power suppliers out of diesel for the past 11 days are reducing or ceasing production taking haiti s already desperate electricity issues from bad to worse twelve months after venezuela stopped delivery of cheap oil under its energy assistance petrocaribe program forcing haiti to buy all of its petroleum products on the caribbean and u s spot markets haiti s energy woes have grown into an almost monthly panic as the country s bankrupt government insists on maintaining control of fuel imports despite its inability to pay it s become a mess for to deliver said pierre marie boisson a port au prince economist and founder of société générale de solidarité sogesol one of haiti s three largest microfinance companies the latest symbol of the dysfunction since feb 27 about 150 000 barrels of gasoline have been sitting in a ship off the coast of port au prince in international waters awaiting more than 37 million in overdue payments from the haitian government s bureau of monetization of programs and development aid or bmpad the owner of the cargo houston based novum energy said it is owed 58 million in arrears not including the 11 million for the gasoline currently sitting off the coast my priority is to get some payment so i can discharge this cargo said chris scott novum s chief financial officer we have not received any payments and as of right now have no idea when we are likely to get any either we are not getting any information whatsoever as part of its agreement with novum which had been winning most of the government s energy bids haiti enjoyed 45 days payment terms but payments scott said have being repeatedly delayed prompting the company in january to keep two shiploads at bay while fuel pumps and generators throughout haiti ran empty we ve been doing this for four and a half years and only since the collapse of petrocaribe has this been a problem scott said the latest arrears prompted novum this week to issue a press release explaining why another one of its fuel ships was not off loading the release also went on to explain that after running up 69 million in credit bmpad was effectively squeezing novum out of the haitian fuel supply market scott said bmpad issued a request for bids in february for fuel to be delivered during two different periods in march novum put in bids and was then notified that the contract had been canceled three days later the fuel request was re posted but this time with a caveat in order to bid a company needed to have a local registration number that was at least two years old there are no requirements anywhere in the world where you need to have a local registration said scott the reality is if bmpad continues to put in this requirement to be a domestically registered company then novum will no longer be able to submit we cannot comply neither can any international company scott said novum put in a bid anyway his company s offer he said beat out competitors including local haiti competitor dinasa which is a subsidiary of the french rubis group scott said novum has yet to receive official word about who won the bid request but has learned that dinasa has two cargo ships filled with fuel bound for haiti and this is also despite the fact we still have a gasoline cargo there that we have a contract to deliver and we are still awaiting payments for he said in its release novum said that if it is eventually disqualified dinasa will ultimately charge the people of haiti 700 000 more than the real best price available furthermore haiti will run out of gasoline imminently since not one other company supplied a price at tender firing back with its own press release dinasa said it has nothing to do with bmpad s decision company head luc maiche told the miami herald that its 275 000 barrels of diesel and 74 000 barrels of kerosene that are en route to haiti are 360 000 cheaper than novum s offer ignace saint fleur who heads bmpad said that he refuses to enter a debate over novum but that the company did not meet the new requirements he said bmpad is awaiting payments from the oil companies in haiti in order to pay novum the arrears it owes on fuel there is no gas crisis he said haitians monitoring the fuel war between novum and dinasa say the recurring fuel shortage crisis goes beyond the companies spat or even bmpad s poor handling of the latest round of bidding the spat like the fuel crisis is symptomatic of the government s continued mismanagement and misguided intervention in matters that should be handled by private businesses they say when you have government messing around and managing things that should be managed by the market you always have that type of situation you always have that type of hidden corruption preference mismanagement boisson said unfortunately for haiti the fuel war is coming as the country finds itself knee deep in a political and economic crisis as the government struggles to keep cars running and the lights on the opposition is calling for the resignation of the president and the cost of living is skyrocketing anytime you have a fuel shortage in haiti you have a mess because it impacts everyone boisson said a lot of people in haiti are running on private generators and when they don t have fuel it impacts on a lot of different activities while the end of venezuela s oil deliveries under petrocaribe in march 2018 is often cited as the beginning of the crisis some say it goes back to 2017 when the haitian government confiscated a fuel ship after dinasa and two other oil companies decided to import fuel on their own the government declared them a menace to the national security of the country and threatened the companies directors with indictments months later haitian president jovenel moïse issued an order explicitly giving bmpad the monopoly over fuel imports but that exclusivity came amid a volatile foreign exchange market in which the local haitian currency the gourde was quickly devaluing against a strong u s dollar at the same time the moïse government which continued a policy of subsidizing fuel prices at the pump was incurring a record public deficit all of which made dollars harder to come by to pay for the fuel adding to the country s woes was the government s decision months later to ban the use of the u s dollar and other foreign currency in transactions the measure has since been rescinded what it meant say economists is that every time a shipment of fuel came in the government had to come up with dollars to pay with the central bank s own international reserves nearing a critical threshold the government was then forced to buy dollars which led to it further accumulating debt with novum meanwhile the government itself loses anywhere between 25 million and 35 million a month between its financing of fuel and the state owned power company edh which purchases power from private providers for its unstable grid there is no energy policy in haiti no controls said reginald noel a bio energy specialist in port au prince who has a weekly investment show on radio metropole we ve been subsidizing for so long and it s ridiculous that most of the diesel being used is for electricity generation that only covers three haitians out of 10 it s not going to get us anywhere and not going to cover production for agriculture or tourism he added hotels have to supply their own electricity each and every company that comes to invest here has to bring two generators and fuel tanks making matters worse noel pointed out is that the government which endured three days of violent civil unrest and canceled international flights when it announced fuel hikes in july cannot even raise the price of the gallon by one dime yet on the black market fuel is being sold for 8 48 and 12 11 a gallon in certain provinces noel said it is total mismanagement we need an emergency energy policy in haiti things cannot go on like that indeed black market fuel has become a hot commodity in haiti that and the stockpiling by gas stations is speeding up consumption which means that even oil companies are increasingly facing difficulties trying to figure out the country s fuel needs when sending orders to bmpad boisson said that during a visit between the president and business leaders six months ago he warned moïse who has promised to bring 24 7 electricity to all of haiti by this summer about the pending fuel shortage the way to solve the situation is pretty clear to me boisson said first of all pay the arrears it is really bad for the country second he said open the fuel market not so long ago fuel companies used to consolidate their respective purchases into one order every three to four weeks to minimize costs boisson said when they were purchasing their own fuel they were teaming together making their own bids and deciding who was going to be the importer this time and that importer would import for everybody that mechanism was more in line with everyone s objectives and the importers just went to the bank and purchased the foreign exchange and it was working there is no need for the government to be controlling this he added referring to fuel imports and bmpad s monopolized role this is really a lot of intervention in the marketplace where the state should at least focus on what is their job and let the private sector businesses do their work this story was originally published march 8 2019 7

another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last nine days the sell off which lost some strength toward the end of the day followed a surprisingly weak jobs report and more signs that the global economy is hitting the brakes on friday a report showed chinese exports plunged 20 percent last month far more than economists expected on thursday europe s central bank said it was doing a policy reversal and restoring measures to shore up that region s economy energy stocks led the market s slide as crude oil prices declined health care companies and retailers also pulled the market lower most homebuilders rose following a big jump in january housing starts the u s jobs report is the latest batch of discouraging economic news to give investors a reason to sell and pocket some of their recent gains as they wait for the next positive headline or economic data to pave the way for stocks to move higher again said mark watkins regional investment strategist at u s bank wealth management we ve had a very solid run and there are investors who are going to be taking a little bit of money off the table watkins said the s p 500 dropped 5 86 points or 0 2 percent to 2 743 07 the benchmark index has fallen five days in a row its longest losing streak in nearly four months the dow jones industrial

year this week s losses for the s p 500 are the worst since december but not as severe as they were then when worries were peaking about a slowing global economy and that interest rates may rise too quickly since then the federal reserve helped calm some of the worries by pledging to be patient in raising rates still investors are feeling increasingly uneasy about the global economy the organisation for economic co operation and development said this week that it expects global growth to be 3 3 percent this year down from the 3 5 percent that it had forecast just four months ago the oecd said economic prospects are weaker in nearly all the countries that make up the g20 than previously expected and it cited a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing among other reasons the united states and china have been locked in a particularly tense trade dispute though the countries say they re making progress in negotiations analysts are debating whether the u s stock market s latest moves are the last gasps for the longest bull market on record for u s stocks which began 10 years ago this weekend or just the latest challenge for it muddle through right now the u s economy is gradually slowing and earnings are trending a little bit lower watkins said any news that has been coming out that hasn t been that strong has been a little bit of a negative catalyst for the market to have a reason to move back just a little bit the strong u s labor market has been a major pillar of support for the stock market s run in recent years but friday s jobs report was surprisingly bad employers added just 20 000 jobs last month when economists were expecting something closer to 180 000 last month s job growth was also a sharp slowdown from january s 311 000 a number that the government revised higher on friday a slower global economy wouldn t need as much oil and the price of crude sank friday along with expectations for demand benchmark u s crude fell 1 percent to settle at 56 07 per barrel brent crude the international standard lost 0 8 percent to close at 65 74 per barrel the sharp decline sent energy companies to double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the s p 500 they ended 2 percent lower also hurting the sector was a decision by norway s 1 trillion wealth fund to dump shares in some oil and gas companies the move would exclude companies that operate solely in exploration or production but it will continue to own the biggest companies in the energy industry noble energy and eog resources tumbled 5 4 percent new

deployment of new products progress being made on cathedral s next generation dual telemetry measurement while drilling mwd tool and performance and reliability enhancements being incorporated into cathedral s existing mwd equipment fleet outlook in 2018 the u s rig count continued to grow from 929 rigs at the end of 2017 to 1 083 active rigs at the end of 2018 for an average rig count of 1 032 during the year source baker hughes rig count data in 2018 the u s rig count growth was largely driven by west texas intermediate wti oil price increases from the usd 60 bbl range at the beginning of 2018 to the usd 75 bbl range by mid year however starting in october 2018 there was a sharp decrease in wti pricing into the 50 bbl range by the end of the year this oil price drop resulted in many energy companies reviewing their drilling budgets for 2019 with the result that there has been a modest drop in the u s rig count in early 2019 another factor which may impact u s rig activity in 2019 is takeaway capacity issues in the permian these are expected to be resolved in late 2019 and early 2020 investors are also messaging to energy companies that they need to live within their cash flow all the above considerations have industry analysts prognosticating there could be a drop in the u s average rig count in 2019 by up to 10 this rig count drop may impact cathedral s activity levels in 2019 however the impact is uncertain when it comes down to individual customer situations and cathedral s operations and sales performance in this environment the u s market is our primary focus and our intention is to continue to grow our market share we believe that our recent equipment additions and upgrades position us well to achieve this following curtailment in 2018 q4 the canadian operating environment has seen volatility in the early months of 2019 coinciding with the wti price drop in late 2018 the canadian industry was further impacted by high oil price differentials resulting from oil take away capacity from canada being constrained at the end of 2018 many canadian energy companies were reviewing their drilling budgets with a view to reduce them in 2019 since the end of 2018 pricing for canadian oil has improved however drilling activity levels in canada remain very uncertain at least in the first half of 2019 analysts anticipate canadian drilling activity levels will be down year over year 8 to 39 with the wide range highlighting the degree of uncertainty although the outlook for canada looks challenging in the short term the expectation is that things will improve into 2020 based on additional take away capacity coming on line the canadian industry also stands to get a boost in the early 2020s based on liquefied natural gas lng export capacity coming on stream mid decade our strategy in canada is to maintain the optionality on future industry growth through focusing on serving stronger customers in areas we have advantages in maintaining a focused and lean cost structure and again leveraging our differentiated technology advantages in the canadian market there continues to be movement in the industry to combine or consolidate operations in order to achieve enhanced profitability through greater size and scale in order to leverage our existing strong balance sheet to improve equipment utilization and to better leverage our proprietary technologies our strategy includes looking at opportunities for growth through market share additions and accretive combination with other entities after a large capital spend over the last two years we can now shift to a more modest capital program as we deploy the new equipment our primary capital expenditure focus to the end of 2018 was on our motor fleet in early 2019 we are expecting to field test two new patented motor designs double bend and double pad both motor designs are based upon substantially the same principles and are expected to significantly reduce drag stick slip and rotary torque as well as extending the length of laterals that can be drilled with a conventional bottom hole assembly bha as compared to using a rotary steerable system we have had discussions with a number of u s operators that are interested in testing this new technology we also expect to add a mud lube version of our ndurance bearing section into our motor fleet introducing a mud lube bearing assembly in addition to our sealed bearing design is aimed at facilitating better motor performance in areas of high downhole temperature and with higher mud flow and pressure situations in 2019 our focus is primarily on building out our new mwd technology our 2019 net capital budget is targeted at approximately 4 000 and 1 700 of intangible additions related to technology developments subject to operating results and industry outlook equipment lost in hole will be replaced and funded from the proceeds received although we expect the first half of 2019 to be very fluid based on changing market conditions we are in a strong position and ready to seize opportunities results of operations three months ended december 31 revenues 2018 q4 2017 q4 canada 8 146 7 749 united states 34 981 30 653

december 31 2017 however in 2017 the company chose to write off certain assets where utilization was very low due to low market demand in the amount of 8 287 the assets written down included non proprietary drilling motors and certain non proprietary mwd systems the non proprietary mwd systems had been purchased in connection with international operations which were subsequently discontinued this equipment was not used extensively in the company s north american operations and was fully written off the company has experienced lower demand for non proprietary motors in the current drilling environment as their performance capabilities are lower than the company s proprietary motors as a consequence the company conducted a review and wrote off the remaining net book value for any non

new york ap another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last nine days the sell off which lost some strength toward the end of the day followed a surprisingly weak jobs report and more signs that the global economy is hitting the brakes on friday a report showed chinese exports plunged 20 percent last month far more than economists expected on thursday europe s central bank said it was doing a policy reversal and restoring measures to shore up that region s economy energy stocks led the market s slide as crude oil prices declined health care companies and retailers also pulled the market lower most homebuilders rose following a big jump in january housing starts the u s jobs report is the latest batch of discouraging economic news to give investors a reason to sell and pocket some of their recent gains as they wait for the next positive headline or economic data to pave the way for stocks to move higher again said mark watkins regional investment strategist at u s bank wealth management we ve had a very solid run and there are investors who are going to be taking a little bit of money off the table watkins said the s p 500 dropped 5 86 points or 0 2 percent to 2 743 07 the benchmark index has fallen five days in a row its longest losing streak in nearly four months the dow jones industrial average lost 22 99 points or 0 1 percent to 25 450 24 the average briefly fell more than 220 points nasdaq composite declined 13 32 points or 0 2 percent to 7 408 14 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 1 74 points or 0 1 percent to 1 521 88 major european indexes closed lower the market s momentum has stalled this week after enjoying a sharp bounce back at the start of this year this week s losses for the s p 500 are the worst since december but not as severe as they were then when worries were peaking about a slowing global economy and that interest rates may rise too quickly since then the federal reserve helped calm some of the worries by pledging to be patient in raising rates still investors are feeling increasingly uneasy about the global economy the organisation for economic co operation and development said this week that it expects global growth to be 3 3 percent this year down from the 3 5 percent that it had forecast just four months ago the oecd said economic prospects are weaker in nearly all the countries that make up the g20 than previously expected and it cited a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing among other reasons the united states and china have been locked in a particularly tense trade dispute though the countries say they re making progress in negotiations analysts are debating whether the u s stock market s latest moves are the last gasps for the longest bull market on record for u s stocks which began 10 years ago this weekend or just the latest challenge for it muddle through right now the u s economy is gradually slowing and earnings are trending a little bit lower watkins said any news that has been coming out that hasn t been that strong has been a little bit of a negative catalyst for the market to have a reason to move back just a little bit the strong u s labor market has been a major pillar of support for the stock market s run in recent years but friday s jobs report was surprisingly bad employers added just 20 000 jobs last month when economists were expecting something closer to 180 000 last month s job growth was also a sharp slowdown from january s 311 000 a number that the government revised higher on friday a slower global economy wouldn t need as much oil and the price of crude sank friday along with expectations for demand benchmark u s crude fell 1 percent to settle at 56 07 per barrel brent crude the international standard lost 0 8 percent to close at 65 74 per barrel the sharp decline sent energy companies to double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the s p 500 they ended 2 percent lower also hurting the sector was a decision by norway s 1 trillion wealth fund to dump shares in some oil and gas companies the move would exclude companies that operate solely in exploration or production but it will continue to own the biggest companies in the energy industry noble energy and eog resources tumbled 5 4 percent new u s residential construction data gave traders reason to be more optimistic about homebuilder stocks the commerce department said housing starts jumped 18 6 percent in january as builders ramped up construction of single family houses to the fastest pace in eight months the rebound after december s plunge bodes well for the new home market heading into the spring homebuying season hovnanian enterprises gained 4 percent kb home added 1 5 percent traders hammered national beverage after the maker of la croix soft drinks reported disappointing quarterly earnings the ceo issued a puzzling statement saying we are truly sorry for the results stated above and blamed the weak performance on unspecified injustice the stock slumped 14 6 percent costco wholesale bucked wall street s downward trend climbing 5 1 percent for the biggest gain among stocks in the s p 500 the warehouse club operator reported profit growth that was far stronger than analysts expected other retailers racked up losses foot locker lost 3 3 percent ross stores slid 3 6 percent and gap dropped 3 percent the weak u s jobs growth helped pull the value of the dollar lower against its peers the u s currency slipped to 111 07 japanese yen from 111 52 yen late thursday the weaker dollar sent the euro up to 1 1242 from 1 1186 bond prices were little changed the yield on the 10 year treasury note held at 2 63

the gbp usd is set to close the first week of march 1 1 lower breaking below 50 fibonacci retracement support at 1 3090 the key macro event is scheduled for tuesday march 12 with the house of commons set to vote on re negotiated brexit deal the chances are rising for delayed brexit to materialize should the smooth brexit and no deal brexit scenarios fail to materialize the fxstreet forecast poll reflects a greater amount of uncertainty ahead of uk house of commons brexit vote scheduled for next week the gbp usd is trading down about 1 1 over the week on friday after falling from monday s 1 3208 as low as 1 3051 over the week as brexit uncertainty and the technical setup for a corrective move lower played its part during the first week of march even with the us non farm payroll report in february missing the market forecast with only 20k new jobs added in february well off 180k expected the gbp usd remained capped below 1 3100 as the us wages rose by 3 4 over the year slightly more than expected and the unemployment rate in the us dropped to 3 8 although the currency market reaction was rather muted the us interest rate futures showed the chances of federal reserve cutting the rates in 2019 increasing to 30 from 19 shortly before the february payrolls data with us dollar negative implications the uk government is trying to re negotiate the brexit deal with the european union in the last minute attempt to deliver the changes on the troubled issue of the irish border backstop that saw members of house of commons reject the original withdrawal proposal in january in a stunning defeat for the government on the macroeconomic side the uk construction pmi slumped to a contraction territory with the reading of 49 5 in february while services pmi saw the business activity increase to 51 3 the macro news had a marginal effect on the currency market with the brexit negotiations conducted behind the closed doors and no major market moving announcements the us dollar strength emerged after the european central bank decided on thursday to launch further stimulus program with the third part of targeted long term refinancing operations tltros while changing the forward guidance on rates saying it won t change rates until the end of 2019 the us dollar rose as much as 1 against the euro that fell to the lowest level since june 27 2017 and the dollar strength saw sterling falling past 1 3090 representing a 50 fibonacci retracement of the upmove from 1 1800 to a cyclical high of 1 4374 the brexit re negotiations are taking place in brussels with the european union said to make a new offer to the uk on brexit backstop that is likely to fall short of the uk demands with 21 days left before the uk is expected to officially depart from the european union the time is tight for any structural changes while the uk house of commons is scheduled to vote on re negotiated brexit deal next tuesday while the uk parliament is unlikely to pass the re negotiated brexit deal the chances for delayed brexit increased in support for sterling for the week ahead the crucial brexit deal vote is scheduled for tuesday march 12 passing the brexit deal opens up the road to scheduled departure of the uk from the european union on march 29 in case of the uk house of commons rejecting the deal another vote on a no deal brexit will follow on wednesday march 13 failure to accept a no deal brexit which is the most likely scenario will see the house of commons vote on delayed brexit proposal on thursday march 14 on the macro front the uk manufacturing output due on the day of the brexit vote next week is expected to play the minor role and the us retail sales and inflation data are also unlikely to drive the currency markets more than the brexit deal vote itself on the other side of the atlantic the us february non farm payroll missed the market estimate big time rising only by 20k compared to the expectations of 180k while wages increased slightly above expectations by 3 4 y y and the unemployment rate dropped to 3 8 while scenarios of approving the brexit deal is gbp usd supportive a no deal brexit scenario might become a nightmare for sterling after 2 years of brexit chaos with days remaining before the official departure of the uk from the eu nobody really knows what sort of brexit will finally become reality that s sad but true as the bank of england monetary policy committee member silvana tenrayro indicated in her speech on thursday the disorderly brexit is more likely to require loosening of monetary policy than tightening while sterling would likely appreciate after a smooth brexit which would limit inflation pressure the us federal reserve and the bank of england officials speaking new york fed president john williams said in a speech at the economic club of new york on march 6 slower growth isn t necessarily cause for alarm but instead a new normal we should expect from a monetary policy perspective the us economy is about as good as it gets fed can afford to be flexible and wait for data to guide our approach i expect the growth to slow to about 2 this year the outlook in europe and china has become less bright with a downgrade to european outlook notable tightening of financial conditions in 2018 will restrain consumer business spending in 2019 the us economy has a strong labor market moderate growth no sign of significant inflation pressure my view is we re not seeing signs of the scarcity of reserves needed to conduct monetary policy there is no clear answer on the level of reserves fed will need to conduct monetary policy interest rates are right where they need to be inflation risks don t seem to be out there at all right now i don t have a particular lean on where rates should go in a downturn we could consider quantitative easing negative rates with cost benefit tradeoffs of negative rates not as favorable as quantitative easing the bank of england monetary policy committee member michael saunders said on march 6 it is possible that monetary tightening might be needed in the future but does not mean we need to tighten now it makes sense to wait and see how brexit unfolds the uk inflation reasonably well behaved growth not strong enough now to create excess demand the policy response to brexit is not automatic could be in either direction effect of the latest boe rate hikes on households seems much smaller than usual weaker impact of recent rate rises suggests boe may need to be more forceful when tightening or loosening policy in the future the link between the bank rate and changes in household finances less effective when the bank rate is low negative interest rates do not really work quantitative easing offers more scope gradual tightening does not mean it will be fantastically slow the output gap is closing so policy should not be as loose as has been when we get out of brexit risk the uk households would probably go back to recent trend if brexit deadline extended by a couple of years i am agnostic about the direction of monetary policy after a no deal brexit i am certain that monetary policy could not prevent a no deal brexit from damaging uk economy the new york federal reserve vice president simon potter said on march 7 there is little academic analysis to quantify the effect of fed mortgage purchases on other bonds stocks there is a little experience to draw on as fed reverses asset purchases many might argue that agency mortgage backed securities mbs issuers gained benefits at taxpayers expense some agency mbs reinvestment purchases may be needed in the future there is more to learn about selling agency mbs prior to any decision to start doing so mbs purchases provided clear benefits to the economy the federal reserve governor and the voting member of the rate setting fomc lael brainard said at princeton university in new jersey on march 7 increase in risks warrants a downward revision in rate path policy goal now is to preserve progress made on maximum employment target inflation the best way to safeguard gains is to navigate cautiously on rates the downside risks to output employment argue for softer rate path even if economic outlook stays the same the demand appears to have softened against the backdrop of greater downside risks prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting especially with no signs of inflation pickup the economy might warrant a softening in the fed s policy path with balance sheet normalization well advanced should wind down redemptions later this year i would not want to cut rates and shrink the balance sheet at the same time the inflation trends may be below the committee s objective we should be equally attentive to the risk of downside erosion in inflation expectations trade disputes brexit us government debt ceiling among risks to forecast fed policymakers are carefully monitoring leveraged loans bonds vulnerable to downgrade and funds that hold those assets it is clear that the potential us economic growth rate is lower than before i do not want to prejudge what kind of rate moves would be appropriate late in the year the active movement from mortgage backed securities to treasuries on the fed balance sheet is not a short term consideration fed policymakers should look at temporary price level targeting and other proposals on the inflation target fed will not be done addressing larger inflation framework review until late this year or beyond the bank of england monetary policy committee member silvana tenreyro said on march 7 disorderly brexit is more likely to require loosening of monetary policy than tightening it is easy to envisage other scenarios requiring the opposite response sterling would likely appreciate after a smooth brexit which would limit inflation pressure we will need a small amount of tightening over the next 3 years after smooth brexit before voting for rate hikes need to be confident of demand growing faster than supply an increase in domestic inflation pressure trade tensions and the us tariffs on china are the biggest drivers of the global slowdown brexit vote

new york ap another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last nine days the sell off which lost some strength toward the end of the day followed a surprisingly weak jobs report and more signs that the global economy is hitting the brakes on friday a report showed chinese exports plunged 20 percent last month far more than economists expected on thursday europe s central bank said it was doing a policy reversal and restoring measures to shore up that region s economy energy stocks led the market s slide as crude oil prices declined health care companies and retailers also pulled the market lower most homebuilders rose following a big jump in january housing starts the u s jobs report is the latest batch of discouraging economic news to give investors a reason to sell and pocket some of their recent gains as they wait for the next positive headline or economic data to pave the way for stocks to move higher again said mark watkins regional investment strategist at u s bank wealth management we ve had a very solid run and there are investors who are going to be taking a little bit of money off the

this week s losses for the s p 500 are the worst since december but not as severe as they were then when worries were peaking about a slowing global economy and that interest rates may rise too quickly since then the federal reserve helped calm some of the worries by pledging to be patient in raising rates still investors are feeling increasingly uneasy about the global economy the organisation for economic co operation and development said this week that it expects global growth to be 3 3 percent this year down from the 3 5 percent that it had forecast just four months ago the oecd said economic prospects are weaker in nearly all the countries that make up the g20 than previously expected and it cited a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing among other reasons the united states and china have been locked in a particularly tense trade dispute though the countries say they re making progress in negotiations analysts are debating whether the u s stock market s latest moves are the last gasps for the longest bull market on record for u s stocks which began 10 years ago this weekend or just the latest challenge for it muddle through right now the u s economy is gradually slowing and earnings are trending a little bit lower watkins said any news that has been coming out that hasn t been that strong has been a little bit of a negative catalyst for the market to have a reason to move back just a little bit the strong u s labor market has been a major pillar of support for the stock market s run in recent years but friday s jobs report was surprisingly bad employers added just 20 000 jobs last month when economists were expecting something closer to 180 000 last month s job growth was also a sharp slowdown from january s 311 000 a number that the government revised higher on friday a slower global economy wouldn t need as much oil and the price of crude sank friday along with expectations for demand benchmark u s crude fell 1 percent to settle at 56 07 per barrel brent crude the international standard lost 0 8 percent to close at 65 74 per barrel the sharp decline sent energy companies to double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the s p 500 they ended 2 percent lower also hurting the sector was a decision by norway s 1 trillion wealth fund to dump shares in some oil and gas companies the move

company expects the acquisition to close prior to the commencement of the australian ski season in june 2019 commenting on the company s fiscal 2019 second quarter results rob katz chief executive officer said we are pleased with our overall results for the quarter with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year in the pre holiday period destination guest visitation at our u s resorts was less than expected which we attribute to guest concerns after two prior years of poor pre holiday conditions our destination guest visitation was largely in line with expectations during the key holiday weeks and through the remainder of january throughout the quarter with the favorable conditions at our u s resorts we saw strong visitation growth among our local guests who are primarily pass purchasers our colorado and utah resorts experienced strong visitation during the holidays and through the remainder of the quarter that aligned with our expectations our tahoe resorts and whistler blackcomb saw periods of strong visitation in the holiday and post holiday periods but have also been impacted by numerous weather events that have negatively impacted their results in addition international visitation at whistler blackcomb was below the prior year throughout the quarter our northeast resorts are off to a great start to the season as we continue to benefit from good conditions and the first season with okemo and mount sunapee as a part of our network conditions across the network are set up well for the remainder of the season including results from triple peaks and stevens pass in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 total lift revenue increased 17 2 driven by a 27 0 growth in skier visitation total effective ticket price etp decreased 7 8 in the second quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to higher skier visitation by season pass holders and the impact of the new military epic pass partially offset by price increases in both our lift ticket and season pass products excluding season pass holders etp increased 8 3 compared to the prior year the strong rebound in visitation and spending compared to the prior year along with the addition of triple peaks and stevens pass drove a 15 1 increase in ski school revenue a 21 3 increase in dining revenue and an 11 3 increase in retail rental revenue compared to the prior year regarding the company s lodging segment katz said our lodging results for the second fiscal quarter were positive with revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursements increasing 16 1 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental operations of triple peaks the average daily rate adr decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the inclusion of the triple peaks resorts as well as incremental managed tahoe lodging properties that we did not manage in the prior year all of which generate a lower adr as compared to our broader lodging segment regarding the company s outlook katz said as noted in our january press release we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disappointing results from destination visitation in the pre holiday period and also due to shortfalls from expectations at our tahoe resorts and whistler blackcomb we now expect net income attributable to vail resorts inc for fiscal 2019 to be between 268 million and 300 million and resort reported ebitda for fiscal 2019 to be between 690 million and 710 million which remains generally consistent with our commentary on guidance in january our guidance is predicated on current canadian and australian foreign exchange rates of 0 75 and 0 71 respectively for each currency to the u s dollar for the remainder of the fiscal year which represents an estimated 4 million reduction in resort reported ebitda from the currency rates included in the guidance we issued in september 2018 of which nearly half has been realized year to date the updated guidance incorporates 12 million

corporation realized record low net operating costs of 5 09 per barrel in 2018 26 below the record of 6 84 per barrel achieved in the prior year the decrease in net operating costs was primarily the result of a per barrel decrease in energy operating costs and an increase in per barrel power revenue non energy operating costs averaged 4 62 per barrel for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 pricing and market access the fourth quarter of 2018 was a challenging period for canadian oil producers due to a rapid decline in canadian heavy crude oil prices meg s blend sales price of 36 59 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by historically wide wti wcs differentials of us 39 43 per barrel in comparison meg s blend sales price was 57 01 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017 with a wti wcs differential of us 12 26 per barrel the corporation partially mitigated the wider differentials during the fourth quarter of 2018 by selling 33 of blend volumes into the higher priced u s gulf coast market via the flanagan south seaway pipelines and rail on an annual basis in contrast to the 27 increase in wti benchmark price meg s blend sales price increased by 4 to average 53 26 per barrel in 2018 compared to 51 20 per barrel in 2017 due to the widening wti wcs differential meg s bitumen realization during the fourth quarter averaged 13 90 per barrel as a result of the significant widening of the wti wcs differential negatively impacting both the blend sales price and the cost recovered on the corporation s diluent purchases the increase in average condensate benchmark prices and the timing of inventory purchases negatively impacted diluent expense during the fourth quarter bitumen realization averaged 36 25 per barrel in 2018 compared to 41 89 per barrel in 2017 the corporation s cost of diluent averaged 89 28 per barrel in the fourth quarter and 91 60 per barrel in 2018 compared to 72 32 per barrel of diluent in 2017 primarily due to an increase in average condensate benchmark pricing during the fourth quarter of 2018 meg doubled its rail volumes from the prior quarter to 14 700 bbls d 56 of which were delivered to the u s gulf coast the corporation estimates rail volumes to average 20 000 bbls d in the first quarter increasing to 30 000 bbls d by the third quarter of 2019 as a mechanism to clear barrels during periods of high pipeline apportionment and reduce exposure to the post apportionment market the use of rail enables meg to maximize the price received on its barrels until additional egress capacity from western canada is secured transportation costs averaged 10 28 per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 8 42 per barrel and 6 89 per barrel for full year 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in costs on a per barrel basis is primarily the result of incremental costs associated with the access transportation services agreement that was put in place after the sale of meg s 50 interest in the pipeline and its 100 interest in the stonefell terminal on march 22 2018 as well as additional costs associated with increased volumes transported by rail to the u s gulf coast the production curtailments put in place by the alberta government since january have helped to strengthen the price we receive for our products with nearly one third of our blend sales exposed to the higher price gulf coast market in 2019 we anticipate our blend sales realization to be above the wcs benchmark for the full year says evans by mid 2020 we expect to double the number of barrels we will sell into the u s gulf coast as our commitment on flanagan south seaway increases from 50 000 to 100 000 bbls d capital investment total cash capital investment in 2018 totaled 619 million compared to 503 million in 2017 and the previously revised guidance of 670 million announced in august 2018 capital investment in 2018 was primarily directed towards completing the rollout of emsagp on christina lake phase 2b advancement of the corporation s phase 2b brownfield expansion and sustaining and maintenance activities adjusted funds flow and net earnings the corporation realized a cash operating netback of 5 73 per barrel in fourth quarter of 2018 as a direct result of the wti wcs differential which negatively impacted bitumen realizations partially offset by a realized gain on commodity risk management contracts of 6 81 per barrel cash operating netback for 2018 averaged 17 17 per barrel compared to 27 00 per barrel for 2017 impacted by similar factors adjusted funds flow was impacted by the same primary factors as cash operating netback resulting in realized negative adjusted funds flow of 38 million or 0 13 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted funds flow for the full year 2018 was 180 million or 0 60 per share compared to 374 million for 2017 the decrease was primarily the result of the significant widening of the wti wcs differential particularly during the fourth quarter of 2018 which resulted in a decrease in bitumen realization year over year combined with realized losses on commodity risk management contracts during 2018 the corporation recognized a net loss of 199 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 which in addition to the impact of depressed prices reflects a net foreign exchange loss of 198 million partially offset by a gain on commodity risk management contracts of 228 million the corporation recognized a net loss of 119 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to net earnings of 166 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the net loss in 2018 included a net foreign exchange loss of 311 million offset by a gain on commodity risk management contracts of 23 million and a gain on asset dispositions of 325 million primarily related to the sale of the corporation s 50 interest in the access pipeline outlook announced in january meg s 2019 capital investment plan includes a base capital budget of 200 million designed to sustain production capability at 100 000 bbls d and advance growth projects beyond 2019 while meg has the ability to average 100 000 bbls d of production the corporation s 2019 production

expense averaged 2 58 per barrel in 2018 a 12 decrease from 2 94 per barrel in 2017 to align with lower levels of capital spending and to further optimize operational efficiencies the corporation made

another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last nine days another wave of selling on wall street friday left the s p 500 with its worst weekly showing since january and its eighth loss in the last nine days the sell off which lost some strength toward the end of the day followed a surprisingly weak jobs report and more signs that the global economy is hitting the brakes on friday a report showed chinese exports plunged 20 percent last month far more than economists expected on thursday europe s central bank said it was doing a policy reversal and restoring measures to shore up that region s economy energy stocks led the market s slide as crude oil prices declined health care companies and retailers also pulled the market lower most homebuilders rose following a big jump in january housing starts the u s jobs report is the latest batch of discouraging economic news to give investors a reason to sell and pocket some of their recent gains as they wait for the next positive headline or economic data to pave the way for stocks to move higher again said mark watkins regional investment strategist at u s bank wealth management we ve had a very solid run and there are investors who are going to be taking a little bit of money off the table watkins said the s p 500 dropped 5 86 points

since december but not as severe as they were then when worries were peaking about a slowing global economy and that interest rates may rise too quickly since then the federal reserve helped calm some of the worries by pledging to be patient in raising rates still investors are feeling increasingly uneasy about the global economy the organisation for economic co operation and development said this week that it expects global growth to be 3 3 percent this year down from the 3 5 percent that it had forecast just four months ago the oecd said economic prospects are weaker in nearly all the countries that make up the g20 than previously expected and it cited a slowdown in trade and global manufacturing among other reasons the united states and china have been locked in a particularly tense trade dispute though the countries say they re making progress in negotiations analysts are debating whether the u s stock market s latest moves are the last gasps for the longest bull market on record for u s stocks which began 10 years ago this weekend or just the latest challenge for it muddle through right now the u s economy is gradually slowing and earnings are trending a little bit lower watkins said any news that has been coming out that hasn t been that strong has been a little bit of a negative catalyst for the market to have a reason to move back just a little bit the strong u s labor market has been a major pillar of support for the stock market s run in recent years but friday s jobs report was surprisingly bad employers added just 20 000 jobs last month when economists were expecting something closer to 180 000 last month s job growth was also a sharp slowdown from january s 311 000 a number that the government revised higher on friday a slower global economy wouldn t need as much oil and the price of crude sank friday along with expectations for demand benchmark u s crude fell 1 percent to settle at 56 07 per barrel brent crude the international standard lost 0 8 percent to close at 65 74 per barrel the sharp decline sent energy companies to double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the s p 500 they ended 2 percent lower also hurting the sector was a decision by norway s 1 trillion wealth fund to dump shares in some oil and gas companies the move would exclude companies that operate solely in exploration or production but it will

recovery of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices during the year as well as the trinidad acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2018 operating and financial results were lower in canada in 2018

provided unused and available borrowings of 401 5 million at december 31 2018 compared to 11 2 million at december 31 2017 up by 390 3 million primarily due to a higher current principal amount under

news national by steve h hanke until february 20 zimbabwe produced a quasi currency it was dubbed a zollar on february 20 the quasi currency became zimbabwe s official currency this new currency is called rtgs dollars and consists of bond notes and rtgs electronic money the rtgs dollars possess legal tender status and will serve as the unit of account for the government s books the official exchange rate for zollar quasi currency had been set at a one to one rate with the united states dollar but now the rtgs dollar will trade at a managed floating exchange rate the rate today is 2 50 per us dollar not par as it used to be so zimbabwe s official exchange rate has experienced a maxi devaluation of 60 that however is not the end of zimbabwe s exchange rate story zimbabwe imposes a plethora of exchange and capital controls on its citizens under these exchange controls private individuals traders and companies must seek permission from the government to buy sell and hold foreign currencies so neither the old zollar nor the new rtgs dollar is freely convertible into a foreign currency in consequence a black market read free market exists indeed whenever there are exchange controls and restrictions on free convertibility black markets always appear at present the black market rate is 5 75 which represents a considerable premium over the official rate of 2 50 rtgs us dollar the black market usually yields a premium over the official rate as it does zimbabwe in some cases the premiums can reach staggering levels for example in 1982 ghana s cedi carried a premium of over 2 000 these premiums are known as black market premiums the black market premium indicates among other things the severity of the controls and restrictions a country imposes on its citizens in the case of zimbabwe the official currency devaluation caused the black market premium to shrink from 456 to 130 as the official rate moved from one rtgs usd to 2 50 so as of now the markets deem that the introduction of the new currency and the maxi devaluation have reduced the severity of controls that drive a wedge between the official and black market exchange rate moreover since the black market premium on foreign exchange is an implicit tax on exports the reduction in the premium means that the export tax resulting from exchange controls has been reduced the chart below contains 22 countries that have black markets in foreign exchange and for which data are available north korea tops the list with a black market premium of 811 this suggests that controls are severe and that an official devaluation will eventually be in the cards venezuela is at the bottom of the list with an unusual negative black market premium this negative premium suggests that market participants think the bolivar will appreciate relative to the greenback and that individuals are willing to pay a premium to obtain bolivars on the black market just why do countries impose restrictions and controls on foreign exchange markets and restrict free convertibility in most cases controls are seen as a way to cool off hot money and conserve official foreign exchange reserves the pedigree of exchange controls can be traced back to plato the father of statism inspired by lycurgus of sparta plato embraced the idea of an inconvertible currency as a means to preserve the autonomy of the state from outside interference so the temptation to turn to exchange controls in the face of disruptions caused by hot money flows is hardly new in the modern era tsar nicholas ii was the first to pioneer limitations on convertibility in 1905 he ordered the state bank of russia to introduce a limited form of exchange control to discourage speculative purchases of foreign exchange the bank did so by refusing to sell foreign exchange except where it could be shown that it was required to buy imported goods otherwise foreign exchange was limited to 50 000 german marks per person the tsar s rationale for exchange controls was that of limiting hot money flows so that foreign reserves and the exchange rate could be maintained as we move to reflect on zimbabwe or any of the other countries in the hanke quarterly black market review we must lift a page from nobel laureate friedrich hayek s 1944 classic the road to serfdom the extent of the control over all life that economic control confers is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of foreign exchanges nothing would at first seem to affect private life less than a state control of the dealings in foreign exchange and most people will regard its introduction with complete indifference yet the experience of most continental countries has taught thoughtful people to regard this step as the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism and the suppression of individual liberty it is in fact the complete delivery of the individual to the tyranny of the state the final suppression of all means of escape not merely for the rich but for everybody hayek s message about convertibility has regrettably been overlooked by many contemporary economists exchange controls are nothing more than a ring fence within which governments can expropriate their subjects property open exchange and capital markets in fact protect the individual from exactions because governments must reckon with the possibility of capital flight from this it follows that the imposition of exchange controls leads to an instantaneous reduction in the wealth of the country because all assets decline in value to see why it is important to understand how assets are priced the value of any asset is the sum of the expected future installments of income it generates discounted to the present value for example the price of a stock represents the value to the investor now of his share of the company s future cash flows whether issued as dividends or reinvested the present value of future income is calculated using an appropriate interest rate that is adjusted for the various risks that the income may not materialise when convertibility is restricted risk increases because property is held hostage and is subject to a potential ransom through expropriation as a result the risk adjusted interest rate employed to value assets is higher than it would be with full convertibility investors are willing to pay less for each dollar of prospective income and the value of property is less than it would be with full convertibility president emmerson mnangagwa has proclaimed that zimbabwe is open for business this refrain rings hollow in the face of zimbabwe s exchange controls and its new currency the rtgs dollar if zimbabwe wants to be open for business and wants its own sound currency it should adopt a currency board that would make zimbabwe s currency a clone of the us dollar or some other suitable anchor such as gold a currency board would mandate that exchange controls be thrown in the dustbin free convertibility would reign and so would low inflation rates and higher asset valuations the open for business sign would be the real deal professor steve h hanke hanke is a professor of applied economics at the

reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 time for some voodoo so after three years of pumping 2 6 trillion euros worth of stimulus and cutting interest rates to minus 0 4 percent the ecb has admitted its growth inflation targets remain elusive and those emergency era monetary settings will have to persist for a lot longer the ecb is not alone doubts abound around the world about whether developed economies have enjoyed lasting benefit or been fully repaired by trillions of dollars of bond buying quantitative easing from central banks over the past decade japan has been in this funk for decades the federal reserve is finding normalization of its policy settings difficult of late slowing economic momentum has seen australia canada and sweden turning tail on policy tightening plans all this speaks loud and clear to the current economic policy zeitgeist a raging debate around mmt or modern monetary theory effectively a reworking of monetary theory by the left of the u s democratic party ahead of next year s elections mmt advocates posit that policymakers in countries fortunate enough to manage the world s main reserve currencies should as long as inflation remains as subdued as it is right now just keep interest rates at zero and print money to invest in environment and infrastructure projects with interest rates near zero and inflation structurally depressed they argue that government deficits and debt levels far higher than the sometimes arbitrary limits set by current orthodox policy can be both sustainable and productive in seeding higher and better quality economic growth in the longer term the idea is akin to british opposition labor leader jeremy corbyn s proposal of people s qe a few years back some politicians across europe too especially among italy s populist coalition government have railed against fiscal orthodoxy as strangling growth many have called on the ecb to support debt funded government reinvestment program mainstream economists such as larry summers dismiss mmt as voodoo and as mmt balks at the idea that bond and currency markets should continue to be allowed to dictate government spending levels and priorities many financial market economists also oppose the notion but as europe shows no one can argue that tried and tested orthodoxy has really worked expect to hear more about a rethink of economic policy theories like this as may s european parliament election approaches and campaigning gets going for 2020 u s presidential elections 2 breaking point three votes in three days the brexit saga returns with a vengeance on march 12 when prime minister theresa may risks another crushing defeat of the deal she s negotiated with the eu another defeat for may who as of friday had no new concessions from brussels to present to parliament could just reignite fears about an eventual no deal brexit outcome it will also deal a blow to the pound that s rallied in recent weeks as this risk was priced out if may loses the vote lawmakers will get to vote on march 13 and 14 to rule out a no deal brexit and on delaying britain s departure depending on whom you ask agreement to delay will either settle nerves or prolong the unknown a reuters poll of economists predicted brexit to be delayed by a few months with a free trade deal eventually agreed but uncertainty is showing up in currency derivatives markets with one month implied volatility capturing the march 29 brexit date at its highest since mid january the pound too has come off recent highs a buyers strike was december s dismal retail sales report in the united states a one off pause in consumer spending caused by the stock market meltdown or was it the start of a trend that question could be answered on monday when january data is released roughly three weeks later than normal after the partial government shutdown in december and january disrupted the data release schedule the figures will be a key signal about how well the u s consumer and economy are standing up to a worldwide slowdown overall sales are seen edging up 0 1 percent in january after dropping 1 2 percent in december the biggest fall since 2009 several subsets of the series saw an even more alarming decline for instance the so called core measure of retail sales slid 1 7 percent for its largest decline since 2001 even against that bleak backdrop the december falloff in online sales was especially weak in the hitherto booming sector the 3 9 percent decline was the largest since the financial crisis and marked the worst december ever for the nonstore category that stands as a proxy for online sales another month of weakness will confirm the storm clouds are gathering and the stimulus impact is well and truly over slow and slower the message that rang loud and clear from china s annual parliament meeting was stability is paramount which is why the authorities kept growth targets within a broad 6 0 6 5 percent range cut taxes but kept fiscal easing well short of 2015 levels and they emphasized yuan stability as a priority yet reading between the lines one might conclude that to keep growth above 6 percent china needs to be flexible about credit growth and deficit targets but after february s 20 percent plus exports contraction and the sharp imports slowdown it seems a matter of when not if benchmark interest rates will be cut upcoming data on industrial output retail sales housing and credit will also come against the backdrop of speculation about what deal u s president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping will eventually reach on those all important trade tariffs 5 re run in em the argentine peso in recent days has led emerging currencies in a race to the bottom plumbing record lows others such as the turkish lira and south african rand have followed closely one culprit is the strong dollar which has surged to its highest level since june 2017 but domestic factors are also to blame aside from problematic politics and high inflation turkey argentina and south africa rely heavily on external financing slowing world growth will weigh on such markets prospects turkey and argentina were also clobbered with economic forecast downgrades by the oecd while south africa s economy too has slowed there are signs investment into emerging equities and bonds is starting to slow it all stirs memories from 2018 when a buoyant first quarter dissolved into selling with turkey and argentina getting walloped by currency crises both countries have since taken steps to recover investors will be wondering whether those are sufficient to stop history repeating

company expects the acquisition to close prior to the commencement of the australian ski season in june 2019 commenting on the company s fiscal 2019 second quarter results rob katz chief executive officer said we are pleased with our overall results for the quarter with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year in the pre holiday period destination guest visitation at our u s resorts was less than expected which we attribute to guest concerns after two prior years of poor pre holiday conditions our destination guest visitation was largely in line with expectations during the key holiday weeks and through the remainder of january throughout the quarter with the favorable conditions at our u s resorts we saw strong visitation growth among our local guests who are primarily pass purchasers our colorado and utah resorts experienced strong visitation during the holidays and through the remainder of the quarter that aligned with our expectations our tahoe resorts and whistler blackcomb saw periods of strong visitation in the holiday and post holiday periods but have also been impacted by numerous weather events that have negatively impacted their results in addition international visitation at whistler blackcomb was below the prior year throughout the quarter our northeast resorts are off to a great start to the season as we continue to benefit from good conditions and the first season with okemo and mount sunapee as a part of our network conditions across the network are set up well for the remainder of the season including results from triple peaks and stevens pass in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 total lift revenue increased 17 2 driven by a 27 0 growth in skier visitation total effective ticket price etp decreased 7 8 in the second quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to higher skier visitation by season pass holders and the impact of the new military epic pass partially offset by price increases in both our lift ticket and season pass products excluding season pass holders etp increased 8 3 compared to the prior year the strong rebound in visitation and spending compared to the prior year along with the addition of triple peaks and stevens pass drove a 15 1 increase in ski school revenue a 21 3 increase in dining revenue and an 11 3 increase in retail rental revenue compared to the prior year regarding the company s lodging segment katz said our lodging results for the second fiscal quarter were positive with revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursements increasing 16 1 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental operations of triple peaks the average daily rate adr decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the inclusion of the triple peaks resorts as well as incremental managed tahoe lodging properties that we did not manage in the prior year all of which generate a lower adr as compared to our broader lodging segment regarding the company s outlook katz said as noted in our january press release we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disappointing results from destination visitation in the pre holiday period and also due to shortfalls from expectations at our tahoe resorts and whistler blackcomb we now expect net income attributable to vail resorts inc for fiscal 2019 to be between 268 million and 300 million and resort reported ebitda for fiscal 2019 to be between 690 million and 710 million which remains generally consistent with our commentary on guidance in january our guidance is predicated on current canadian and australian foreign exchange rates of 0 75 and 0 71 respectively for each currency to the u s dollar for the remainder of the fiscal year which represents an estimated 4 million reduction in resort reported ebitda from the currency rates included in the guidance we issued in september 2018 of which nearly half has been realized year to date the updated guidance incorporates 12 million of acquisition and integration expenses including 2 million for the falls creek and hotham resorts transaction the guidance does not incorporate any expected operating results or stamp duty payments for falls creek and hotham which we plan to update following the closing of the transaction our guidance assumes normal conditions at our resorts and a stable economic environment for the remainder of the fiscal year regarding capital allocation katz said we remain confident in the strong cash flow generation and stability of our business model we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital and remain committed to strategic high return capital projects continuous investment in our people strategic acquisition opportunities and returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchase programs we are pleased to announce that the board of directors has approved a 20 increase to our quarterly dividend and declared a quarterly cash dividend on

indicative measurement of the company s operating performance and is similar to performance metrics generally used by investors to evaluate other companies in the resort and lodging industries the company defines resort ebitda margin as resort reported ebitda divided by resort net revenue the company believes resort ebitda margin is an important measurement of operating performance the company believes that net debt is an important measurement of liquidity as it is an indicator of the company s ability to obtain additional capital resources for its future cash needs additionally the company believes net real estate cash flow is important as a cash flow indicator for its real estate segment see the tables provided in this release for reconciliations of our measures of segment

the european central bank on thursday unveiled a new economic rescue package citing a darkening outlook driven by a slowdown in china fears that the united kingdom will make a chaotic exit from the european union and aftershocks from president trump s tariff wars the mounting worries prompted the bank to cut its growth forecast for 2019 by nearly one third to just above 1 percent ecb president mario draghi also said he would maintain rock bottom interest rates through the end of this year several months longer than previously planned and funnel more credit to banks in hopes of spurring business lending the move came less than three months after european authorities said the 19 nation euro zone economy no longer needed unusual help capping more than a decade long 3 trillion stimulus following the global financial crisis advertisement thursday s about face sounded alarms about a global slowdown that caught officials off guard it s a highly significant move said adam tooze a columbia university historian and author of crashed a history of recent financial crises it s a testament to the anemic quality of europe s recovery and the of the ecb that we ve had to go through this roller coaster for now the united states remains an island of relative stability though federal reserve officials in recent days have voiced concerns that the economic expansion could be fraying the dow jones industrial average fell more than 200 points or nearly 1 percent on the european announcement despite the accumulation of bad news the global economy is still likely to grow this year the bigger concern is that central banks like the ecb have little ammunition to fight a deeper downturn whether triggered by events in europe or elsewhere advertisement european interest rates are already negative meaning that banks actually pay authorities in frankfurt to hold their deposits in the united states the fed s benchmark lending rate is less than one half what it was on the eve of the global financial crisis so chair jerome h powell would have little room to cut rates to spur growth if a recession occurs what s scary is this is the ecb signaling they are running out of ammo said adam posen a former member of the bank of england s monetary policy committee if we overshoot into a genuine recession that s why i get genuinely freaked out if that happens european monetary authorities will have the greatest difficulty the federal reserve and the people s bank of china are in relatively better shape he added fed officials have changed their thinking about how high interest rates should be when the economy is purring at an ideal pace one that doesn t need to be accelerated or cooled down advertisement before the financial crisis the fed believed that inflation adjusted neutral rate was 3 percent today it s probably around 1 percent the likelihood that rates will often be lower than in the past even when the economy is growing at its potential limits the amount of space available for cutting the federal fund rate to buffer the economy from adverse developments lael brainard a member of the fed s board of governors said thursday in a speech at princeton university if needed the fed could resume its bond purchases known as quantitative easing share this article share along with such monetary tools the united states could raise spending or cut taxes to fight rising unemployment the trump administration already cut taxes by 1 5 trillion in 2017 helping drive the national debt to nearly 22 trillion advertisement so far even as the public debt swells financial markets have been willing to lend the government as much as it wants borrowing costs measured by the 2 6 percent yield on the 10 year treasury security are less than one half the 50 year average investors may not remain so sanguine indefinitely for now the economy is humming job growth in the united states remains robust with employers hiring nearly 240 000 workers each month over the past year small businesses broke a 45 year old record for job creation in february according to the national federation of independent business brainard cited recent statistics on retail sales consumer confidence and residential construction that suggested a softening of economic activity the economy in the first quarter has all but stalled growing at an annual rate of just 0 5 percent according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta s gdpnow forecast advertisement weakness abroad reverberates in the united states through lower orders for american exports and financial market volatility she added more than 40 percent of sales by companies in the standard poor s 500 stock index a key stock market benchmark come from overseas we are more vulnerable than what people are suggesting said torsten slok chief international economist for deutsche bank indeed in paris on wednesday laurence boone chief economist for the 36 nation organization for economic cooperation and development gave a downbeat assessment of the global outlook before cutting her forecasts for the global economy and every advanced nation it does not look very good boone said global growth looked really good in 2017 but it has slowed markedly since then her formal presentation carried a stark warning vulnerabilities in china europe and financial markets could derail the global economy advertisement tensions from the trade war between the united states and china along with uncertainty over the u k s planned brexit have sapped consumer and business confidence china where government leaders have been trying to wean the economy from its addiction to debt fueled growth also is slowing more sharply than had been anticipated in the fourth quarter world trade volume fell by 0 9 percent its worst performance since 2009 according to the cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis the ecb s actions indicate that the authorities expect economic weakness to persist for at least a year according to carl weinberg chief international economist at high frequency economics they re a little bit more worried than dr draghi has let on weinberg told clients on a thursday webinar the global downturn reflects a buildup in business inventories and should be short and shallow weinberg said all recessions do not have to result in a financial crisis still dan alpert

remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the korn ferry s third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode following the prepared remarks we will conduct a question and answer session as a reminder this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes we have also made available in the investor relations section of our website at kornferry com a copy of the financial presentation that we will be reviewing with you today advertisement advertisement before i turn the call over to our host mr gary burnison let me first call read a cautionary statement to investors certain statements made in today s call such as those relating to future performance plans and goals constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although the company believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected or desired because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are beyond the company s control additional information concerning risks and uncertainties can be found in the release relating to this presentations and in the periodic reports filed by the company with the sec including the company s annual report for fiscal year 2018 also some of the comments today may reference non gaap financial measures such as adjusted fee revenue constant currency amounts ebitda and adjusted ebitda additional information concerning these measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is contained in the financial presentation and earnings release related to this call both of which are posted in the investor relations section of the company s website at www kornferry com with that i ll turn the conference over to mr burnison please go ahead advertisement advertisement gary burnison chief executive officer okay thank you anna good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us i would say that the quarter was very good for korn ferry we grew the top line 10 at constant currency and the profitability was outstanding this is my 67th earnings call it kind of feels like number six but today korn ferry is a much much different company we are an organizational consultancy that helps companies look at their talent and strategy together most clients can come up with a sound strategy but many struggle to make it stick because their talent strategy they re not in sync and that s exactly where we come in we help companies make sure that they have the right people in the right places for the right rewards that bring their strategy to life how do we do that well we do it by redesigning their org structure by helping them hire and hold onto the best people with the right skills and mind set for the future and also most importantly by motivating the people to not just fulfilled but to exceed their potential and as i ve said before strategy without talent is hopeless but talent without strategy is helpless and we connect those dots that s what korn ferry does and so on the 67th earnings call i see a substantially different company today than even two or three years ago with a completely different profile number one we re 50 bigger more than half of our revenues now generated from outside the us 61 of our colleagues are women 53 are millennial and only 14 of us are baby boomers our advisory business is over 800 million in revenue which alone is bigger than any other search firm and in fact it s about the size of our entire firm 10 years ago and most importantly i think we ve got a much more balanced and less cyclical company an evolution that s taken place all while our flagship search business has thrived it operates at the highest level and you would look to that not by hyperbole but you d actually look at your average fee and our average fee is 125 000 and we re generating more revenue by far than any industry competitor advertisement advertisement this company today is not a cyclic binge or bust company we re now a firm for all seasons whether the challenge is globalization cost synergies m a digital transformation we can help organizations make an impact in any kind of economic environment and the breadth and depth of our company is substantial our organizational strategy capabilities it s about 11 of the company today with that we help companies align their strategy with their people to their organizational structure our succession and assessment offerings we help clients close the gap between the talent they have and the talent they need nearly 50 million people have been assessed by korn ferry the assessment and succession offerings represent about 12 of our firm every year we develop 1 2 million executives we have almost 1 000 colleagues every single day the only thing they re doing is leadership development that accounts for about 10 of the company s footing we have reward data on 25 million people we know what it takes to keep your best talent our rewards business is about 10 of the company so we absolutely have the foundation for a multi billion revenue opportunity so the real question is well what do you do to get there and it has to start outside and it has to start with pursuing enduring scalable meaningful client relationships engagements that deliver measurable results for our clients today about 18 of our clients utilize more than one line of business so we got a lot of runway with the remaining 80 but specifically we got to relentlessly focus on five areas one the centerpiece has to be the approach to client development and it starts with our marquee accounts those companies where we have a strong opportunity for impact today those clients represent about 20 of the company the growth rate for those marquee accounts have been twice the rate of the remaining portfolio and as part of our one kf strategy that we announced last summer we are now in the process of expanding this account program to another 200 regional accounts which is approximately about another 200 million of revenue we re going to continue to develop and add account leaders to ensure that we bring the full weight of the firm to these clients and gain more wallet share secondly we ve guided take those single the smaller clients so we got to make them doubles and triples we re doing that practically right now through solution training and again as part of the one kf initiative last month we kicked off a firm wide program to educate every single colleague in the company at every level about all of our solutions we have over 100 trainers with about 330 sessions already scheduled across the globe today advertisement advertisement the third piece of the growth strategy is the product business when you look at advisory that 820 million 840 million business today on a run rate basis two thirds of it is consulting and one third of it is product so it s about a 250 million product business today those products are much less cyclical they are substantially profitable and we ve got the opportunity to scale that fourth as you know m a has been a pretty consistent pillar we re continuing to explore opportunities at the intersection of talent in strategy and then the final piece is about our own people i spent a full two days with colleague advisory council almost 50 people from around the world at all levels and we have to have a commitment to developing our own talent and providing growth opportunities for everybody and at the same time we have to continue to bring in world class consultants and then finally in addition to the m a we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital year to date we ve allocated about 18 million to dividends and 37 million to share

review the operating segments in more detail advertisement advertisement gregg kvochak investor relations thanks bob despite calendar year and holiday seasonality fee revenue for executive search continue to grow in the third quarter improving to over 193 million globally compared year over year and measure at actual exchange rates global executive search fee revenue grew 13 million or 7 2 in third quarter and 10 measured at constant currency growth for our executive search segment remained broad based at constant currency north america was up 12 europe was up 3 asia pacific was up 10 and latin america was up 34 by specialty market growth was mixed in the third quarter compared to the third quarter a year ago at actual exchange rates our financial services and technology practices were

advisory in the third quarter global fee revenue for advisory reached 201 5 million which was up 6 year over year measured at constant currency by geographic region growth in the third quarter was strongest in both the europe and asia pacific regions similar to executive search the advisory segment was impacted by year end holiday seasonality were fewer working days resulted in fewer billable hours with clients as previously mentioned to start calendar year 2019 global new business awards accelerated for advisory january new business was up nearly 11 year over year providing a solid backlog to begin the fourth quarter advisory earnings and profitability trends also remained strong in the third quarter adjusted ebitda for advisory was 38 2 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 18 9 advertisement advertisement finally turning to rpo and professional search we re in the third quarter growth continued at double digit pace the rpo and professional search segment generated 79 6 million of fee revenue in the third quarter which was up 19 4 year over year at constant currency all geographic regions continued to grow double digits in the third quarter led by north america and asia pacific which were up 23 and 20 respectively at constant currency as previously mentioned in the third quarter the rpo and professional search segment secured a total of 104 million of new business consisting of 78 million of larger long term rpo assignments and 26 million of smaller shorter term professional search assignments earnings also improved sharply in the third quarter for the rpo and professional search segment ebitda in the third quarter was 13 1 million with an ebitda margin of 16 4 which were both up sharply year over year now i ll turn the call back over to bob to discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter fiscal 19 robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer great thanks greg following the seasonally slower month of december new business activity to begin calendar year 2019 has ramp back up january and february new business across all our operating segments has been strong providing us with a solid backlog to start the fourth quarter which in a typically year is our seasonally strongest quarter for executive search global new business awards in the month of january and february combined were up 6 year over year with growth in every region if monthly new business patterns are consistent with prior years we expect march to be one of the best months for new business this fiscal year and that we will finish the year with a solid april advertisement advertisement for advisory the fiscal fourth quarter is also typically a seasonally stronger quarter where both backlog and new business awards combined with more hours with clients to execute assignments drives a quarter of strong revenue to start the fourth quarter advisory global new business awards for the month of january february combined were up 6 year over year with regards to rpo and professional search a number of large rpo contracts early the backlog are ramping up in the fourth quarter and the pipeline of potential new business opportunities remained strong we expect both of those facts to combine on a combined basis will drive a stronger quarter of revenue growth considering these factors and assuming worldwide economic conditions financial markets foreign exchange rates remained steady and assuming a 25 26 effective tax rate for the quarter we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 to range from 485 million to 505 million and we expect our consolidated diluted earnings per share to range from 0 85 to 0 93 when comparing to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year it should be noted that our fourth quarter revenue guidance reflects a significantly stronger us dollar relative to a number of currencies including the british pound and the euro finally the amortization of retention bonuses associated with a hay group acquisition over three years ago ended in december of 2018 therefore in the fourth quarter there will no longer be adjustments to earnings per share presented under us gaap for this item that concludes our prepared remarks and we re glad to take any questions that you may have questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from tobey sommer with suntrust please go ahead joseph charles suntrust analyst hi this is joseph charles ph on for tobey sommer this evening i have one quick question about consultant productivity last quarter i think you referenced that consultant productivity is lot higher in the us than it is in a lot of the other countries in which you operate are there any particular regions or industries that you d like to highlight that you think you still have runway for growth thank you gary burnison chief executive officer well i think first overall when you say consultant productivity i don t know if you re talking about our consulting business joseph charles suntrust analyst executive search consultants gary burnison chief executive officer the executive search consultants today it s about the overall global average is about 1 4 million or so average fee per assignments 125 000 obviously we have a much a far reaching footprint probably more level than any other search firm so when you look at regions around the world you re going to find a great disparity in the level of executive pay so our fee and our productivity is going to vary substantially from mexico to china to ecuador to belgium to the united states and i would just say that when you look at it the overall average of 1 4 million there is clearly room for productivity now whether that is 15 whether that s 20 i m not going to put an exact number but clearly there s still headroom there joseph charles suntrust analyst got it and do you see that headroom more so in the developing markets you re in or the developed markets you re in thank you gary burnison chief executive officer sorry no it s look it s in both i mean just look at when i started at this place the i think the average search fee was like i don t know 55 000 or 60 000 today we re at 125 000 a part of that has been wage growth part of it has been our strategy but if you just look at the underlying dynamics what are you seeing well you re seeing career nomads so new people coming out of college are going to work for 30 different employers so there is going to be more and more churn so i think that both bodes very well for this company over the long term in the united states there is 7 million unfilled jobs i mean there is a ton of jobs out there high skilled good paying jobs we re seeing that in our rpo and professional search business where the demand for talent is robust and people are finding they are having to pay much more for talented people than what they thought joseph charles suntrust analyst got you operator our next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse please go ahead kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst great thanks hi gary or bob kind of heading into the last kind of inflection point in the cycle you folks did a real nice job of kind of acquiring assets that really prove to really differentiate the firm through this up cycle any thoughts on that just within the context of boosting the buyback because it seems like a pretty sizable step up in the buyback just any thoughts on that relative to the acquisition strategy is that just a function of you got the footprint you need just any thoughts on that would be super helpful gary burnison chief executive officer we re going to continue to we ve followed a pretty consistent playbook we ve made 10 acquisitions over a 10 year period of time and we are continuing to follow that playbook and so we have to have a balanced approach to capital we have to think of stakeholders we have to think of our clients we have to think of our colleagues and we have to think of our shareholders and we ve got to make sure we ve got the right balance so we did think that the buyback we only had about 50 million left and so we thought it prudent to raise that so i think you re going to see us have a very balanced approach to capital deployment but now we very much have an appetite to make investments that would increase our breadth and depth robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer and kevin this is bob kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst hi bob robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer just put a little bit more hi how are you doing a little more color on it when we first put the buyback authorization in place back in 2014 it was roughly somewhere between 10 12 of our market cap and so the number that we re at today is roughly the same obviously we re a bigger company today and hence you get the larger authorization amount kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst and then maybe bob just any thoughts on within the context of the q4 guidance what gets you to the upper end of the range versus the low end and conversely on the eps just any kind of factors that would kind of swing it toward the upper end or the lower end robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer yeah i think the as we sit here today what s going to push us toward the upper end of the range is our ability to convert our advisory backlog into revenue is one factor they ve had strong new business in q2 strong new business in this past quarter q3 and what we re seeing is as they sell larger engagements the conversion to revenue takes a little bit longer we ve also seen a bit of a change in mix in that business where the leadership development is a higher proportion of the mix and that takes a little bit longer so our ability to actively manage proactively manage that and convert it to revenue is one area and i think the other area that s going to get us to the higher end of the range is in the rpo business they ve sold a number of large engagements that were standing up now so our ability to execute against those successfully will help us get there as well kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst got it and then any sense of any color on kind of upticks across any segments or any thoughts around that gary burnison chief executive officer yeah we haven t seen much change in executive search in upticks it s been pretty consistent i mean over the past couple of years they ve drifted up but not remarkably we re seeing a little bit more uptick activity on the positive side is in the professional search area again that it s not remarkably different but we re starting to see a little bit of upward advancement in professional search kevin mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst you bet thank you operator our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs please go ahead george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good afternoon you indicated that your marquee accounts are growing at twice the rate of the overall business and that you re expanding the program to another 200 regional accounts which would yield another 200 million in revenues can you elaborate on the rollout of this expanded program and the timing of when this 200 million in incremental revenues will be achieved gary burnison chief executive officer well the 200 million in revenue is from those existing it s the run rate so it s from the existing portfolio of regional accounts today so today we ve got 100 marquee accounts and that represents about 20 of the company s overall footings we re now expanding that to include another couple hundred accounts where we would have dedicated account leaders people that we are either recruiting from outside the firm that have account management responsibility experience or promoting from within and so today the run rate on those 200 accounts without real dedicated account ownership would be 200 million so you could look at the whole piece of the dedicated account program and say today ok that s something like 600 million or 30 of the overall company so you would think about the growth from that kind of starting point and definitely the marquee accounts the performance of those accounts the growth of those accounts has outperformed the rest of the portfolio george tong goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful in the advisory business the growth there decelerated from 11 8 constant currency in fiscal 2q to 6 this quarter can you help unpack the quarter specifically if there were certain onetime items that weighed on growth and if not what strategies you have to accelerate the growth robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer yeah i think george this is bob how you are doing i think the if you go back to how we responded to kevin s question the conversion of backlog into revenue as we move our solutions to larger scalable solutions does take a bit longer so that had some impact and as the change in mix of leadership development again takes a bit longer to convert so that had some impact and then the only other piece is if you look at the number of days in way that the holidays fell this year we had one less business day so they had obviously if you re not working you can t judge your time and generate revenue george tong goldman sachs analyst got it any other active strategies you have to improve the growth performance there because it sounds like the exit rate for january february sounds relatively comparable at 6 in terms of new business trends gary burnison chief executive officer yeah no it s i would say it s ok i mean am i satisfied with the growth no but when you look at it today you ve got an 820 million advisory business that 10 years ago was a 10th of the size but i think when you look at it at a moment in time and you say ok well what do you have to believe how did you get there well you look at the components we ve got an organizational strategy component that s 10 of the company that has to be a much bigger percentage being able to link business strategy with organizational strategy so that has absolute runway the assessment and succession is about 12 we ve got a lot of different instruments and we ve assessed 50 million people we can do anything from simulations to onsite i mean we ve got it we ve got great ip there if we were to pick something up that s fine but we re not out purposefully looking for that the leadership development area if you look at the market opportunity that s the biggest area i mean when you look at hr services that is a substantial market and so for us today that s call it a couple hundred million dollar business i mean that s got a lot of headroom then the other piece is rewards which again is about 10 and so when you look at the business one of the things that we have to solve for is to moving to bigger more impactful engagements and so today you ll find a lot of the volume is actually sub six digit engagements and a lot of that comes from the heritage of assessments and so we re doing thousands of assessments and so you have to believe that you can move that portfolio toward bigger more impactful assignments and so when you look this last quarter at the dollar volume 50 of the new business was for engagements that were over 500 000 so that s something you have to believe the whole reason for the account strategy i mean is for this very reason is we have incredible relationships we re dealing with 10 000 clients a year but the reality is only 18 of those are using us for one thing so you ve got to have a purposeful strategy with dedicated leaders that are working those clients all the time that are walking the halls that has to be something that you really have to believe in and you ve got to execute and then finally when i come to the north american market we ve got fabulous people we don t have enough people i mean just plain and simple so the market opportunity is absolutely there and we ve demonstrated that we can cross introduce people from different parts of the organization the solution training that we re doing is the whole reason for that solution training is to get at the very question that you ask george tong goldman sachs analyst very helpful thank you operator our next question is from tim mchugh from william blair please go ahead trevor romeo william blair analyst hi thanks it s actually trevor romeo in for tim thanks for taking the question so first just wanted to clarify are those new business growth rates you provided for january and february in constant currency or is that reported growth and how much of an impact are you expecting from currency in the fourth quarter gary burnison chief executive officer yeah so the first question it is an actual dollars the rates that we quoted if you go back and you look at sort of q4 of last year the rates that were in place at that point in time and you kind of compare that to what we did for january we did it for february rate and it s about a 4 percentage point impact trevor romeo william blair analyst okay got it thank you and then it seems like your revenue in europe has held up fairly well despite kind of some of the softer economic data lately so what is your assessment of the demand environment there given some of that recent economic weakness gary burnison chief executive officer i think that s one of the strengths of the company today is that when people say the brand korn ferry you kind of think of one thing but the reality is the portfolio is way more balanced today than it was say a decade ago so you ve got a products business that is definitely going to be less cyclical for sure so you ve got a different profile and even when you look at it you know you look at it on a regional basis you would draw that same conclusion and so even like look at new business in china in february yes search was down a little bit but guess what we were up overall because we had a couple other parts of the business that made up for it the european business i think is probably what i m most proud of it s an incredible business and the uk believe it or not i mean the uk in the quarter grew this is again constant currency but i think it s the most comparable way to do it it was up 14 in the quarter so which you would find very very hard to believe so i think it s the balanced nature of the portfolio between the consulting business the products business the rpo and the search business in europe there was weakness in france that you would probably guess even on a total portfolio basis but the uk has held up better than you would have thought trevor romeo william blair analyst okay great thanks and then maybe if i could just sneak in one more have you seen any meaningful change in turnover in the advisory segment since the hay group retention program ended gary burnison chief executive officer no that the business there is going to looks like the firm does today it s completely different so you ve got an employee base that today is now 53 millennial and so for the company overall that s why we re on college campuses now recruiting them and then we just had our winter start class we put them through eight weeks of training consistent training around the entire solution footprint of the organization they just graduated a couple days ago that s why we re ramping that up in a very big way because i really think that for young people coming out of graduate or undergrad they re going to be career nomads and the challenge for any company is to identify the high potentials to develop them and that s a business opportunity actually for us trevor romeo william blair analyst okay thank you that s all very helpful operator our next question comes from greg mendez with baird please go ahead gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst hi thanks this is a greg on for mark marcon thanks for taking the question i guess first just going back to the talent piece that you ve been discussing gary with what you guys are accomplishing and building how are you thinking about just the mix of the talent that you need to add you mentioned folks coming from college but the balance between experienced versus new new and then given the labor environment how tough is it to find right now you know those experienced folks gary burnison chief executive officer yeah it s definitely look it s tough i mean there s no doubt about that i think that the one of the things that we re very very focused on is bringing people that have account management experience so that has we ve got a big focus on that today and that s something we re going have to do i think secondly we have an eye on consulting talent that can sell and deliver bigger more impactful engagements in other words they can sell the integrated solution so that the crossover between org strategy assessment succession leadership development and more integrative business outcome solutions then the final piece that we have to get right is promoting from within because this does need to look like a professional services firm where where you do hire lots of people off graduate or undergraduate campuses and give them the right kind of development and the right kind of opportunity to grow and so that s not only for the consultants it s for the entire organization but we have to have a real orientation on that that s why we ve got all these solution training sessions scheduled to this day we ve got 330 of them scheduled it s to give everybody to try to give everybody a lens into pivot points around clients how to broaden the conversation and all that gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst that s great and on the profitability side you ve done a really good job of continuing to expand the margins with a focus on marquee with the focus on product as we see that subscription model build over the coming quarters i mean how assuming the economy stays where it s at how do you think about profitability then over the next two three years or maybe just the aspiration if we can guess product goes to 40 or 50 of advisory for example and we see the continued strength in the from marquee accounts gary burnison chief executive officer yeah the way that we it is about the way we kind of manage our activities is we have this concept we call flow through and we look at things on an incremental basis and so as an overall company if our margins in this quarter were 16 4 so on the incremental revenues that we generate if we re not driving margins on those dollars at the 20 25 then we re not growing our profitability so we set targets for the whole company as well as for each individual line of business because they re all they have different profit profiles but we manage to the flow through and generally rule of thumb i would set it somewhere between 20 and 25 overall for the company gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst okay great and then just my last question i know you did the rebranding in a few other countries in january that continues to go on just any update there on that initiative gary burnison chief executive officer now listen i think it continues to and we ve got a playbook that it s like when we did the hay acquisition put a playbook in place in the integration i mean it was a lot of hard work but it went without a hitch and that s what we re seeing on the one korn ferry initiatives that we ve got under way i mean the legal entity rationalization which is what you just referred to we did six countries we re in the process of doing another seven or eight countries now and we ve got it down to a science and so there s no i ll say just continuing and again a lot of hard work but we re not encountering any real issues that are sticking points gregory mendez robert w baird co analyst great thanks a lot operator and our next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti please go ahead marc riddick sidoti analyst hi good afternoon gary burnison chief executive officer hi marc marc riddick sidoti analyst quick question i guess maybe a pivot toward some of the things that we saw with financial services i was wondering if you could share some thoughts there because it certainly seemed as though at least from year over year perspective that those were very strong words there and then maybe if you could sort of touch a little bit on what that the that sort of continued as far as i mean growth that outpaced the rest of the company and then i had a couple of follow ups there gary burnison chief executive officer well when you look at the quarter i mean clearly that too from an industry perspective year over year you would look to financial services and technology and both of those were actually they were good and the advisory the financial service was pretty good then the advisory but actually both of them were driven in north america and were driven by search so in particular financial services we ve got an incredible commercial banking business investment banking business asset management and so there s not any single large engagement so i wouldn t point anything that was wow this is kind of one off or anything but it was good growth in north american search marc riddick sidoti analyst is it fair to think about the pace of part of the business being as strong as it is to think that back of continued into the beginning of this quarter gary burnison chief executive officer i don t have the confirms broken down by february i ll tell you overall for the search business it was kind of up 10 i want to say right in february it is right so we don t i don t have it broken down by industry again i think it s kind of the and hopefully we re building a company that is not binge or bust and that one part can kind of compensate for another that kind of growth i would not at all quarter on quarter i wouldn t kind of factor that in by any means marc riddick sidoti analyst okay that s fair and then i was wondering if you could touch a little bit going back to the ambition of expanding to another 200 accounts under another marquee program i was wondering if there s sort of a similarity or differences that you would call out as to the mix of that customers and maybe what it might look like whether it s be it industry vertical or geographic or is there any type of mix differential for that next 200 accounts that we should be thinking about gary burnison chief executive officer well there is definitely a series of screens that were run against the 10 000 clients that we have and so there was a very systematic process and so out of the 10 000 we picked another couple hundred more where we really believe we have the opportunity for impact there wasn t any and it would follow a pretty much follow the geographic distribution of the company there wasn t any there wasn t something that was over weighted in terms of geography we hope to see more out of asia so i would i have a personal bias there but i wouldn t say there was anything over weighted from an industry perspective no i mean there are some practicalities i mean our life sciences business is unbelievable i mean we re it s almost 17 18 of the company something like that it s got incredible penetration i mean we have to be mindful just how far that can go so maybe there was going to be a little bit less in life science but that would really be about it at a very very high level marc riddick sidoti analyst okay great and then last one from me i was wondering if you could just sort of give us a bit of an update on capex year to date and what you might be looking at for full year thanks robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer marc it s bob our capex year to date and that includes stuff we re doing on the it platform what we re doing lease holds as well as some of the investors who make it into the products area to date it s somewhere around 35 million that i would expect on a run rate basis to continue through the course of the rest of this year we re just kicking off our annual operating plan process for fiscal 20 right now and so we ll set our thinking around capital for next year as we go through that process but i wouldn t expect there to be a dramatic change up or down at this point in time assuming the economy everything holds as we see it today marc riddick sidoti analyst okay great i appreciate thank you very much robert rozek chief financial officer executive vice president and chief corporate officer yeah operator that appears there are no further questions mr burnison please go ahead for any

on the struggles of america s working class and the rise of donald trump the number crunchers often get confused they ll say there s no crisis of economic mobility they ll say there s no stagnation of wages among blue collar workers and in the realm of politics they ll say that donald trump s base while reacting to his proclamation that the american dream was dead had no legitimate grievances that s because the number crunchers too often see individuals in too abstract a context as rows or cells on a spreadsheet to be sorted by individual traits such as age sex or income they fail to see people as they actually live in places as members of a community with a particular location on our globe it s the fatal abstraction once we look at people in places we see a much more complicated picture we see that many parts of america have incredible economic mobility but many regions are dreadful on that score we see that the places most affected by trade with china have seen serious wage drops and unemployment spikes for blue collar men and plenty of worse consequences that follow and we see that even if donald trump s earliest supporters were doing fine on paper they were living in places that were not doing fine start with how trade affects certain places in america the free market story of free trade says that all involved nations benefit when they reduce trade barriers between them this is true the united states economy as a whole is richer thanks to freer trade by one estimate our economy made an extra 2 trillion from trade liberalization since the 1950s but free trade was always going to produce some losers in the u s low skilled workers in manufacturing suffer because that manufacturing shifts to cheaper overseas locales the lower prices of goods though free up consumer money to spend on new goods or services to be produced presumably by the ex factory workers even if at a slightly lower wage never gonna be anything here visit the monongahela valley where the wheeling pittsburgh steel factory used to operate though and you ll see things didn t work out that way main street in fayette city is crumbling andrew duda sr used to work at the steel mill he was at vargo s newsstand practically the only business open on main street when i visited in 2016 just drive down through the river roads his son andrew duda jr said from here through monessen it s all shut down areas like this the clerk at vargo s piped in there s never gonna be anything here the senior duda an old union guy used to be a democrat but in 2016 he was fully behind trump when trump talks about the trade deals he s a hundred percent right that nafta that was the worst thing even before nafta and china s entry into the world trade organization international competition helped kill the wheeling pittsburgh plant and countless others the result wasn t merely lower wages in the mon valley it was economic and social devastation including high unemployment more men on disability more drug abuse and even more babies out of wedlock trade shocks hit some places hard economist david autor of mit focusing on the later more dramatic trade shock caused by china found rather than modestly reducing wage levels among low skill workers nationally these shocks catalyze significant falls in employment rates within trade impacted local labor markets autor has also found that the places in america exposed to competition with chinese manufacturing also saw more deaths more men on disability and less marriage that is the u s economy got cheaper goods and some factory towns got destroyed economist raj chetty has produced very different studies with a very similar theme where you live dramatically effects how you end up places themselves have causal impacts is how economist melissa kearney summed it up economic mobility is not really decreasing in america most of the numbers show some economists hold this up as evidence that the working class and poor aren t really stuck but chetty dug into the numbers on a local level and found very uneven levels of opportunity and mobility america may still be the land of opportunity he found but it s really many lands of opportunity and many other lands of hopelessness chetty writes intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the u s a kid born into the bottom quintile in salt lake city has an excellent chance one in ten of reaching the top quintile that same kid born in charlotte has only a 4 4 chance families and communities matter what distinguishes the places with the best mobility from those with the worst school spending or progressive taxation don t make much of a difference the data suggests the two biggest factors are the percentage of kids raised by intact families and the area s score on measures of social capital civic participation number of churches amount of volunteering and so on that is places with strong communities and strong families provide the most opportunity finally there s the question of trump my new book alienated america explores why people believe the american dream is dead and how that belief contributed to trump s instant explosion onto the political scene in mid 2015 different studies of trump s core voters turned up different results we found little evidence to suggest individual economic distress benefited trump one typical study proclaimed one study at vox com explained that science disproved the common sentiment that poor white americans came out in droves to put trump over the top in 2016 but a different study published at fivethirtyeight found trump significantly outperformed romney in counties where residents had lower credit scores and in counties where more men have stopped working the same researcher found more subprime loans more trump support more residents receiving disability payments more trump support lower earnings among full time workers more trump support plenty others found the same thing so how to explain the difference between the studies that found economic woe behind trump s win and those that found nothing of the sort the studies that denied the connection between economic woe and trump were studies of individuals the studies that saw that connection were studies of places it can be easy if you live in a well connected community in a thriving locality as so many of our academics commentators and politicians do and if you only study the topline aggregate data to miss what s going on beneath the surface and on the other side of the tracks the true story of america today is that we are a great country with many struggling places

more than offset by the impact of the ramp up of automotive production and the higher cost structure of the lewisport facility as we absorb costs previously considered start up expense in addition

million which consisted of approximately 353 million of availability under our abl facility 109 million of cash on hand and 7 million of cash restricted for the payment of the china loan facility both our borrowing base and abl facility utilization may fluctuate on a monthly basis due in part to changes in seasonal working capital and aluminum prices north america north america segment income

respectively as a result of favorable demand and improved operating performance and our continuous cast operations continued to deliver solid productivity gains and improved operational performance however these improvements were more than offset by wage inflation significantly higher freight costs and unfavorable productivity at our lewisport facility productivity at the lewisport facility was affected by the automotive ramp up the absorption of costs previously considered start up expense and a cost structure designed for a manufacturing rate at which the facility is not yet producing we

agreement subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions there can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated on the expected timing or at all full year results key financial highlights for the year ended december 31 2018 include revenues of 3 446 million compared to 2 857 million for the prior year period the increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes particularly in the global automotive and global aerospace end uses as well as the north america building and construction and distribution end uses higher average aluminum prices included in

higher adjusted ebitda a favorable change in unrealized gains on derivatives a decrease in the provision for income taxes and lower start up costs the majority of which have been absorbed in adjusted

provided by operating activities totaled 22 million in the current year compared to cash used by operating activities of 31 million in 2017 the current year cash provided by operating activities relates to 86 million of cash from earnings offset by cash used to fund a 64 million increase in net operating assets the increase in net operating assets was primarily due to higher inventory resulting from increased aluminum prices and the ramp up of production in lewisport partially offset by increased deferred revenue associated with 60 million of capacity reservation fees received in the first half of 2018 in the current year compared to cash used by operating activities of in 2017 the current year cash provided by operating activities relates to of cash from earnings offset by

in partially offset by increased deferred revenue associated with of capacity reservation fees received in the first half of 2018 capital expenditures decreased to 108 million from 208 million in the prior year period as the north america abs project has been substantially completed full year outlook for 2019 we expect that segment income and adjusted ebitda will be higher than 2018 as north america volumes continue to benefit from the mix shift to higher value added abs products and stable u s housing industry conditions while global aerospace volumes are expected to benefit from a return to growth and higher volumes from our new multi year contracts in addition beginning in 2019 common alloy products made by our north america segment are expected to benefit from recent duties imposed on imported common alloy products we expect full year capital expenditures of approximately 120 million to 140 million as a result of these factors we expect to generate positive cash flow in

required by law non gaap financial measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with gaap this press release includes information regarding certain non gaap financial measures management uses ebitda adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and commercial margin collectively the non gaap measures as performance metrics and believes these measures provide additional information commonly used by the holders of the 2023 junior priority notes and parties to our term loan facility and the abl facility with respect to the ongoing performance of our underlying business activities as well as our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital needs in addition ebitda with certain adjustments is a component of certain covenants under the credit agreement governing the term loan facility and the indenture governing the 2023 junior priority notes adjusted ebitda including the impact of metal price lag is a component of certain financial covenants under the credit agreement governing the abl facility management also uses commercial margin as a performance metric and believes that it provides useful information regarding the performance of our segments because it measures the price at which we sell our aluminum products above the hedged cost of the metal and the effects of metal price lag thereby reflecting the value added components of our commercial activities independent of aluminum prices which we cannot control our ebitda calculations represent net income and loss before interest income and expense provision for and benefit from

derivative financial instruments restructuring charges currency exchange gains and losses on debt stock based compensation expense start up costs loss on extinguishment of debt impairment of amounts held in escrow related to the sale of the recycling business and certain other gains and losses segment adjusted ebitda represents adjusted ebitda on a per segment basis ebitda as defined in the credit agreement governing the term loan facility and the indenture governing the 2023 junior priority notes also limits the amount of adjustments for cost savings operational improvement and synergies for the purpose of determining our compliance with such covenants adjusted ebitda as defined under the abl facility also limits the amount of adjustments for restructuring charges and requires additional adjustments be made if certain annual pension funding levels are exceeded commercial margin represents revenues less the hedged cost of metal and the effects of metal price lag the non gaap measures as we use them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies we calculate the non gaap financial measures by eliminating the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other items you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental

this article was first published 5 years ago if we play our cards right we may even benefit from the competition between the us and china as seen from increased investment from each of these countries into india the size of our market gives us an important lever of power which we shall have to play adroitly and intelligently points out ambassador gautam bambawale who served as india s envoy to china in the professor v m dandekar memorial lecture 2019 delivered on march 8 2019 in pune illustration uttam ghosh rediff com professor s b mujumdar chancellor and founder of symbiosis international professor rajani gupte vice chancellor of symbiosis international professor hrishikesh soman principal of the symbiosis college of arts and commerce ladies and gentlemen i thank you for inviting me to deliver this year s professor v m dandekar memorial lecture it is a great pleasure as well as an honour to be able to do so especially since i was a student of professor dandekar at the gokhale institute of politics and economics here in pune who then flew the coop so to say and instead of pursuing a doctorate in economics which would have been the preferred option of my teachers i strayed into being a diplomat for india in this capacity i have been away from pune for almost 35 years during the last few of those 35 years i have had the honor of serving india as her ambassador to bhutan and china as well as her high commissioner to pakistan so if professor dandekar had been alive today he would have looked at my return to my roots in pune as somewhat of a return of the prodigal when we think back about professor v m dandekar we remember him not merely for his intellect and erudition his wit and his perseverance as well as the constant mischievous glint in his eyes but the most outstanding characteristic he brought to bear in whatever he did was his sense of commitment and passion which seemed to all of us then to become ever stronger with each passing day i for one recollect the passion with which he taught us the neo ricardian economics of the late italian scholar piero sraffa while imparting his instructions to us not only did he convey his deep understanding of the subject at hand but much more importantly he radiated with passion and enthusiasm for many of sraffa s propositions later he brought the same passion in establishing the indian school of political economy not far from this campus both the gokhale institute as well as the indian school are today institutions of great learning and eminence in our city of pune so my message to all the young men and women present here today especially students of the symbiosis college of arts and commerce is that please be passionate about whatever it is that you decide to do in your life this is the most important lesson we learnt from the late professor v m dandekar and this is the lesson which i would like to convey to a younger generation present here today whatever is your chosen field of specialisation whatever occupation or profession you finally decide on you will succeed only if you are passionate about your work and retain this passion till the end this zest for life or as the french call it joie de vivre is what distinguishes people and gives them that little edge in successful careers i would also like to acknowledge the presence here today of professor s b mujumdar whose own passion for his idea of vasudhaiva kutumbakam or the world is one family led him to found symbiosis which has over these past years now grown into a huge organisation about which we are all aware about once again these feats have been possible only due to the ideas of professor mujumdar and the passion he brought to bear in implementing them since today is the 8th of march or international women s day a word for the young ladies out there in the audience professor v m dandekar gave every encouragement to the girl student of his day two of them have done exceedingly well and are present here with all of us today both professor rajani gupte vice chancellor symbiosis international as well as your own vice principal professor sunayini parchure were students of professor dandekar i am sure they owe a debt of gratitude to him to the young ladies who are present here today let me express the common hope and wish of the symbiosis family that all of you will do well in your chosen careers that some of you will break the still existing glass ceilings in our country and that some of you will represent india in international forums thereby making pune and india proud of your achievements image bullet trains at a high speed train maintenance base in guangzhou china photograph reuters i have been asked to speak to all of you today on the us china trade war and its implications for india let me begin by first talking about china a country that i have visited and seen for 30 years now my first memory of china is that in february 1988 when i took a train from guangzhou in southern china also called canton to beijing the capital of that ancient nation it was a 36 hour journey during which i spent two nights on the train with a group of other foreigners who were in my compartment today the high speed railway takes just 12 hours to perform this journey and you do not need to spend a night on the train the reason i have recounted this experience is to highlight how much china has changed over these past 30 years it was in december 1978 that the then supreme leader of china deng xiaoping set her on the path of economic reform and opening to the outside world a road to which china has stuck despite turns and twists in its history and its politics the results are there for all to see over the 30 year period from 1980 to 2010 china s gdp grew at an annual average rate of over 10 per cent per annum and has only begun to slow down since 2013 in this period china has grown from a us 200 billion dollar economy to a us 12 5 trillion dollar one to provide some comparison the united states is today a us 20 5 trillion dollar economy while india is a us 2 6 trillion dollar one image women at a company manufacturing medical textiles in the changji hui autonomous prefecture xinjiang uighur autonomous region china photograph reuters however china continues to be as it has since 1949 a polity which is dominated and controlled by the communist party so it remains a centrally driven polity economy as well as society land is owned by the state which is the communist party of china although the agricultural reforms pursued there based on the contract responsibility system provided incentives to individual farmers and cultivators and did lead to huge increases in agricultural output as well as productivity similarly most industrial and other firms are either publicly owned and are what we would term as psus who control the commanding heights of the chinese economy the communist party is ever present even in so called private firms including foreign invested joint ventures with a cell of the party in each and every such enterprise very often the party cell in a company will routinely interfere in decision making on pricing employment and marketing since the major factors of production are owned by the state its pricing is non market based hence in china land is easily and cheaply available for major infrastructure projects while here in india land acquisition often become the major stumbling block in executing large scale infrastructure development one point that i would like to make in passing is that since china is a non market economy the supply of infrastructure runs ahead of the demand for infrastructure public investment is an important instrument to ensure high economic growth therefore in many cities of china you will find that new airports are being constructed even before the older ones are becoming congested or exceeding capacity in much of the rest of the world including in the united states and of course in india too the supply of infrastructure follows the demand for it only when pune airport becomes extremely overcrowded and terribly congested will a new airport be built for the city this has been the experience in both delhi and mumbai image workers make orolay jackets at the company s factory complex in jiaxing china photograph pei li reuters one final point that i would like to make about china is that ever since she embarked on the policy of integrating with the rest of the world she has followed a mercantilist policy of ensuring that exports exceeded imports and that there were ever rising foreign exchange reserves in her kitty this coupled with the rising importance and size of china in the world economy has created tensions and problems for almost every nation on the globe take india as an example we have an ever increasing trade deficit with china which last year amounted to about 62 billion us dollars it was roughly half of our global trade deficit with all countries some of our problems relate to non tariff barriers so we sell our software and our pharmaceuticals all over the world but they do not find entry into the china market thereby compounding our trade problems with that country prior to china joining the world trade organisation in 2001 all countries including india and the united states negotiated our own bilateral agreements with china we found that the us had insisted and obtained agreement from china that at least 10 hollywood films would be allowed to be screened in china each year we did not insist on a certain number of bollywood films being permitted into china each year and hence did not have any kind of written agreement with the chinese on this issue however over the last few years bollywood has made its own way into the china market as witnessed by the success there of films such as dangal secret superstar and hindi medium as many of you may know the film dangal made more money in china than it did in india photograph ng han guan reuters the reason i have dwelt at length about developments in the chinese economy is to set the stage for the main part of my talk about the us china trade war at the turn of the century around the year 2000 the general approach of the united states towards china was that once china got into international organisations she herself would change and become more open and democratic therefore the us actively worked towards china s entry into the wto in december 2001 this policy approach was a constant from the clinton administration right down to the obama presidency however right through this period the united states as well as her western allies ensured that controlled technologies which had dual purposes were not made available to china so too with military platforms and assets however through this period china s military modernisation process continued apace and many were of the opinion that they were able to steal and reverse engineer advanced technologies many political scientists and international relations experts were of the opinion that since the break up of the soviet union the united states was the pre eminent superpower in the world and that she would not tolerate the rise of a new peer competitor this is where i would once again refer back to professor v m dandekar he has always seen the link between economics and politics though this was more in a domestic context it can be seen from the names of the institutions he was linked with the gokhale institute of politics and economics and then later the indian school of political economy ladies and gentlemen the us china trade war that we are currently witnessing is truly the meeting ground of geopolitics and geo economics the current superpower the united states responding to the challenge of the rising power china and since there cannot be an overtly military conflict the gauntlet is being thrown down in the economic sphere the us national security strategy of december 2017 states that for decades us policy was rooted in the belief that support for china s rise and for its integration into the post war international order would liberalise china contrary to our hopes china expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others china gathers and exploits data on an unrivaled scale and spreads features of its authoritarian system including corruption and the use of surveillance the us national defense strategy 2018 says china is a strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours image china s president xi jinping inspects people s liberation army troops at the pla s hong kong garrison june 30 2017 photograph damir sagolj reuters with the advent of the trump presidency in the us increasing focus has been placed on china s trade practices including non tariff barriers her theft of intellectual property her arm twisting of foreign enterprises who are in china to part with their technologies her mercantilist trade policies her potential for manipulating her currency and her enhanced use of big data and artificial intelligence for surveillance of her own citizens the made in china 2025 programme which aims at making china a world leader in robotics ai and biotechnology which in turn will challenge america s unrivalled leadership in technology has alarmed the americans and forced them to accept and stare down this challenge the fact that these developments have been accompanied with the rising influence of the communist party of china in that country s economic and social life have only added to the sense of competition it is the american way of life which is under threat american values are under fire the american position was articulated by vice president mike pence in a major speech on october 4 2018 in which he stated after the fall of the soviet union we assumed that a free china was inevitable heady with optimism at the turn of the 21st century america agreed to give beijing open access to our economy and we brought china into the wto speaking about the problem areas as seen by the united states he added the chinese communist party has also used an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade including tariffs quotas currency manipulation forced technology transfer intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies summing up the new us approach to trade with china vice president pence noted the united states of america has adopted a new approach to china we seek a relationship grounded in fairness reciprocity and respect for sovereignty on the trade front itself the us too like india faced a large and growing trade deficit the deficit amounted to 375 billion us dollars in 2017 and 323 billion us dollars in 2018 hence the americans keep calling for free fair and reciprocal trade in their war with china image china s president xi jinping first lady peng liyuan united states president donald j trump and first lady melania at a state dinner at the great hall of the people in beijing november 9 2017 photograph thomas peter reuters therefore in order to put china on notice to alter its economic policies and to provide the united states with fair and reciprocal trading and economic arrangements president trump levied an additional 10 tariff on chinese exports amounting to 60 billion us dollars in early 2018 the chinese side retaliated in a tit for tat move and levied the same amount of additional tariffs on us exports to china worth 60 billion dollars the number of chinese export commodities on which the us has levied tariffs has grown over time and today stands at 250 billion us dollars the us has also threatened to increase these tariffs from 10 to 25 if talks between the two nations does not yield a satisfactory result so far they have held off from carrying out this threat since talks are ongoing between the two governments for their part china has levied tariffs on us exports to china valued at 110 billion us dollars trump has in turn threatened to levy enhanced tariffs on a further 267 billion worth of chinese exports to america the weakness in the chinese position is that since it exports much more to the united states than it imports from that nation there is a finite limit to which it can levy tariffs on the us moreover china has grown to a large extent based on export led growth in which strategy the united states is an extremely important market hence the chinese are on a weaker wicket and are very keen to reach some kind of agreement also they have to ensure that nothing halts or decelerates china s current growth rate of about 6 5 a lot of people argue that president trump is a transactional man well let me say that the chinese government is even more transactional hence the two sides are currently having intense discussions aimed at averting a further enhancement of the trade or economic war between the two currently the deadline is march 31 but that is not cast in stone the united states will hope for a deal which will prove to be for china what the plaza accord did to japan on its part china will negotiate to ensure that this does not happen and that china s growth and rise is not stopped in its tracks or set back seriously negotiations between the two continue even as i speak and the two sides hope to sign a deal once struck at a summit meeting between the two presidents possibly somewhere in the us the point i would like to highlight here is that while the frictions between the united states and china are deep rooted and based in geo politics given the transactional nature of both regimes please do not rule out some kind of deal in the short term so that both can claim victory given the more fundamental nature of the divide between the two countries however a truce will prove to be short lived and tensions will flare up again in the not too distant future remember what we are witnessing today is the rise of a new world power challenging the existing superpower such developments have never been easy or peaceful in the history of mankind image chinese president xi jinping and prime minister narendra damodardas modi at the hubei provincial museum in wuhan april 27 2018 photograph china daily reuters so what should india be doing in this current scenario is there anything we can do when the fight is between the two largest economies in the world there is a chinese saying that when elephants fight the grass below their feet will get trampled on so my advice for india will be to keep its head down and make sure that we are not the grass which gets trampled on some of this is becoming evident in the recent action by the trump administration to end india s gsp benefits recently which all of you must have read about the big picture is that india must ensure that its rising economy is not hindered in any way and that we do not become the unwitting victim of the us china trade war we have to ensure that our gdp continues to rise at 7 or 7 5 per cent each year and that we reach our next 6 to 7 year target of becoming a 5 trillion dollar economy so what do we need to do in order to ensure that these goals are met we need not take sides in the current trade war even if a further opening and ease of doing business in china will eventually prove beneficial to us if non tariff barriers in the chinese economy do indeed lower we will be able to sell more indian pharmaceutical products there and possibly more software that will aid the reduction in the trade deficit with china however the deficit is dictated by the very composition of india china trade where we import large amounts of manufactured finished products such as iron and steel power equipment mobile phones and electronics when our exports to china are mainly agricultural products then we can see that the deficit will indeed grow i would propose that we need to look at the invisibles in our balance of payments with china and therefore i recommend that we work seriously on attracting more chinese tourists to india if we are able to undertake a very serious focused and intensive media campaign in china to market incredible india there including in their tier 2 and tier 3 cities then we should be able to get 1 5 million chinese tourists to visit india by 2020 this will not merely enable us to meet our tourism targets but it will provide huge employment to many of our countrymen and women while also helping balance payments with china photograph jason lee reuters we are also seeing more attention by chinese companies to the indian market and increasingly they are investing in india despite the fact that we are not an easy country in which to do business this is entirely due to the size of our market and the recent success of xiaomi in becoming the market leader in our mobile handset sector in a fairly short period of time does provide encouragement to chinese firms to look at india seriously as an investment destination we need to encourage this trend while paying attention to issues such as data privacy and security the tussle and competition between the us and china on the development of 5g technology is another case in point us moves against the chinese firm huawei are well known to all of you we are also aware that huawei is indeed one of the leading companies in the world where development of 5g technology is concerned where should india stand on this matter naturally security is an important consideration and we must pay adequate attention to it however we need not take a stand on which firm or firms from what countries develop the technology we want it to be rolled out in india as soon as the rest of the world has it and we want it to be as cheap as possible as many of you may know huawei does have large operations in india it does sell its equipment to many of our mobile phone service providers and it has a huge development park in bengaluru where about 5 000 indian engineers are employed chinese investment in india will also help balance our deficit in goods by bringing inflows on capital account image prime minister narendra damodardas modi with us president donald j trump photograph win mcnamee getty images how do we deal with the united states we have an excellent relationship with the united states there is little doubt about that we have over 3 million indian americans who provide a bridge between the two nations most importantly we share values of democracy transparency and the importance of individual rights with america recently the us has also made available to us many dual use products and technologies which we did not have access to earlier so our relations with america are important even to our continued economic and social growth and development we are aware that president trump is transactional so what stops us from matching him why do we stand on ceremony and principle when he asks us to lower tariffs on harley davidson mobikes i feel we must introspect on this matter in this way we shall keep all our options open since india s continued growth and development needs capital technology and management expertise from any source or any country we can get it from to sum up where do we stand on this entire matter of the us china trade war first it is quite apparent that the trade war is actually a contest between a rising world power and the existing super power history shows that such a contest is not going to be short and quick but will stretch for several years possibly decades moreover the trade war is the manifestation of a much more serious geo political match up between the two sides second in this current scenario india must protect its own national interest which is to safeguard our own growth and development we cannot permit this turmoil to threaten our rise in any way and in order to do that we need not take sides third if we play our cards right we may even benefit from the competition between the two as seen from increased investment from each of these countries into india the size of our market gives us an important lever of power which we shall have to play adroitly and intelligently fourth it is imperative that we put our heads down and keep doing domestically what is required for our own benefit whether it is to clean india encourage startups raise the proportion of manufacturing in our gdp skill india or provide more remunerative returns to our farmers if we do not stay the course internally then howsoever favourable the external

following a more dovish than expected ecb on thursday the euro exchange rates fell sharply vs major currency peers gbp eur briefly achieved 1 17 while eur usd dropped to lows of around 1 12 the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 22 lower 1 16641 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 09 lower 1 30793 today overnight after a turbulent day in global stock markets the rout looked to intensify in japan surprisingly despite a 1 6 loss in the nikkei 225 by 2 am gmt the japanese yen was relatively quiet typically big moves in the nikkei prompt some weakness in the usd jpy exchange rate as investors pile into the haven yen the fact this isn t happening is curious and perhaps indicates just how disinterested investors are given how the boj is viewed as being extremely dovish advertisement asian stocks are trading lower on the back of a rare sell rating from china s largest brokerage and concerns over a slowdown in global growth chinese trade data came in weaker than expected overnight oil prices were also lower with crude losing 0 5 chinese woes appear to be damaging the outlook in asia the day ahead there is practically no economic data in europe today and perhaps that is a good thing after the ecb meeting just german factory orders to start the day and then from there it s all about north america the united states has some extremely top tier data with building permits and housing starts important for gauging the health of the economy the unemployment rate and non farm payrolls headline this slew of data and will almost certainly generate some volatility in the us dollar index if they catch investors off guard analyst us nfp preview lloyds bank at last week s semi annual testimonies to us congress fed chair powell stressed that the us economy remained strong in spite of growing external risks while the delayed q4 gdp numbers showed above consensus growth against this backdrop the labour market numbers will be scrutinised to see if the underlying economy continued to grow robustly through q1 last month s report showed a notable rise in nonfarm payrolls of 304k our forecast for february s numbers are for a more modest rise of 185k while consensus is at 180k such an outturn should be sufficient to see the unemployment rate fall further and we forecast a decline to 3 9 from 4 0 meanwhile an uptick in average earnings from 3 2 y y to 3 3 y y is also expected which would provide further evidence that the tight labour market is feeding through to stronger pay growth analyst us nfp preview kyrre aamdal and andreas økland dnb markets we expect non farm payrolls to have increased by 220k in february after increasing by 304k in january consensus is for a 180k increase according to bloomberg both we and consensus expect the unemployment rate to have fallen by 0 1 point to 3 9 we also expect the average hourly earnings to have increased by 0 3 mom in february up from 0 1 growth in january numbers on housing starts in january will also be published today consensus is for housing starts to have increased by 10 4 mom in january after falling by 11 2 in december and for the number of building permits to have fallen by 2 8 mom after increasing by 0 3 in december analyst us data preview marshall gittler acls global the market consensus is 180k which would basically be reversion back to trend after a couple of months of unusually high figures the market estimate floating around on twitter is a bit higher at 200k indicating that perhaps the market is primed for an upside surprise that makes some sense because february has been the strongest month of the year for payrolls relative to consensus since 2000 13 of the 19 february payroll reports have beaten the consensus estimate this trend has only gotten stronger in recent years with eight of the last nine years beating it and all of the last seven years over this last seven years the figure on average beat the consensus by a notable 52k while the only miss over the last nine years was a mere 4k i believe that the average hourly earnings are probably more important than the nfp figure itself because the us economy is already at what the fed considers to be full employment before they start hiking rates again they want to see evidence that the tight labor market is feeding through to higher wages which could then feed through to higher inflation here too the consensus is for reversion to the mean basically 80 of the time the mom change is either 0 1 0 2 or 0 3 since last month it was 0 1 the low end of the usual range the market assumes this month it will come out on the high end of the usual range namely 0 3 that would push the yoy rate back up to 3 3 the peak for this economic cycle that i think would suggest the labor market remains strong and therefore would be beneficial for the dollar economic data released today 08 03 2019 07 00 eur german factory orders mom jan 13 15 cad housing starts feb 13 30 usd average

foreign exchange markets it was an absolutely terrible day on thursday for european currencies against the us dollar and there was only one thing to blame the ecb in a report from lloyds rapid response team the uk based bank outlined just what it was that mario draghi did to shock the euro and drag the british pound with it firstly it signaled that interest rates are now expected to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 previously the ecb pointed to no expected rate rise at least through the summer of 2019 in other words the first rate rise should not be expected until 2020 in fact president draghi revealed that policymakers discussed pushing out the guidance to march 2020 an extremely dovish ecb has put the knife in eur usd which fell sharply and the pound to dollar exchange rate is now below 1 31 and in danger of dropping back through the psychologically significant 1 30 level another issue that hurt the euro exchange rates was the fact that the ecb made a physically dovish move to prevent credit conditions from getting too tight the second noteworthy announcement was confirmation the ecb will launch a new targeted longer term refinancing operations programme tltro iii these are long term loans to banks that may be facing cliff effects as current tltro ii funding needs to be replaced in june the purpose of the liquidity support is to prevent an unwarranted tightening of credit conditions for businesses and households in the wider economy add to all this that the ecb also dialed back their inflation forecast and it s not surprising that stocks swooned with the euro unusual for a dovish move from the ecb and concerning longer term as it looks like draghi may have missed the boat to get european monetary policy had back towards normalisation analyst view barclays bank barclays research has pushed out its baseline expectation for a first hike in the deposit rate of 15bp to q1 20 previously q4 19 followed by a second deposit and refinancing rate hike of 25bp in q3 20 previously q2 20 eur gbp dropped to one week lows of 0 85364 and eur usd traded down to 20 month lows of 1 1177 on the back of the more dovish than expected

ecb president mario draghi said the economy was in a period of continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty as he pushed out a planned rate hike and instead offered banks a new round of cheap loans the reversal came in the same week that canada s central bank took a sudden dovish turn and dismal data from australia to britain instilled a sense of foreboding in markets when central banks surprise like this some investors wonder whether that infers things are much worse than they thought said mr gavin friend a senior market strategist at nab our initial take is these developments are pressing down on market confidence seen in lower bond yields and equities yields on german and french 10 year bonds dived to their lowest since 2016 while banking stocks took a beating the euro duly sank to depths last seen in mid 2017 sending the safe haven us dollar and yen surging euro in a hole the next hurdle for investors will be united states payrolls data for february with analysts uncertain how much payback there might be for january s outsized jump there was also a chance the jobless rate could fall by more than forecast given the recent strength in employment the numbers are still likely to highlight the relative outperformance of the us economy especially against the european union and further encourage dollar bulls the greenback reached a new 2019 high against a basket of currencies before steadying at 97 537 the euro cowered at us 1 1198 having suffered its biggest one day loss against the dollar since june 2018 when the ecb last pushed back plans for a rate hike the euro also shed over 1 per cent on the yen overnight and was last trading at 124 57 yen the safe harbour japanese currency was one of the few to hold its own on the dollar firming to 111 28 the ecb s updated forecasts imply that at best growth slowly returns to trend over the next few years meaning it will be very difficult to get underlying inflation up wrote analysts at anz in a note euro interest rates could be at current levels into 2021 that is not good news for euro area banks or the euro in commodity markets the rise in the dollar restrained gold to us 1 287 86 per ounce oil prices eased as us crude output and exports climbed to record highs undermining efforts by producer club opec to tighten global markets us crude was last down 38 cents at us 56 28 a barrel while brent crude fell 49 cents to us 65 81
file photo sign of the european central bank ecb is seen ahead of the news conference on the outcome of the governing council meeting outside the ecb headquarters in frankfurt germany march 7 2019 reuters kai pfaffenbach reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 time for some voodoo so after three years of pumping 2 6 trillion euros worth of stimulus and cutting interest rates to minus 0 4 percent the ecb has admitted its growth inflation targets remain elusive and those emergency era monetary settings will have to persist for a lot longer the ecb is not alone doubts abound around the world about whether developed economies have enjoyed lasting benefit or been fully repaired by trillions of dollars of bond buying quantitative easing from central banks over the past decade japan has been in this funk for decades the federal reserve is finding normalization of its policy settings difficult of late slowing economic momentum has seen australia canada and sweden turning tail on policy tightening plans all this speaks loud and clear to the current economic policy zeitgeist a raging debate around mmt or modern monetary theory effectively a reworking of monetary theory by the left of the u s democratic party ahead of next year s elections mmt advocates posit that policymakers in countries fortunate enough to manage the world s main reserve currencies should as long as inflation remains as subdued as it is right now just keep interest rates at zero and print money to invest in environment and infrastructure projects with interest rates near zero and inflation structurally depressed they argue that government deficits and debt levels far higher than the sometimes arbitrary limits set by current orthodox policy can be both sustainable and productive in seeding higher and better quality economic growth in the longer term the idea is akin to british opposition labor leader jeremy corbyn s proposal of people s qe a few years back some politicians across europe too especially among italy s populist coalition government have railed against fiscal orthodoxy as strangling growth many have called on the ecb to support debt funded government reinvestment program mainstream economists such as larry summers dismiss mmt as voodoo and as mmt balks at the idea that bond and currency markets should continue to be allowed to dictate government spending levels and priorities many financial market economists also oppose the notion but as europe shows no one can argue that tried and tested orthodoxy has really worked expect to hear more about a rethink of economic policy theories like this as may s european parliament election approaches and

how well the u s consumer and economy are standing up to a worldwide slowdown overall sales are seen edging up 0 1 percent in january after dropping 1 2 percent in december the biggest fall since 2009

backdrop the december falloff in online sales was especially weak in the hitherto booming sector the 3 9 percent decline was the largest since the financial crisis and marked the worst december ever

news national by steve h hanke until february 20 zimbabwe produced a quasi currency it was dubbed a zollar on february 20 the quasi currency became zimbabwe s official currency this new currency is called rtgs dollars and consists of bond notes and rtgs electronic money the rtgs dollars possess legal tender status and will serve as the unit of account for the government s books the official exchange rate for zollar quasi currency had been set at a one to one rate with the united states dollar but now the rtgs dollar will trade at a managed floating exchange rate the rate today is 2 50 per us dollar not par as it used to be so zimbabwe s official exchange rate has experienced a maxi devaluation of 60 that however is not the end of zimbabwe s exchange rate story zimbabwe imposes a plethora of exchange and capital controls on its citizens under these exchange controls private individuals traders and companies must seek permission from the government to buy sell and hold foreign currencies so neither the old zollar nor the new rtgs dollar is freely convertible into a foreign currency in consequence a black market read free market exists indeed whenever there are exchange controls and restrictions on free convertibility black markets always appear at present the black market rate is 5 75 which represents a considerable premium over the official rate of 2 50 rtgs us dollar the black market usually yields a premium over the official rate as it does zimbabwe in some cases the premiums can reach staggering levels for example in 1982 ghana s cedi carried a premium of over 2 000 these premiums are known as black market premiums the black market premium indicates among other things the severity of the controls and restrictions a country imposes on its citizens in the case of zimbabwe the official currency devaluation caused the black market premium to shrink from 456 to 130 as the official rate moved from one rtgs usd to 2 50 so as of now the markets deem that the introduction of the new currency and the maxi devaluation have reduced the severity of controls that drive a wedge between the official and black market exchange rate moreover since the black market premium on foreign exchange is an implicit tax on exports the reduction in the premium means that the export tax resulting from exchange controls has been reduced the chart below contains 22 countries that have black markets in foreign exchange and for which data are available north korea tops the list with a black market premium of 811 this suggests that controls are severe and that an official devaluation will eventually be in the cards venezuela is at the bottom of the list with an unusual negative black market premium this negative premium suggests that market participants think the bolivar will appreciate relative to the greenback and that individuals are willing to pay a premium to obtain bolivars on the black market just why do countries impose restrictions and controls on foreign exchange markets and restrict free convertibility in most cases controls are seen as a way to cool off hot money and conserve official foreign exchange reserves the pedigree of exchange controls can be traced back to plato the father of statism inspired by lycurgus of sparta plato embraced the idea of an inconvertible currency as a means to preserve the autonomy of the state from outside interference so the temptation to turn to exchange controls in the face of disruptions caused by hot money flows is hardly new in the modern era tsar nicholas ii was the first to pioneer limitations on convertibility in 1905 he ordered the state bank of russia to introduce a limited form of exchange control to discourage speculative purchases of foreign exchange the bank did so by refusing to sell foreign exchange except where it could be shown that it was required to buy imported goods otherwise foreign exchange was limited to 50 000 german marks per person the tsar s rationale for exchange controls was that of limiting hot money flows so that foreign reserves and the exchange rate could be maintained as we move to reflect on zimbabwe or any of the other countries in the hanke quarterly black market review we must lift a page from nobel laureate friedrich hayek s 1944 classic the road to serfdom the extent of the control over all life that economic control confers is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of foreign exchanges nothing would at first seem to affect private life less than a state control of the dealings in foreign exchange and most people will regard its introduction with complete indifference yet the experience of most continental countries has taught thoughtful people to regard this step as the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism and the suppression of individual liberty it is in fact the complete delivery of the individual to the tyranny of the state the final suppression of all means of escape not merely for the rich but for everybody hayek s message about convertibility has regrettably been overlooked by many contemporary economists exchange controls are nothing more than a ring fence within which governments can expropriate their subjects property open exchange and capital markets in fact protect the individual from exactions because governments must reckon with the possibility of capital flight from this it follows that the imposition of exchange controls leads to an instantaneous reduction in the wealth of the country because all assets decline in value to see why it is important to understand how assets are priced the value of any asset is the sum of the expected future installments of income it generates discounted to the present value for example the price of a stock represents the value to the investor now of his share of the company s future cash flows whether issued as dividends or reinvested the present value of future income is calculated using an appropriate interest rate that is adjusted for the various risks that the income may not materialise when convertibility is restricted risk increases because property is held hostage and is subject to a potential ransom through expropriation as a result the risk adjusted interest rate employed to value assets is higher than it would be with full convertibility investors are willing to pay less for each dollar of prospective income and the value of property is less than it would be with full convertibility president emmerson mnangagwa has proclaimed that zimbabwe is open for business this refrain rings hollow in the face of zimbabwe s exchange controls and its new currency the rtgs dollar if zimbabwe wants to be open for business and wants its own sound currency it should adopt a currency board that would make zimbabwe s currency a clone of the us dollar or some other suitable anchor such as gold a currency board would mandate that exchange controls be thrown in the dustbin free convertibility would reign and so would low inflation rates and higher asset valuations the open for business sign would be the real deal professor steve h hanke hanke is a professor of applied economics at the

officer said we are pleased with our overall results for the quarter with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year in the pre holiday period destination guest visitation at our u s resorts was less than expected which we attribute to guest concerns after two prior years of poor pre holiday conditions our destination guest visitation was largely in line with expectations during the key holiday weeks and through the remainder of january throughout the quarter with the favorable conditions at our u s resorts we saw strong visitation growth among our local guests who are primarily pass purchasers our colorado and utah resorts experienced strong visitation during the holidays and through the remainder of the quarter that aligned with our expectations our tahoe resorts and whistler blackcomb saw periods of strong visitation in the holiday and post holiday periods but have also been impacted by numerous weather events that have negatively impacted their results in addition international visitation at whistler blackcomb was below the prior year throughout the quarter our northeast resorts are off to a great start to the season as we continue to benefit from good conditions and the first season with okemo and mount sunapee as a part of our network conditions across the network are set up well for the remainder of the season including results from triple peaks and stevens pass in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 total lift revenue increased 17 2 driven by a 27 0 growth in skier visitation total effective ticket price etp decreased 7 8 in the second quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to higher skier visitation by season pass holders and the impact of the new military epic pass partially offset by price increases in both our lift ticket and season pass products excluding season pass holders etp increased 8 3 compared to the prior year the strong rebound in visitation and spending compared to the prior year along with the addition of triple peaks and stevens pass drove a 15 1 increase in ski school revenue a 21 3 increase in dining revenue and an 11 3 increase in retail rental revenue compared to the prior year regarding the company s lodging segment katz said our lodging results for the second fiscal quarter were positive with revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursements increasing 16 1 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental operations of triple peaks the average daily rate adr decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the inclusion of the triple peaks resorts as well as incremental managed tahoe lodging properties that we did not manage in the prior year all of which generate a lower adr as compared to our broader lodging segment regarding the company s outlook katz said as noted in our january press release we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disappointing results from destination visitation in the pre holiday period and also due to shortfalls from expectations at our tahoe resorts and whistler blackcomb we now expect net income attributable to vail resorts inc for fiscal 2019 to be between 268 million and 300 million and resort reported ebitda for fiscal 2019 to be between 690 million and 710 million which remains generally consistent with our commentary on guidance in january our guidance is predicated on current canadian and australian foreign exchange rates of 0 75 and 0 71 respectively for each currency to the u s dollar for the remainder of the fiscal year which represents an estimated 4 million reduction in resort reported ebitda from the currency rates included in the guidance we issued in september 2018 of which nearly half has been realized year to date the updated guidance incorporates 12 million

as the longest bull market in u s history celebrates its 10th anniversary saturday wall street pros are debating whether the old timer is on its last legs or mustering a second wind the question is pivotal for the 401 k plans and other investments of millions of americans who have built robust nest eggs on the back of the market s impressive rise bull markets don t die of old age says jason ware chief investment officer at albion financial group i see no reason the bull market should abruptly end as long as the economy stays out of recession and the federal reserve doesn t excessively raise interest rates others are more skeptical it s a late stage market with one last rally in it says jared woodard global investment strategist for bank of america merrill lynch he expects the stock

prices without a 20 percent drop from its peak or bear market based on closing prices since the standard poor s 500 stock index bottomed out at 676 53 on march 9 2009 in the thick of the great

bull lasted so long stocks tumbled so low on march 9 2009 the s p 500 was 57 percent off its prior peak they had nowhere to go but way way up there was a lot of catching up to do says yung yu ma chief investment strategist of bmo wealth management the benchmark stock index in fact didn t even claw its way back to its previous high until 2013 the market also has benefited from a not too hot not too cold economy ware says economic growth averaging a modest 2 2 percent a year has helped contain inflation allowing the fed to keep short term rates low and buy bonds that slashed long term rates on mortgages and other loans low rates coax investors to move their money to higher yielding stocks and spur more borrowing and economic activity tame inflation also means businesses pay less for labor and materials widening their profit margins at the same time the market run up has been devoid of the kind of risk taking that led to the 2000 dotcom bubble and the 2007 housing crash both of which were followed by market downturns and recessions ware says another boost businesses were cautious after the bruising recession of 2007 09 limiting hiring employee raises and capital investment that helped fatten their annual earnings gains to an average 12 percent the past decade above the 5 5 percent historical average ware says instead public companies have spent billions of dollars buying back their own stock a strategy that pushed share prices even higher s p 500 companies have made a record 600 billion in buybacks the past five years woodard says will the good times continue here s why some analysts think this bull has further to run economy is still on even keel while growth picked up to nearly 3 percent in 2018 on the federal stimulus it s expected to slow this year more importantly inflation remains below the fed s annual 2 percent target letting the central bank keep interest rates low the economy should also continue to dodge the boom and bust moments that are a recipe for bear markets and recessions ware says fed to the rescue the fed breathed new life into a sputtering market when it made its big about face and said it will be patient on rate hikes this year the central bank also said it expects to stop shrinking its 4 trillion portfolio of bonds earlier than anticipated this year a move that should keep long term rates lower we were very bearish with the fed planning to raise rates woodard says we turned tactically bullish after the fed s turnabout at least for 2019 market drop bought the bull more time the plunge in stocks last fall was nerve wracking but it likely extended the bull s lifespan by rinsing the market of investors bent on making a quick buck and leaving more long term shareholders focused on company fundamentals it wrings out the excesses ware says stocks still reasonably priced despite the market run up the average s p 500 stock is priced at 16 times projected earnings over the next 12 months down from a multiple of 18 in late 2017 and slightly below the five year average according to factset the stock market is cheap ware says especially with low interest rates making shares of companies more appealing but wait here s why some analysts think a bear market lurks by next year wages could squeeze profits goose inflation average annual pay increases have picked up to more than 3 percent as employers bid up to attract fewer available workers amid 4 percent unemployment that s good for workers but it will likely mean narrower corporate profits that crimp stock gains or contribute to losses if raises accelerate further as expected woodard says s p 500 earnings gains are expected to slow to 4 5 percent this year according to factset morgan stanley expects earnings to contract alternatively woodard says companies could pass along their higher labor costs to consumers through higher prices juicing inflation and forcing the fed to raise rates more aggressively that too could be a bull market killer fading effects of tax cut the big corporate tax cut accounted for about a third of the 20 percent plus growth in corporate profits the first three quarters of last year ware says but since the lower tax rate is now part of baseline earnings it won t goose profits this year recession odds are rising more than half the economists surveyed by the wall street journal in early january predicted a recession will start in 2020 a downturn is almost always accompanied by a bear market the market rally has soothed nerves but many economists still foresee a slump next year trade fight lingers trump administration officials are reportedly close to a deal with china to roll back most tariffs on both sides but ma of bmo wealth management says a deal is already priced into stocks meanwhile any agreement is likely to include provisions that would reinstate tariffs if china doesn t meet certain conditions ma says that he says would leave a cloud of uncertainty over the market corporate debt bubble there s a record 4 3 trillion in lower quality corporate loans and high yield bonds that could see rising defaults if the economy goes south even higher quality debt could default if the economy wobbles woodard says curtailing lending and deepening any market pain bottom line while a bear market is possible the next two years ma thinks the more likely scenario is a slowdown in market returns to about 7 percent a year that keeps the bull trudging forward ware continues to recommend a balanced mix of stocks and bonds for middle age investors and a portfolio skewed toward stocks for younger folks and bonds for seniors the best way to manage the inevitable ups and downs of the stock market is to stop short of predicting when the bumps will come he says this article originally appeared on usa today stocks the record bull market is 10 years old is it about to flame out or surge higher

thank you all very much for being here tonight and thank you for being part of a political revolution which will transform america thank you for being part of a campaign which is not only going to win the democratic nomination which is not only going to defeat donald trump the most dangerous president in modern american history but with your help is going to transform this country and finally create an economy and government which works for all americans and not just the one percent today i want to welcome you to a campaign which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed kleptocracy hatred and lies it will not be racism sexism xenophobia homophobia and religious bigotry all of that is going to end the principles of our government will be based on justice economic justice social justice racial justice and environmental justice tonight i want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of wall street corporate america and the billionaire class greed which has resulted in this country having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth no we will no longer stand idly by and allow 3 people in this country to own more wealth than the bottom half of america while at the same time nearly 20 percent of our children live in poverty veterans sleep out on the streets and seniors cannot afford their prescription drugs we will no longer accept 46 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent while millions of americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs just to survive and over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck frightened to death about what happens to them financially if their car breaks down or their child becomes sick together we are going to create a political system which is based on the democratic principles of one person one vote and end a corrupt system which allows billionaires to buy elections yes we are going to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections today we fight for a political revolution and tonight i want to offer a very special thanks to the people of the great state of iowa in 2016 this is where the political revolution began thank you iowa when i first came here to campaign in 2015 not a whole lot of people knew who i was nobody took our campaign seriously and we were at 3 percent in the polls further the ideas that we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme ideas they said that nobody in america would support raising the minimum wage to a living wage too radical guaranteeing health care to all as a right not a privilege too radical creating up to 15 million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure with a one trillion dollar investment too radical aggressively combatting climate change too radical reforming our broken criminal justice and immigration systems too radical not taking money from super pacs and the rich too radical ending the power of super delegates at the democratic convention too radical well a funny thing happened in iowa over that year on caucus night we didn t win 3 of the vote we won 50 of the vote and half of the pledged delegates and that great start in iowa led us to win victories in 22 states around the country 13 million votes over 1700 delegates at the convention and more votes from young people black white latino asian american and native american than trump and clinton combined and by the way those ideas that we talked about 4 years years ago that seemed so very radical at that time well today virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the american people and have overwhelming support from democrats and independents and they re ideas that democratic candidates for president to school board are now supporting so iowa you helped begin the political revolution in 2016 and with your help on this campaign we are going to complete what we started here we re going to turn our vision and our progressive agenda into reality today as we launch our campaign here in iowa we say to the private health insurance companies whether you like it or not the united states will join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right all americans are entitled to go to the doctor when they re sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital we will no longer accept the absurdity of paying almost twice as much per capita on health care while we have a lower life expectancy and worse health care outcomes than many other countries the goal of health care must be to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way not tens of billions in profits for the insurance companies and outrageous compensation packages for ceos in 2017 the top 65 healthcare ceos made 1 7 billion in compensation including 83 2 million to david wichmann the ceo of unitedhealth group and 58 7 million to mark bertolini the ceo of aetna we need a health care system that invests in disease prevention doctors nurses dentists and rural clinics we don t a system which makes insurance companies and their ceos super rich yes we will pass a medicare for all single payer program health care is a right and by the way our legislation improves health care for seniors by providing coverage for dental care hearing aids and eye glasses today we say to the pharmaceutical industry that you will no longer charge the american people the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs the result being that one out of five americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors prescribe seniors in this country should not have to cut their pills in half the outrageous greed of the pharmaceutical industry is going to end we are going to lower prescription drug prices in this country today we say to walmart the fast food industry and other low wage employers stop paying your employees starvation wages yes we are going to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage 15 an hour nobody who works 40 hours a week in this country should live in poverty and yes we re going to make it easier for people to join unions not harder four years ago when we talked about the idea of a 15 an hour minimum wage it seemed like an impossible dream well since then i m happy to tell you that 5 states have passed 15 an hour legislation and just yesterday the u s house committee on labor and education reported out a bill that will raise the federal minimum wage from 7 25 an hour to 15 an hour and i believe that bill will pass the full house within the month and by the way today we say to corporate america that artificial intelligence and robotics are not going to be used just to throw workers out on the street this exploding technology must serve human needs not just corporate profits today we say to the american people that we will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail system and subways our airports our water systems and wastewater plants and when we do that we create up to 13 million good paying jobs and let s be clear when i talk about infrastructure and clean water we re talking about strengthening clean water laws so that corporate polluters stop poisoning the drinking water that communities in iowa and across the country rely on today we say to the parents in this country that you and your kids deserve quality affordable childcare the children are our future and they deserve the best possible head start in life with a high quality universal pre k program today we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can regardless of the income of your family good jobs require a good education that is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially lower the outrageous level of student debt that currently exists america once had the best educated workforce in the world and we are going to make that happen again today we say to our senior citizens that we understand that you cannot live in dignity when you are trying to survive on 13 000 or 14 000 a year in social security benefits my republican colleagues want to cut social security but we have some bad news for them we re not going to cut social security benefits we re going to expand them today we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry that climate change is not a hoax but is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet and we intend to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy and in the process create millions of good paying jobs all of us have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren is healthy and habitable today we say to the prison industrial complex that we are going to bring about real criminal justice reform we are going to end the international embarrassment of having more people in jail than any other country on earth instead of spending 80 billion a year on jails and incarceration we are going to invest in jobs and education for our young people no more private prisons and detention centers no more profiteering from locking people up no more war on drugs no more keeping people in jail because they re too poor to afford cash bail and by the way when we talk about criminal justice reform we re going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every year get criminal records for possessing marijuana but not one major wall street executive went to jail for destroying our economy in 2008 as a result of their greed recklessness and illegal behavior no they didn t go to jail they got a trillion dollar bailout today we say to the american people that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country we re going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship we re going to provide legal status to the 1 8 million young people eligible for the daca program and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum no more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers today we say to the top 1 percent and the large profitable corporations in this country people who have never had it so good that under a bernie sanders administration we re going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that you currently enjoy we will no longer accept the absurd situation where large corporations like amazon netflix and general motors pay nothing in federal income taxes after raking in billions in profits we will no longer tolerate the situation in which the wealthy and large corporations stash billions in tax havens throughout the world yes the wealthy and multi national corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes we are going to end austerity for working families and provide some austerity for large multi national corporations today we say to the military industrial complex that we will not continue to spend 700 billion a year on the military more than the next ten nations combined we re going to invest in affordable housing we re going to invest in public education we re going to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure not more nuclear weapons and never ending wars brothers and sisters we re going to win this election not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires we re going to win this election because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of american politics donald trump wants to divide us up by the color of our skin our country of origin our gender our religion and our sexual orientation we are going to do exactly the opposite we are going to bring our people together black white latino native american asian american gay and straight young and old men and women native born and immigrant we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots effort which i am happy to tell you already has over one million people signed up as volunteers brothers and sisters as someone who represents vermont one of the most rural states in the country let me be very honest with you in saying that the u s congress has for too long ignored the many crises facing rural america in iowa in vermont and all over this country we have seen more and more young people leave the small towns they grew up in and love not because they dont want to stay but because there are fewer and fewer jobs that pay a living wage we have seen schools churches and community centers shut down and once vibrant main streets become boarded up and deserted in vermont iowa and all across rural america we have seen family farmers go out of business as the prices they receive for their products decline rapidly and large agri business corporations and factory farming take over agriculture we have seen rural hospitals and nursing homes shut down and not enough doctors to provide the quality health care that rural american deserves tragically instead of seeing good jobs education and health care coming into our rural communities we are far too often seeing despair and depression and a terrible increase in suicide and opioid addiction brothers and sisters we need policies for rural america that represent the needs of working people and farmers not agri business and multi national corporations among many other things that need to be done is for the federal government to enforce anti trust laws and i will appoint an attorney general who will do just that it is not acceptable to me that the top four packing companies control more than 80 percent of the beef market 63 percent of the pork market and 53 percent of the chicken market and these numbers understate the situation in many communities there really is only one buyer which means food producers are at their mercy they must use that corporations feed and livestock they must accept that corporations costs and they must accept that corporations lower and lower payment rates in many cases the farmer doesnt even own the livestock or supplies they are effectively contract employees who are forced to lease everything and then get paid an inadequate wage for their very hard work with the federal government not enforcing antitrust laws we have seen mergers like the bayer monsanto approved giving the two largest conglomerates 78 percent of the corn seed market further instead of protecting family owned farms federal support for agriculture is skewed toward huge farms the top 10 percent of farms currently receive 77 percent of all subsidies the time is long overdue for the u s government to stand with rural america and that is exactly what i do brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society and we ve had some successes together as billionaires and large corporations have attacked unions destroyed pensions deregulated the banks and slashed wages we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to 15 in states and cities across the country and forced large corporations like amazon and disney to do the same and we have supported teachers who successfully stood up for their kids in strike after strike after strike together as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars we have stood arm in arm to fight back for the first time in 45 years we have utilized the war powers act to move us forward in ending the horrific saudi led war in yemen together as so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses we have fought to end the war on drugs and have seen state after state decriminalize marijuana and have seen communities expunge the criminal records of those arrested on these charges lets be honest while we have won some victories our struggles have not always been successful but i am here to tell you that because of all the work we have done we are now on the brink of winning not just an election but transforming our country and let me tell you what that means when we are in the white house we will enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job there is more than enough work to be done in this country let s do it when we are in the white house we will not only end the decline of rural america but attack the problem of urban gentrification and build the affordable housing we desperately need all across this country when we are in the white house we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want people who should not have guns will not have guns when we are in the white house we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist overall in our nation but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists not only will we end voter suppression we are going to make it easier for people to vote not harder when we are in the white house we are going to protect a womans right to control her own body that is her decision not the government s make no mistake about it this struggle is not just about defeating donald trump this struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country and im talking about wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the military industrial complex agri business the prison industrial complex the fossil fuel industry and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables billionaires to buy elections these powerful special interests are going to spend a lot of money to try to defeat us but we have something they dont have the power of the people brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us but this what i believe if we stand together if we don t allow trump and his friends to divide us up if we stand together as black and white latino asian american and native american if we stand together as gay and straight men and women native born and immigrant if we stand together as rural and urban north south east and west if we understand that there really is no such thing as blue state or red state but states throughout the country where working people are struggling to survive if we stand together this country has an extraordinary future let s make it happen
toronto march 07 2019 globe newswire yamana gold inc tsx yri nyse auy yamana glencore international ag lse glen jse gln glencore and goldcorp inc goldcorp tsx g nyse gg collectively the parties are pleased to announce the signing of an integration agreement the agreement pursuant to which the agua rica project would be developed and operated using the existing infrastructure and facilities of minera alumbrera limited alumbrera in the catamarca province of argentina the parties believe the integration of the agua rica project and the alumbrera mine the integrated project has significant merit given the proximity of the assets and the potential to realize significant synergies by taking full advantage of existing infrastructure associated with the alumbrera mine for the development and operation of agua rica agua rica hosts a large scale long life copper mineral resource with associated gold silver and molybdenum while the alumbrera infrastructure is of significant scale and configuration that is ideally suited for the integration plan preliminary studies show the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal 1 including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the first 10 years of operation this is based on the agua rica mineral reserve 2 estimated to contain proven and probable mineral reserves of approximately 4 5 million tonnes 10 billion pounds of copper and 6 5 million ounces of gold contained in approximately 910 million tonnes of ore the agreement represents a significant step forward towards the optimization of agua rica the alumbrera infrastructure including the existing infrastructure for concentrate logistics located in northern argentina between the mine site and the port presents a unique opportunity to enhance project economics while also reducing both the project complexity and environmental footprint the parties have established a technical committee to direct the review and evaluation of the integrated project it is expected that a pre feasibility study for the integrated project will be completed in 2019 and that a full feasibility study with updated mineral reserve production and project cost estimates will be completed by 2020 this will provide the framework for the submission of a new environmental impact assessment eia to the authorities of the catamarca province and for the continued engagement with local stakeholders and communities the parties have been working together with key government stakeholders to support a path forward for the evaluation and development of the integrated project an agreement has been reached with the catamarca state mining company catamarca minera y energética

and pigeons bearish central bankers are holding their fire hitting a pause button one by one and spooking the markets in the process investors are anxious because of the evidence that global economic growth is slowing with the world s central banks driving home that point the federal reserve earlier announced it would pause for now in its rate hiking cycle followed by the bank of canada this week and the european central bank thursday the ecb sparked a market downdraft promising to hold rates steady for the rest of this year offering funds to the banking system and cutting its outlook for economic growth in the region to just 1 1 per cent in 2019 the ecb set the cat among the pigeons spooking markets with an indication that the euro zone economy is going to get worse before it gets better ig chief market analyst chris beauchamp said as stocks tumbled thursday despite their barnstorming performance since christmas markets remain acutely sensitive to hints that the economic situation will worsen and as a result we re seeing far more than tiny steps from indices here s where things stand the fed the u s central bank hit its pause button earlier abruptly ending a rate hiking cycle and prompting analysts to cut their few of how many more times it will move some economists believe the fed will make one more move this year depending of course on how things play out we judge inflation will need to pick up from its current pace to a bit above 2 per cent before the fed acts again bank of montreal deputy chief economist michael gregory and senior economist jennifer lee said in a forecast thursday the anticipated post q1 growth profile amid an already positive output gap should do the trick in prodding a bit more inflation pressure they added projecting too that the

then of course things got ugly with the latest numbers showing canada s economy expanded in the fourth quarter at an annual pace of just 04 per cent and analysts calling for a first quarter also with just about no growth business investment and the housing market stumbled with consumers shopping at a much slower pace as well so the central bank called a halt this week holding its benchmark overnight rate at 1 75 per cent and saying it will hold the line until things get better as the globe and mail s barrie mckenna reports deputy governor lynn patterson drove home that point in a talk with a business audience thursday saying the central bank was surprised at the sudden economic shift observers have now cut their expectations for rate increases with bmo still suggesting one more this year amid chatter the bank of canada could even roll back some of the moves it made earlier governor poloz watered down his hiking bias and speech by deputy governor patterson did little to change the market s dovish perception said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes the bank of canada is holding on to the narrative that there will still be rotation in demand away from consumption and housing and toward business investment and exports strong enough to justify an eventual move towards their 3 per cent neutral rate he added but given that recent data releases don t reflect any evidence of that happening just yet and the fact that there s still more pain to come as the economy digests past rate hikes the bank of canada will likely have to lower their signs even further in the months to come the canadian dollar has tumbled in the wake of the fourth quarter numbers as markets expect less from the central bank the ecb the ecb officially joined the growing roster of growingly cautious central banks offering more help to support growth and keeping rates lower for longer said bmo s ms lee central bank chief mario draghi said the ecb won t be raising rates until next year at the earliest and the money for the banking system also sent a message of just how cautious he and his colleagues are if as seems entirely possible the euro zone economy takes a further turn for the worse the ecb doesn t have much room for manoeuvre on interest rates said john higgins chief markets economist at capital economics and it has fewer options that other central banks when it comes to providing additional unconventional monetary stimulus the bank of england governor mark carney is at the mercy of how brexit plays out whether parliament approves what prime minister theresa may wants whether there s a delay in quitting the eu or whether britain leaves the union with no deal the so called hard brexit open this photo in gallery prime minister theresa maytoby melville reuters time is running out or it already has said bmo s mr gregory and ms lee the boe does not meeting until march 21 and it will be interesting to see if given the heightened uncertainty it still believes it is appropriate to have ongoing tightening over the forecast period they added referring to earlier comments one of the hawks on the michael saunders has already downplayed it we no longer believe a rate hike is warranted and now see the bank on hold over the next two years bank of japan japan has its own issues and has for some time now and it s almost worth not talking about the central bank s outlook given that it s going to do nothing the boj has been perched on the sidelines for a long time hesitant to raise rates in the face of still disappointing growth and a clear lack of inflationary pressure said mr gregory and ms lee open this photo in gallery bank of japan governor haruhiko kurodaissei kato reuters governor kuroda continues to hint about exiting but is extremely cautious he borrowed from the federal reserve s word wall recently saying that the boj will be patient as it maintains its massive stimulus program to keep inflation heading

today is the canadian economy a dead parrot or like the one in the monte python skit maybe its just resting since today s jobs data seem to suggest that there s a lot of life left in it said cibc chief economist avery shenfeld while there s nothing in this that spells a rate hike any time soon the market might rethink the idea that the next move is sure to be a cut he added the u s in turn

new gdp target range that puts guidance as low as 6 to as high as 6 5 china is officially slowing the 6 target is the lowest target set since the great recession of 2009 u s companies based there say they are expecting lower profits this year as a result of changing economic dynamics in the world s no 2 economy the high end target of 6 5 gdp growth suggests beijing has no plan for a 2009 style stimulus package either investors have been daring china to increase stimulus driving up mainland equity prices since the start of the year premier li keqiang delivered his gdp target to the national party congress in beijing on tuesday more stimulus is coming even if it is not the kind of bridges to nowhere and shadow banking stimulus that propped up chinese markets for over a decade xi jinping appears to have no appetite for increasing leverage china is shifting focus to improving growth says meghan shue senior investment strategist for wilmington trust a de emphasis on leverage concerns and an increased emphasis on tax cuts for example would be encouraging for emerging market equities over the next 9 12 months some of the newest fiscal stimulus measures include lower taxes and corporate pension payments getting cut by nearly 2 trillion yuan the manufacturing sector will see their value added tax vat rate go to 13 from 16 and on the trade war front there is a proposal that would give foreign entities the same rights as domestic entities when doing business in china chalk that up as a quiet win for the americans in the ongoing trade spat between the two sides china s economy has been showing signs of a slowdown for years u s companies are no longer seeing the big profits from china compared with the rest of the world worsening industry conditions and increased costs are also factors driving down profits u s technology companies say their profitability is being hampered by competition from privately owned chinese companies according to a survey published this month by the american chamber of commerce of china earnings before interest and taxes or ebit margins are now lower in china than the rest of the world for more than a third of amcham s members thirty six percent of them reported lower ebit margins in china than globally in 2018 about the same proportion as in 2016 china is still a top priority for american companies but slower economic growth uncertainty over the trade war and modern china s tighter regulatory and labor laws all have executives expecting lower returns this year china is more expensive than it was 10 years ago the

the following are excerpts from an interview with stalin pérez borges a union leader and veteran socialist militant in venezuela he is a member of the unitarian unionist chavista league luchas and of the bolivarian socialist workers central cbst advisory council the original appeared in spanish on feb 7 that is long before the feb 23 showdown on the border translated by pedro alvarez from aporrea entire interview tinyurl com y4tknu43 social and economic crisis in venezuela the economic and social crisis has grown exponentially for five years and has gotten to this rotten state of hyper inflation that we re barely coping with this is the cause for the huge discontent that we have at this stage and for the important change in the correlation of political power in this juncture this is a consequence of three fundamental facts two of them circumstantial and one structural the circumstantial causes are first the economic sabotage and blockade described by the government as economic warfare this factor is the main determinant in the current economic and social situation the trade exclusion and the blockade have caused a stagnation of 80 percent of what little was being produced in the country s industries it has also led to plummeting in the high levels of imports of food medicines raw materials and machinery it is also the cause of the hoarding and the fact that unscrupulous traders can set the price for all sorts of commodities including the u s dollar the second circumstantial cause is corruption ineptitude and impunity which have soared in the past five years the level of corruption and ineptitude government functionaries is major and damaging in many cases it coincides with the sabotage by the elites and imperialists with the complicity of military and civilian functionaries regarding the speculative value of the market price of commodities that the people need the structural problem is that the national productive capacity is very low this is also determined by the historic high level of oil income which turned the local bourgeoisie into a very parasitic social class always dependent on the price of oil they prefer to import rather than produce or export under chávez despite some appropriate programs and plans to improve the development of national industry this largely remained on paper the levels of national production needed were never made a reality under chávez from 2007 to 2012 that low production capacity didn t produce discontent as the high price of oil was enough to import even luxury goods but from 2013 to date with maduro a high price has been paid for this mistake with the decreasing price of oil there is no money for imports nor for the national industry including transnational companies to receive the dollars that they used to be guaranteed due to the currency controls the struggle of these sectors to seize a share of that income is the main reason why the conspiracies and the fight to the death haven t stopped in 20 years of chavista governments and it is here making use of this situation that yankee and european interests also play a role scope and class character of the jan 23 opposition the opposition s demonstrations on jan 23 were impressively big those in caracas and valencia surprised both them and others that has encouraged the opposition the right wing segments had largely surrendered after the elections for the congress anc since the election until jan 23 they were absent at street demonstrations they were focused on media campaigns against the government taking advantage of the growing discontent because the government hasn t been able to provide measures to successfully counter the economic warfare and they focused on the complicity of corrupt bureaucrats who have allowed speculation in the commercial sector as solutions president maduro has implemented distribution of food packages carried out by the local committees of distribution and production clap and also compensation bonuses and continuous increases to the minimum wage and food ticket for workers these are progressive measures but they have not been enough to cover the loss of purchasing power of workers salaries so the right wing demonstrations of jan 23 included the usual social base of middle class people plus some segments of workers including some unions that earlier this year identified with chavismo chavistas organized spectacular demonstrations after jan 23 the opposition made big efforts to turn out the same number of people or more as on that day in caracas and valencia they demonstrated again on feb 2 but it wasn t the same in numbers or expectations as on jan 23 meanwhile the chavista demonstration on jan 23 in caracas was very well attended the feeling among the government sympathizing popular class is very strong on january 28 29 30 31 and feb 1 and 2 chavistas organized surprisingly spectacular demonstrations in more than six cities the feb 2 demonstration in caracas was attended by large numbers of people similar to those during the best days of chavismo so currently we have a chavismo that is more motivated to take the offensive against the coup or invasion plans there are no visible signs of grassroots self organizing the united socialist party of venezuela psuv and government structures are leading these demonstrations the strong presence of youth is striking internal rupture within the army since before jan 10 the opposition and high ranking members of the trump administration u s senators and some governments like those of ivan duque in colombia jair bolsonaro in brazil mauricio macri in argentina and luis almagro from the organization of american states oas have been waiting for the push for maduro s fall to come from segments of the bolivarian national army forces fanb however until now that has failed they have offered fanb members large sums of money and promises of amnesty and appointment to high positions ever since guaidó proclaimed himself interim president this usurper s main proposition is aimed at members of the army promoting a supposed amnesty law in favor of soldiers who rebel against maduro s government no signs have been seen inside or outside the fanb that a force may appear which is capable of risking a suicidal venture on the side of imperialism and its lackeys in the opposition imperialism s strategy imperialism s aim has always been to oust the chavista government at any cost since the moment maduro came to power in 2013 they started the plan to oust him currently they are acting with more urgency they need to put an end to maduro and the bolivarian revolution the cycle of instability and the progressive and more or less sovereign governments that arose in our continent after chávez kicked off the revolutionary process and started governing with lenin moreno s treason in ecuador and having regained complete control in brazil and argentina and with a favorable balance of forces in the region imperialism does the rest they want to oust maduro and defeat the bolivarian process with the least possible political cost but if they don t achieve this in the short term they will try to do it at any cost trump represents a segment of imperialism that desperately wants the u s to seize global economic political and military hegemony they want to recover economic financial and industrial supremacy which they have been losing to china their power is mainly military anti imperialist sentiment deep the anti imperialist sentiment of our people is historic and it runs very deep it will be difficult to defeat us it will be hard to convince a majority of the workers and poor people to accept the raising of the u s flag as guaidó and the right wing political leaders who are with him have done in their public demonstrations since the oil strike of 1936 which almost became a national strike against the british and yankees and the military dictatorship a very deep anti imperialist sentiment has grown it was rebuilt or revived for more than 15 years with chávez s message a rebellious sentiment appeared here that hasn t stopped since feb 27 and 28 1989 this found expression in the decisive fearless struggle of april 13 2002 when an attempted military coup against chávez was defeated and it was demonstrated in the response to the bosses strike and oil sabotage from december 2002 to january 2003 and in all the resistance we have carried out not letting the right wing oust maduro by force the government continues to pay on the foreign debt in the middle of this imperialist economic blockade it hasn t touched any monopolies such as the polar group and others when these same monopolies hoard food stocks or distribute them arbitrarily and overpriced living in valencia the country s main industrial city and being a unionist i can say that its industrial zones are almost paralyzed that there are stagnant or nearly stagnant industrial sectors that working conditions safety and salaries in important sectors such as energy oil health and education have suffered to worrisome levels capacity of venezuelan gov t popular militias to resist in a public statement by luchas we urgently requested the dispatch of army officials and soldiers to at least 11 000 zones so that they can live with the communities and organize the military aspect of anti imperialist resistance we need to make the civilian military alliance a reality in the community in that statement we said in this context we encourage the people and workers to voluntarily join the 50 000 popular defense units in all neighborhoods cities and corners of the country for them to back up and strengthen an integral defense of the motherland which president maduro has asked to implement popular militias or those popular defense units are a work in process the venezuelan national militia has existed for years there are already 2 million militia members many of whom are being called on to integrate other army forces as active permanent soldiers it s said that the weapons capacity of the army is very modern and the army has good logistics and respectable professionalism we also call for the formation of simón bolívar international brigades of solidarity with venezuela and we call for 1 the world federation of trade unions wftu national unions federations and other social movements and organizations around the world to trade in medicines food and raw materials with the legitimate government of president maduro and or with union and social organizations of venezuela and 2 the social organizations of latin america to organize solidarity caravans and come here through our borders with colombia and brazil nationalization expropriation if doesn t act soon resolving the consequences of its stagnation in these economic and social aspects it will do more damage than any missile or incoming imperialist humanitarian aid if it doesn t control problems effectively and for the long term such as currency exchange speculation supply shortages and the price of food and medicines or encourage the national production of goods and services in mid term it will lose its social base and find it difficult to survive among other measures it has to stop paying the foreign debt block capital flight impose progressive taxation on assets and promote the distribution and control of goods by a communal state run by the workers otherwise we will fail let me finish this interview with our motto fight fight don t stop fighting for a government of the workers and of the people

the ecb s move highlights a shift in global central bank policy thinking and a distinct move away from a tightening bias anemic global growth has forced policymakers to reassess policy guidelines and pivot back to accommodative and loose monetary policy programs in a bid to stimulate economic development this shift has cushioned the fallout from the federal reserves move to a neutral policy

by dennis miller the government surprised the world in 2008 when the fed bailed out the banks at the expense of seniors and savers the fed dropped interest rates to historic lows while buying u s treasuries and bad loans through their quantitative easing qe program seniors and savers lost over 4 trillion in interest income they would have normally received the stock market tanked investors desperately searching for yield redeployed their money into the market and higher risk bonds retirees had to take on more risk in order to survive former fed chair ben bernanke called the consequences collateral damage seniors and baby boomers called it catastrophic damage as they downsized and altered their retirement plans since the 2016 election the fed raised rates 8 times in january 2019 they held rates but continue to sell off mortgages and treasuries it appears the fed is starting a u turn and we could soon see more qe chuck butler reports about the recent fed announcement the fed s fomc meeting ended with no rate hike and a short speech by fed chairman jerome powell the rate hikes might be on pause for a while and he sees the first rate cut in 2020 investors were blindsided last time this time around if we are not prepared it s our own fault do we really want more qe chuck predicted the u turn for quite some time it s time to talk with the master fed guru dennis chuck once again on behalf of our readers thanks for taking your time for our education qe was different it was more than a normal rate adjustment it included buying bad debts from banks and private companies i d like to unbundle that for a minute capitalism depends on rewarding those who do well and punishing those for making bad decisions i ve received hundreds of emails complaining about the fed while no one praised the fed saying they were better off today i agree with bill bonner when he says the fix was in and whether the man on the street knows how it worked or not he s beginning to resent it who really benefitted from qe by bailing out the banks and companies like ge didn t the fed reward incompetence at the expense of hard working taxpayers it s no wonder socialists scream capitalism doesn t work chuck thank you dennis for another invitation to speak to your readers i want to say this up front so it doesn t get mixed up with what else i have to say woodrow wilson shoved the fed down american s throats in 1913 i know we both agree the country would be better off more prosperous and less in trouble if we had never had a federal reserve i ve never viewed the 2008 fiasco as a failure of the free markets it was instead an abject failure of policymaking of government policy and central bank doctrine and methods martin wolf financial times ok i got that off my chest while i ve done a lot of studying of austrian economics i m nowhere near an expert however i do know my way around the ballpark to answer your first question as you pointed out last week wall street and the investor class reaped the greatest benefit of qe things have changed since the banks were allowed to become brokerage investment houses gillian tett warned us at the last count america s top five banks controlled 47 of banking assets compared with 44 in 2007 and the top 1 of mutual funds have 45 of assets headlines are saying the fed chair powell capitulated to wall street that should not be a surprise as to your second question i would say that is correct in a normal economy free of government and central bank intervention you experience booms and busts when excess builds it corrects with a recession cleaning out the excesses allowing bad companies to fail strong companies to thrive and the economy rebuilds once again since alan greenspan was fed chairman we ve not experienced anything like a normal boom bust economy we ve seen bailouts the greenspan put quantitative easing zero interest rate policies and so on taxpayers bailed out bad companies the economy wasn t allowed to clean out the excesses things today are worse than they were 10 years ago with regards to debt derivatives leveraged loans etc we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this might sound heartless but last year marked the 10th anniversary of the financial meltdown had we done what we used to do yes it would have been painful but it would be past us now had the fed government not intervened dennis the majority of the public opposed the bailouts our mutual friend economist john mauldin told me some prominent congressmen confided they would support more bank bailouts just don t call it qe they were ok bailing out the banks as long as they had some political cover the government has a great incentive to keep rates down every 1 increase adds 200 billion to the deficit chuck that concerns me is there anything we can do politically should we be focusing on trying to survive another round chuck unfortunately no sure we can gather up large groups of people like the tea party and make some noise in the end did they succeed at what they wanted done no should a central bank be raising rates so late in an expansionary cycle no the fed is only hiking rates right now to have some cushion to cut them in the next recession which by the way is right around the corner dennis the low interest rates blew up most pension plans many states are virtually bankrupt due to underfunded pensions mike maloney s videoreports a record number of companies that can t even pay the interest on their debts if the fed follows suit like last time could qe4 qe5 called something else do even more harm i don t think the public wants to see private companies bailed out chuck well that depends if you ve worked for or owned stock in ge for example you are a stakeholder you would appreciate a bailout but your next door neighbor sure isn t going to like it the law of unintended consequencesactions of people and especially of government always have effects that are unanticipated and or unintended we will likely see the fed continue in the same path i agree with mike maloney and to answer your question yes it will do more harm once again companies and individuals will load up with inexpensive debt the problem with debt is that it has to be repaid or defaulted on the congressional budget office cbo just announced that we ll be adding 1 trillion per year on top of the current 22 trillion and that s if everything goes right next meltdown we could very well be seeing 2 trillion annually added to our national debt russia china and even japan on a smaller size are dumping u s treasuries not buying who s going to buy all that debt issuance in the future the fed will just print dollars to buy the bonds while loading up ben bernanke s helicopter with all that money supply what do you believe will happen to the dollar i think you all know high inflation dennis one last question pundits use the term extend and pretend kick the problems down the road prolonging the inevitable correction that must take place when excess debt comes to a boil if more qe is coming wall street may be cheering today and crying tomorrow when the inevitable crash comes we got blindsided last time what should investors do to protect themselves this time around chuck dennis i hate to be sounding like a doom and gloom guy i just call them the way i see them when you play poker you look at your cards and decide to either fold or play what was given to you the one silver lining is we shouldn t be blindsided this time you and i have been warning readers in the daily pfennig i called the housing bubble 4 full years before the markets began to notice a problem in housing readers might get tired of the warning but many are taking heed we have time to make certain our stop losses are up to date i did some research a year ago and found a study of stock performance during a recession and it was ugly not just ugly tree ugly i m talking the whole darn forest ugly so you can see that getting these stop losses in place is a good idea there is never a bad time to sell stock and take a profit look at your allocation in gold silver both have been stuck in the mud for some time and look ready to breakout to the upside a market crash presents opportunities to find some real bargains just be patient i really want to end on a positive note so spend time with your loved ones hug them tell them you love them i m serious here when things get ugly and they will it s comforting knowing you are loved and you love someone thanks again for the opportunity to share my thoughts dennis here wow not much i can add to that if we have more extend and pretend we need to remain patient in the meantime enjoy the ride knowing you are prepared should another bailout appear imminent i will once again write my elected representatives chuck s free daily newsletter the daily pfennig is highly recommended for more information check out my website or follow me on facebook until next time dennis www milleronthemoney com
thank you all very much for being here tonight and thank you for being part of a political revolution which will transform america thank you for being part of a campaign which is not only going to win the democratic nomination which is not only going to defeat donald trump the most dangerous president in modern american history but with your help is going to transform this country and finally create an economy and government which works for all americans and not just the one percent today i want to welcome you to a campaign which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed kleptocracy hatred and lies it will not be racism sexism xenophobia homophobia and religious bigotry all of that is going to end the principles of our government will be based on justice economic justice social justice racial justice and environmental justice tonight i want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of wall street corporate america and the billionaire class greed which has resulted in this country having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth no we will no longer stand idly by and allow 3 people in this country to own more wealth than the bottom half of america while at the same time nearly 20 percent of our children live in poverty veterans sleep out on the streets and seniors cannot afford their prescription drugs we will no longer accept 46 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent while millions of americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs just to survive and over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck frightened to death about what happens to them financially if their car breaks down or their child becomes sick together we are going to create a political system which is based on the democratic principles of one person one vote and end a corrupt system which allows billionaires to buy elections yes we are going to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections today we fight for a political revolution and tonight i want to offer a very special thanks to the people of the great state of iowa in 2016 this is where the political revolution began thank you iowa when i first came here to campaign in 2015 not a whole lot of people knew who i was nobody took our campaign seriously and we were at 3 percent in the polls further the ideas that we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme ideas they said that nobody in america would support raising the minimum wage to a living wage too radical guaranteeing health care to all as a right not a privilege too radical creating up to 15 million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure with a one trillion dollar investment too radical aggressively combatting climate change too radical reforming our broken criminal justice and immigration systems too radical not taking money from super pacs and the rich too radical ending the power of super delegates at the democratic convention too radical well a funny thing happened in iowa over that year on caucus night we didn t win 3 of the vote we won 50 of the vote and half of the pledged delegates and that great start in iowa led us to win victories in 22 states around the country 13 million votes over 1700 delegates at the convention and more votes from young people black white latino asian american and native american than trump and clinton combined and by the way those ideas that we talked about 4 years years ago that seemed so very radical at that time well today virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the american people and have overwhelming support from democrats and independents and they re ideas that democratic candidates for president to school board are now supporting so iowa you helped begin the political revolution in 2016 and with your help on this campaign we are going to complete what we started here we re going to turn our vision and our progressive agenda into reality today as we launch our campaign here in iowa we say to the private health insurance companies whether you like it or not the united states will join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right all americans are entitled to go to the doctor when they re sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital we will no longer accept the absurdity of paying almost twice as much per capita on health care while we have a lower life expectancy and worse health care outcomes than many other countries the goal of health care must be to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way not tens of billions in profits for the insurance companies and outrageous compensation packages for ceos in 2017 the top 65 healthcare ceo s made 1 7 billion in compensation including 83 2 million to david wichmann the ceo of unitedhealth group and 58 7 million to mark bertolini the ceo of aetna we need a health care system that invests in disease prevention doctors nurses dentists and rural clinics we don t a system which makes insurance companies and their ceos super rich yes we will pass a medicare for all single payer program health care is a right and by the way our legislation improves health care for seniors by providing coverage for dental care hearing aids and eye glasses today we say to the pharmaceutical industry that you will no longer charge the american people the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs the result being that one out of five americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors prescribe seniors in this country should not have to cut their pills in half the outrageous greed of the pharmaceutical industry is going to end we are going to lower prescription drug prices in this country today we say to walmart the fast food industry and other low wage employers stop paying your employees starvation wages yes we are going to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage 15 an hour nobody who works 40 hours a week in this country should live in poverty and yes we re going to make it easier for people to join unions not harder four years ago when we talked about the idea of a 15 an hour minimum wage it seemed like an impossible dream well since then i m happy to tell you that 5 states have passed 15 an hour legislation and just yesterday the u s house committee on labor and education reported out a bill that will raise the federal minimum wage from 7 25 an hour to 15 an hour and i believe that bill will pass the full house within the month and by the way today we say to corporate america that artificial intelligence and robotics are not going to be used just to throw workers out on the street this exploding technology must serve human needs not just corporate profits today we say to the american people that we will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail system and subways our airports our water systems and wastewater plants and when we do that we create up to 13 million good paying jobs and let s be clear when i talk about infrastructure and clean water we re talking about strengthening clean water laws so that corporate polluters stop poisoning the drinking water that communities in iowa and across the country rely on today we say to the parents in this country that you and your kids deserve quality affordable childcare the children are our future and they deserve the best possible head start in life with a high quality universal pre k program today we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can regardless of the income of your family good jobs require a good education that is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially lower the outrageous level of student debt that currently exists america once had the best educated workforce in the world and we are going to make that happen again today we say to our senior citizens that we understand that you cannot live in dignity when you are trying to survive on 13 000 or 14 000 a year in social security benefits my republican colleagues want to cut social security but we have some bad news for them we re not going to cut social security benefits we re going to expand them today we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry that climate change is not a hoax but is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet and we intend to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy and in the process create millions of good paying jobs all of us have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren is healthy and habitable today we say to the prison industrial complex that we are going to bring about real criminal justice reform we are going to end the international embarrassment of having more people in jail than any other country on earth instead of spending 80 billion a year on jails and incarceration we are going to invest in jobs and education for our young people no more private prisons and detention centers no more profiteering from locking people up no more war on drugs no more keeping people in jail because they re too poor to afford cash bail and by the way when we talk about criminal justice reform we re going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every year get criminal records for possessing marijuana but not one major wall street executive went to jail for destroying our economy in 2008 as a result of their greed recklessness and illegal behavior no they didn t go to jail they got a trillion dollar bailout today we say to the american people that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country we re going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship we re going to provide legal status to the 1 8 million young people eligible for the daca program and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum no more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers today we say to the top 1 percent and the large profitable corporations in this country people who have never had it so good that under a bernie sanders administration we re going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that you currently enjoy we will no longer accept the absurd situation where large corporations like amazon netflix and general motors pay nothing in federal income taxes after raking in billions in profits we will no longer tolerate the situation in which the wealthy and large corporations stash billions in tax havens throughout the world yes the wealthy and multi national corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes we are going to end austerity for working families and provide some austerity for large multi national corporations today we say to the military industrial complex that we will not continue to spend 700 billion a year on the military more than the next ten nations combined we re going to invest in affordable housing we re going to invest in public education we re going to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure not more nuclear weapons and never ending wars brothers and sisters we re going to win this election not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires we re going to win this election because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of american politics donald trump wants to divide us up by the color of our skin our country of origin our gender our religion and our sexual orientation we are going to do exactly the opposite we are going to bring our people together black white latino native american asian american gay and straight young and old men and women native born and immigrant we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots effort which i am happy to tell you already has over one million people signed up as volunteers brothers and sisters as someone who represents vermont one of the most rural states in the country let me be very honest with you in saying that the u s congress has for too long ignored the many crises facing rural america in iowa in vermont and all over this country we have seen more and more young people leave the small towns they grew up in and love not because they don t want to stay but because there are fewer and fewer jobs that pay a living wage we have seen schools churches and community centers shut down and once vibrant main streets become boarded up and deserted in vermont iowa and all across rural america we have seen family farmers go out of business as the prices they receive for their products decline rapidly and large agri business corporations and factory farming take over agriculture we have seen rural hospitals and nursing homes shut down and not enough doctors to provide the quality health care that rural american deserves tragically instead of seeing good jobs education and health care coming into our rural communities we are far too often seeing despair and depression and a terrible increase in suicide and opioid addiction brothers and sisters we need policies for rural america that represent the needs of working people and farmers not agri business and multi national corporations among many other things that need to be done is for the federal government to enforce anti trust laws and i will appoint an attorney general who will do just that it is not acceptable to me that the top four packing companies control more than 80 percent of the beef market 63 percent of the pork market and 53 percent of the chicken market and these numbers understate the situation in many communities there really is only one buyer which means food producers are at their mercy they must use that corporation s feed and livestock they must accept that corporation s costs and they must accept that corporation s lower and lower payment rates in many cases the farmer doesn t even own the livestock or supplies they are effectively contract employees who are forced to lease everything and then get paid an inadequate wage for their very hard work with the federal government not enforcing antitrust laws we have seen mergers like the bayer monsanto approved giving the two largest conglomerates 78 percent of the corn seed market further instead of protecting family owned farms federal support for agriculture is skewed toward huge farms the top 10 percent of farms currently receive 77 percent of all subsidies the time is long overdue for the u s government to stand with rural america and that is exactly what i do brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society and we ve had some successes together as billionaires and large corporations have attacked unions destroyed pensions deregulated the banks and slashed wages we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to 15 in states and cities across the country and forced large corporations like amazon and disney to do the same and we have supported teachers who successfully stood up for their kids in strike after strike after strike together as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars we have stood arm in arm to fight back for the first time in 45 years we have utilized the war powers act to move us forward in ending the horrific saudi led war in yemen together as so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses we have fought to end the war on drugs and have seen state after state decriminalize marijuana and have seen communities expunge the criminal records of those arrested on these charges let s be honest while we have won some victories our struggles have not always been successful but i am here to tell you that because of all the work we have done we are now on the brink of winning not just an election but transforming our country and let me tell you what that means when we are in the white house we will enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job there is more than enough work to be done in this country let s do it when we are in the white house we will not only end the decline of rural america but attack the problem of urban gentrification and build the affordable housing we desperately need all across this country when we are in the white house we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want people who should not have guns will not have guns when we are in the white house we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist overall in our nation but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists not only will we end voter suppression we are going to make it easier for people to vote not harder when we are in the white house we are going to protect a woman s right to control her own body that is her decision not the government s make no mistake about it this struggle is not just about defeating donald trump this struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country and i m talking about wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the military industrial complex agri business the prison industrial complex the fossil fuel industry and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables billionaires to buy elections these powerful special interests are going to spend a lot of money to try to defeat us but we have something they don t have the power of the people brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us but this what i believe if we stand together if we don t allow trump and his friends to divide us up if we stand together as black and white latino asian american and native american if we stand together as gay and straight men and women native born and immigrant if we stand together as rural and urban north south east and west if we understand that there really is no such thing as blue state or red state but states throughout the country where working people are struggling to survive if we stand together this country has an extraordinary future let s make it happen
higher marginal tax rates on the rich have coincided with good times in america tax cuts are a key culprit in inequality when rep alexandria ocasio cortez proposed a 70 percent tax rate on the richest americans hysteria followed on the right and confusion in a fair portion of the media billionaire presidential candidate howard schultz i sonics condemned it and said the views of one of her advisers are un american in fact high marginal tax rates on top earners are as american as apple pie pizza and cheese and onion enchiladas first an important clarification a 70 percent marginal tax rate doesn t mean 70 percent of a high earner s income goes to uncle sam or to leftist fantasy programs as gop rep steve scalise put it instead people are taxed at different rates as they cross the threshold of each tax bracket today the united states has seven brackets the highest being 37 percent but simplifying to postpone your nap time you only pay that top rate on the extra dollars that rise above that level otherwise you ve been taxed at lower rates all the way up on 60 minutes ocasio cortez put it this way once you get to the tippy tops on your 10 millionth dollar sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent that doesn t mean all 10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more the top of the ladder folks paid high marginal rates for much of the 20th century it was 91 percent under republican president dwight eisenhower in the 1950s democrat john f kennedy campaigned on a tax cut to stimulate the economy which finally became law after his assassination the top rate after that cut was 70 percent where it mostly stayed until the election of republican ronald reagan in 1980 he also pushed for lower rates so the highest bracket fell to 50 percent it fell again to 28 percent in 1988 but was raised to 39 6 percent during the clinton administration in the 1990s since then the highest rate on the wealthiest has slightly yo yo d depending on republican cut or democratic raise control but 70 percent is hardly un american or radical indeed economists thomas piketty of the paris school of economics emmanuel saez at the university of california berkeley and stefanie stantcheva of harvard endorse an even higher rate today the united states ranks 39th in top marginal rates some broad brush strokes accompany the rate changes the high top tax rates coincided with the best years of the nation s middle class every group of american earners saw their incomes rise inequality was lower the federal government invested heavily in science infrastructure low income housing and education the economy grew strongly but that s not the whole story the parting of incomes began not under reagan but in the mid 1970s the causes are still debated but included oil embargoes along with slow growth and high inflation stagflation reagan promised a different approach but this too is more complex than comic strip history while reagan s tax cuts probably didn t raise any more money than had jimmy carter won re election deregulation by reagan and carter unleashed a massive restructuring of american industry a huge assist came from paul volcker s federal reserve which defeated high inflation with a painful recession the upturn of the business cycle was goosed by mergers the rise of the tech sector and especially the arms buildup against the soviet union the result was the longest economic expansion in american history until it was eclipsed by the 1990s boom under bill clinton s higher tax rates clinton s increase didn t kill the economy as critics warned yet not all was well most americans saw their income stagnating or growing very slowly except for a small time late in the 1990s this was a sharp difference from the late 1940s through the mid 1970s the very richest pocketed enormous income gains since 1980 the wealthiest 10 percent s income share has grown steadily the share of the bottom 50 percent has fallen tax cuts on the rich including capital gains and estate taxes are at least partly to blame higher taxes on those at the top mean they pay a larger share of their income than less affluent households they have less to use in the wall street casino which often involves making money by moving money around rather than creating enterprises that hire people they make much of their incomes from investments rather than wages and stock prices often depend on cutting employment holding down paychecks for workers that remain and making job killing mergers the trump gop tax cuts also remind us how such rate reductions do little for economic growth a bloomberg analysis found that the stimulus was minimal while the effect on the deficit and debt was huge as bloomberg s tim mahedy wrote it s not that tax cuts don t matter it s that they don t matter much and that s just the view from gross domestic product tax cuts also bring opportunity costs the federal investments that don t get made the jobs that aren t created the wider public good from research and spending on health and schools that never happens one can t blame tax cuts on the rich entirely endless wars purblind globalization union busting deregulation lack of antitrust enforcement and the political influence of the wealthy have all led to a less equal less opportunity filled america technology advanced and many were left behind and things happened outside the realm of domestic politics such as the economic rise of other nations still today s extreme inequality is causing a backlash it s not only from some on the democratic left polls show at least 70 percent of respondents support raising taxes on the wealthy as with the green new deal to address climate change a tax increase stands little chance of becoming reality even with an elizabeth warren or bernie sanders presidency that s because red states may control the senate for many years about 25 republican majority states have less population than la county but california has only two senators those red states have 50 still many years is not forever politics is fluid at times of fear and discontent pendulums swing and people such as jeff bezos and bill gates would still be very rich but a little less so history shows the economy won t be worse off and might be much better

thank you all very much for being here tonight and thank you for being part of a political revolution which will transform america thank you for being part of a campaign which is not only going to win the democratic nomination which is not only going to defeat donald trump the most dangerous president in modern american history but with your help is going to transform this country and finally create an economy and government which works for all americans and not just the one percent today i want to welcome you to a campaign which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed kleptocracy hatred and lies it will not be racism sexism xenophobia homophobia and religious bigotry all of that is going to end the principles of our government will be based on justice economic justice social justice racial justice and environmental justice tonight i want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of wall street corporate america and the billionaire class greed which has resulted in this country having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth no we will no longer stand idly by and allow 3 people in this country to own more wealth than the bottom half of america while at the same time nearly 20 percent of our children live in poverty veterans sleep out on the streets and seniors cannot afford their prescription drugs we will no longer accept 46 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent while millions of americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs just to survive and over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck frightened to death about what happens to them financially if their car breaks down or their child becomes sick together we are going to create a political system which is based on the democratic principles of one person one vote and end a corrupt system which allows billionaires to buy elections yes we are going to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections today we fight for a political revolution and tonight i want to offer a very special thanks to the people of the great state of iowa in 2016 this is where the political revolution began thank you iowa when i first came here to campaign in 2015 not a whole lot of people knew who i was nobody took our campaign seriously and we were at 3 percent in the polls further the ideas that we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme ideas they said that nobody in america would support raising the minimum wage to a living wage too radical guaranteeing health care to all as a right not a privilege too radical creating up to 15 million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure with a one trillion dollar investment too radical aggressively combatting climate change too radical reforming our broken criminal justice and immigration systems too radical not taking money from super pacs and the rich too radical ending the power of super delegates at the democratic convention too radical well a funny thing happened in iowa over that year on caucus night we didn t win 3 of the vote we won 50 of the vote and half of the pledged delegates and that great start in iowa led us to win victories in 22 states around the country 13 million votes over 1700 delegates at the convention and more votes from young people black white latino asian american and native american than trump and clinton combined and by the way those ideas that we talked about 4 years years ago that seemed so very radical at that time well today virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the american people and have overwhelming support from democrats and independents and they re ideas that democratic candidates for president to school board are now supporting so iowa you helped begin the political revolution in 2016 and with your help on this campaign we are going to complete what we started here we re going to turn our vision and our progressive agenda into reality today as we launch our campaign here in iowa we say to the private health insurance companies whether you like it or not the united states will join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right all americans are entitled to go to the doctor when they re sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital we will no longer accept the absurdity of paying almost twice as much per capita on health care while we have a lower life expectancy and worse health care outcomes than many other countries the goal of health care must be to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way not tens of billions in profits for the insurance companies and outrageous compensation packages for ceos in 2017 the top 65 healthcare ceo s made 1 7 billion in compensation including 83 2 million to david wichmann the ceo of unitedhealth group and 58 7 million to mark bertolini the ceo of aetna we need a health care system that invests in disease prevention doctors nurses dentists and rural clinics we don t a system which makes insurance companies and their ceos super rich yes we will pass a medicare for all single payer program health care is a right and by the way our legislation improves health care for seniors by providing coverage for dental care hearing aids and eye glasses today we say to the pharmaceutical industry that you will no longer charge the american people the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs the result being that one out of five americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors prescribe seniors in this country should not have to cut their pills in half the outrageous greed of the pharmaceutical industry is going to end we are going to lower prescription drug prices in this country today we say to walmart the fast food industry and other low wage employers stop paying your employees starvation wages yes we are going to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage 15 an hour nobody who works 40 hours a week in this country should live in poverty and yes we re going to make it easier for people to join unions not harder four years ago when we talked about the idea of a 15 an hour minimum wage it seemed like an impossible dream well since then i m happy to tell you that 5 states have passed 15 an hour legislation and just yesterday the u s house committee on labor and education reported out a bill that will raise the federal minimum wage from 7 25 an hour to 15 an hour and i believe that bill will pass the full house within the month and by the way today we say to corporate america that artificial intelligence and robotics are not going to be used just to throw workers out on the street this exploding technology must serve human needs not just corporate profits today we say to the american people that we will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail system and subways our airports our water systems and wastewater plants and when we do that we create up to 13 million good paying jobs and let s be clear when i talk about infrastructure and clean water we re talking about strengthening clean water laws so that corporate polluters stop poisoning the drinking water that communities in iowa and across the country rely on today we say to the parents in this country that you and your kids deserve quality affordable childcare the children are our future and they deserve the best possible head start in life with a high quality universal pre k program today we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can regardless of the income of your family good jobs require a good education that is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially lower the outrageous level of student debt that currently exists america once had the best educated workforce in the world and we are going to make that happen again today we say to our senior citizens that we understand that you cannot live in dignity when you are trying to survive on 13 000 or 14 000 a year in social security benefits my republican colleagues want to cut social security but we have some bad news for them we re not going to cut social security benefits we re going to expand them today we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry that climate change is not a hoax but is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet and we intend to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy and in the process create millions of good paying jobs all of us have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren is healthy and habitable today we say to the prison industrial complex that we are going to bring about real criminal justice reform we are going to end the international embarrassment of having more people in jail than any other country on earth instead of spending 80 billion a year on jails and incarceration we are going to invest in jobs and education for our young people no more private prisons and detention centers no more profiteering from locking people up no more war on drugs no more keeping people in jail because they re too poor to afford cash bail and by the way when we talk about criminal justice reform we re going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every year get criminal records for possessing marijuana but not one major wall street executive went to jail for destroying our economy in 2008 as a result of their greed recklessness and illegal behavior no they didn t go to jail they got a trillion dollar bailout today we say to the american people that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country we re going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship we re going to provide legal status to the 1 8 million young people eligible for the daca program and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum no more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers today we say to the top 1 percent and the large profitable corporations in this country people who have never had it so good that under a bernie sanders administration we re going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that you currently enjoy we will no longer accept the absurd situation where large corporations like amazon netflix and general motors pay nothing in federal income taxes after raking in billions in profits we will no longer tolerate the situation in which the wealthy and large corporations stash billions in tax havens throughout the world yes the wealthy and multi national corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes we are going to end austerity for working families and provide some austerity for large multi national corporations today we say to the military industrial complex that we will not continue to spend 700 billion a year on the military more than the next ten nations combined we re going to invest in affordable housing we re going to invest in public education we re going to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure not more nuclear weapons and never ending wars brothers and sisters we re going to win this election not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires we re going to win this election because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of american politics donald trump wants to divide us up by the color of our skin our country of origin our gender our religion and our sexual orientation we are going to do exactly the opposite we are going to bring our people together black white latino native american asian american gay and straight young and old men and women native born and immigrant we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots effort which i am happy to tell you already has over one million people signed up as volunteers brothers and sisters as someone who represents vermont one of the most rural states in the country let me be very honest with you in saying that the u s congress has for too long ignored the many crises facing rural america in iowa in vermont and all over this country we have seen more and more young people leave the small towns they grew up in and love not because they don t want to stay but because there are fewer and fewer jobs that pay a living wage we have seen schools churches and community centers shut down and once vibrant main streets become boarded up and deserted in vermont iowa and all across rural america we have seen family farmers go out of business as the prices they receive for their products decline rapidly and large agri business corporations and factory farming take over agriculture we have seen rural hospitals and nursing homes shut down and not enough doctors to provide the quality health care that rural american deserves tragically instead of seeing good jobs education and health care coming into our rural communities we are far too often seeing despair and depression and a terrible increase in suicide and opioid addiction brothers and sisters we need policies for rural america that represent the needs of working people and farmers not agri business and multi national corporations among many other things that need to be done is for the federal government to enforce anti trust laws and i will appoint an attorney general who will do just that it is not acceptable to me that the top four packing companies control more than 80 percent of the beef market 63 percent of the pork market and 53 percent of the chicken market and these numbers understate the situation in many communities there really is only one buyer which means food producers are at their mercy they must use that corporation s feed and livestock they must accept that corporation s costs and they must accept that corporation s lower and lower payment rates in many cases the farmer doesn t even own the livestock or supplies they are effectively contract employees who are forced to lease everything and then get paid an inadequate wage for their very hard work with the federal government not enforcing antitrust laws we have seen mergers like the bayer monsanto approved giving the two largest conglomerates 78 percent of the corn seed market further instead of protecting family owned farms federal support for agriculture is skewed toward huge farms the top 10 percent of farms currently receive 77 percent of all subsidies the time is long overdue for the u s government to stand with rural america and that is exactly what i do brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society and we ve had some successes together as billionaires and large corporations have attacked unions destroyed pensions deregulated the banks and slashed wages we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to 15 in states and cities across the country and forced large corporations like amazon and disney to do the same and we have supported teachers who successfully stood up for their kids in strike after strike after strike together as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars we have stood arm in arm to fight back for the first time in 45 years we have utilized the war powers act to move us forward in ending the horrific saudi led war in yemen together as so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses we have fought to end the war on drugs and have seen state after state decriminalize marijuana and have seen communities expunge the criminal records of those arrested on these charges let s be honest while we have won some victories our struggles have not always been successful but i am here to tell you that because of all the work we have done we are now on the brink of winning not just an election but transforming our country and let me tell you what that means when we are in the white house we will enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job there is more than enough work to be done in this country let s do it when we are in the white house we will not only end the decline of rural america but attack the problem of urban gentrification and build the affordable housing we desperately need all across this country when we are in the white house we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want people who should not have guns will not have guns when we are in the white house we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist overall in our nation but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists not only will we end voter suppression we are going to make it easier for people to vote not harder when we are in the white house we are going to protect a woman s right to control her own body that is her decision not the government s make no mistake about it this struggle is not just about defeating donald trump this struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country and i m talking about wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the military industrial complex agri business the prison industrial complex the fossil fuel industry and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables billionaires to buy elections these powerful special interests are going to spend a lot of money to try to defeat us but we have something they don t have the power of the people brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us but this what i believe if we stand together if we don t allow trump and his friends to divide us up if we stand together as black and white latino asian american and native american if we stand together as gay and straight men and women native born and immigrant if we stand together as rural and urban north south east and west if we understand that there really is no such thing as blue state or red state but states throughout the country where working people are struggling to survive if we stand together this country has an extraordinary future let s make it happen

minera alumbrera limited alumbrera in the catamarca province of argentina the parties believe the integration of the agua rica project and the alumbrera mine the integrated project has significant merit given the proximity of the assets and the potential to realize significant synergies by taking full advantage of existing infrastructure associated with the alumbrera mine for the development and operation of agua rica agua rica hosts a large scale long life copper mineral resource with associated gold silver and molybdenum while the alumbrera infrastructure is of significant scale and configuration that is ideally suited for the integration plan preliminary studies show the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal 1 including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the first 10 years of operation this is based on the agua rica mineral reserve 2 estimated to contain proven and probable mineral reserves of approximately 4 5 million tonnes 10 billion pounds of copper and 6 5 million ounces of gold contained in approximately 910 million tonnes of ore the agreement represents a significant step forward towards the optimization of agua rica the alumbrera infrastructure including the existing infrastructure for concentrate logistics located in northern

synchronizes with the advancement of the integrated project and is funded with existing cash of alumbrera on reserve for reclamation activities yacimientos mineros de agua de dionisio ymad has indicated its support for the use of the alumbrera infrastructure for the integrated project finally the national government implemented a mechanism that was pending since the 2003 reform of the

good morning we appreciate you joining us today for our call to wrap up 2018 i m going to run through the business highlights then our cfo david martin will go through the financial aspects and then we will provide some additional comments on our recent strategic announcement before concluding with your questions to start off as you look back at the past couple of years i firmly believe titan international and our global team has accomplished a lot and the proof of that progress is evidenced in our financial results our 2018 sales ended over the 1 6 billion mark and up over 9 from last year but if you back out the negative impact of foreign currency we actually had an 11 revenue increase we moved our sale gains well through into ebitda where adjusted ebitda finished 2018 at 119 million representing a solid 64 increase over 2017 72 million that equates to an incremental adjusted ebitda margin of 35 this year keep in mind these top and bottom line gains came this year within a volatile business landscape that has seen tariff battles steel prices at decade highs sluggish commodity prices that have impacted farmer income and that s just to name a few of the challenges i can t say if this type of market environment represents the new normal or not but i do know that the financial improvements we posted in 2018 represent a really good year and definitely reflect our extensive efforts over the past couple of years as you may recall we laid out our original 2018 business outlook in november of 2017 as we were preparing to refinance our bonds when you look now considering the volatility of the current bond market we re very fortunate to have made that decision to get our bonds refinanced at 6 5 through 2023 so let s recap our 2018 performance against the updated outlook that we provided as i stated earlier our 2018 sales were up 9 or 11 excluding that negative impact of currency this compares favorably against our noted expectations of 9 to 12 growth ebitda was up 98 well within our guidelines of an 80 to 100 increase sg a came in much better at 9 1 of sales beating the 10 low end of our guidance by 14 million our gross profit improved this year by 24 we were only slightly below our outlook guidance by 2 million gross margin this year was of course impacted by raw materials we saw an ag market as i mentioned earlier that led us to some tougher pricing within many parts of the landscape that we compete in as the tariff battles continued to drag on we are all very familiar with those issues but again i think our gross profit improvement by 24 this year reflects a strong performance when you look at our outlook that we provided we did not provide anything for eps but i do want to note we returned to profitability this year for the first time since 2013 with income of 16 million or 0 27 per share all in all we did a good job this year of accomplishing what we said we were going to do in 2018 as you know kind of looking back in a different direction as you know our end markets entered a heavy cyclical downturn in 2014 that reached its low point in 2016 i d like to take just a second here to point out where we ve come from since that low point titan has posted overall sales growth of 27 and if you take the solid revenue gains and combine them with the operational and business improvements that we ve been continuously driving that resulted in adjusted ebitda growth of 152 in that two year period again these accomplishments are against a tough backdrop of a volatile market conditions and a wild raw material situation that we saw in 2017 with natural rubber we worked hard and are proud of these improvements we ve made over the past couple of years but as good as these gains have been we know we still have more work to do first we need to continue to drive stronger margin improvements we have to raise our gross margins above today s level next while it was definitely nice to return to profitability this year we have pieces of our business that quite frankly performed at unacceptable levels these particular areas have a negative impact on our bottom line and as a company impedes titan from reaching an even higher level of profitability so first let s touch on the comment about driving gross margin improvements and talk specifically about north america our largest business unit our management team in north america is keenly focused on opportunities to improve our margins we operate in a competitive landscape we operate in a challenging market that continues to grow remain below historical averages with that being said we have made good gains in 2018 with north america gross margin gaining over 200 basis points but we all know there s still ample room to improve from there last quarter we announced that an 80 20 portfolio management program would be launched in early 2019 we have done that and formally put that into place for our tire business on january 1 of this year the history for both our north america and tire wheel business is that they started off as the little guys competing in a big world and to this day that spirit is inherent in our entrepreneurial culture now it s a good thing however similar to many smaller companies that have been seeking growth for many years through that period we continue to see our product portfolio balloon that in turn has made us overly complex and less efficient in our processes and really all the way through our manufacturing operations our 80 20 program will revamp our product strategy and how we manage our operations in north america we believe quite confidently this program will improve profitability cash flow and our management of working capital levels while also enabling us to make effective timely decisions by reducing the burden of complexity in our daily business activities many world class organizations have already implemented an 80 20 program cnh recently announced they re embarking on this program as well 80 20 is a longer term journey for us we re off and running within our tire group and then later this year we re going to implement it in our wheel division as well continuing on the margin discussion russia is another business unit that we re heavily focused on and needs to improve their margin performance it goes without saying russia is a complex arena to operate on many fronts for us it was made more complicated as we worked through the five year put option that came due this year our russian business is primarily ag related and within the ag sector in russia they have faced many challenges associated with not just the commodity prices but a banking system that is causing significant working capital constraints within our distribution channels our dealers our end users et cetera our titan russia business unit is the number one ag tire producer in the cis region its 2018 results are much better than they were a few years ago but as we sit here today the gross margins are not near where they need to be and operating income is nowhere near an acceptable return on the investments we ve made we ve been prudent through the years with the investments we ve made and they had a very positive impact titan russia has increased their efficiency levels well over 50 in the last few years along with that we re putting in other enhancements that are designed to drive quality improvements and that has been going well we are in the later phases of developing tires that can be exported in the eu and other markets as well that is crucial to the future success within titan russia our management team there is making good get decisions in navigating the challenging russian market and improving their operational efficiencies as i noted earlier but we need to and we ll do more to produce better financial results there next moving over to profitability as i mentioned earlier titan has seen our operating income improve from a loss of 25 million in 2016 to an operating profit of 42 million just this year 2018 that is a fairly solid improvement however for us to reach our potential we need to continue to reduce the negative bottom line impact of certain parts of our business one area that needs addressing is our ttrc recycling business in canada as we previously announced in september of 2017 we had a fire at ttrc destroy the building that contains three of our six reactors prior to that fire we had internal projections that we had shared publicly that ttrc would be a profitable business with healthy ebitda margins that has not materialized and due to the fire has placed a fairly sizable negative burden on our financials in the past couple of years we are hopefully nearing the completion point with the insurance and insurance settlement from that fire and at that point titan will complete a strategic and operational review of ttrc to determine the next steps for the future another area of strategic focus for us is australia and what goes along with that is our larger mining tire business that is produced here in the us in those two areas combined we ve made sizable operating income improvements over that tally well over 10 million since 2016 but despite those improvements that we ve introduced into these businesses both still operate at an unacceptable level of financial performance and we need to see better from them in 2019 we have already made organizational changes in australia and we ll be further analyzing both these businesses this year to determine the strategic plans and what else needs to be done to drive toward acceptable financial performance the next area i want to jump over to is spending some time on our 2019 outlook that we provided in our press release we believe 2019 total sales will grow 6 to 7 5 with our earthmoving construction segment leading the way with growth in the 8 to 9 5 range like many other companies we believe there is pent up demand within the ag market we are cautiously optimistic about where things will go in 2019 but assuming that the political and commodity pressures that we ve evolved in we focus on will remain in place we still see our ag business growing in the 4 to 6 range which i should add would represent some market share expansion in certain areas as noted earlier we are committed to driving further margin improvements over the next few years and we see our 2019 gross margins in the 12 8 to 13 2 range representing a solid improvement over the 12 4 in 2018 and the 11 6 on an adjusted for some impairment basis that we reported in 2017 as we did this year we will continue to drive more leverage into our business and into our sg a structure and therefore forecast sg a and r d combined to be an approximately 150 million or less than 9 on a percentage basis this all said results in projected 2019 adjusted ebitda in the range of 124 million to 134 million again this compares favorably to the 119 million that we reported for 2018 and the 72 million that we reported in 2017 all these projections that we ve discussed assume that no divestitures will have taken place in conclusion we ve worked hard as one titan in the past couple of years and i think 2018 is a strong reflection of what we ve accomplished as we hit the targets we set for the year we have more than doubled our ebitda since 2016 with that i d now like to turn the call over to david and then i ll follow up later with some comments on our recent strategic announcements david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks paul and good morning to everyone on the call i will highlight some of the key items from our fourth quarter 2018 performance while i don t want to repeat all the numbers from the release that we outlined last night net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 363 million which represents a decline of 3 from the prior year but on a constant currency basis revenues would have been up nearly 8 million from the prior year or 2 1 this currency impact of 20 million or 5 4 was felt most in the latin america and the european geographies our itm indicators business performed very well with revenues increasing 13 from q4 2017 absent currency devaluation that occurred during the quarter our north american business primarily tire experienced a decline in sales as the market softening in the aftermarket continued the trend that we saw throughout the second half of 2018 due to a variety of reasons that paul described earlier i already talked about the negative impact of currency on net sales but our sales volume on a consolidated basis was essentially flat while we had a pickup in sales from increased price and mix of 2 i d like to take a just a second to discuss our fourth quarter performance relative to our own expectations we experienced some market softening in russia and australia during the quarter which were the two largest drivers of under performance against our expectations for the quarter in terms of revenue and gross profit the impact on gross profit from these shortfalls approximated 4 million obviously currency impacts also played a major part in the overall profitability versus expectations which included the impact from currency losses reported in other expense from revaluation of our inter company loans and balances which is another 4 million during the quarter i ll discuss that more in a bit our reported gross profit for the fourth quarter was approximately 37 million or 10 1 of net sales compared to 36 million or 9 6 of net sales in the same quarter a year ago the impact from negative currency translation effects on gross profit was approximately 2 million for the quarter or 6 in the prior year we recorded an impairment on assets related to the fire at our tire recycling business in canada of 10 million when comparing to q4 2017 adjusted gross profit excluding the impairment loss gross profit would have been down i already alluded to it but in the fourth quarter of 2018 our north american aftermarket tire sales were slower than the prior year which also negatively impacted gross profit dollars and margin factors behind this are somewhat complex while our customers have been very cautious after the market disruptions we have experienced due to global trade wars and other impacts on farm income i want to point out that for the full year we experienced a 7 increase in net sales in north america so some of the decline in q4 relates to timing and relative dealer inventory levels we also had some delays relating to shipments in our north american wheel business from temporary challenges related to the start up of our new erp system in november and december these challenges are largely behind us now and we should catch up majority of our sales shortfall in this quarter and next gross profit and margin both improved significantly in the earthmoving and construction segment primarily due to itm s business the impact year over year and gross profit from slower market conditions in russia and australia during the fourth quarter was approximately 4 million which is similar to the impact in the quarter in terms of our own expectations that i described earlier now let s take a little closer look at each of the three segments our agriculture segment net sales were 150 million down 10 on a year over year basis that would have been down only 3 5 if not for the negative currency impact volume in this segment was down 4 5 while favorable price and mix added 1 to segment net sales sales in north america were down for the quarter primarily due to the factors i just discussed latin america ag sales though were improved in the quarter by 36 year over year absent currency headwinds and that is due to some recovery in the market which experienced challenges for the most of the year our agricultural segment gross profit for the fourth quarter was 17 million down from 21 5 million in last year with a portion of this coming from lower currencies as well volume in north america was the largest factor in the decline from q4 a year ago while there were market headwinds from russia as well year over year margins declined approximately 160 basis points in the fourth quarter to 11 4 again driven by the same factors that i ve just reviewed with you continuing to our earthmoving and construction segment this segment experienced an increase in net sales of nearly 8 million or 5 to 174 million on a constant currency basis net sales would have increased nearly 22 for the quarter volume gains in this segment were close to 6 while volume price and mix was 3 and negative currency impacted the segment by 4 5 again the strongest areas of growth for this segment came in europe with itm s indicators business as we ve talked about all year as a trend australia experienced a decline in sales from what appears to be a short term market softening gross profit within the earthmoving and construction segment for the fourth quarter was 15 5 million which represents a 7 9 million increase from a year ago keeping in mind and in the prior year there was a 10 million asset impairment related to the 2017 fire at our tire reclamation operations in canada now to wrap up with consumer segment the segment s fourth quarter net sales were 40 million decreased 10 when compared to last year on a constant currency basis net sales would have been down only 2 volume decreased by almost 5 while we gained some with favorable price and mix of 3 there was a significant fx drag again this quarter with negative impact of 4 from the prior year with the biggest impact felt in latin america this segment s gross profit for the fourth quarter was 4 million which was down 2 8 million from a year ago gross margin was 10 3 a decline of almost 500 basis points over the same period last year which was really reflective of lower sales volume and the impact of fixed cost absorption in latin america turning over to our operating expenses sg a and r d expenses for the fourth quarter were 35 million a decrease of 2 million from the prior year as a percentage of net sales sg a and r d was 9 7 compared to 10 in the comparable period last year this decrease in operating expenses primarily relates to lower legal spending tax expense during the quarter was 3 million in the quarter on a pre tax loss of 11 million which appears to be unusual but with a portion of our losses coming in tax jurisdictions where we have significant cumulative operating losses we re not able to take a current year tax benefit which causes an unusual outcome particularly in the quarter for the year the income tax provision was 6 8 million or 34 on pre tax income of 19 8 million which is more normalized for 2019 i would anticipate our tax rate to fall between 25 and 30 given our expectation of mix of our pre tax income in the various tax jurisdictions a final item of note for our fourth quarter performance discussion relates to the redemption value adjustment of 1 1 million which decreased from the prior year amount of 2 4 million almost all of this adjustment relates to the impact of the current period currency devaluation of the russian ruble versus the us dollar the rdif portion of the put option is now satisfied and there will no longer be any impact from the redeemable non controlling interest in the russian operation related to rdif now i d like to move over to our financial condition and highlight a few key balance sheet liquidity and capital items going into the fourth quarter we had an expectation that we would see some turnaround in working capital levels in the business and we did see an appropriate decline in accounts receivable relative to sales levels as our dsos remained steady at 61 days our total ar dropped 17 million during the fourth quarter from the third quarter however our ending inventory in december grew by 14 million from the third quarter this growth came in two principal areas of the business our north american wheel operations and our undercarriage business as discussed earlier we had some temporary delays in shipments during the fourth quarter related to isolated challenges with the start up of our new erp system we have achieved stabilization subsequent to year end and we anticipate being able to catch up substantially during the first half of the year as it relates to itm s undercarriage business we have experienced dramatic growth in the business over the course of 2018 and they continue to see strong trends in the business climate requiring them to continue to build inventory to meet increased demands inventory turnover for the business has remained relatively steady during the year obviously increases in working capital has continued to impact our cash balances throughout the year our cash balance of approximately 82 million was approximately 82 million at the end of the year declining 15 million from september 30 2018 working capital growth at the rate we saw in 2018 is not sustainable and our management teams across the business are increasingly focused on improving our production planning processes some of this coming from improvements we are making in our financial systems it also involves simply maintaining the appropriately disciplined and continuous focus by our finance supply chain and operations management teams we are certainly positioned well with our inventory levels to meet the anticipated increased demand in 2019 and with our reinvigorated focus on working capital management throughout the organization we believe we should be able to see a turnaround in our operating cash flow for this year and beyond now just a couple more items before i wrap up the discussion starting with debt our combined current and long term debt totaled 461 million at the end of december which was stable with where we were at the end of last quarter current maturities due within one year totaled 52 million a significant portion of the current maturities relates to local overdraft and working capital facilities which are generally considered on demand for reporting purposes but are expect to be able to roll over with the use of cash during the year again as a reminder our debt consists primarily of 400 million senior secured notes which will mature in 2023 we have increased our borrowing level in the first quarter of 2019 to manage the payment to rdif related to the put option while i anticipate we should improve our cash flow sufficiently in the coming year to pay it down some of this will come from improved operating cash flows while i also believe we will be able to shed some non core or idle assets into cash in the near term that could deliver between 30 million and 50 million in cash given the improvements in cash flow we expect to have sufficient liquidity to continue to invest in the business appropriately to bolster the growth and profit improvement aspirations that we have capital expenditures for 2018 were 39 million versus roughly 33 million in 2017 we came within our range of expectations for the year due to anticipated growth in 2019 and specific needs we have in the business i anticipate to spend a bit more in the range of 40 million to 50 million for the year targeting areas that can deliver the highest returns through increased plan efficiency and cost reductions it s important to note that our depreciation and amortization is running at a 58 million and we believe it will be in a similar range in 2019 we now closed out the year and we improved on all of our financial performance metrics and we believe that our outlook for 2019 is positive and balanced in the view of the global markets that remains unpredictable and volatile at times the business is positioned to take advantage of our opportunities we are committed to driving improved returns to our shareholders as we continue to get long standing challenges behind us i want to conclude by restating a few priorities that remain in front of us in terms of financial improvement initiatives i ll discuss this in some detail but we have important initiatives under way across the business focused on driving sales and improving margin performance across the business the 80 20 program for our north american operation should be a significant step to drive operational improvements we re also focusing on components of their business that are incurring operating losses today but taking steps to eliminate them from the portfolio or by reducing our fixed cost to improve profitability we have also started down a path to develop appropriate strategies aimed at reducing volatility in our financial performance related to the impacts of currency fluctuations and stronger global treasury management practices last quarter i talked about focus on cash flow and while we didn t make the progress in fourth quarter that i expected we are working hard to build improved visibility and accountability in the organization to drive improved working capital management practices we are also focused on building our capability to deliver the significantly improved and more timely business analytics in the business through innovations in our base erp platform all of these initiatives will take time but we are committed to making significant progress during 2019 now i d like to turn the call back over to paul for a few more comments before we get into any questions that you might have paul g reitz president and chief executive officer good job david appreciate it i want to close with a few comments on our strategic announcement last week regarding itm as you may recall it was april of 2016 that titan received a letter of interest for itm that triggered the formation of a special committee to engage in advisory discussions with a leading investment bank i won t repeat all that the one thing that came out of it that we did then announce publicly in march of 2017 is that we announced titan had determined that selling itm was not in the best interest of our shareholders at that time our strategic focus then became to continue to pursue growth in itm s business and overall financial performance and as you ve heard from both of us this morning that s exactly what we have successfully done since 2016 itm has been on a strong path that has continued to see excellent growth in sales operating income and ebitda we don t divulge itm s financial performance separately in our financial filings but i will say as a reminder and this is what some of the comments we ve made previously as well our undercarriage business operates primarily outside north america and predominantly in the earthmoving construction segment as we announced last week we are now once again evaluating strategic alternatives for itm we ve engaged advisors to assist us with that process and this does now include the option of a public listing in europe i firmly believe that based on itm s performance the past couple of years itm is now worth a much higher value than the offers we received in 2016 we are not declaring itm a noncore asset and it s not a foregone conclusion that we ll dispose this business but i want to add that itm can be split apart from titan without major disruption or cost regardless of our announcements we continue to believe that itm is an excellent business with a strong future however we also firmly believe it s in the best interest of our shareholders to evaluate our strategic options at this time changing direction briefly from itm we ve made a couple of recent announcements regarding our russian put option with rdif first we announced that we reached an agreement on the rdif put for a total consideration of 50 million that included an immediate cash payment of 25 million an issuance of 25 million of titan s restricted stock that will mature in three years completely within our own discretion we can buyback this stock in cash within 12 months and we would receive 10 of their ownership in titan russia that then would reduce rdif s holdings to 25 our latest announcement on february 25 stated that we closed the transaction by making the 25 million cash payment and we ll be issuing roughly 4 million shares of restricted stock that s still subject to regulatory approval our other partner in titan russia one equity partners has exercised their put option that would require titan to pay oep 46 million later this month in return for their approximately 21 equity interest that would also be subject to a regulatory filing in russia to approve titan owning more than 50 of the voltyre prom equity i want to wrap up by stating that on both these matters our board and myself and david together with our financial advisors will continue to work toward making the best decisions in the interest of our shareholders with that i d now like to turn the call over for your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question will come from steve volkmann of jefferies please go ahead stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst hey good morning guys paul g reitz president and chief executive officer good morning stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst so i guess maybe lots of questions but maybe i ll start on david with some cash flow questions and i guess i m trying to figure out it sounds like we re going to bring down working capital a little bit in 2019 i don t know if there s sort of an order of magnitude can we talk about maybe free cash flow relative to net income maybe as a way to think about that paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah i ll take that our expectation is that from a working capital perspective that while there ll be some sales growth that we will be able to draw down to a certain extent from the levels that we saw last year particularly in inventory while you may not see a big downturn in it but with the growth levels and the profit levels that we see increase we should be able to see significantly different operating cash flow number then of course our targets are to see free cash flow in the range of 1 times net income and i expect that we can potentially get pretty close to that this year stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst okay that s helpful and then i think you mentioned 30 million to 50 million in idle assets that you could potentially dispose of can you say a little bit more about what that is and is the 30 million to 50 million what you d expect in proceeds or just a little more detail there paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes that s a good question we certainly have some properties and some assets that we have that have not been producing anything lately and so there are some opportunities to make the sales of such properties in addition to the potential for us as we look at ttrc operations in canada stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst okay and again is that 30 million to 50 million what you re expecting in proceeds or is that what the value of the assets on the books are or paul g reitz president and chief executive officer that would be proceeds stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst proceeds ok good all right i ll pass it on and get back in line thanks operator our next question will come from joe mondillo of sidoti company please go ahead joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst hi good morning guys paul g reitz president and chief executive officer hey good morning joe joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst so just to sort of hang on to that questioning in terms of liquidity just wondering if you could expand on the liquidity you went through it sort of fast in the prepared commentary so it sounded like you owe some current debt of about 52 million you paid the 25 million for rdif and you have a roughly some sort of a liability at 46 million to 1 ph equity are those the biggest buckets of liability this year paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes i think you outlined that correctly oep s some 46 million that would be settled at this time i mean i guess we still have the optionality of stock or cash but we have missed some deadlines i guess i would say in regards to notified oep we would use stock so at this juncture that would be 46 million worth of cash with rdif like you said we ve already paid them the 25 million as announced we will be issuing 25 million worth of restricted stock but the optionality exists to trade that restricted stock in using cash which would be another 25 million so the total cash exposure between the two would be right around that 70 million mark david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer and just to add to that joe if you look at the 52 million in other debt that we have outside of any capital leases that we have or anything related to the senior notes those are demand on demand and they are obviously the working capital and overdraft facilities in our international locations and not expected to see any significant repayments of those because they re just ongoing demand type of lines of credit if you will so it s not immediately due and we often roll these over with cash flow each year joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst and so in terms of the paying for the rdif in one equity in the beginning of the year i imagine you will if anything you ll ramp up working capital a little bit just seasonally whether it s not as strong as last year or not what means do you have to compensate i guess the biggest portion being the rdif in one equity i m just sort of looking at near term liquidity david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we have the opportunity under our lines of credit that we have in the united states overall we have a 75 million abl line that we can access and obviously we have we work closely with our banks to be able to provide sufficient liquidity in the business for any spikes like what we re seeing with respect to these payments to our partners joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay so overall david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer so multiple speakers near term that we can actually manage these payments so they are accessing that and then as time moves on the cash flow continues to get better we can pay down joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay ok great could you guys repeat the volume price mix and fx for the ag segment i missed that david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah the overall for the fourth quarter itself we had a 1 improvement in price and mix and a decline of 4 5 related to volume in a currency negative currency impact of 6 joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great so looking at i guess the volume at the ag segment and just wanted to sort of expand on that i think you touched on the aftermarket revenue was a little light there your guidance certainly suggests that things will bounce back but just sort of could you provide any more color regarding what happened in the fourth quarter and why you sort of have some confidence going into 2019 that things will get better than from where you were in the fourth quarter in terms of that growth rate there in terms of volumes paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes i think joe david mentioned one of the items that impacted us is the implementation of the erp system so we had some shipments that rolled over from the period into the next as we were going through that implementation process and the other item of note in the fourth quarter on the volume side is that if you recall back in q4 of 17 there was a much more aggressive ramp up going into 2018 with expectations of a stronger year that was pre tariffs and commodity prices really doing what they did throughout 2018 and so we saw more of an inventory build coming from our oems in the last quarter of 2017 compared to where we sit today kind of leading into then 2019 why we feel good about where we re at and where we re going is that foundation for the ag sector is still it s still firm in fact i think most operators most dealers are used to this type of environment the good ones have gotten better the weaker ones have continued to have problems and some of them been acquired by either larger farms or larger dealers and so what we re seeing from our customers is that cautiously optimistic outlook that even in this tougher environment the business has continued to can continue to grow and then with that if you get some changes that are favorable there is definitely a pent up demand when you look at nearly every type of metric on the replacement side in north america that could drive things even further than what we projected but with all that being said i think everybody s cautiously optimistic we see ourselves outgrowing the market in certain areas if i look back to some of the initiatives that we put in place that we ve talked about and i look back at the dealer meetings that we hosted as we wrapped up 2018 we feel good that our dealer network is strong the products we re producing are well received in the markets we re working on how we can continue to push more products into the markets again through the 80 20 initiatives and the different activities that we have going but i think we re going to gain some market share here with our initiatives and i feel like we re well positioned and definitely our dealers are feeling good about 2019 and so we put out the outlook that i think reflects all that and it s again cautiously optimistic that 2019 will continue on a good path joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and just a follow up the volume the share gains that you re referring to is mainly on the aftermarket side then is that correct paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes i would say that i think that s correct certainly we also see some opportunities where we position ourselves well with oems and so but yeah i would agree mainly your comments with 80 20 we ll have more of a direct impact your comments are correct that 80 20 we ll have more of a direct impact on what we do with the aftermarket joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then on the price cost side the price mix relative to revenue growth actually decelerated from the third quarter which was i was a little surprised given that i think you put a price increase in september so i was actually assuming that that might accelerate i m not sure what happened with the mix side of things but on the price cost side of things where are we relative to sort of getting back to where we were five or six quarters ago do you still see a benefit starting in the first quarter going forward in terms of that price cost spread paul g reitz president and chief executive officer i think what we projected and how we ve built our models for 2019 is that it will be neutral trying to predict all that is challenging we ve seen the market grow if you look at the mix side of it not necessarily price costs element but just on the mix side definitely over the last few years we ve seen the smaller horsepower grow quicker than the large we are well positioned in that market i think we ve got a very good job servicing our customers that play heavy in that arena so for us there has been some mix change that s taking place that s actually good as again because that s the part of the market that s been performing well and we ve been doing a good job with our customers in that area on price to mix i mean i think we re at a better point now as far the lack of volatility in raw materials i think they stabilized as far as price mix excuse me price cost we make the assumption that it s going to be neutral i don t see us at this point being getting a benefit or being hurt and again actually i saw some price increases come out from not competitors in the off road space but on the on road tire space that were pretty sizable so it s a tough question to answer because at this point we just don t know where raw materials are going to go but we do have contracts within the oem sector that help protect us on the raw materials within aftermarkets i think at this point we re fairly neutral on pricing and again it s something these guys stay on top of on a regular basis joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and then so in terms of price mix aspect relative to the revenue growth i assume the mix off the unfavorable mix i guess in the fourth quarter offset the price increases that you put in september paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah i think we what were we david was it 1 david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah well that was just for ag it was 2 for the overall business we saw a little bit better impact in our amc segment but yeah i think it s fair to say any a portion of our price increases was impacted by unfavorable mix joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and just a clarification on the guidance in terms of the ebitda do you guys is the other non operating income included in that ebitda guidance that you provided paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst and can you quantify how much you re sort of looking for that non operating income paul g reitz president and chief executive officer are you talking about you re talking about other kind of below the line joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst yeah paul g reitz president and chief executive officer below the operating line yeah i would expect obviously last year we had some significant one time things during the year so that number is not reasonable but i don t know normal basis you would expect to see about 5 million to 6 million david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer we don t have built into our 2019 ebitda expectation the large number that you see in 2018 we what we forecast in the outlook would be the standardized routine things that are cemented by either cash flow or a contract something like that paul g reitz president and chief executive officer and the other thing would be our joint venture income and some of our minority investments that we have all over the world so that s what that represents as well joseph mondillo sidoti company analyst right ok okay great all right thanks i ll hop back in queue thank you operator our next question will come from komal patel of goldman sachs please go ahead komal patel goldman sachs analyst hi good morning first if i could just clarify i might have misheard it earlier but the missed deadlines on the oep side does that mean you re definitely using cash to settle it and not restricted stock or anything again apologize i might have missed it paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah i mean at this time it s really just it s we re in the middle of discussions we ve not settled with oep but what i meant by my comments is legally we had a deadline where if we were going to utilize stock we had to notify oep of that and we did not make that notice to them so on a strict legal basis the answer would be yes it would have to be settled in cash komal patel goldman sachs analyst got it ok and i guess the follow up question is that could you consider settling them with them in a manner similar to rdif as in trying to keep them in the business and maybe that s why discussions have been lasting longer than maybe originally anticipated paul g reitz president and chief executive officer at this point i can t make any comments on that komal patel goldman sachs analyst okay all right that s fair and i guess just to maybe touch on the itm businesses as well what s kind of the rationale for selling the business now is it fair to think about it as a way to increase some of the liquidity that you need or just given how much growth that you ve experienced already are you expecting slower growth in europe for next year or beyond paul g reitz president and chief executive officer no i think it would be more of the liquidity question or liquidity issue clearly as david has highlighted what we ve been talking about with the put option we ve made a lot of good investments in working capital that will translate into positive cash flows as we move to 2019 but clearly there is a lot of debt that is then is required to settle the put option and so you look at this business we certainly see great prospects with itm not just what we ve seen the last couple of years but well into the future the business has become very well positioned in the areas where we were seeking expansion we do believe we can continue to grow in those areas we believe that the valuation is much higher than what it was in 2016 so at this point we just believe it s the right time to seek some strategic alternatives possibly with itm and have those discussions with the advisors but clearly the liquidity issue is something that would drive us to make the announcement that we did here last week komal patel goldman sachs analyst got it ok and then if i could just switch gears a bit some of the cost cutting comments that you made can we talk a little bit about the cadence of some of the cuts that you re expecting back half weighted is it beyond that any kind of just quarter to quarter information that you could share with us and what kind of cost do you expect to incur to achieve some of these savings paul g reitz president and chief executive officer so in terms of some of the cost reductions we talked about are related to fixed cost absorption in our plans and so forth so that cadence is more ratable if you will as we go through the year it wasn t isn t anything significant that we have to do one quarter versus another one it comes over time and i ll also say there s a 80 20 initiative which is basically basically helps us achieve better production runs long production runs versus small runs that take up a lot of time in our facilities today create a lot of indirect cost in the business changeovers and so forth and so these are the kind of costs that we re looking to avoid moving forward as far as sg a costs go we re not looking at any significant cuts here but we are actually being more prudent with how we invest our sg a and directing them toward those value added activities so you maybe see some trade offs as far as significant cost to achieve the savings i wouldn t say it s anything significant at this point komal patel goldman sachs analyst got it okay and last one from me how i guess recent discussions politically on the tariff side of things changed or updated the outlook at all for your customers any kind of willingness to invest in the equipment any kind of change in sentiment that you ve seen so far paul g reitz president and chief executive officer i wouldn t say there s any dramatic shift yet but certainly i think there is some optimism that s coming back into the markets with the positive discussions that have been taking place and i think some of the other comments recently about other noted ph countries as well including india and turkey are favorable for us and our business so yes there is some good trends but i think overall the good customers whether again its dealers investing in inventory or oems investing in expansion and seeing a bright future or the end users that are willing to invest in equipment i think overall the good ones are continuing to do that some of the results coming out of the kansas city fed ph are slightly painted the other way where you see some debt being brought onto the books for end users to cover operating expenses and i think that s true for the weaker operators in all parts of our business but i think overall nothing things have the potential to get better and i think that s what we re reflecting in our guidance our overall guidance for 2019 reflects that komal patel goldman sachs analyst got it thanks so much appreciate the comments paul g reitz president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from justine ho of mesirow financial please go ahead justine ho mesirow financial analyst hi actually most of my questions are answered but i just wanted to double check if i can get clarification you mentioned that the deadline passed regarding notifying oep about if you were to do issue stock so just to make sure i understand you that means you have decided to settle that all in cash the 46 million david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean at this point i really can t say anything more other than just from a legal standpoint oep has exercised the put option which means that we owe them 46 million of consideration up to a certain date a couple weeks ago we could settle that 46 million in either stock or cash the board of directors and myself made a decision that we were not going to notify ope that we we re going to utilize stock so from a strict legal perspective we have let that date pass and so at this point as soon as we start just like we do with rdf as soon as we have a final conclusion on everything and we start transacting the final results with oep we certainly will make an update but at this point those are just strictly the legal situation is where we stand and we ll update you as soon as we can justine ho mesirow financial analyst okay and can you make any comments regarding itm in terms of i guess your thoughts on has there been any interest that you see so far right now is it too early in the process paul g reitz president and chief executive officer well we really can t say too much more than what we put in our press release but clearly putting out the announcement reflects a strong belief that we see a good valuation a very good valuation for the company and that clearly we ve engaged some advisors that feel pretty good about those prospects as well but at this point we won t be able to provide any more updates until we get to a further point in the process as we said in both our comments last week and even with our press release today i think that s about all we can say at this point justine ho mesirow financial analyst okay and lastly we are in two months into the first quarter do you from what you re seeing now in current conditions do you still i guess i m just wondering about the ag particularly the ag business do you fell that it is still cautiously optimistic that based on your guidance of growth there paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes absolutely i think our outlook reflects that cautious optimism and what we re seeing is certainly reflected in our full year 2019 outlook we are a cyclical business so there ll be ups and downs throughout the year for different reasons some of them are standard as far as how our business flows throughout the year and some of them are going to be just as the market changes but i think at this point yeah we do see things that are moving in a positive direction again and i think our revenue guidance for next year reflects that it s good growth in all areas both earth moving and construction obviously on a higher end of that single digit range and then ag being in the mid point of it but i think overall it s definitely good growth and to answer your question it reflects what we certainly feel and believe at this point in the year justine ho mesirow financial analyst thank you paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question will come from alex blanton of clear harbor asset management please go ahead alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst yes good morning can you hear me paul g reitz president and chief executive officer hey alex alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay i was looking at your change in your gross profit from the third quarter and it was about a 7 million decline from the third quarter on a 21 million decline in sales so that s 32 9 which is about what one would expect on that kind of a sales decline 32 9 incremental so it doesn t look like you had much greater impact from raw material costs in that quarter than would be normal is that correct david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer i would say that s correct yes alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay but how much impact is there in total let s say in the past year from the steel cost increases and the other materials and what s the prospect for offsetting that i know you said that your cost increases and your price increases would be about at balance for this year so are you saying that there is no recouping of those cost increases david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer you got to take it twofold certainly if you look at steel prices there certainly is mechanisms built in for how we deal with steel pricing up or down on that so for the most part we are covered with respect to any changes in those prices quarter to quarter and so forth so but as far as the pricing that you see on other raw materials we have to be very cautious about how we price our products all the time and reflecting that in a given period of time you could see some volatility but based on what our expectations are and what we saw in the marketplace over the second half of last year we became much closer in line with what our expectations were and we saw some the first half of the year is where we saw the significance steel price increases and synthetic rubber the other prices are kind of working together in terms of where we think we can price our products in the market so i don t know if paul wants to add anything to that but it really is we feel like that the forecast for raw materials this year we believe we can cover within the confines of how we re pricing today particularly on the tire side alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay going back to the fourth quarter that was a very negative quarter from many standpoints the stock market was down in early october freddie ph came out and said that 25 of executives expect a recession by the end of 2019 and 8 ph expected a recession by the end of 2020 had a very negative frame of mind overall among corporate executives and i assume that that extended to your dealers and the people at your oems who were probably reducing inventory and so forth so how much impact was there on the sales because it looks like if you re not seeing a greater negative impact from raw materials increases and you re getting some improvements in efficiencies as indicated by the incremental results from third quarter if the sales improved it ought to have a pretty good bottom line impact it looks like your biggest problem here is really the sales volume paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst is that correct paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah i think you re exactly right with that alex i mean just look at what we ve done over the last couple of years on a i think it s 27 revenue increase ebitda has more than doubled and that s because we ve driven efficiencies we ve gotten better we ve driven efficiencies in the business we ve reduced our cost of quality we are very well setup we manage our product portfolio better and we continue to do that as we talked about with the 80 20 program and so you re right i mean it becomes an issue of volume and then when you see that shift in volume as you mentioned in q4 where there is a lot of heightened concern for a number of reasons it seemed like in q4 and early 2019 it was one day they are saying we are going into recession and the next day they say no it s not going to happen so it s just it creates that level of uncertainty that does impact the order flow so for us what we keep focus on is what we control which is getting as much volume as we can and that s exactly what we re doing but also realizing we got to be prepared to manage a business that is operating in environment that is highly volatile and again we ve done a good job i mean you look at ebitda in 2016 at 52 million and in 2018 we do a 119 million on less than 30 revenue growth i think that continues to get lost at our company is our stock is down half of what it was at that point and there has been so much focus on rdif and the put option the fire at ttrc and all these negative issues but if you look at the underlying business like i think what your question is alluding to we ve done a really good job and it gets frustrating because that message gets lost in all these other topics and it s unfortunate that the put option has us focusing on liquidity and that s why we ve made this announcement with itm we have ways to make sure we are solid we have a great asset that again that we re seeing what the strategic options are david mentioned that we got 30 million to 50 million of additional liquidity that we can tap with some other assets we have a line of credit that is ample and that s only based upon north america assets so ar and inventory we have access to capital all around the world that we aren t tapping into so yeah it s frustrating what gets lost in all these comments is what we did in 2018 to leverage this business and do a damn good job growing and performing alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst yeah well at this point at the current price of the stock your company is valued in the marketplace at less than 300 million and you are the world leader in your business in the business that s growing on the construction side and has tremendous rebound potential on the ag side if this tariff situation ever gets resolved is that a fair assessment paul g reitz president and chief executive officer absolutely i mean like you said we re 300 million valuation that s doing a 119 million of ebitda and we ve stated today that we re going to grow that yes again that s the part that gets and the put option look it s tough to sit here today and not be able to give all of you clear indication of exactly what s going to happen and how this is going to be settled and what s going to take place but we can t and this is unfortunately it s been something we ve been talking about for a long time and it s again all these topics take away from the fact that the business has more than doubled and leveraged itself very well and again going back to your original question less than 30 sales more than double in ebitda it s completely getting lost in the fact with all the other topics alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst one more question we haven t talked about latin america today could you just give us a summary of what s going on there paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes david you had some comments on latin america why don t you kind of echo some of the things you mentioned earlier david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer well what i would say and you can maybe give a backdrop to more to the market and what s happening down there with things but as far as for the year we held steady with our volume for the year notwithstanding some of the challenges we saw in the first call it the first nine months of the year we had a fairly significant increase in volume in q4 which kind of offset some of the trends we saw earlier in the year so i think the way we look at it right now is that it s getting more steady and some of the uncertainty in the political climate has gone away and there is a little bit more investment going on so expectation is that the business is steady to growing now paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah and the team there just to add one thing i mean we ve done a good job really growing our share that s something we ve talked about before but it s worth mentioning again i mean we ve taken over the top spot in latin america done a really good job growing share so amid all that volatility in 2018 we continue to perform very well build great products and got a good team out there representing ourselves with the customers there so we like david said we feel pretty good about the stability and continue to see good trend there alexander m blanton clear harbor asset management analyst okay thank you very much paul g reitz president and chief executive officer thanks alex operator and our final question today is a follow up from stephen volkmann of jefferies please go ahead stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst yes me again hi guys so your stock s now down 29 since we ve been chatting here and obviously i think it s a focus on this whole liquidity issue but i have to confess i am kind of scratching my head a little bit so i was hoping we could just sort of do a little big picture review here i mean you guys had 82 million of cash at the end of the year right paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst and we have 63 million of availability on your revolver correct paul g reitz president and chief executive officer that s correct at the end of the year yes stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst so that s so as we stand here today we must have roughly 145 million kind of liquidity am i doing this right paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yes you got that right stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst and you basically said somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 to 1 free cash flow to net income so we re going to take in 30 million to 35 million of cash this year from the business and then you have 30 million to 50 million of these sort of idle assets where you think you can drive some cash inflows and i mean those things by themselves are plenty to satisfy the 46 million that you owe to one equity and the other 25 million potentially that goes to rdf that s up to you you don t have to do that correct paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah it is in our sole discretion yes stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst so are there any other cash outflows in 2019 besides the 46 million that i mean i m assuming basically you re covering capex with d a is there anything else that s a cash outflow in 2019 paul g reitz president and chief executive officer no nothing significant at all you ve outlined it quite well stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst so you basically have 145 million on the books of liquidity today plus call it 40 million in idle assets that s 185 million plus 30 million of free cash flow is what s that 215 million i don t know i m not that good at math but that seems like a fair amount liquidity relative to the 46 million that you owe and i guess i just wanted to make sure i had all that right because i don t understand why the stock would be down paul g reitz president and chief executive officer steve i totally agree with you i think we feel like we have adequate liquidity to manage this business effectively and do the investments that we need to do in the business and satisfy the obligations that we have for the year only thing i would extend to exactly that is that we also have access with the banks to change or increase our line of credit if we needed to there is an accordion agreement that we have and we would look that to do whatever we need from a short term perspective to get adequate liquidity that we would need just based on timing but those things that you outlined in and of itself would be more than adequate to handle the things we need to do in the business stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst so i guess just a final point on that then is you ve talked about this itm potential divestiture and paul you said a couple times that it was driven by a focus on liquidity but it doesn t seem like you actually need to do that relative to the numbers i just kind of laid out so maybe that s part of the mix message here paul g reitz president and chief executive officer it could be it definitely could be i think some of the headlines we are picking up on some different issues yeah it s all we announced is we re looking at strategically options with itm stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst okay paul g reitz president and chief executive officer with everything that we ve talked about with the put option and you ve outlined it david outlined a very well liquidity it s not a liquidity crunch i guess you re right it s not the way we should answer the question is liquidity to handle the issues to handle the ongoing liabilities but to make sure we are positioned well for the future and investing in the future like you said we can handle capex through i mean everything is lining up very good we re looking at options for itm maybe i should just leave it at that stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst well i mean i think it s fair for investors to ask you why you re doing that but you know that i guess that again i ll just flip put that back to you because i do think that s important i mean if there s another reason i don t know are there other assets out there that you d rather buy perhaps or something else that might focus you on using that as a source of liquidity paul g reitz president and chief executive officer yeah not at this point i think we got to get into the process with itm and then we ll look at it i mean the answer to that could be we simply shore up the balance sheet so that we can focus on acquisitions and growing the business so i think really what i m trying to say is liquidity and i should phrase it differently and i ll kind of just do that now we re focusing on that we have a strong foundation with the balance sheet for the future you walk through the equity side of it we re not any reason to be heightened concern over liquidity but we would firmly believe we need to have a foundation with a strong balance sheet so that we can continue to grow into the future and that s what we re looking to do if the valuation is right with itm we ve made investments in itm and they ve been very good but we want to continue investing in the business so in our total global business i mean it s really just having a fortress foundation with the balance sheet instead of liquidity and why we re looking at the strategic options for itm that s the best way i d characterize it stephen volkmann jefferies co analyst okay all right well fair enough i will leave it at that thank you paul g reitz president and chief executive officer thanks steve david a martin senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks steve operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to mr reitz for any closing remarks paul g reitz president and chief executive officer i certainly appreciate everybody s attendance on the call today

toronto march 07 2019 globe newswire yamana gold inc tsx yri nyse auy yamana glencore international ag lse glen jse gln glencore and goldcorp inc goldcorp tsx g nyse gg collectively the parties are pleased to announce the signing of an integration agreement the agreement pursuant to which the agua rica project would be developed and operated using the existing infrastructure and facilities of minera alumbrera limited alumbrera in the catamarca province of argentina the parties believe the integration of the agua rica project and the alumbrera mine the integrated project has significant merit given the proximity of the assets and the potential to realize significant synergies by taking full advantage of existing infrastructure associated with the alumbrera mine for the development and operation of agua rica agua rica hosts a large scale long life copper mineral resource with associated gold silver and molybdenum while the alumbrera infrastructure is of significant scale and configuration that is ideally suited for the integration plan preliminary studies show the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal 1 including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the first 10 years of operation this is based on the agua rica mineral reserve 2 estimated to contain proven and probable mineral reserves of approximately 4 5 million tonnes 10 billion pounds of copper and 6 5 million ounces of gold contained in approximately 910 million tonnes of ore the agreement represents a significant step forward towards the optimization of agua rica the alumbrera infrastructure including the existing infrastructure for concentrate logistics located in northern argentina between the mine site and the port presents a unique opportunity to enhance project economics while also reducing both the project complexity and environmental footprint the parties have established a technical committee to direct the review and evaluation of the integrated project it is expected that a pre feasibility study for the integrated project will be completed in 2019 and that a full feasibility study with updated mineral reserve production and project cost estimates will be completed by 2020 this will provide the framework for the submission of a new environmental impact assessment eia to the authorities of the catamarca province and for the continued engagement with local stakeholders and communities the parties have been working together with key government stakeholders to support a path forward for the evaluation and development of the integrated project an agreement has been reached with the catamarca state mining company catamarca minera y energética sociedad del estado camyen in respect to camyen s participation in the integrated project the catamarca province has approved a closure plan for the progressive reclamation of the alumbrera mine that synchronizes with the advancement of the integrated project and is funded with existing cash of alumbrera on reserve for reclamation activities yacimientos mineros de agua de dionisio ymad has indicated its support for the use of the alumbrera infrastructure for the integrated project finally the national government implemented a mechanism that was pending since the 2003 reform of the argentine mining investments law that sets out the framework for refund of amounts paid in excess of a mining project s overall tax burden at a federal level this supports fiscal stability of mining projects in country and the integrated project specifically as it advances ____________ all amounts are expressed in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated copper equivalent metal includes copper with gold molybdenum and silver converted to copper equivalent metal based on the following metal price assumptions us 6 614 tonne for copper us 1 250 oz for gold us 24 250 tonne for molybdenum and us 18 oz for silver as of december 31 2018 further details including tonnes grade and assumptions are presented at the end of this press release transaction overview the agreement provides the

as the longest bull market in u s history celebrates its 10th anniversary saturday wall street pros are debating whether the old timer is on its last legs or mustering a second wind the question is pivotal for the 401 k plans and other investments of millions of americans who have built robust nest eggs on the back of the market s impressive rise protect your assets best high yield savings accounts of 2023 bull markets don t die of old age says jason ware chief investment officer at albion financial group i see no reason the bull market should abruptly end as long as the economy stays out of recession and the federal reserve doesn t excessively raise interest rates others are more skeptical it s a late stage market with one last rally in it says jared woodard global investment strategist for bank of america merrill lynch he expects the stock market to reach new highs this year before petering out by 2020 on lower corporate earnings or higher inflation and interest rates a bull market is generally defined as a sustained rise in stock prices without a 20 percent drop from its peak or bear market based on closing prices since the standard poor s 500 stock index bottomed out at 676 53 on march 9 2009 in the thick of the great recession and financial crisis it has more than quadrupled if you were daring enough to invest 100 000 in a broad stock index fund on that dark day 10 years ago your investment would be worth 406 327 today the market has averaged 17 6 percent annualized returns year during that period compared with a historical average of about 10 percent according to s p dow jones indices this bull topped the 1990s rally as the longest last august after months long stomach churning turbulence the bull nearly met its demise christmas eve when the s p 500 was down 19 8 percent from its late september record of 2 930 75 investors were spooked by the fed s plan to raise interest rates twice more this year after nine hikes since late 2015 president donald trump s trade war with china a slowing global economy and the fading effects of federal tax cuts and spending increases but after coming within a whisker of a bear market stocks have mounted a rousing comeback since fed chairman jerome powell and other central bank officials reversed course and suggested they may not lift rates at all this year if inflation remains subdued the broad market index is up 17 percent from its recent low but still 6 3 percent off its peak over the past decade the bull market has also weathered european debt crises a downgrade of the u s credit rating an oil price crash devastating hurricanes and threats of nuclear war no job no problem businesses hire high skilled workers even if there s no position retirement you better be able to answer these 3 questions about your savings before you retire why has bull lasted so long stocks tumbled so low on march 9 2009 the s p 500 was 57 percent off its prior peak they had nowhere to go but way way up there was a lot of catching up to do says yung yu ma chief investment strategist of bmo wealth management the benchmark stock index in fact didn t even claw its way back to its previous high until 2013 the market also has benefited from a not too hot not too cold economy ware says economic growth averaging a modest 2 2 percent a year has helped contain inflation allowing the fed to keep short term rates low and buy bonds that slashed long term rates on mortgages and other loans low rates coax investors to move their money to higher yielding stocks and spur more borrowing and economic activity tame inflation also means businesses pay less for labor and materials widening their profit margins at the same time the market run up has been devoid of the kind of risk taking that led to the 2000 dotcom bubble and the 2007 housing crash both of which were followed by market downturns and recessions ware says another boost businesses were cautious after the bruising recession of 2007 09 limiting hiring employee raises and capital investment that helped fatten their annual earnings gains to an average 12 percent the past decade above the 5 5 percent historical average ware says instead public companies have spent billions of dollars buying back their own stock a strategy that pushed share prices even higher s p 500 companies have made a record 600 billion in buybacks the past five years woodard says will the good times continue here s why some analysts think this bull has further to run economy is still on even keel while growth picked up to nearly 3 percent in 2018 on the federal stimulus it s expected to slow this year more importantly inflation remains below the fed s annual 2 percent target letting the central bank keep interest rates low the economy should also continue to dodge the boom and bust moments that are a recipe for bear markets and recessions ware says fed to the rescue the fed breathed new life into a sputtering market when it made its big about face and said it will be patient on rate hikes this year the central bank also said it expects to stop shrinking its 4 trillion portfolio of bonds earlier than anticipated this year a move that should keep long term rates lower we were very bearish with the fed planning to raise rates woodard says we turned tactically bullish after the fed s turnabout at least for 2019 market drop bought the bull more time the plunge in stocks last fall was nerve wracking but it likely extended the bull s lifespan by rinsing the market of investors bent on making a quick buck and leaving more long term shareholders focused on company fundamentals it wrings out the excesses ware says stocks still reasonably priced despite the market run up the average s p 500 stock is priced at 16 times projected earnings over the next 12 months down from a multiple of 18 in late 2017 and slightly below the five year average according to factset the stock market is cheap ware says especially with low interest rates making shares of companies more appealing but wait here s why some analysts think a bear market lurks by next year wages could squeeze profits goose inflation average annual pay increases have picked up to more than 3 percent as employers bid up to attract fewer available workers amid 4 percent unemployment that s good for workers but it will likely mean narrower corporate profits that crimp stock gains or contribute to losses if raises accelerate further as expected woodard says s p 500 earnings gains are expected to slow to 4 5 percent this year according to factset morgan stanley expects earnings to contract alternatively woodard says companies could pass along their higher labor costs to consumers through higher prices juicing inflation and forcing the fed to raise rates more aggressively that too could be a bull market killer fading effects of tax cut the big corporate tax cut accounted for about a third of the 20 percent plus growth in corporate profits the first three quarters of last year ware says but since the lower tax rate is now part of baseline earnings it won t goose profits this year recession odds are rising more than half the economists surveyed by the wall street journal in early january predicted a recession will start in 2020 a downturn is almost always accompanied by a bear market the market rally has soothed nerves but many economists still foresee a slump next year trade fight lingers trump administration officials are reportedly close to a deal with china to roll back most tariffs on both sides but ma of bmo wealth management says a deal is already priced into stocks meanwhile any agreement is likely to include provisions that would reinstate tariffs if china doesn t meet certain conditions ma says that he says would leave a cloud of uncertainty over the market corporate debt bubble there s a record 4 3 trillion in lower quality corporate loans and high yield bonds that could see rising defaults if the economy goes south even higher quality debt could default if the economy wobbles woodard says curtailing lending and deepening any market pain bottom line while a bear market is possible the next two years ma thinks the more likely scenario is a slowdown in market returns to about 7 percent a year that keeps the bull trudging forward ware continues to recommend a balanced mix of stocks and bonds for middle age investors and a portfolio skewed toward stocks for younger folks and bonds for seniors the best way to manage the inevitable ups and downs of the stock market is to stop short of predicting when the bumps will come he says
thank you all very much for being here tonight and thank you for being part of a political revolution which will transform america thank you for being part of a campaign which is not only going to win the democratic nomination which is not only going to defeat donald trump the most dangerous president in modern american history but with your help is going to transform this country and finally create an economy and government which works for all americans and not just the one percent today i want to welcome you to a campaign which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed kleptocracy hatred and lies it will not be racism sexism xenophobia homophobia and religious bigotry all of that is going to end the principles of our government will be based on justice economic justice social justice racial justice and environmental justice tonight i want to welcome you to a campaign which tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of wall street corporate america and the billionaire class greed which has resulted in this country having more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth no we will no longer stand idly by and allow 3 people in this country to own more wealth than the bottom half of america while at the same time nearly 20 percent of our children live in poverty veterans sleep out on the streets and seniors cannot afford their prescription drugs we will no longer accept 46 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent while millions of americans are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs just to survive and over half of our people live paycheck to paycheck frightened to death about what happens to them financially if their car breaks down or their child becomes sick together we are going to create a political system which is based on the democratic principles of one person one vote and end a corrupt system which allows billionaires to buy elections yes we are going to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections today we fight for a political revolution and tonight i want to offer a very special thanks to the people of the great state of iowa in 2016 this is where the political revolution began thank you iowa when i first came here to campaign in 2015 not a whole lot of people knew who i was nobody took our campaign seriously and we were at 3 percent in the polls further the ideas that we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be radical and extreme ideas they said that nobody in america would support raising the minimum wage to a living wage too radical guaranteeing health care to all as a right not a privilege too radical creating up to 15 million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure with a one trillion dollar investment too radical aggressively combatting climate change too radical reforming our broken criminal justice and immigration systems too radical not taking money from super pacs and the rich too radical ending the power of super delegates at the democratic convention too radical well a funny thing happened in iowa over that year on caucus night we didn t win 3 of the vote we won 50 of the vote and half of the pledged delegates and that great start in iowa led us to win victories in 22 states around the country 13 million votes over 1700 delegates at the convention and more votes from young people black white latino asian american and native american than trump and clinton combined and by the way those ideas that we talked about 4 years years ago that seemed so very radical at that time well today virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the american people and have overwhelming support from democrats and independents and they re ideas that democratic candidates for president to school board are now supporting so iowa you helped begin the political revolution in 2016 and with your help on this campaign we are going to complete what we started here we re going to turn our vision and our progressive agenda into reality today as we launch our campaign here in iowa we say to the private health insurance companies whether you like it or not the united states will join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare to all people as a right all americans are entitled to go to the doctor when they re sick and not go bankrupt after staying in the hospital we will no longer accept the absurdity of paying almost twice as much per capita on health care while we have a lower life expectancy and worse health care outcomes than many other countries the goal of health care must be to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way not tens of billions in profits for the insurance companies and outrageous compensation packages for ceos in 2017 the top 65 healthcare ceos made 1 7 billion in compensation including 83 2 million to david wichmann the ceo of unitedhealth group and 58 7 million to mark bertolini the ceo of aetna we need a health care system that invests in disease prevention doctors nurses dentists and rural clinics we don t a system which makes insurance companies and their ceos super rich yes we will pass a medicare for all single payer program health care is a right and by the way our legislation improves health care for seniors by providing coverage for dental care hearing aids and eye glasses today we say to the pharmaceutical industry that you will no longer charge the american people the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs the result being that one out of five americans cannot afford the prescriptions their doctors prescribe seniors in this country should not have to cut their pills in half the outrageous greed of the pharmaceutical industry is going to end we are going to lower prescription drug prices in this country today we say to walmart the fast food industry and other low wage employers stop paying your employees starvation wages yes we are going to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage 15 an hour nobody who works 40 hours a week in this country should live in poverty and yes we re going to make it easier for people to join unions not harder four years ago when we talked about the idea of a 15 an hour minimum wage it seemed like an impossible dream well since then i m happy to tell you that 5 states have passed 15 an hour legislation and just yesterday the u s house committee on labor and education reported out a bill that will raise the federal minimum wage from 7 25 an hour to 15 an hour and i believe that bill will pass the full house within the month and by the way today we say to corporate america that artificial intelligence and robotics are not going to be used just to throw workers out on the street this exploding technology must serve human needs not just corporate profits today we say to the american people that we will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure our roads our bridges our rail system and subways our airports our water systems and wastewater plants and when we do that we create up to 13 million good paying jobs and let s be clear when i talk about infrastructure and clean water we re talking about strengthening clean water laws so that corporate polluters stop poisoning the drinking water that communities in iowa and across the country rely on today we say to the parents in this country that you and your kids deserve quality affordable childcare the children are our future and they deserve the best possible head start in life with a high quality universal pre k program today we say to our young people that we want you to get the best education that you can regardless of the income of your family good jobs require a good education that is why we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially lower the outrageous level of student debt that currently exists america once had the best educated workforce in the world and we are going to make that happen again today we say to our senior citizens that we understand that you cannot live in dignity when you are trying to survive on 13 000 or 14 000 a year in social security benefits my republican colleagues want to cut social security but we have some bad news for them we re not going to cut social security benefits we re going to expand them today we say to donald trump and the fossil fuel industry that climate change is not a hoax but is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet and we intend to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy and in the process create millions of good paying jobs all of us have a moral responsibility to make certain that the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren is healthy and habitable today we say to the prison industrial complex that we are going to bring about real criminal justice reform we are going to end the international embarrassment of having more people in jail than any other country on earth instead of spending 80 billion a year on jails and incarceration we are going to invest in jobs and education for our young people no more private prisons and detention centers no more profiteering from locking people up no more war on drugs no more keeping people in jail because they re too poor to afford cash bail and by the way when we talk about criminal justice reform we re going to change a system in which tens of thousands of americans every year get criminal records for possessing marijuana but not one major wall street executive went to jail for destroying our economy in 2008 as a result of their greed recklessness and illegal behavior no they didn t go to jail they got a trillion dollar bailout today we say to the american people that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country we re going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship we re going to provide legal status to the 1 8 million young people eligible for the daca program and develop a humane border policy for those who seek asylum no more snatching babies from the arms of their mothers today we say to the top 1 percent and the large profitable corporations in this country people who have never had it so good that under a bernie sanders administration we re going to end the massive tax breaks and loopholes that you currently enjoy we will no longer accept the absurd situation where large corporations like amazon netflix and general motors pay nothing in federal income taxes after raking in billions in profits we will no longer tolerate the situation in which the wealthy and large corporations stash billions in tax havens throughout the world yes the wealthy and multi national corporations in this country will start paying their fair share of taxes we are going to end austerity for working families and provide some austerity for large multi national corporations today we say to the military industrial complex that we will not continue to spend 700 billion a year on the military more than the next ten nations combined we re going to invest in affordable housing we re going to invest in public education we re going to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure not more nuclear weapons and never ending wars brothers and sisters we re going to win this election not because we have a super pac funded by billionaires we re going to win this election because we will put together the strongest grassroots coalition in the history of american politics donald trump wants to divide us up by the color of our skin our country of origin our gender our religion and our sexual orientation we are going to do exactly the opposite we are going to bring our people together black white latino native american asian american gay and straight young and old men and women native born and immigrant we are going to bring our people together for an unprecedented grassroots effort which i am happy to tell you already has over one million people signed up as volunteers brothers and sisters as someone who represents vermont one of the most rural states in the country let me be very honest with you in saying that the u s congress has for too long ignored the many crises facing rural america in iowa in vermont and all over this country we have seen more and more young people leave the small towns they grew up in and love not because they dont want to stay but because there are fewer and fewer jobs that pay a living wage we have seen schools churches and community centers shut down and once vibrant main streets become boarded up and deserted in vermont iowa and all across rural america we have seen family farmers go out of business as the prices they receive for their products decline rapidly and large agri business corporations and factory farming take over agriculture we have seen rural hospitals and nursing homes shut down and not enough doctors to provide the quality health care that rural american deserves tragically instead of seeing good jobs education and health care coming into our rural communities we are far too often seeing despair and depression and a terrible increase in suicide and opioid addiction brothers and sisters we need policies for rural america that represent the needs of working people and farmers not agri business and multi national corporations among many other things that need to be done is for the federal government to enforce anti trust laws and i will appoint an attorney general who will do just that it is not acceptable to me that the top four packing companies control more than 80 percent of the beef market 63 percent of the pork market and 53 percent of the chicken market and these numbers understate the situation in many communities there really is only one buyer which means food producers are at their mercy they must use that corporations feed and livestock they must accept that corporations costs and they must accept that corporations lower and lower payment rates in many cases the farmer doesnt even own the livestock or supplies they are effectively contract employees who are forced to lease everything and then get paid an inadequate wage for their very hard work with the federal government not enforcing antitrust laws we have seen mergers like the bayer monsanto approved giving the two largest conglomerates 78 percent of the corn seed market further instead of protecting family owned farms federal support for agriculture is skewed toward huge farms the top 10 percent of farms currently receive 77 percent of all subsidies the time is long overdue for the u s government to stand with rural america and that is exactly what i do brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society and we ve had some successes together as billionaires and large corporations have attacked unions destroyed pensions deregulated the banks and slashed wages we have succeeded in raising the minimum wage to 15 in states and cities across the country and forced large corporations like amazon and disney to do the same and we have supported teachers who successfully stood up for their kids in strike after strike after strike together as the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in unending wars we have stood arm in arm to fight back for the first time in 45 years we have utilized the war powers act to move us forward in ending the horrific saudi led war in yemen together as so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses we have fought to end the war on drugs and have seen state after state decriminalize marijuana and have seen communities expunge the criminal records of those arrested on these charges lets be honest while we have won some victories our struggles have not always been successful but i am here to tell you that because of all the work we have done we are now on the brink of winning not just an election but transforming our country and let me tell you what that means when we are in the white house we will enact a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job there is more than enough work to be done in this country let s do it when we are in the white house we will not only end the decline of rural america but attack the problem of urban gentrification and build the affordable housing we desperately need all across this country when we are in the white house we will move aggressively to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country and pass the common sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of americans want people who should not have guns will not have guns when we are in the white house we are going to address not only the disparities of wealth and income that exist overall in our nation but we will address the racial disparities of wealth and income we are going to root out institutional racism wherever it exists not only will we end voter suppression we are going to make it easier for people to vote not harder when we are in the white house we are going to protect a womans right to control her own body that is her decision not the government s make no mistake about it this struggle is not just about defeating donald trump this struggle is about taking on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of this country and im talking about wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the military industrial complex agri business the prison industrial complex the fossil fuel industry and a corrupt campaign finance system that enables billionaires to buy elections these powerful special interests are going to spend a lot of money to try to defeat us but we have something they dont have the power of the people brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us but this what i believe if we stand together if we don t allow trump and his friends to divide us up if we stand together as black and white latino asian american and native american if we stand together as gay and straight men and women native born and immigrant if we stand together as rural and urban north south east and west if we understand that there really is no such thing as blue state or red state but states throughout the country where working people are struggling to survive if we stand together this country has an extraordinary future let s make it happen
jeremy warner thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe the definition of an emerging market according to the old investment joke is one from which it is impossible to emerge with your money intact few seem to prove this truism better than what was once africa s largest economy nigeria indeed if the dictionary definition of an emerging market is that of an economy with low income but high growth prospects nigeria fails the test it is most certainly low income but in recent years it has also been low growth both in absolute and per capita terms nigeria s gdp has been in sharp decline for the best part of four years and in the past year it has again fallen behind south africa as the continent s largest economy only now is it beginning to pull out of this long recession meanwhile its currency the nigerian naira has suffered a catastrophic collapse devaluing by nearly 70pc against the us dollar over the past 10 years it is with good reason that some pundits call nigeria the next venezuela in the making this might seem an unduly harsh verdict but the similarities between the two are striking nigeria is a relatively oil rich economy with a newly re elected left wing populist muhammadu buhari at its helm whose chief of staff is an avowed admirer of jeremy corbyn himself a devotee of venezuela s late hugo chavez both economies nigeria and venezuela have recklessly alienated international capital and utterly failed to harness their oil wealth even ghana less than a seventh the size of nigeria in terms of gdp receives more foreign direct investment these days than its near neighbour related news the socialist politics of envy what the world can learn from nigeria s unfolding disaster global investors and companies have lost faith in the country and are leaving in droves so too has its middle class nigeria is estimated to have lost about a tenth of its wealthier citizens to emigration in recent years its brightest and best have been voting with the feet in ruinous numbers doctors nurses engineers accountants entrepreneurs lawyers and so on success and wealth are routinely demonised by the buhari regime the grubby process of populist vote buying has triumphed over sound economics and pragmatic policy nigeria s newly re elected president muhammadu buhari during his campaign he glorified poverty and vilified success according to the nigerian political blogger david hundeyin buhari s recent election campaign was characterised not by any serious acknowledgement of nigeria s extreme investment deficit in education healthcare power generation and transport infrastructure but by attacks on the usual populist scapegoats corrupt people treasury looters and arrogant elites poverty was glorified success was vilified what has all this got to do with the west nigeria may be a country of nearly 200m but at less than 1pc of global gdp it is neither here nor there like venezuela it might be a cautionary tale in the politics of left wing populism yet its wider significance seems at most marginal well perhaps but the fact is that even as western populations age and decline nigeria s like much of the rest of africa is on an explosive growth path on the present trajectory nigeria s population is expected to more than double over the next 30 years reaching a scarcely credible 750m by 2100 according to projections by the census bureau of the united states that s plainly not going to be sustainable and therefore quite unlikely to occur in practice but even if only half right it creates in the absence of extremely rapid per capita economic growth myriad problems for the west related news 2019 election failed prophecies on buhari atiku contest the challenge of mass migration from sub saharan africa we see today threatens to turn into an exodus of positively biblical proportions however vigorous conventional border controls would struggle to prevent it it is therefore very much in the west s interests that africa follows asia into rapid economic advancement but here s the paradox experience suggests that migration from the developing world peaks when national income reaches the 6 000 to 7 000 per capita range much below that and only the middle classes and the enterprising have the wherewithal to make the break once income reaches that level however it provides the means for mass migration as things stand nigerian gdp per head is only 2 450 it could therefore be argued that the west perversely has an incentive to keep africa in relative poverty with an anti business politician such as buhari in charge we perhaps don t have to worry too much about an african invasion we can cynically take our pick of its most educated while leaving the rest to cope as best they can according to the emerging markets specialist renaissance capital to develop a large manufacturing sector you need electricity investment and literacy building on analysis by the american economist mary jean bowman charles robertson chief economist at renaissance capital has developed a neat little system for determining whether a country is capable of the sort of industrialisation necessary to achieve middle income status or better bowman established that one prerequisite was a minimum literacy rate of 70pc india achieved that level in 2015 some 20 years after china nigeria is still some way off riven by ethnic and religious division it is struggling to make progress related news africa s richest man dangote makes a 17 billion bid for immortality robertson adds another two pre conditions that a country needs a minimum investment rate of 25pc of gdp and that electricity consumption must reach an average of 300 kilowatt hours per person enough to power a tv and three low energy lightbulbs again nigeria is well short of these thresholds particularly on investment which is only half that level robertson is more optimistic than most about nigeria s prospects of eventually getting there he also points out that buhari s government is not the totally unreconstructed hard left populist cabinet it might seem it contains some notable reformers whose anti corruption crusade can only be applauded even so nigeria for now remains an economy linked inextricably to the fortunes of the oil price and like russia apparently incapable of decent levels of growth when the price is low for nigeria abundant oil has proved as much a curse as a blessing again the problem is population production per capita is too low to make a material difference to average incomes but just high enough to remove the incentives for other sources of income growth the next venezuela it s all too possible telegraph uk
in the cover story of the november december 2017 issue of the washington monthly executive editor gilad edelman chronicled how anti monopoly politics including revived antitrust enforcement had seemed to go from fringe argument to a pillar of the democrats economic plan at least rhetorically overnight it turned out that years of earnest washington monthly articles on the subject played a role but he cautioned things like merely including a section on corporate concentration in the democrats better deal agenda were just baby steps it remained to be seen whether the issue would develop into a real campaign topic two things happened this week that suggest the answer may be yes yesterday at a rally in council bluffs iowa senator bernie sanders who recently entered the presidential race delivered a speech about how to improve the fortunes of rural america that heavily emphasized the need to combat agricultural monopolies the argument sounded strikingly similar to the ones recently made by the open markets institute s claire kelloway in the washington monthly and austin frerick in the american conservative the other big news came this morning when fellow candidate senator elizabeth warren made her own antitrust news by unveiling a regulatory plan aimed at breaking up some of america s largest tech companies including amazon google apple and facebook it s a plan that sounds a bit like former mark zuckerberg mentor roger mcnamee s groundbreaking 2018 washington monthly article which sounded the alarm on the myriad threats posed by the platform monopolies from the speech among many other things that need to be done is for the federal government to enforce anti trust laws and i will appoint an attorney general who will do just that it is not acceptable to me that the top four packing companies control more than 80 percent of the beef market 63 percent of the pork market and 53 percent of the chicken market and these numbers understate the situation in many communities there really is only one buyer which means food producers are at their mercy they must use that corporation s feed and livestock they must accept that corporation s costs and they must accept that corporation s lower and lower payment rates in many cases the farmer doesn t even own the livestock or supplies they are effectively contract employees who are forced to lease everything and then get paid an inadequate wage for their very hard work with the federal government not enforcing antitrust laws we have seen mergers like the bayer monsanto approved giving the two largest conglomerates 78 percent of the corn seed market over the past couple of days we ve published a couple of articles that could be viewed as favorable to former vice president joe biden but now it s time to issue him a warning the democratic party is already on our antitrust bus and he needs to get on board too because his record as a senator on these issues is woeful people often mark the decline of antitrust enforcement as beginning with the election of ronald reagan but that s not accurate the history is more complex and anti regulatory reform was a hot topic among a lot of democrats in the 1970s including many progressives like ralph nader in a recent huffington post piece zach carter takes us back to the history books to a battle between biden and senator ted kennedy when the senator from massachusetts moved up to the chairmanship of the judiciary committee this year the hearts of antitrust activists beat faster the new york times noted in 1979 kennedy had his sights on a sweeping piece of legislation that would block corporate mergers based on the total size of the resulting company even if the company was a conglomerate of unrelated businesses and the merger did not increase a firm s share of business in a particular market but kennedy almost immediately ran into problems with biden when coca cola urged congress to exempt the soft drink industry from these antitrust regulations biden joined republicans to pass such a bill over the objections of kennedy and department of justice antitrust expert ky ewing who concluded that the bill was special interest legislation with no evidence to support it as biden fought kennedy on the coca cola bill he was also trying to thwart a kennedy effort that would have empowered consumers to sue over a broader swath of antitrust violations the latter day villains in the antitrust battle are already revealing themselves in reaction to senator warren s direct challenge to the power of platform monopolies senator elizabeth warren proposed in a medium post on friday to dismantle so called big tech facebook google and amazon but antitrust experts found serious flaws in her proposal the presidential hopeful is using a sledgehammer that is breaking companies up to address problems like data privacy that could be solved in other ways noted herbert hovenkamp a leading authority on antitrust law because of economies of scale hovenkamp noted bigger companies can offer cheaper products and forcing them to spin off businesses could hurt consumers customers are not complaining about amazon it s got some of the highest consumer evaluations in retailing the story for smaller businesses is a little more mixed but on balance a lot of them like dealing with amazon noted hovenkamp a professor at the university of pennsylvania law school the tech companies have more money than a saudi prince and they have no shortage of leading authorities on antitrust law to provide quotes for yahoo finance articles panning the proposals of the democratic presidential contenders this is going to be a major battle throughout the 2020 campaign and into the next decade joe biden was on the wrong side of this battle when it began in a very significant and major way he s going to need a come to jesus moment on corporate consolidation and antitrust regulation if he wants to atone for his past and provide leadership for the future

officer bernard acoca bernard acoca president and chief executive officer thanks larry good afternoon everyone and thank you all for joining us today our transformation agenda continued to drive momentum in the quarter and i m incredibly proud of our fourth quarter results during the quarter we achieved 4 4 systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth which was our best systemwide result since the first quarter of 2015 and a two year sales comp of 5 8 we are proud that we drove these results by bringing more people into our restaurants achieving systemwide comparable restaurant transaction growth of 2 3 this quarter we delivered restaurant operating profit margin of 18 7 and pro forma eps of 0 16 on an ongoing operating basis up 45 over the comparable quarter last year this was all accomplished despite significant headwinds in the quarter in the form of california wildfires and avocado shortage a spike in tomato prices and a nationwide recall by the cdc on romaine lettuce in the hyper competitive category we achieved these results without engaging in the steep discounting of our competitors in fact we reduced the amount of discounting year over year which is testament to the growing strength of our brand we believe these results are evidence that the initiatives we launched as part of our transformation agenda in march of last year are producing the desired results and we are just getting started i would like to personally thank all of our employees and franchisee partners without whom these results would not be possible the passion commitment and resilience that our employees and franchisees demonstrate to take care of our customers and one another give me great confidence that our company mission to feed the love that makes us all feel like family is being brought to life by them each and every day during the quarter we further strengthened our leadership team adding industry veteran hector munoz as chief marketing officer on december 3rd hector was most recently executive vice president and global chief marketing officer at church s chicken and previously served for nearly seven years as us chief marketing officer for popeyes he s an inspirational servant leader who built an impressive track record for driving same store sales growth in both companies and we re thrilled to have him on board as we transition our company to being a more brand centric organization also we recently reached agreements in principle to settle our securities class action lawsuit and multiple wage and hour class action lawsuits it was important for us to get these long standing legal issues taken care of so that we can focus all our attention going forward on building upon the momentum generated in 2018 as we look ahead to 2019 we remain focused on executing our transformation agenda which entails four key strategies one developing the people first culture by investing in and growing our talent two differentiating the brand by accentuating our strengths and building upon them three simplifying operations thereby making it easier to be an employee and franchisee and four growing the business responsibly and profitably for the long term i d now like to touch on the four strategies and highlight some of the key initiatives supporting each as i ve discussed previously we believe that culture is the foundation for all great companies and the enabler for everything we do therefore it is critical that we continue to invest in and develop our talent in creating a people first culture we have set out to drive a performance based culture with heart along these lines we recently implemented a new bonus program for both field and support center employees that rewards them based on sales profitability and customer satisfaction improvement this customer satisfaction piece has been enabled by a new measurement we developed in october called our overall blended index or obi which aggregates our mystery shops customer surveys and customer complaints in each one of our restaurants and automates an action plan for our restaurant general managers to respond to that data the obi has proven to have a strong correlation with sales performance and we believe this bonus structure is a much more robust way to reward what we value and drive better sales profits and positive customer experiences another example of our people first culture and values being put in practice is the program that launches in a few days our very first employee appreciation month as a company our primary goal each and every day is to determine new and meaningful ways we can make our employees jobs easier and more rewarding employee appreciation month has been designed with this objective in mind we have developed four weeks of planned activity designed to celebrate invest in and thank our greatest asset our employees week one will be about recognizing our employees for all they do and launching our new dedicated service awards a program designed to recognize long term employees in our restaurants and support center week two will be an investment in our employees professional development and personal well being week three will showcase our employees unique talents and have them help us come up with our next great new product week four will focus on volunteerism and giving back to the communities we serve culminating in a huge community service event in east los angeles on april 1st cesar chavez day a day intended to commemorate his legacy by giving back to those in need our second strategy is to accentuate our brand strengths and build upon them thereby differentiating the brand and making the company s values a source of competitive advantage these strengths and values were identified through an extensive brand segmentation completed last fall that work helped us identify our core customers and reaffirm our key brand differentiators and is captured in our brand book which serves as a strategic filter for all our decision making particularly how we communicate everything we do going forward based on this work we have just initiated a comprehensive brand relaunch incorporating our new look this month across our system a new logo advertising tag line menu boards and point of purchase materials will be rolled out in the month of march with the new e commerce site mobile app packaging and uniforms being phased into the system later this year i m especially excited by our new tag line feed the flame which not only highlights that we are the only major restaurant brand that is a true fire burning grill a source of competitive advantage for us but also points the aspirational passions for life our employees and customers share as we relaunch the brand we are also focused on building a tested product pipeline centered on a food type we are now calling l a mex l a mex is the juxtaposition of better for you food that is the hallmark of quintessentially la lifestyle and mexican inspired cuisine we have coined this phrase to indicate not only where our brand originated and how los angeles has shaped and influenced us but also to encapsulate what we ve been doing in our kitchens for years we will reinforce l a mex in our communications moving forward to emphasize that you don t have to feel guilty eating at el pollo loco because so much of our food is grilled made from scratch made with only the freshest ingredients and can be personalized to meet any diet whether you are following a paleo regime or strictly vegetarian one in order to cast the widest net we are also seeking to develop products that equally appeal to both our hispanic and general market consumers our last three promotions are great examples of these type of products in the fourth quarter we launched handmade chicken tamales a classic mexican holiday dish to kick off the holiday season we then started 2019 with fire grilled chicken nachos and are now promoting hand rolled stone ground enchiladas all of these product offerings were designed to have broad base acceptance and have been well received by our guests across multiple demographic lines on the technology front we continue to make loyalty digital and delivery bigger parts of how we connect with our customers our loyalty program now has over 1 2 million members and accounts for approximately 7 5 of our sales our goal in the next two years is to get the 5 million members and make our loyalty program a bigger part of how we go to market this includes transitioning our discounts away from mass market vehicles and focusing them instead in a much more pinpointed fashion in our loyalty program where we can drive higher levels of incrementality based on knowledge of our customers purchase history all of our restaurants currently have access to delivery through doordash in order to expand our delivery presence we ve recently signed agreements with postmates and uber eats to sell on their marketplaces which we expect to test and implement during the year in the second half of this year we will further increase our number of digital access points by allowing our customers to order from us on facebook messenger via chatbot technology and enable voice activated orders on devices like amazon s alexa our third strategy is focused on simplifying operations for our employees and franchisees this strategy was recently added to the original transformation agenda to highlight the importance of operations and the work we know we need to do to reduce back of house complexity in order to free up capacity to deliver a better experience front of house as part of our brand relaunch we have implemented the first phase of menu simplification in our restaurants which we tested last year this involves eliminating approximately 20 of lower mixing lower margin menu items in addition we continue to invest in technology that will streamline our operations this year we are implementing a new pack of health management system which is expected to free up one hour per day for our restaurant general managers we are revisiting and revising some of our standard operating procedures to minimize non value added non customer facing work we believe simplified operations can significantly improve our employee s ability to execute our brand providing better food and service with the added benefit of lower turnover and increased retention the final strategy underpinning our transformation agenda is profitably and responsibly growing our business for the long term we are currently setting the foundation for new market expansion with a target date of 2020 for entry into one or two new markets this includes developing a new store of the future in partnership with an outside firm which will incorporate our new brand visual expression and create a market entry marketing strategy based among other things on our learnings from texas furthermore we believe the work we are doing to streamline our menu and enhance our operations platform will facilitate success in new markets in summary we believe our transformation agenda has put us on the right track as evidenced by our fourth quarter results we believe this momentum will only accelerate as our transformation agenda continues to gain traction and we further elevate the el pollo loco brand i look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls i d now like to hand the call over to larry to review our fourth quarter results in more detail laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer thanks bernard before we get into our fourth quarter results i d first like to touch on our store base during the fourth quarter we opened two new company operated restaurants in southern california franchisees also opened two new restaurants during the quarter one in utah and one in texas looking ahead we expect to open three to four company operated restaurants along with three to five franchise restaurants in 2019 at remodels the company completed eight vision remodels in the fourth quarter and franchisees completed an additional 14 this year we plan to complete 10 to 15 company remodels and expect our franchise partners to complete another 10 to 15 now onto our financial results for the fourth quarter ended december 26 2018 total revenue increased 11 6 to 106 3 million from 95 2 million in the fourth quarter 2017 total revenue in the quarter included a 5 2 million of advertising revenue related to franchise advertising fund contributions required as part of new accounting guidance implementation excluding the advertising fund revenue total revenue would have increased 6 2 driven by an increase in company operated restaurant sales company operated restaurant sales grew 6 in the quarter to 94 6 million from 89 3 million in the fourth quarter of last year this increase in company operated restaurant sales was driven by the contribution from the 12 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as by 3 7 increase in company operated comparable restaurant sales partially offset by seven restaurant closures during the same period the increase in company operated comparable restaurant sales was composed of a 1 increase in transaction and a 2 7 increase in average check franchise revenue increased 9 2 in the fourth quarter to 6 4 million compared to 5 9 million in the prior year period the increase was largely driven by a 5 1 increase in franchise comparable restaurant sales which included transaction growth of 3 3 as well as by the contribution from the 10 new franchise restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by four restaurant closures during the same period expenses food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 50 basis point year over year to 28 4 the improvement was predominantly due to higher menu prices looking ahead we have locked in our chicken need for the year and expect total inflation of 1 to 2 in 2019 as a reminder chicken makes up approximately 40 of our commodity basket labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 60 basis points year over year to 29 3 the increase in labor expenses was primarily due to higher hourly wages in california especially los angeles and higher group insurance partially offset by increased menu prices and a reversal of an accrual as a result of california no longer being a credit reduction state we expect labor inflation of about 6 in 2019 occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 20 basis points year over year to 23 6 the decrease was primarily due to sales leverage and restaurant closures partially offset by higher delivery charges as well as increased costs for trash pickup services and operating supplies general and administrative expenses increased by 1 5 million year over year to 12 4 million included in g a our 3 million of legal expenses associated with the securities litigation as compared to 1 9 million in securities litigation costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the costs associated with the securities litigation and adjusting for the impact of franchise advertising revenues on our 2018 revenues g a expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased approximately 350 000 year over year to 9 3 of total revenue a 20 basis point decrease versus the prior year the dollar increase in g a expenses resulted primarily from an increase in our bonus accrual and higher group insurance costs depreciation and amortization expense increased to 4 8 million from 4 5 million in the fourth quarter of last year the increase was primarily due to new restaurant openings and remodels completed during and after the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by the impairment of 12 restaurants during the same time period as a percentage of company revenue depreciation and amortization decreased 20 basis points year over year the decrease was primarily driven by increased sales revenue which leveraged the higher expense noted above during the fourth quarter we incurred a total of 36 3 million of pre tax expense related to two agreements in principle to settle several class action lawsuits the securities loss suit settlement agreement and associated legal expenses and the wage and hour settlement agreement have been adjusted out of our pro forma net income calculations we recorded an income tax benefit of 8 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for an effective tax rate of 26 4 this compares to an income tax benefit of 4 8 million and an effective tax rate of 99 2 in the prior year fourth quarter we reported a gaap net loss of 23 4 million or 0 60 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to a net loss of 38 000 or 0 per diluted share in the prior year period pro forma net income for the quarter was 6 1 million as compared to net income of 4 4 million in the fourth quarter of last year pro forma diluted earnings per share were 0 16 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 0 11 in the prior year period for a reconciliation of pro forma net income and earnings per share to the comparable gaap figures please refer to our earnings release in terms of our liquidity and balance sheet we had 7 million in cash and equivalents as of december 26 2018 and 74 2 million in debt outstanding for the foreseeable future we expect to finance our operations including new restaurant development and maintenance capital through cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility for 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to total 14 million to 19 million during the quarter we repurchased 66 409 shares for approximately 980 000 or an average price of 14 78 as of december 26 2018 we had approximately 19 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization turning to our outlook for 2019 we are providing guidance for the full year as follows excluding the impact of potential share repurchases we expect pro forma diluted net income per share of 0 70 to 0 75 this compares to pro forma diluted net income per share of 0 74 in 2018 our pro forma net income per share guidance for 2019 is based in part on the following annual assumptions we expect systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth to be approximately 2 to 4 as i noted we expect to open three to four new company owned restaurants and expect our franchisees to open three to five new restaurants we expect restaurant contribution margin of between 18 2 and 18 9 we expect g a expenses of between 8 4 and 8 6 of total revenue excluding ceo transition costs and legal fees related to securities class action litigation and reflecting our change in accounting for franchise advertising fees we expect adjusted ebitda of between 62 million and 65 million and we are using a pro forma income tax rate of 26 5 this concludes our prepared remarks we d like to thank you again for joining us on the call today and we are now happy to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jake bartlett with suntrust please proceed with your question jake bartlett suntrust analyst great thanks for taking the question first i had a question about the guidance in same store sales and just how confident you are that you can you keep it this kind of current level this strong level and maybe in that answer kind of give us an indication as to what how you re trending right now bernard acoca president and chief executive officer so i ll answer the first part of the question i ll let for the same store sales portion of the question i ll let larry answer the balance of it what we can say right now is that in the current quarter that we re in we are positive however i don t think what we could have envisioned at the start of this fiscal year is the what is now approaching record rainfall in southern california or in california in general i should say where we have 80 of our restaurants and what has turned out to be record cold weather in the month of february the coldest february in 60 years so normally i it s hard for me to talk about weather as being a factor in our business but when you got that many restaurants located in the state of california given what we have been experiencing thus far within the quarter it is starting to have an impact with that being said we are positive and we are fighting through it and we do believe that that is an anomaly that is seasonally based versus something that we re going to live with for the duration of the year jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah jake so jake bartlett suntrust analyst yeah sorry laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer jake so i think what you hear from bernard saying is we feel good about that range for the full year despite what we re seeing as a soft start to the first quarter really driven by weather the only the other thing i d highlight about the first quarter is in addition to the weather impact causing results to be a little softer than we expected we have a couple of other expense items in the first quarter really around severance and some high gas prices which really hit in december which we saw in january february so as we look at the quarterization of the year i think q1 will be a little softer relative year over year versus the other quarters of the year so i think as you guys look at your models and things i suggest you look at that because again i think given the softer start to the year in terms of sales and some of the expenses we ve seen q1 year over year will be a little softer than the other quarters ever again we still believe the 0 70 to 0 75 range that we re projecting is a good range jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it and i had a couple of questions about margins and just looking at the margin guidance for restaurant level margins it looks like you re expecting about a similar decrease year over year on a basis points basis despite having what looks to be stronger comps and so just trying to understand that on the restaurant level maybe that s an indication that maybe the company might not be as strong as the system or maybe that s baked into your guidance if you could address that and also the question about g a and it looks like it s expected to accelerate pretty meaningfully in 19 as a percentage of sales which is also year over year growth kind of aside from earning the one time charges what is driving that and should we when should we expect you to get leverage on g a going forward laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah so let me talk g a first and i ll talk margins g a the biggest driver of the increase is the bonus adjustment so obviously when we look year over year we go back to a 100 bonus accrual projection will be hitting plan and so when you see year on year overall after securities litigation costs and ceo transition costs i think we re up about 3 million or so to get within that range the bonus adjustment is by far the biggest driver of that we have a little bit higher in terms of equity compensation in that number and then the balance of salaries and other g a expenses are roughly flat so overall we ve done a real good job in terms of managing g a overall but again we ll have that bonus adjustment and a little bit on the equity that will drive the costs up year over year if we have the year that we are targeting at this year then i expect to start leveraging g a next year quite honestly as we continue to build sales and not have this seems like annual bonus adjustments that we have to lap into the future so in terms of margins what you re seeing now is the wage inflation which has if you look at the past several years it has become higher and higher for us one just from the magnitude of the minimum wage increases here in california the other one is the ability to manage the compression has gotten tougher basically managing a difference between your higher paid labor in restaurants like shift layers and cooks relative to cashiers and chefs so we ve had to move more than more in line with minimum wage increases so we haven t had the ability to manage that compression so you got the wage pressures and versus the last three years where we had food costs deflation this year as you have heard in our opening remarks we expect to have a little bit inflation in food costs i don t have that offset so we ve pretty consistently saying you really need to be probably 3 5 comp growth in order to hold margin flat maybe even north of that so that s why you re seeing the high end of the range were basically flat on margins but if you get lower you could see some margin degradation if we don t get that kind of comp lift jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question is from matthew difrisco with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst thank you so much i have a couple of questions just first on the remodels that you ve been doing can you just talk about how much of those what s the type of lift you re seeing of those and i guess are you gaining some momentum on those or is that becoming a greater factor to some of the momentum we saw toward the end of the year on the comp laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yes overall when we look at the vision remodels over the last couple of years you re able to get varying performance anywhere from roughly flat up to north of high double digits in terms of the growth on average to average them out you re probably running somewhere around 5 to 7 overall lift now we ll highlight that the remodels that we did in late 16 and 17 and earlier 18 you re getting higher lift in those numbers because what we re doing is we re getting toward the tail end of the restaurant that need to be remodeled so these are pre hacienda but they are also the ones we waited the longest on just because they have site issues they have other issues that we just wait until we get into the remodel so we expect less lift on those so going forward what we re doing is really going back through only doing restaurants that are pre hacienda for those who go back probably around 10 years or so that haven t been touched and we re looking for before going to do remodels we re also going to be working on get those costs down and do some modifications to the vision remodel because obviously with our new brand image and things we want and we build some of those elements into those remodels as we re doing them so that s why number of remodels is only 10 to 15 and again the lift we re seeing from the later ones was lower which we expected just because again they have other issues which put them at the very end of the list of restaurants remodeling matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay and then just a bookkeeping question i think you said also the debt balance was around 74 million at the end of the year is that correct laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yes matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst that incorporates the 36 million of the legal settlement or are there some does the balance now in entering into 19 has that creeped up or is that 74 million representative of you fully paying out any liabilities you may have had to encash bernard acoca president and chief executive officer no so the 74 million is where we ended the year and then it was just fairly recently that we entered into these agreements in principle on the legal settlements so if those go through we ll see those borrowing balances increase probably in three four five months or so so as i project the year i expect to be starting obviously at 74 million we should see an increase kind of mid year and then come back down again given our free cash flow and i expect to get back down to probably 75 to 85 million level in debt matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay so you might go back the 36 million added onto that might take you up to 110 million and then you come down basically throughout the year is that the way to think of it bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah something that yeah matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst and that s incorporated in your guidance or eps guidance bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yes matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay and then the last question i guess if you look at the comp guidance i think clearly you guys said that it is positive in 1q however i guess if we look at it ex the weather and assuming you re going to have sunny dry california return are you seeing the same type of is there any reason to think that there is two year momentum that you saw in the fourth quarter didn t end when the calendar switched but you re seeing that on the normalized days still bernard acoca president and chief executive officer but i think the answer on to that is reflected in the full year guidance so i mean i think you re seeing us there project comps for the full year that are closer to that range so i think that is reflected in the quarterly and full year guidance we provided matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you operator our next question is from david tarantino with robert w baird please proceed with your question david tarantino robert w baird analyst hi good afternoon my first question is on the q4 sales trends and you saw a nice inflection in the traffic in the positive territory bernard i guess i m curious to know your thoughts on what the key drivers of that inflection were i know you have a lot of components of the transformation plan but are there one or two things that you see in the business that really drove that inflection bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah i think it s pretty consistent with what we ve been sharing out it s never one thing it s several things that i think in the aggregate have really helped get us more consistent traction with the business i d say one of the drivers certainly is the fact that we re clear on who our primary customer is in terms of who frequents us most often which is a hispanic customer and while we certainly haven t neglected the general market customer what we did in 2018 was we took our media spend which was less than 8 when i joined the organization and we took that up to over slightly 20 to put more of a focus on the hispanic customer whom we see visit our restaurants and 50 of our customers on a daily basis fallen that hispanic category now still 80 of our media is spent in the general market so it s not like we re not equally going after with the same intensity that consumer group but we felt in 2018 until we made that correction that we were not doubling down on who our best and most loyal customer was is i should say so that s one thing i think the second thing is when you truly have clarity around your customer hierarchy we ve been able with the segmentation work that we ve done and the brand work that we ve done we ve been able to develop i believe a more compelling product pipeline which you saw with our chicken tamale promotion in the fourth quarter as well as advertising that i think is more reflective of who our core customer is and really what our brand needs to stand for going forward i think our differentiators we re more readily apparent as the year progressed so i think that was another big driver the business was just simply more compelling advertising and more relevant products that seem to resonate very very strongly with our consumer base the third thing that i would say and this is really just the magical unlock in our business is really operations which is why you saw an adjustment in our transformation agenda occurred late last year it wasn t one of the overarching strategies i talked about in q2 or q3 of last year but it s one that i m talking about with a lot of intensity now and that is simplifying our operations and making it easier to be an employee and franchisee and part of that also is building a sales driving mindset with our operators and having them own a portion of the sales result which was something that they weren t really looked to do in the they weren t looked or responsible for doing in the past to the degree that they are today so we are setting very clear upsell targets with them that they are required to achieve on a daily basis that gets measured real time in the restaurants and so there is a higher degree of accountability there around having operations own a portion of our sales so i would say those are the big ones those are the big drivers and those initiatives are certainly carrying forward into 2019 david tarantino robert w baird analyst great that s really helpful and on the operations side you mentioned simplification of the menu so can you elaborate on what you re seeing so far with that reduction in the number of skus bernard acoca president and chief executive officer so we talked about the fact that we ve been testing this in los angeles and we launched it in texas as well last year we mentioned at that time that in our test we saw no sales degradation if anything we saw a mix shift a little some slight mix shift into what we wanted to achieve was into our chicken on the bone products and we eliminated low margin low mixing items from the menu that we just didn t think earn their keep any longer with the intensive simplifying our operations back of house so that labor could be redeployed front of house we launched that as of saturday last saturday and we naturally too soon to tell what it s doing now that we have it at scale but based on how long we tested it in our markets in 2018 we have a lot of confidence that what we saw in test will carry forward now that we ve launched it throughout the system in 2019 so too soon to give you any further detail on that since it s relatively new but we ll be we ll share out more detail as it becomes available david tarantino robert w baird analyst right and larry couple of quick ones for you so i may have missed it but did you talk about how much pricing is in your same store sales assumption for 2019 laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer no you re the first to ask that david so we are our target for this year is in the i call it the mid 3 range the mid 3s having said that what we re trying to do is do incremental pricing during the year so each time we do that like we just took some pricing this past weekend and so each time we take that we ll monitor to see what the impact is because despite the cost pressures we do want to be careful about getting too far out in front on the pricing front but right now the target is in the mid 3 range and but again we ll assess it as we move along to determine that we keep moving up on that path david tarantino robert w baird analyst got it and then last one on i think on the labor line you mentioned there was an accrual reversal in that line in q4 and i think we heard that from a couple of companies that have a lot of restaurants in california so how big was the impact of that accrual and i guess can you confirm that that s going to continue to be a benefit in 2019 so 19 versus 18 will it be neutral when you add it all up laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i think the impact of reverse in the accrual was somewhere around 600 000 to 700 000 in that range and really the reason we had such big change in the fourth quarter is because we have been incurring ph all year and then it finally came out i guess was october november that california has finally repaid all the money it owed to the federal government and therefore is no longer going to be penalized through employment taxes and so we re able to reverse that accrual then going forward there should be no year over year impact but the quarters will look it will be more evenly spread across the quarter so that accrual benefit in q4 of 2018 will be spread across the first three quarters next year david tarantino robert w baird analyst understood okay thank you very much operator our next question is from sharon zackfia with william blair please proceed sharon zackfia william blair analyst hi good afternoon actually following up on the labor question it looks like the per unit labor spend accelerated a lot in the fourth quarter if you kind of break into it and i guess i was curious whether the group insurance dynamic that you talked about was meaningful in the quarter because it seems like the 60 basis point increase on the 3 7 ph comp is out of keeping with what we saw the rest of the year laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i mean so the group insurance was not insignificant it was probably just 400 000 to 500 000 sharon zackfia william blair analyst okay and what was that larry is that like are you self insured or can you talk about what that is laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we re self insured so we will see wide fluctuations in that number just based on the claims that come through sharon zackfia william blair analyst okay perfect and then a question on the plans for 2019 i think at one point you had mentioned the potential for some new chicken flavor profiles and i don t know if that was still something that you re thinking of in terms of menu innovation for 2019 and maybe give us some color on how impactful that might be or when we might see that in the restaurants bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah so that s something that we still have in test right now in terms of just ideas that we are concept screening and also just playing within our test kitchens to figure out how to best operationalize but what i will say is so that s something that we re still investigating and figuring out the best way to bring to market but what i will say certainly with hector s arrival here as chief marketing officer what we are going to be doing at a far more accelerated rate is putting a lot more ideas at the top of our product development funnel so that we ve got a pantry full of really compelling ideas to the degree to which we haven t had them before so really ramping up product innovation is a huge growth driver for us moving forward in developing compelling innovation that really hits the mark in terms of what our customers want from us is going to be something that you will see going forward and we ve got some exciting things planned for 2019 sharon zackfia william blair analyst are you planning to keep the marketing budget the same as a percentage of sales or is there any thought on moving that bernard acoca president and chief executive officer currently it s staying where it is so there is no short term desire to change at the moment sharon zackfia william blair analyst yeah thank you operator our next question is from andy barish with jefferies please proceed with your question alexandra chan jefferies analyst hey bernard hey larry this is alex on for andy just wanted to follow up on david s question around pricing and clarify are you looking for mid 3s for the full year or really of ramp up to that 3 by year end and i guess thinking about the mix and how you ve seen a slightly positive mix there with upsell work i m trying to understand the traffic dynamics in the guidance here bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah so we expect for the full year to average about mid 3s alexandra chan jefferies analyst okay and would you expect mix to remain positive bernard acoca president and chief executive officer i think we re targeting mix to be flat more or less flat maybe slightly positive a lot of it depends on how successful we are in terms of driving family meals which is obviously one of the big initiatives that we have if we move that mix up i would expect to be positive mix i m kind of thinking flat to slightly positive on mix alexandra chan jefferies analyst okay that makes sense and then historically the franchisees had outperformed the company on comps but that was something that you were working on last quarter as well and here in the fourth quarter both the comp and traffic saw that gap widen a bit with the work you are doing around increased staffing at dinner drive through and peak days of the week do you think you can start to close that gap this year bernard acoca president and chief executive officer no i think those were tests so i want to make sure that there s no shame that that wasn t necessarily spread throughout the entire company system and so we were taking we re still looking at what adding incremental labor very judiciously and selectively in our business can do to drive results what i would say is the real opportunity in our business is driving a level of operational consistency throughout the system unit by unit by unit i ll just be very candid we ve got some outstanding restaurant operations in certain geographies and we ve got opportunities in others and the key goal is to drive a level of consistency throughout that i think will then be reflected in the results so that s really where we are focusing the lion s share of our effort these days alexandra chan jefferies analyst that makes sense and then i guess given larry s comment on the family meals we ve seen here in this quarter the approach of value looks like sort of an add on offering with the four for 4 enchiladas do you think about the strategy this year for value really on kind of add ons and that of holistic value versus maybe what we ve seen previously with that discounting around single entrees bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah so i think how our approach was in 2018 and continues to be to reduce our discounting year over year that s kind of the opposite of what you hear a lot of our competitors doing or saying and i think again that is testament to the strength of our brand and our ability to command and have pricing power in the market and i think the reason why we re able to do that is because we have become better storytellers and really explaining what the quality difference is in our products and explaining to the world the hard work that we do each and every day in terms that everything that is handcrafted made from scratch et cetera that our competitors simply don t do with that being said a lot of these value add ons you re seeing us promote and advertise in conjunction with family meals are really designed to address the fact that again in 2018 we made in the second half of the year a concerted effort to go after families and we have a mantra internally within the company that we want to own families one of the ways that we are figuring out how to do that is to really ensure that mom have an opportunity to provide her family with everything that they want whereas her and her husband or dad choose selecting for his family might decide that he wants chicken on the bone but the younger children in the family wants something else now we are providing that kind of a value offering where chicken on the bone could be had by perhaps by the older members of the family and then if there s something for the younger members of the family to enjoy and indulge in if chicken on the bone isn t something that they want and moms and dads can add that on for value price which serves not only a consumer need in this particular case but provides value to the family while helping us increase our overall ticket ph so that s one of the ways we re really trying to become more relevant at dinner while not discounting our business unnecessarily alexandra chan jefferies analyst great thanks that s all from me operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks bernard acoca president and chief executive officer thank you everyone for attending this quarter s call we look forward to regrouping with you next quarter as we continue to make

for years president trump has been obsessed with trade deficits incorrectly viewing them as a good measure of which countries are winning and which are losing the united states has run a trade deficit for decades thereby designating us a perennial loser in trump s worldview he promised to turn things around by picking a few easy to win trade wars instead by trump s own measure we re bigger losers than ever before the trade deficit just jumped to its largest size in a decade even worse our deficit in goods which trump for some reason emphasizes most just hit its largest level ever there are a few takeaways from this news including that trade was probably a bigger drag on growth last year than previously forecast but the bigger question is this why exactly is the trade deficit expanding when trump promised it would shrink the answer largely though not exclusively has to do with trump s own economic policies to be clear trade deficits whether bilateral or otherwise are not necessarily bad nor are they a sign that we re being somehow cheated by other countries they reflect broader trends in the economy including savings and investment rates small or shrinking trade deficits are also not necessarily a measure of a healthy economy in fact as bloomberg news shawn donnan points out the year the u s trade deficit shrank the most was 2009 which was not exactly a blockbuster year for the economy we were at the tail end of the great recession then and because the economy was bad americans bought less stuff from abroad today the u s economy is healthy with economic growth relatively robust this is partly because of the fiscal stimulus trump has been pumping into the economy through both his tax cuts and federal spending hikes consumers have more money to spend which means they demand more stuff and companies have ramped up their imports to satisfy that demand simultaneously other countries including china and members of the european union have not been doing so hot with the u s economy doing well while other economies are faltering and the federal reserve raising rates the dollar has strengthened making foreign products look cheaper and making our exports more expensive i e less competitive in other countries that too leads to higher trade deficits and it s one of many reasons team trump might want to cool it with the schadenfreude about other countries economic woes so in some ways then trump s preferred metric of winning is a victim of his own fiscally driven economic success but it s also a victim of his trade policy failures he has picked trade wars the world over with friends and foes alike he has also threatened even more tariffs including an additional hike in tariffs on chinese goods a new national security driven duty on auto imports etc these actions and threats have led to some predictable consequences one is that u s companies have stocked up on some imported goods to beat the tariffs which increases imports in the short run higher imports equal bigger trade deficit another is that other countries have levied their own retaliatory tariffs on our own products most famously red state goods such as soybeans and bourbon so there has been less demand for u s exports lower exports also equal bigger trade deficit trump has pledged that once his brilliantly negotiated deals go through the new north american free trade agreement gets ratified by congress china fully capitulates to all his wildest demands the european union and japan suddenly decide to buy more of our cars etc our balance of trade will turn around there s reason to be skeptical however and not only because some of these objectives seem like fantasies even the ones that look more plausible such as the implementation of the new nafta seem unlikely to move the needle after all the new nafta looks an awful lot like the old nafta plus some language cribbed from the pacific trade pact trump pulled us out of in fact the most significant change in the new nafta deal involves new content rules for autos which are intended to lead to more manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in the united states but as trade experts have pointed out these new rules may be so costly to comply with that they could have the opposite of their intended effect leading manufacturers to source less rather than more content from north america which could mean a boost to auto and auto parts imports which would contribute to you guessed it a wider trade deficit email crampell washpost com twitter crampell

and chief executive officer bernard acoca bernard acoca president and chief executive officer thanks larry good afternoon everyone and thank you all for joining us today our transformation agenda continued to drive momentum in the quarter and i m incredibly proud of our fourth quarter results during the quarter we achieved 4 4 systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth which was our best systemwide result since the first quarter of 2015 and a two year sales comp of 5 8 we are proud that we drove these results by bringing more people into our restaurants achieving systemwide comparable restaurant transaction growth of 2 3 this quarter we delivered restaurant operating profit margin of 18 7 and pro forma eps of 0 16 on an ongoing operating basis up 45 over the comparable quarter last year this was all accomplished despite significant headwinds in the quarter in the form of california wildfires and avocado shortage a spike in tomato prices and a nationwide recall by the cdc on romaine lettuce in the hyper competitive category we achieved these results without engaging in the steep discounting of our competitors in fact we reduced the amount of discounting year over year which is testament to the growing strength of our brand we believe these results are evidence that the initiatives we launched as part of our transformation agenda in march of last year are producing the desired results and we are just getting started i would like to personally thank all of our employees and franchisee partners without whom these results would not be possible the passion commitment and resilience that our employees and franchisees demonstrate to take care of our customers and one another give me great confidence that our company mission to feed the love that makes us all feel like family is being brought to life by them each and every day during the quarter we further strengthened our leadership team adding industry veteran hector munoz as chief marketing officer on december 3rd hector was most recently executive vice president and global chief marketing officer at church s chicken and previously served for nearly seven years as us chief marketing officer for popeyes he s an inspirational servant leader who built an impressive track record for driving same store sales growth in both companies and we re thrilled to have him on board as we transition our company to being a more brand centric organization also we recently reached agreements in principle to settle our securities class action lawsuit and multiple wage and hour class action lawsuits it was important for us to get these long standing legal issues taken care of so that we can focus all our attention going forward on building upon the momentum generated in 2018 as we look ahead to 2019 we remain focused on executing our transformation agenda which entails four key strategies one developing the people first culture by investing in and growing our talent two differentiating the brand by accentuating our strengths and building upon them three simplifying operations thereby making it easier to be an employee and franchisee and four growing the business responsibly and profitably for the long term i d now like to touch on the four strategies and highlight some of the key initiatives supporting each as i ve discussed previously we believe that culture is the foundation for all great companies and the enabler for everything we do therefore it is critical that we continue to invest in and develop our talent in creating a people first culture we have set out to drive a performance based culture with heart along these lines we recently implemented a new bonus program for both field and support center employees that rewards them based on sales profitability and customer satisfaction improvement this customer satisfaction piece has been enabled by a new measurement we developed in october called our overall blended index or obi which aggregates our mystery shops customer surveys and customer complaints in each one of our restaurants and automates an action plan for our restaurant general managers to respond to that data the obi has proven to have a strong correlation with sales performance and we believe this bonus structure is a much more robust way to reward what we value and drive better sales profits and positive customer experiences another example of our people first culture and values being put in practice is the program that launches in a few days our very first employee appreciation month as a company our primary goal each and every day is to determine new and meaningful ways we can make our employees jobs easier and more rewarding employee appreciation month has been designed with this objective in mind we have developed four weeks of planned activity designed to celebrate invest in and thank our greatest asset our employees week one will be about recognizing our employees for all they do and launching our new dedicated service awards a program designed to recognize long term employees in our restaurants and support center week two will be an investment in our employees professional development and personal well being week three will showcase our employees unique talents and have them help us come up with our next great new product week four will focus on volunteerism and giving back to the communities we serve culminating in a huge community service event in east los angeles on april 1st cesar chavez day a day intended to commemorate his legacy by giving back to those in need our second strategy is to accentuate our brand strengths and build upon them thereby differentiating the brand and making the company s values a source of competitive advantage these strengths and values were identified through an extensive brand segmentation completed last fall that work helped us identify our core customers and reaffirm our key brand differentiators and is captured in our brand book which serves as a strategic filter for all our decision making particularly how we communicate everything we do going forward based on this work we have just initiated a comprehensive brand relaunch incorporating our new look this month across our system a new logo advertising tag line menu boards and point of purchase materials will be rolled out in the month of march with the new e commerce site mobile app packaging and uniforms being phased into the system later this year i m especially excited by our new tag line feed the flame which not only highlights that we are the only major restaurant brand that is a true fire burning grill a source of competitive advantage for us but also points the aspirational passions for life our employees and customers share as we relaunch the brand we are also focused on building a tested product pipeline centered on a food type we are now calling l a mex l a mex is the juxtaposition of better for you food that is the hallmark of quintessentially la lifestyle and mexican inspired cuisine we have coined this phrase to indicate not only where our brand originated and how los angeles has shaped and influenced us but also to encapsulate what we ve been doing in our kitchens for years we will reinforce l a mex in our communications moving forward to emphasize that you don t have to feel guilty eating at el pollo loco because so much of our food is grilled made from scratch made with only the freshest ingredients and can be personalized to meet any diet whether you are following a paleo regime or strictly vegetarian one in order to cast the widest net we are also seeking to develop products that equally appeal to both our hispanic and general market consumers our last three promotions are great examples of these type of products in the fourth quarter we launched handmade chicken tamales a classic mexican holiday dish to kick off the holiday season we then started 2019 with fire grilled chicken nachos and are now promoting hand rolled stone ground enchiladas all of these product offerings were designed to have broad base acceptance and have been well received by our guests across multiple demographic lines on the technology front we continue to make loyalty digital and delivery bigger parts of how we connect with our customers our loyalty program now has over 1 2 million members and accounts for approximately 7 5 of our sales our goal in the next two years is to get the 5 million members and make our loyalty program a bigger part of how we go to market this includes transitioning our discounts away from mass market vehicles and focusing them instead in a much more pinpointed fashion in our loyalty program where we can drive higher levels of incrementality based on knowledge of our customers purchase history all of our restaurants currently have access to delivery through doordash in order to expand our delivery presence we ve recently signed agreements with postmates and uber eats to sell on their marketplaces which we expect to test and implement during the year in the second half of this year we will further increase our number of digital access points by allowing our customers to order from us on facebook messenger via chatbot technology and enable voice activated orders on devices like amazon s alexa our third strategy is focused on simplifying operations for our employees and franchisees this strategy was recently added to the original transformation agenda to highlight the importance of operations and the work we know we need to do to reduce back of house complexity in order to free up capacity to deliver a better experience front of house as part of our brand relaunch we have implemented the first phase of menu simplification in our restaurants which we tested last year this involves eliminating approximately 20 of lower mixing lower margin menu items in addition we continue to invest in technology that will streamline our operations this year we are implementing a new pack of health management system which is expected to free up one hour per day for our restaurant general managers we are revisiting and revising some of our standard operating procedures to minimize non value added non customer facing work we believe simplified operations can significantly improve our employee s ability to execute our brand providing better food and service with the added benefit of lower turnover and increased retention the final strategy underpinning our transformation agenda is profitably and responsibly growing our business for the long term we are currently setting the foundation for new market expansion with a target date of 2020 for entry into one or two new markets this includes developing a new store of the future in partnership with an outside firm which will incorporate our new brand visual expression and create a market entry marketing strategy based among other things on our learnings from texas furthermore we believe the work we are doing to streamline our menu and enhance our operations platform will facilitate success in new markets in summary we believe our transformation agenda has put us on the right track as evidenced by our fourth quarter results we believe this momentum will only accelerate as our transformation agenda continues to gain traction and we further elevate the el pollo loco brand i look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls i d now like to hand the call over to larry to review our fourth quarter results in more detail laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer thanks bernard before we get into our fourth quarter results i d first like to touch on our store base during the fourth quarter we opened two new company operated restaurants in southern california franchisees also opened two new restaurants during the quarter one in utah and one in texas looking ahead we expect to open three to four company operated restaurants along with three to five franchise restaurants in 2019 at remodels the company completed eight vision remodels in the fourth quarter and franchisees completed an additional 14 this year we plan to complete 10 to 15 company remodels and expect our franchise partners to complete another 10 to 15 now onto our financial results for the fourth quarter ended december 26 2018 total revenue increased 11 6 to 106 3 million from 95 2 million in the fourth quarter 2017 total revenue in the quarter included a 5 2 million of advertising revenue related to franchise advertising fund contributions required as part of new accounting guidance implementation excluding the advertising fund revenue total revenue would have increased 6 2 driven by an increase in company operated restaurant sales company operated restaurant sales grew 6 in the quarter to 94 6 million from 89 3 million in the fourth quarter of last year this increase in company operated restaurant sales was driven by the contribution from the 12 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as by 3 7 increase in company operated comparable restaurant sales partially offset by seven restaurant closures during the same period the increase in company operated comparable restaurant sales was composed of a 1 increase in transaction and a 2 7 increase in average check franchise revenue increased 9 2 in the fourth quarter to 6 4 million compared to 5 9 million in the prior year period the increase was largely driven by a 5 1 increase in franchise comparable restaurant sales which included transaction growth of 3 3 as well as by the contribution from the 10 new franchise restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by four restaurant closures during the same period expenses food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 50 basis point year over year to 28 4 the improvement was predominantly due to higher menu prices looking ahead we have locked in our chicken need for the year and expect total inflation of 1 to 2 in 2019 as a reminder chicken makes up approximately 40 of our commodity basket labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 60 basis points year over year to 29 3 the increase in labor expenses was primarily due to higher hourly wages in california especially los angeles and higher group insurance partially offset by increased menu prices and a reversal of an accrual as a result of california no longer being a credit reduction state we expect labor inflation of about 6 in 2019 occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 20 basis points year over year to 23 6 the decrease was primarily due to sales leverage and restaurant closures partially offset by higher delivery charges as well as increased costs for trash pickup services and operating supplies general and administrative expenses increased by 1 5 million year over year to 12 4 million included in g a our 3 million of legal expenses associated with the securities litigation as compared to 1 9 million in securities litigation costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the costs associated with the securities litigation and adjusting for the impact of franchise advertising revenues on our 2018 revenues g a expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 increased approximately 350 000 year over year to 9 3 of total revenue a 20 basis point decrease versus the prior year the dollar increase in g a expenses resulted primarily from an increase in our bonus accrual and higher group insurance costs depreciation and amortization expense increased to 4 8 million from 4 5 million in the fourth quarter of last year the increase was primarily due to new restaurant openings and remodels completed during and after the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by the impairment of 12 restaurants during the same time period as a percentage of company revenue depreciation and amortization decreased 20 basis points year over year the decrease was primarily driven by increased sales revenue which leveraged the higher expense noted above during the fourth quarter we incurred a total of 36 3 million of pre tax expense related to two agreements in principle to settle several class action lawsuits the securities loss suit settlement agreement and associated legal expenses and the wage and hour settlement agreement have been adjusted out of our pro forma net income calculations we recorded an income tax benefit of 8 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for an effective tax rate of 26 4 this compares to an income tax benefit of 4 8 million and an effective tax rate of 99 2 in the prior year fourth quarter we reported a gaap net loss of 23 4 million or 0 60 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to a net loss of 38 000 or 0 per diluted share in the prior year period pro forma net income for the quarter was 6 1 million as compared to net income of 4 4 million in the fourth quarter of last year pro forma diluted earnings per share were 0 16 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 0 11 in the prior year period for a reconciliation of pro forma net income and earnings per share to the comparable gaap figures please refer to our earnings release in terms of our liquidity and balance sheet we had 7 million in cash and equivalents as of december 26 2018 and 74 2 million in debt outstanding for the foreseeable future we expect to finance our operations including new restaurant development and maintenance capital through cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility for 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to total 14 million to 19 million during the quarter we repurchased 66 409 shares for approximately 980 000 or an average price of 14 78 as of december 26 2018 we had approximately 19 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization turning to our outlook for 2019 we are providing guidance for the full year as follows excluding the impact of potential share repurchases we expect pro forma diluted net income per share of 0 70 to 0 75 this compares to pro forma diluted net income per share of 0 74 in 2018 our pro forma net income per share guidance for 2019 is based in part on the following annual assumptions we expect systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth to be approximately 2 to 4 as i noted we expect to open three to four new company owned restaurants and expect our franchisees to open three to five new restaurants we expect restaurant contribution margin of between 18 2 and 18 9 we expect g a expenses of between 8 4 and 8 6 of total revenue excluding ceo transition costs and legal fees related to securities class action litigation and reflecting our change in accounting for franchise advertising fees we expect adjusted ebitda of between 62 million and 65 million and we are using a pro forma income tax rate of 26 5 this concludes our prepared remarks we d like to thank you again for joining us on the call today and we are now happy to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jake bartlett with suntrust please proceed with your question jake bartlett suntrust analyst great thanks for taking the question first i had a question about the guidance in same store sales and just how confident you are that you can you keep it this kind of current level this strong level and maybe in that answer kind of give us an indication as to what how you re trending right now bernard acoca president and chief executive officer so i ll answer the first part of the question i ll let for the same store sales portion of the question i ll let larry answer the balance of it what we can say right now is that in the current quarter that we re in we are positive however i don t think what we could have envisioned at the start of this fiscal year is the what is now approaching record rainfall in southern california or in california in general i should say where we have 80 of our restaurants and what has turned out to be record cold weather in the month of february the coldest february in 60 years so normally i it s hard for me to talk about weather as being a factor in our business but when you got that many restaurants located in the state of california given what we have been experiencing thus far within the quarter it is starting to have an impact with that being said we are positive and we are fighting through it and we do believe that that is an anomaly that is seasonally based versus something that we re going to live with for the duration of the year jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah jake so jake bartlett suntrust analyst yeah sorry laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer jake so i think what you hear from bernard saying is we feel good about that range for the full year despite what we re seeing as a soft start to the first quarter really driven by weather the only the other thing i d highlight about the first quarter is in addition to the weather impact causing results to be a little softer than we expected we have a couple of other expense items in the first quarter really around severance and some high gas prices which really hit in december which we saw in january february so as we look at the quarterization of the year i think q1 will be a little softer relative year over year versus the other quarters of the year so i think as you guys look at your models and things i suggest you look at that because again i think given the softer start to the year in terms of sales and some of the expenses we ve seen q1 year over year will be a little softer than the other quarters ever again we still believe the 0 70 to 0 75 range that we re projecting is a good range jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it and i had a couple of questions about margins and just looking at the margin guidance for restaurant level margins it looks like you re expecting about a similar decrease year over year on a basis points basis despite having what looks to be stronger comps and so just trying to understand that on the restaurant level maybe that s an indication that maybe the company might not be as strong as the system or maybe that s baked into your guidance if you could address that and also the question about g a and it looks like it s expected to accelerate pretty meaningfully in 19 as a percentage of sales which is also year over year growth kind of aside from earning the one time charges what is driving that and should we when should we expect you to get leverage on g a going forward laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah so let me talk g a first and i ll talk margins g a the biggest driver of the increase is the bonus adjustment so obviously when we look year over year we go back to a 100 bonus accrual projection will be hitting plan and so when you see year on year overall after securities litigation costs and ceo transition costs i think we re up about 3 million or so to get within that range the bonus adjustment is by far the biggest driver of that we have a little bit higher in terms of equity compensation in that number and then the balance of salaries and other g a expenses are roughly flat so overall we ve done a real good job in terms of managing g a overall but again we ll have that bonus adjustment and a little bit on the equity that will drive the costs up year over year if we have the year that we are targeting at this year then i expect to start leveraging g a next year quite honestly as we continue to build sales and not have this seems like annual bonus adjustments that we have to lap into the future so in terms of margins what you re seeing now is the wage inflation which has if you look at the past several years it has become higher and higher for us one just from the magnitude of the minimum wage increases here in california the other one is the ability to manage the compression has gotten tougher basically managing a difference between your higher paid labor in restaurants like shift layers and cooks relative to cashiers and chefs so we ve had to move more than more in line with minimum wage increases so we haven t had the ability to manage that compression so you got the wage pressures and versus the last three years where we had food costs deflation this year as you have heard in our opening remarks we expect to have a little bit inflation in food costs i don t have that offset so we ve pretty consistently saying you really need to be probably 3 5 comp growth in order to hold margin flat maybe even north of that so that s why you re seeing the high end of the range were basically flat on margins but if you get lower you could see some margin degradation if we don t get that kind of comp lift jake bartlett suntrust analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question is from matthew difrisco with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst thank you so much i have a couple of questions just first on the remodels that you ve been doing can you just talk about how much of those what s the type of lift you re seeing of those and i guess are you gaining some momentum on those or is that becoming a greater factor to some of the momentum we saw toward the end of the year on the comp laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yes overall when we look at the vision remodels over the last couple of years you re able to get varying performance anywhere from roughly flat up to north of high double digits in terms of the growth on average to average them out you re probably running somewhere around 5 to 7 overall lift now we ll highlight that the remodels that we did in late 16 and 17 and earlier 18 you re getting higher lift in those numbers because what we re doing is we re getting toward the tail end of the restaurant that need to be remodeled so these are pre hacienda but they are also the ones we waited the longest on just because they have site issues they have other issues that we just wait until we get into the remodel so we expect less lift on those so going forward what we re doing is really going back through only doing restaurants that are pre hacienda for those who go back probably around 10 years or so that haven t been touched and we re looking for before going to do remodels we re also going to be working on get those costs down and do some modifications to the vision remodel because obviously with our new brand image and things we want and we build some of those elements into those remodels as we re doing them so that s why number of remodels is only 10 to 15 and again the lift we re seeing from the later ones was lower which we expected just because again they have other issues which put them at the very end of the list of restaurants remodeling matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay and then just a bookkeeping question i think you said also the debt balance was around 74 million at the end of the year is that correct laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yes matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst that incorporates the 36 million of the legal settlement or are there some does the balance now in entering into 19 has that creeped up or is that 74 million representative of you fully paying out any liabilities you may have had to encash bernard acoca president and chief executive officer no so the 74 million is where we ended the year and then it was just fairly recently that we entered into these agreements in principle on the legal settlements so if those go through we ll see those borrowing balances increase probably in three four five months or so so as i project the year i expect to be starting obviously at 74 million we should see an increase kind of mid year and then come back down again given our free cash flow and i expect to get back down to probably 75 to 85 million level in debt matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay so you might go back the 36 million added onto that might take you up to 110 million and then you come down basically throughout the year is that the way to think of it bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah something that yeah matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst and that s incorporated in your guidance or eps guidance bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yes matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay and then the last question i guess if you look at the comp guidance i think clearly you guys said that it is positive in 1q however i guess if we look at it ex the weather and assuming you re going to have sunny dry california return are you seeing the same type of is there any reason to think that there is two year momentum that you saw in the fourth quarter didn t end when the calendar switched but you re seeing that on the normalized days still bernard acoca president and chief executive officer but i think the answer on to that is reflected in the full year guidance so i mean i think you re seeing us there project comps for the full year that are closer to that range so i think that is reflected in the quarterly and full year guidance we provided matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you operator our next question is from david tarantino with robert w baird please proceed with your question david tarantino robert w baird analyst hi good afternoon my first question is on the q4 sales trends and you saw a nice inflection in the traffic in the positive territory bernard i guess i m curious to know your thoughts on what the key drivers of that inflection were i know you have a lot of components of the transformation plan but are there one or two things that you see in the business that really drove that inflection bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah i think it s pretty consistent with what we ve been sharing out it s never one thing it s several things that i think in the aggregate have really helped get us more consistent traction with the business i d say one of the drivers certainly is the fact that we re clear on who our primary customer is in terms of who frequents us most often which is a hispanic customer and while we certainly haven t neglected the general market customer what we did in 2018 was we took our media spend which was less than 8 when i joined the organization and we took that up to over slightly 20 to put more of a focus on the hispanic customer whom we see visit our restaurants and 50 of our customers on a daily basis fallen that hispanic category now still 80 of our media is spent in the general market so it s not like we re not equally going after with the same intensity that consumer group but we felt in 2018 until we made that correction that we were not doubling down on who our best and most loyal customer was is i should say so that s one thing i think the second thing is when you truly have clarity around your customer hierarchy we ve been able with the segmentation work that we ve done and the brand work that we ve done we ve been able to develop i believe a more compelling product pipeline which you saw with our chicken tamale promotion in the fourth quarter as well as advertising that i think is more reflective of who our core customer is and really what our brand needs to stand for going forward i think our differentiators we re more readily apparent as the year progressed so i think that was another big driver the business was just simply more compelling advertising and more relevant products that seem to resonate very very strongly with our consumer base the third thing that i would say and this is really just the magical unlock in our business is really operations which is why you saw an adjustment in our transformation agenda occurred late last year it wasn t one of the overarching strategies i talked about in q2 or q3 of last year but it s one that i m talking about with a lot of intensity now and that is simplifying our operations and making it easier to be an employee and franchisee and part of that also is building a sales driving mindset with our operators and having them own a portion of the sales result which was something that they weren t really looked to do in the they weren t looked or responsible for doing in the past to the degree that they are today so we are setting very clear upsell targets with them that they are required to achieve on a daily basis that gets measured real time in the restaurants and so there is a higher degree of accountability there around having operations own a portion of our sales so i would say those are the big ones those are the big drivers and those initiatives are certainly carrying forward into 2019 david tarantino robert w baird analyst great that s really helpful and on the operations side you mentioned simplification of the menu so can you elaborate on what you re seeing so far with that reduction in the number of skus bernard acoca president and chief executive officer so we talked about the fact that we ve been testing this in los angeles and we launched it in texas as well last year we mentioned at that time that in our test we saw no sales degradation if anything we saw a mix shift a little some slight mix shift into what we wanted to achieve was into our chicken on the bone products and we eliminated low margin low mixing items from the menu that we just didn t think earn their keep any longer with the intensive simplifying our operations back of house so that labor could be redeployed front of house we launched that as of saturday last saturday and we naturally too soon to tell what it s doing now that we have it at scale but based on how long we tested it in our markets in 2018 we have a lot of confidence that what we saw in test will carry forward now that we ve launched it throughout the system in 2019 so too soon to give you any further detail on that since it s relatively new but we ll be we ll share out more detail as it becomes available david tarantino robert w baird analyst right and larry couple of quick ones for you so i may have missed it but did you talk about how much pricing is in your same store sales assumption for 2019 laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer no you re the first to ask that david so we are our target for this year is in the i call it the mid 3 range the mid 3s having said that what we re trying to do is do incremental pricing during the year so each time we do that like we just took some pricing this past weekend and so each time we take that we ll monitor to see what the impact is because despite the cost pressures we do want to be careful about getting too far out in front on the pricing front but right now the target is in the mid 3 range and but again we ll assess it as we move along to determine that we keep moving up on that path david tarantino robert w baird analyst got it and then last one on i think on the labor line you mentioned there was an accrual reversal in that line in q4 and i think we heard that from a couple of companies that have a lot of restaurants in california so how big was the impact of that accrual and i guess can you confirm that that s going to continue to be a benefit in 2019 so 19 versus 18 will it be neutral when you add it all up laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i think the impact of reverse in the accrual was somewhere around 600 000 to 700 000 in that range and really the reason we had such big change in the fourth quarter is because we have been incurring ph all year and then it finally came out i guess was october november that california has finally repaid all the money it owed to the federal government and therefore is no longer going to be penalized through employment taxes and so we re able to reverse that accrual then going forward there should be no year over year impact but the quarters will look it will be more evenly spread across the quarter so that accrual benefit in q4 of 2018 will be spread across the first three quarters next year david tarantino robert w baird analyst understood okay thank you very much operator our next question is from sharon zackfia with william blair please proceed sharon zackfia william blair analyst hi good afternoon actually following up on the labor question it looks like the per unit labor spend accelerated a lot in the fourth quarter if you kind of break into it and i guess i was curious whether the group insurance dynamic that you talked about was meaningful in the quarter because it seems like the 60 basis point increase on the 3 7 ph comp is out of keeping with what we saw the rest of the year laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i mean so the group insurance was not insignificant it was probably just 400 000 to 500 000 sharon zackfia william blair analyst okay and what was that larry is that like are you self insured or can you talk about what that is laurance roberts chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we re self insured so we will see wide fluctuations in that number just based on the claims that come through sharon zackfia william blair analyst okay perfect and then a question on the plans for 2019 i think at one point you had mentioned the potential for some new chicken flavor profiles and i don t know if that was still something that you re thinking of in terms of menu innovation for 2019 and maybe give us some color on how impactful that might be or when we might see that in the restaurants bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah so that s something that we still have in test right now in terms of just ideas that we are concept screening and also just playing within our test kitchens to figure out how to best operationalize but what i will say is so that s something that we re still investigating and figuring out the best way to bring to market but what i will say certainly with hector s arrival here as chief marketing officer what we are going to be doing at a far more accelerated rate is putting a lot more ideas at the top of our product development funnel so that we ve got a pantry full of really compelling ideas to the degree to which we haven t had them before so really ramping up product innovation is a huge growth driver for us moving forward in developing compelling innovation that really hits the mark in terms of what our customers want from us is going to be something that you will see going forward and we ve got some exciting things planned for 2019 sharon zackfia william blair analyst are you planning to keep the marketing budget the same as a percentage of sales or is there any thought on moving that bernard acoca president and chief executive officer currently it s staying where it is so there is no short term desire to change at the moment sharon zackfia william blair analyst yeah thank you operator our next question is from andy barish with jefferies please proceed with your question alexandra chan jefferies analyst hey bernard hey larry this is alex on for andy just wanted to follow up on david s question around pricing and clarify are you looking for mid 3s for the full year or really of ramp up to that 3 by year end and i guess thinking about the mix and how you ve seen a slightly positive mix there with upsell work i m trying to understand the traffic dynamics in the guidance here bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah so we expect for the full year to average about mid 3s alexandra chan jefferies analyst okay and would you expect mix to remain positive bernard acoca president and chief executive officer i think we re targeting mix to be flat more or less flat maybe slightly positive a lot of it depends on how successful we are in terms of driving family meals which is obviously one of the big initiatives that we have if we move that mix up i would expect to be positive mix i m kind of thinking flat to slightly positive on mix alexandra chan jefferies analyst okay that makes sense and then historically the franchisees had outperformed the company on comps but that was something that you were working on last quarter as well and here in the fourth quarter both the comp and traffic saw that gap widen a bit with the work you are doing around increased staffing at dinner drive through and peak days of the week do you think you can start to close that gap this year bernard acoca president and chief executive officer no i think those were tests so i want to make sure that there s no shame that that wasn t necessarily spread throughout the entire company system and so we were taking we re still looking at what adding incremental labor very judiciously and selectively in our business can do to drive results what i would say is the real opportunity in our business is driving a level of operational consistency throughout the system unit by unit by unit i ll just be very candid we ve got some outstanding restaurant operations in certain geographies and we ve got opportunities in others and the key goal is to drive a level of consistency throughout that i think will then be reflected in the results so that s really where we are focusing the lion s share of our effort these days alexandra chan jefferies analyst that makes sense and then i guess given larry s comment on the family meals we ve seen here in this quarter the approach of value looks like sort of an add on offering with the four for 4 enchiladas do you think about the strategy this year for value really on kind of add ons and that of holistic value versus maybe what we ve seen previously with that discounting around single entrees bernard acoca president and chief executive officer yeah so i think how our approach was in 2018 and continues to be to reduce our discounting year over year that s kind of the opposite of what you hear a lot of our competitors doing or saying and i think again that is testament to the strength of our brand and our ability to command and have pricing power in the market and i think the reason why we re able to do that is because we have become better storytellers and really explaining what the quality difference is in our products and explaining to the world the hard work that we do each and every day in terms that everything that is handcrafted made from scratch et cetera that our competitors simply don t do with that being said a lot of these value add ons you re seeing us promote and advertise in conjunction with family meals are really designed to address the fact that again in 2018 we made in the second half of the year a concerted effort to go after families and we have a mantra internally within the company that we want to own families one of the ways that we are figuring out how to do that is to really ensure that mom have an opportunity to provide her family with everything that they want whereas her and her husband or dad choose selecting for his family might decide that he wants chicken on the bone but the younger children in the family wants something else now we are providing that kind of a value offering where chicken on the bone could be had by perhaps by the older members of the family and then if there s something for the younger members of the family to enjoy and indulge in if chicken on the bone isn t something that they want and moms and dads can add that on for value price which serves not only a consumer need in this particular case but provides value to the family while helping us increase our overall ticket ph so that s one of the ways we re really trying to become more relevant at dinner while not discounting our business unnecessarily alexandra chan jefferies analyst great thanks that s all from me operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks bernard acoca president and chief executive officer thank you everyone for attending this quarter s call we look forward to regrouping with you next quarter as we continue to make

following the fed s pause of its tightening cycle the launch of stimulus in china this week and a debate over more action by the bank of japan the ecb s latest policy decision completes a dramatic turn from just a year ago when the world seemed in the midst of a synchronised expansion co ordinated stagnation if anything the world economy is now throwing off signs that an era of co ordinated stagnation may have arrived anchored by the long run demographics of ageing populations and low productivity the situation has been aggravated mr draghi and other central bankers have noted by geopolitical risks such as britain s plan to leave the european union and us protectionist moves that have begun exacting global costs the ecb s forecast of overall 1 1 per cent growth this year for the 19 eu nations that make up the eurozone is less than half of the 2 4 per cent predicted a year ago us growth is expected to slow as well as us president donald trump s us1 5 trillion 2 1 trillion tax cut package takes effect and federal spending begins to wane china this week marked down its growth forecast for 2019 to a 30 year low of between 6 per cent and 6 5 per cent qilai shen advertisement the slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed fed governor lael brainard said in remarks on thursday that continued the us central bank s shift to what she called softer policy that persistent weakness she said reflected the complex challenges faced by china which this week marked down its growth forecast for 2019 to a 30 year low of between 6 per cent and 6 5 per cent weakness in germany and struggles in japan all overlaid with the turbulence caused by the continuing trade conflict between the united states and several of its key economic partners and it is likely to make it harder for anyone to break out lower interest rate expectations in europe mean a likely rise in the us dollar weaker inflation in the united states as imports grow cheaper and slower us growth as the cost of american exports rises on world markets the trump administration has intensified its efforts over the past year to challenge and rearrange the global trading system to the united states advantage as part of an america first policy alex edelman that will add to uncertainty about the us outlook and further limit the fed s already diminished need to further raise rates the us central bank lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018 signalled as late as december that more hikes were coming and then backed down in january advertisement the ecb s u turn added to growing investor angst over a weakening global economy leading to sharp declines on global equity markets on thursday benchmark us and european sovereign debt yields tumbled on the blow to inflation expectations global challenges mr draghi echoing fed chairman jerome powell s comments in january said it was largely the global environment and political risk that had forced the ecb to change course the challenges to european growth are mostly of external source including brexit and us trade policy he said the uncertainty is over how long these will continue affecting the world economy the euro economy and confidence more generally that is a question that has become ever more important to policymakers worldwide as the trump administration intensified its efforts over the past year to challenge and rearrange the global trading system to the united states advantage as part of an america first policy in effect ecb officials argue a broad sense of uncertainty regarding us trade policy brexit and other risks has now taken hold and begun to erode the economic outlook more severely the longer it persists advertisement recent studies have begun tallying the narrow costs of such things as the tariffs imposed by trump with a recent analysis saying the measures imposed so far are taking about us4 5 billion a month directly out of the wallets of american consumers and businesses but the more chronic impact may be the corrosion of confidence in a global recovery that was running full tilt in 2017 and much of 2018 throughout that time us central bankers spoke optimistically of tailwinds they felt would let them continue raising rates disappointing business investment that has given way more recently to disappointing business investment weaker than expected consumption and market volatility that took a record us3 8 trillion out of us household wealth late last year in europe much like in the us mr draghi noted signs of continued economic health that included ongoing job gains and broad wage growth but they are not proving robust enough to lift growth beyond a very limited range and the hope now is that the shift by central banks will at least put a floor under the world economy that prevents anything more serious occurring the ecb s action mr draghi noted did nothing to right the balance of risks europe faces which remain tilted to the downside but only guard against something worse our decisions certainly increase resilience of the eurozone economy he said can they address the factors weighing on the euro zone economy they cannot reuters

even more perfect we start with china and the us the link between their currencies is the cornerstone of the global monetary system give me any asset price in the world for the last 25 years and i can relate it to the link between china and america says napier change the nature of that link and you change the way the world works so how exactly does it work now china has effectively been managing its currency the renminbi rmb against the us dollar since 1994 that s worked out well in some ways but now that growth has slowed the rmb may be overvalued stymying all government efforts to stimulate the economy since last april if an eventual trade deal with the us involves keeping the rmb at current levels as rumours suggest the chinese economy will get worse not better yet only a couple of years ago i say everyone was worrying about the rmb being massively undervalued which made china s exports too cheap what changed look at the current account and you can see says russell china used to have a huge surplus it exported more than it imported it still has a fairly significant one with the us but elsewhere in aggregate it is really very small that suggests the rmb is fairly valued or overvalued but also that if china tries to hold it up artificially and also to buy more from the us as president donald trump is demanding it will end up in current account deficit that could leave china in a bit of a pickle why would china agree to this perhaps it won t but some sort of deal is probably being cooked up and it will almost inevitably be one that suggests lower growth for china

debt require high levels of growth if they are to be repaid and a return to the world that all central bankers fear most one tipping back over to deflation this becomes a genuine risk if when the china us monetary link breaks at that point china won t be able simply to devalue to another fixed rate as in 1994 then its economy made up just 5 of global gdp today at 19 it would be completely politically unacceptable it would be banned from every goods market in the world instead china would have to adopt a fully flexible exchange rate the rmb would fall precipitously which would be deflationary for the rest of us then what every deflationary threat for the last few decades has been met with low interest rates and or quantitative easing but what if central bankers can t solve the deflation that results from a huge chinese devaluation and what if the china us spat is more than a spat take us vice president mike pence he is on record as lambasting china on everything from human rights to religious persecution interference in american politics and trade this could end up as a cold war this all implies a lot of losers in a deflationary environment debt becomes very hard to service in a cold war environment emerging markets that rely on both the us and china for investment and markets have unpleasant choices to make in a low growth environment corporate earnings growth suffers and in all these scenarios stockmarkets surely suffer equities outside the us may not be overly expensive but they can still fall there s a big gap between fair value and cheap as for the us equities could fall significantly because they are grotesquely overvalued by any measure high levels of global debt and falling asset prices would make for a very nasty mix given that we have the most highly geared world economy in our entire history usually says napier investors can ignore geopolitics but the resetting of global monetary policy and of the relationship between china and the us this is a big one this is important why the dollar is still top dog given that i say if you could hold just one fiat currency ie not gold for a 20 year period which would it be the dollar says napier trump or no trump the us constitution is strong as is the rule of law the latter is the number one ingredient that attracts capital i can see it crumbling elsewhere i couldn t put a single emerging market up and say to you i believe this emerging market will always back the rule of law the same goes for china as for japan it might back the rule of law but one day the bank of japan s efforts to inflate away its debt will work and you certainly don t want to be holding the yen when it works what s left not the euro the only way for the single currency to survive is for the superstate that the uk has been trying to avoid being part of to exist only a single fiscal and much closer political union can make it possible but a look at the polls in advance of the european parliament elections in may shows that most european union citizens don t want this level of integration and the rule of law in europe is not the same as in other countries spain just had 12 democratically elected politicians from catalonia incarcerated for organising a vote whatever happens in the uk or the us i don t think we would ever do that let s also not forget the one thing that is most unattractive to the global flow of capital capital controls the eu has twice used them to defend its monetary system making a complete mockery of the idea of the inviolate four freedoms the idea that capital controls are legitimate is something that every investor should worry about i wonder how he reckons brexit is going disappointingly for him it isn t about an economic land of milk and honey outside the eu it is about making some really concerted moves to re establish a representative democracy the loss of democratic accountability is not all the eu s fault power has been passed all over the place in the last few decades to multinationals that don t pay tax for example but we vote for people to go to westminster and we must make sure they have the power and authority to act as we would like them to when they get there erode that for too long and you get yourself into a deep deep hole leaving the eu is one major step towards changing things back people like power to be as local as possible those who voted remain might want to think about the fact that on almost every occasion when we ask people if they want to devolve power rather than concentrate it they say yes so why would they want to be part of an organisation that is absolutely committed to the centralisation of power that had to happen as soon as they put in a single currency when we leave says napier we will have the most decentralised democratic system that we have ever had our democracy at least will flourish people think they want certainty out of the future but certainty isn t ever possible better surely then to have a flexible democratic system such as the uk s one that can cope with change than an authoritarian and rigid one such as china s if he was allowed to hold a second currency for his 20 years would it be sterling it would and the uk stockmarket i am very tempted any other cheap markets this brings us back to the rule of law and to corporate governance china and russia are cheap but i want to be able to vote for the board i want to be able to change the board you might say that these things are hypothetical for the small investor but they are the very core of what investing in equities is all about so i have never invested in russia i have never invested in china either for similar reasons i don t believe that the management of chinese corporations with very few exceptions is actually there with the power ability and willingness to get me good returns that is also true of quite a few western managers but at least there are other ones out there who are looking after and stewarding my capital with that aim and those assets are legally protected what to buy when governments get intrusive what about gold napier isn t a gold bug someone for whom the answer to every question is gold but he would hold it now why first we are facing a period of more active government governments want to redistribute wealth usually via inflation in which case you want gold but it is not just inflation itself that makes gold attractive it s the fact that the government is looking at your assets and suggesting where they should be invested which could also be sparked by the deflationary adjustment mentioned above everything in a wrapper of any kind a sipp or an isa say can be pushed around by governments in the name of say macro prudential regulation regulators could demand that we all hold government bonds in our sipps for example gold is less easy to manipulate so more government is thus good for gold so there you have it there is likely to be both deflation and inflation ahead the uk hosts just about the only attractive stockmarket in the world and if you want to protect your wealth from government this is one of those times when you should probably hold gold and not in your isa hear the

as the old saying goes politics is a show business for ugly people fair enough but what does it have to do with let s jump right in and find out there is no trade war economic reports are rarely fun but when we read the latest us trade report we could not help but laugh it turns out that the us goods and services deficit was 59 8 billion in december up 9 5 billion or almost 19 percent from 50 3 billion in november for 2018 the goods and services deficit was 621 0 billion an increase of 68 8 billion or 12 5 percent from 2017 in other words despite trump s america first policies and trade wars including tariffs aimed at shrinking the trade deficit the us trade gap has widened actually it surged to a 10 year high last year as one can see in the chart below as if that was not enough the shortfall with china hit a record peak isn t that funny well it s a laugh through tears we have two options here the first is that trump s administration is economically illiterate as students of economics learn a trade deficit simply reflects that a country chooses to consume more than it produces so it must import the difference from the rest of the world a trade deal will not help here if the chinese buy more us goods the bilateral trade with china will shrink but the us total trade deficit will not decline unless americans reduce total demand by saving more let s reiterate to make it crystal clear the real reason why the us has massive trade deficit is not the foreign import barriers but the fact that americans are spending more than they produce they can do that because foreigners lend them money to finance their net purchases and because the us dollar is an international reserve currency eagerly accepted by and sought after other countries both to finance their international trade needs and to maintain their reserve positions in so please note another funny thing the us households benefit as a whole from trade deficits after all they can consume more than they produce they get real stuff in exchange for their greenbacks despite blaming china its government actually subsidizes american consumers but there is also the second option more probable there is no trade war at all yes you heard it well it s just a smokescreen or a political theater the whole us china dispute is not about trade deficits but about the dominance in supply chains uncle sam does not care about its trade imbalance after all the tax cuts boosted consumer spending while the increased federal deficit exacerbates the deficit of savings the aim of tariffs was rather to induce china to end stealing us technology so gold investors should not focus on trade deficits and the whole buzz around them it s just a show for the public interest rates are not at neutral the us monetary policy is another great spectacle yesterday john the new york fed president said that the federal funds rate is neither accommodative nor contractionary so there is no hurry in hiking interest rates in a speech at the economic club of new york he said my current estimate for r star is 0 5 percent so when you adjust for inflation that s near 2 percent the current federal funds rate of 2 4 percent puts us right at neutral well we do not know how mr williams nyse calculates the neutral rate but he definitely does not use the atlanta fed s estimations of a taylor rule as you can see in the chart below the prescription is much higher indicating that the federal funds rate should be around 4 percent to be neutral we are of course aware that there are many taylor rule prescriptions but virtually all of them suggest that the fed s monetary policy is still accommodative as one can see in the table below despite different inputs used in calculations all methods indicate that the federal funds rate should be higher so does williams not know taylor s rule is he economically illiterate we doubt it what he is saying is just a theater the fed does not want to raise interest rates further because of the 5 7 trillion corporate borrowing binge this is what robert kaplan dallas fed president admitted on tuesday it s something that i m aware of which sort of reinforces for me why i feel we should be taking no action for some period of time the us central bank is simply afraid of bursting the bubbles it previously created maintaining the interest rates too low for too long the cautious stance is worse for gold than aggressive hiking as it postpones the day of reckoning on the other hand more dovish fed and lower interest rates are supportive for the yellow metal as an alternative for the yield bearing assets implications for gold the implication for gold is clear politics is a theater or show business for ugly people as the old saying goes hence do not take what policymakers say at face value look at data our gold analyses are always data based and one more thing people love spectacles so the political factors may often dominate the markets but all shows eventually end when the curtain falls the fundamental factors of the precious metals market should come to the fore don t focus on the buzz but look deeper then your gold investments will shine and remember today the ecb holds its regular monetary policy meeting it is expected to loosen its stance so we could some volatility in the gold market we will cover its monetary policy decisions next week stay tuned

trade deficit in goods to 891 3 billion in spite of administration policies the new york times says this week the times goes further stating a case of textbook economics catching up with some of the administration s unorthodox policies economists have long warned that the recent tax cuts would ultimately exacerbate the trade deficit it has vowed to reduce the trade war with beijing also widened the gap the times said stiff tariffs on chinese goods helped slow china s economy crimping american exports which declined nearly 50 in december from the same month a year before the trade deficit is the difference between how much a country exports how much it buys it generally includes both goods and services though the administration has focused almost exclusively on the deficit in goods and has long boasted that its trade policies would reduce that gap which it views as a crucial measure of whether partners like china and the european union are taking advantage of the united states a diagnosis few economists share in december the overall deficit in goods and services which includes everything from computers and washing machines to tourism and intellectual property rose to 59 8 billion to the highest level since 2008 when the american economy was mired in recession several global economic factors explain the wider deficit the times said china s slowdown has reduced consumer appetite for american goods as has slowing growth in europe the strength of the dollar in global currency markets has made it cheaper for american consumers to buy foreign made goods and more difficult for foreign customers to buy american made ones the times report focuses heavily on the widening gap which it calls a particular irony by his own metric the president is failing to right america s global trading relationships the times concludes many observers were not alarmed by the new data the stronger trade deficit in the short run is telling you we re importing more so it s not a particular alarming development said lawrence summers a harvard economist who directed the national economic council under president barack obama however the administration has aimed tariffs at china europe canada and mexico to help reset those trade balances that the president says reflect unfair practices to gain a competitive edge in global trade that is particularly the case with china which president trump and many business groups say tilts the balance of power by providing state subsidies blocking foreign competition and engaging in other unfair tactics while the chinese have offered to make large purchases of american products including soybeans and liquefied natural gas they have resisted us efforts to force structural reforms with specific dollar targets for the trade balances arguing that such metrics are largely beyond their control for example the value of china s currency which is determined partly by the market and partly by the government weakened against the dollar last year blunting the effect of the administration s tariffs by making chinese goods even cheaper the currency began rising again in the fall as president xi jinping of china met mr trump in argentina late last year to begin hammering out a trade pact said brad setser a senior fellow for international economics at the council on foreign relations china certainly allowed the market to push the value of the yuan down against the dollar over the summer setser said the relative strength of the united states economy is also a large factor in the widening deficit along with the 1 5 trillion tax cut trump signed into law in 2017 which accelerated growth last year and which is helping to swell the federal budget deficit which trump pledged to eliminate as a candidate however the most recent treasury figures showed the deficit widening and it is on track to top 1 trillion this fiscal year now federal reserve officials and some economists continue to warn that federal borrowing is growing too quickly and will ultimately swamp the american economy with the united states paying huge sums of interest on the debt and even diverting funds from social safety net programs like medicare and social security the fed chairman jerome h powell warned lawmakers at a house hearing last week that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path powell was asked during the hearing if he would also say that the trade deficit was unsustainable i don t think i would say that he replied the debate over trade policy metrics has been going on for some time and is increasingly ensnarling many participants who have favored outcomes including many of the same groups who now are criticizing the administration for its difficulty in justifying its current policies the fight seems

us president donald trump has made reducing the us trade deficit with china a prime target of his administration but new figures out wednesday show that it hit a record for a second straight year under his watch many factors are at work in the ballooning deficit not all of them bad strong us economic growth the american economy expanded by an estimated 2 9 per cent in 2018 more growth means more demand for goods although trump rails against imports he and congressional republicans helped boost the economy by passing an extensive tax cut in december 2017 which further pumped up spending as long as the economy stays strong it will be hard for trump to reduce the overall trade deficit even if he has some success in reducing the bilateral trade gap with china said christine mcdaniel a senior research fellow at the mercatus centre a free market think tank low savings rate american consumers sock away far less than their counterparts in many other countries including china if american consumers saved more and spent less the trade deficit would likely fall mcdaniel said one manifestation of the low us savings rate is the huge us budget deficit which the congressional budget office forecasts will grow to us 900 billion in 2019 compared with us 620 billion in the last year of the obama administration strong dollar the us dollar is the world s reserve currency which means most international transactions are settled in dollars that increases demand pushing up the dollar s value compared to other currencies a strong dollar makes us goods relatively more expensive to buyers in other countries while making imports into the united states relatively cheaper mcdaniel said supporters of trump s trade policies argue that the dollar is overvalued and is a leading cause for america s persistent trade deficits with china and other countries the coalition for a prosperous america a group that vocally backs trump s tariff strategy argued in a recent paper that a devaluation of the dollar could narrow the trade deficit by increasing exports faster than imports investors flock to the us when us imports more than it exports the trade balance shows up as a negative number in the formula to calculate gross domestic product creating the impression it subtracts from economic growth but mcdaniel said that s not really an accurate way to think about the figure because imports are only subtracted from exports to avoid counting domestic consumption twice the trade deficit is part of a larger set of economic data known as the current account this measures balance of trade and investment incomes the flip side of the current account is another set of data known as the capital account which measures changes in longer term investment positions the capital account and the current account always zero each other out trump could reduce the capital account surplus and indirectly reduce the trade deficit by taxing new inflows of foreign investment mcdaniel said but that would be contrary to his goal of encouraging foreign companies to build more facilities in the united states wrong tool for job trump is trying to use us tools to attack a problem created by global factors a point that economists have repeatedly made over the past two years to little avail i don t know whether to laugh or cry at this point mcdaniel said the agreement trump is trying to reach with china right now is expected to include major new purchases of us agricultural commodities energy products and manufactured goods that could make a short term dent in the two way trade deficit but over the long term the deficit will continue to increase as long as united states continues its low savings rate mcdaniel said effects of a trade war some critics of trump s trade policies argue that using tariff threats to force negotiations as the president has done is also further inflating the trade deficit ed gerwin a senior fellow at the progressive policy institute said imports are surging as us companies try to get ahead of any possible tariff increases the deficit has grown not only because the economy is booming but because the president s tariffs have caused all kinds of wacky changes in trade patterns he said source south china morning post

performance improved bolstered by strong domestic activity and import growth however expenditure slippages in various areas and fiscal pressures from state owned enterprises contributed to a widening of the fiscal deficit to 6 6 percent of gdp from 5 3 percent of gdp a year earlier as a result recourse to domestic borrowing significantly exceeded the budgeted amount more encouragingly important

by reuters by howard schneider and balazs koranyi washington frankfurt reuters patient monetary policy muted inflation uncertainty over global trade and government policies that may be undermining the economy evidence of a world slipping back to an inflation less slow growth norm the outlook that prompted the u s federal reserve to halt its interest rate hikes in january has now forced a broader pivot among major trading nations as governments from beijing to ottawa take stock of a decaying outlook in announcing a sharp downgrade of euro zone growth and a surprise move to loosen monetary policy european central bank president mario draghi on thursday coined what may be the motto of the times continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty those five words sum up why the ecb pushed back consideration of any rate increase to next year and expanded lending to banks to stave off a credit crunch the action was a response to weak inflation and growth data following on the heels of the fed s pause of its tightening cycle the launch of stimulus in china this week and a debate over more action by the bank of japan the ecb s latest policy decision completes a dramatic turn from just a year ago when the world seemed in the midst of a synchronized expansion if anything the world economy is now throwing off signs that an era of coordinated stagnation may have arrived anchored by the long run demographics of aging populations and low productivity the situation has been aggravated draghi and other central bankers have noted by geopolitical risks like britain s plan to leave the european union and u s protectionist moves that have begun exacting global costs the ecb s forecast of overall 1 1 percent growth this year for the 19 eu nations that make up the euro zone is less than half of the 2 4 percent predicted a year ago u s growth is expected to slow as well as the impact of president donald trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut package as well as federal spending begin to wane the slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed fed governor lael brainard said in remarks on thursday that continued the u s central bank s shift to what she called softer policy that persistent weakness she said reflects the complex challenges faced by china which this week marked down its growth forecast for 2019 to a 30 year low of between 6 percent and 6 5 percent weakness in germany and struggles in japan all overlaid with the turbulence caused by the ongoing trade conflict between the united states and several of its key economic partners and it is likely to make it harder for anyone to break out lower interest rate expectations in europe mean a likely rise in the u s dollar weaker inflation in the united states as imports grow cheaper and slower u s growth as the cost of american exports rise on world markets that will add to uncertainty about the u s outlook and further limit the fed s already diminished need to further raise rates the u s central bank lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018 signalled as late as december that more hikes were coming and then backed down in january broad uncertainty the ecb s u turn added to growing investor angst over a weakening global economy leading to sharp declines on global equity markets on thursday benchmark u s and european sovereign debt yields tumbled on the blow to inflation expectations advertisement draghi echoing fed chairman jerome powell s comments in january said it was largely the global environment and political risk that had forced the ecb to change course the challenges to european growth are mostly of external source including brexit and u s trade policy he said the uncertainty is over how long these will continue affecting the world economy the euro economy and confidence more generally that is a question that has become ever more important to policymakers worldwide as the trump administration intensified its efforts over the past year to challenge and rearrange the global trading system to the united states advantage as part of an america first policy in effect ecb officials argue a broad sense of uncertainty regarding u s trade policy brexit and other risks has now taken hold and begun to erode the economic outlook more severely the longer it persists recent studies have begun tallying the narrow costs of things like the tariffs imposed by trump with a recent analysis saying the measures imposed so far are taking about 4 5 billion per month directly out of the wallets of american consumers and businesses advertisement but the more chronic impact may be the corrosion of confidence in a global recovery that was running full tilt in 2017 and much of 2018 throughout that time u s central bankers spoke optimistically of tailwinds they felt would let them continue raising rates that has given way more recently to disappointing business investment weaker than expected consumption and market volatility that took a record 3 8 trillion out of u s household wealth late last year in europe much like in the united states draghi noted signs of continued economic health that included ongoing job gains and broad wage growth but they are not proving robust enough to lift growth beyond a very limited range and the hope now is that the shift by central banks will at least put a floor under the world economy that prevents anything more serious from occurring the ecb s action draghi noted did nothing to right the balance of risks europe is facing which remain tilted to the downside but only guard against something worse advertisement our decisions certainly increase resilience of the euro zone economy he said can they address the factors weighing on the euro zone economy they cannot reporting by

for this week s big interview my team turned the tables on me jim pearce chief investment strategist of our flagship publication personal finance asked if he could interview yours truly below are the highlights of our question and answer session touching upon a wide range of timely topics of vital interest to investors jim pearce what major geopolitical events circumstances do you expect to affect your areas of investment expertise the most in 2019 and how why john persinos i ve covered aerospace defense for decades in my youth as the editor of a publication devoted to rotorcraft i even flew helicopter gunships that s me emerging from the cockpit of a bell textron cobra ah 1 attack helicopter i continue to stay in close contact with the top management of large cap aerospace firms these executives give me the heads up on major defense trends based on their latest insights i conclude that the aerospace defense sector is poised for multi year gains aerospace and technology are intertwined they re also particularly susceptible to geopolitical risk the most likely source of overseas risk is the korean peninsula where the rogue totalitarian state of north korea continues to rattle its saber the complete failure of the summit in february between president trump and north korean strongman kim jong un didn t help matters the white house s hawkish and unpredictable foreign policy will continue to prove a wild card in 2019 the middle east is another potential flashpoint with possible disruptions of oil markets saudi arabia s economic restructuring could sow civil unrest the house of saud also is coming under increasing pressure for its human rights abuses which further fuels international tensions china is growing more assertive as trump s america first policy causes the u s to retreat from various international agreements allowing china to rush into the leadership vacuum this makes china s neighbors and age old antagonists in asia nervous meanwhile the u s china trade war probably won t end anytime soon tariffs stoke inflation and add considerable uncertainty to the global economy mistrust among trading partners is worsening as traditional alliances fracture tit for tat tariffs already are disrupting global supply chains and upending long range corporate planning the west is divided a situation that pleases at least one man russian president vladimir putin who seems more emboldened with each passing day investors who keep seeing signs of trade progress are deluding themselves the white house is committed to protectionism and china refuses to blink history shows that trade tensions often escalate into outright military confrontation it s folly to dismiss harsh trade provocations between the u s and china as empty rhetoric if you study the preludes to world wars i and ii you ll see that mere words can have terrible consequences the post world war ii multilateral order which has ensured more than 70 years of international prosperity is coming apart at the seams america is even at odds right now with canada yes mild mannered democratic canada once implemented tariffs are difficult to reverse the verdict of history is clear the protectionism of the 1930s worsened the great depression an economic dark valley that eventually resulted in global conflagration the upshot 2019 will likely witness greater demand for aerospace defense especially for high margin jet fighters that are popular export products u s based aerospace giants did exceptionally well in 2017 and 2018 this prosperity should continue in a fraught 2019 paradoxically heightened tensions in asia could weigh on the technology companies that are based in fast rising emerging markets such as taiwan and south korea caught in the crosshairs would be japan which is coming off the economic ropes the outbreak of war in asia would tank global markets which sectors geographies do you believe will perform the best in 2019 and why in addition to aerospace defense the sectors of utilities energy consumer staples and health services are positioned to outperform in 2019 these sectors typically do well during the late stage of an economic recovery that s when gross domestic product slows credit availability tightens industrial productivity sputters and revenues and earnings decline in particular health care will continue to benefit from unstoppable trends that are resilient to economic and financial cycles people need medical care especially as they get older and sicker whether the economy is growing or not around the world populations are aging and middle classes are rising that spells long term demand for doctors hospitals and drugs the biotechnology sector is in resurgence so far in 2019 and i expect this upward trajectory to continue as new and novel treatments hit the market year to date biotech stocks have outperformed the s p 500 investors should keep an eye on the small cap biotech disruptors which offer the potential for enormous gains what would it take for the current bull market to finally come to an end in 2019 and what might cause that to happen the year 2018 was dreadful for investors especially the fourth quarter triggers abound for further sell offs this year valuations still remain high around the world there are bubbles in stocks bonds and housing the bull market is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary that s ancient by historical standards years of low interest rates that spawned these asset bubbles are coming to an end the fed is on course for shrinking the vast amount of government securities it holds the european central bank and the bank of japan are following the fed s lead two other tightening cycles one in 1999 to 2000 and another from 2004 to 2007 were followed by stock market crashes the fed tries to strike a balance with monetary policy but it rarely gets it just right there s a danger that rising rates will choke off the economic expansion at the same time the trump administration is gutting the regulations put in place to prevent another 2008 if trouble comes the federal government won t have many tools at its disposal the exploding federal deficit caused by the tax cut bill signed in 2017 will push up interest rates and make it difficult for policymakers to respond to a recession also worrying are high debt levels in overseas countries notably china and beleaguered european union countries such as italy a major overseas bank failure could start a domino effect and global meltdown brazil and venezuela teeter on the brink of political collapse with threatens the global economy potential supply disruptions in strife torn oil producer venezuela loom large the road from here looks dangerous global growth is slowing inflation is stirring bond yields are rising public and private debt around the world is mushrooming populist insurrections threaten social stability north korea remains untamed russia has gone rogue political scandals engulf the white house shall i go on i m not an alarmist by nature and i take a dim view of perma bears and fear mongers however it s important for investors to face harsh realities when they actually arise

evidence of a world slipping back to an inflation less slow growth norm the outlook that prompted the u s federal reserve to halt its interest rate hikes in january has now forced a broader pivot

european central bank president mario draghi on thursday coined what may be the motto of the times continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty those five words sum up why the ecb pushed back consideration of any rate increase to next year and expanded lending to banks to stave off a credit crunch the action was a response to weak inflation and growth data following on the heels of the fed

ago when the world seemed in the midst of a synchronized expansion if anything the world economy is now throwing off signs that an era of coordinated stagnation may have arrived anchored by the long run demographics of aging populations and low productivity the situation has been aggravated draghi and other central bankers have noted by geopolitical risks like britain s plan to leave the european union and u s protectionist moves that have begun exacting global costs the ecb s forecast of overall 1 1 percent growth this year for the 19 eu nations that make up the euro zone is less than half of the 2 4 percent predicted a year ago u s growth is expected to slow as well as the impact of president donald trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut package as well as federal spending begin to wane the slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed fed governor lael brainard said in remarks on thursday that continued the u s central bank s shift to what she called softer policy that persistent weakness she said reflects the complex challenges faced by china which this week marked down its growth forecast for 2019 to a 30 year low of between 6 percent and 6 5 percent weakness in germany and struggles in japan all overlaid with the turbulence caused by the ongoing trade conflict between the united states and several of its key economic partners and it is likely to make it harder for anyone to break out lower interest rate expectations in europe mean a likely rise in the u s dollar weaker inflation in the united states as imports grow cheaper and slower u s growth as the cost of american exports rise on world markets that will add to uncertainty about the u s outlook and further limit the fed s already diminished need to further raise rates the u s central bank lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018 signaled as late as december that more hikes were coming and then backed down in january broad uncertainty the ecb s u turn added to growing investor angst over a weakening global economy leading to sharp declines on global equity markets on thursday benchmark u s and european sovereign debt yields tumbled on the blow to inflation expectations draghi echoing fed chairman jerome powell s comments in january said it was largely the global environment and political risk that had forced the ecb to change course the challenges to european growth are mostly of external source including brexit and u s trade policy he said the uncertainty is over how long these will continue affecting the world economy the euro economy and confidence more generally that is a question that has become ever more important to policymakers worldwide as the trump administration intensified its efforts over the past year to challenge and rearrange the global trading system to the united states advantage as part of an america first policy in effect ecb officials argue a broad sense of uncertainty regarding u s trade policy brexit and other risks has now taken hold and begun to erode the economic outlook more severely the longer it persists recent studies have begun tallying the narrow costs of things like the tariffs imposed by trump with a recent analysis saying the measures imposed so far are taking about 4 5 billion per month directly out of the wallets of american consumers and businesses but the more chronic impact may be the corrosion of confidence in a global recovery that was running full tilt in 2017 and much of 2018 throughout that time u s central bankers spoke optimistically of tailwinds they felt would let them continue raising rates that has given way more recently to disappointing business investment weaker than expected consumption and market volatility that took a record 3 8 trillion out of u s household wealth late last year in europe much like in the united states draghi noted signs of continued economic health that included ongoing job gains and broad wage growth but they are not proving robust enough to lift growth beyond a very limited range and the hope now is that the shift by central banks will at least put a floor under the world economy that prevents anything more serious from occurring the ecb s action draghi noted did nothing to right the balance of risks europe is facing which remain tilted to the downside but only guard against something worse our decisions certainly increase resilience of the euro zone economy he said can they address the factors weighing on the euro zone economy they cannot reporting by howard schneider additional reporting by balazs koranyi and

in the 18 months since hurricane maria swept across puerto rico the island has struggled to recover from the destruction left in its wake the troubled power grid remains fragile tarps still cover many homes and tragic stories of storm related deaths have re ignited arguments over exactly what happened in the weeks following the category 4 storm yet even as donald trump and puerto rican governor ricardo rosselló have traded blame for the inadequate response there s another less noticed drama playing out over the territory one with far reaching consequences not just for how puerto rico can get back on its feet but for the ability of cities and states across the united states to provide services for their residents as well advertisement long before maria ripped it apart physically a financial storm devastated the caribbean island faced with a collapsing economy 72 billion in debt and overwhelming pension liabilities it was forced into bankruptcy in mid 2017 ever since and especially after maria the island and its many creditors have been locked in nasty sprawling fights over how much money it actually has and who it belongs to with tens of billions of dollars at stake the bare knuckles brawl has also roiled the massive municipal bond market back on the mainland the fight over puerto rico s debt raises questions about how safe it is to buy the bonds of other financially troubled cities and states such as chicago connecticut new jersey and illinois advertisement or as adam stern co head of research at bond market specialists breckinridge capital advisors puts it what happens in puerto rico no longer stays in puerto rico the reason municipal bonds finance two thirds of all infrastructure across the us cities states and public agencies all turn to the muni market for funds to build schools bridges sewer systems and much else besides the fallout from puerto rico s bankruptcy threatens to make it harder and costlier to raise the money needed for such projects put simply that means taxes could go up if you give the government the ability to just cancel debt when it s convenient how will creditors find the confidence to lend to other municipalities in the future that might need debt to finance a new school building or a new road asks dora lee director of research at belle haven investments which owns puerto rican bonds it would definitely lead to higher interest rates and higher rates on municipal bonds means higher taxes for taxpayers who live in those municipalities advertisement coming on the heels of smaller though no less painful municipal bankruptcies in detroit stockton california and jefferson county alabama over the past decade the impact is multiplied last year mutual fund giant franklin templeton announced it would no longer invest in bonds issued by illinois chicago or the city s public schools the firm had been among puerto rico s largest bondholders before the territory defaulted its municipal bond group s directors warned that the municipal bond market has undergone a dramatic shift as borrowers have become far more willing to stiff their bondholders when they run into trouble than in the past what s more they believe more cities and states will have difficulty meeting their commitments in the years ahead and when the choice comes down to funding public pensions keeping up government services or paying back bondholders bondholders are increasingly likely to lose out this shift has left many investors wary of the promises being made by municipalities under financial distress or that could potentially become so there are thousands of issuers in the market says stern of breckinridge capital if an issuer starts to exhibit behavior you don t like there are usually plenty of other choices advertisement special cases nowhere have the risks raised by puerto rico s financial troubles played out more than in a pair of disputes between some of the island s biggest bondholders over what are known as special revenue bonds to understand why this matters it helps to take a step back and look at the roots of puerto rico s troubles they began in earnest in 1996 when the us congress phased out a tax break for manufacturers that set up on the island as puerto rico s economy declined tax revenues did too successive governments turned to wall street to stay afloat and the bankers were only too happy to oblige financiers invented an ever more complicated array of special revenue bonds unlike general obligation bonds which are paid out of general tax revenues special revenue bonds are backed by specific pots of money puerto rico issued bonds for everything along with lots and lots of general obligation bonds it created almost 20 types of special revenue bonds it issued bonds backed by sales taxes bonds backed by highway tolls and bonds backed by water bills gas taxes and the rents on public buildings advertisement puerto rico even has bonds backed by rum sales this was not unique to the island stern estimates that special revenue bonds now make up around a third of the 3 8 trillion municipal bond market in the us investors like them because they are supposed to function like a lockbox since the revenue stream is guaranteed bondholders are protected from losses even if the borrower goes bankrupt as a result special revenue bonds are considered safer than general obligation bonds that means they ve typically earned higher credit ratings and paid out lower interest rates that s why states and cities like them too they cost taxpayers less advertisement for governments with already weak financials the difference can be substantial chicago s general obligation bonds yielded around 4 2 on average over the past month for example versus the 3 3 yield on bonds backed by o hare airport revenues but puerto rico s bankruptcy has raised questions about whether special revenue bonds are really as safe as investors thought what we ve found is that the promises that were made when times were good aren t necessarily there when times are bad says jane ridley a senior director at credit ratings agency standard poor s this is something we never would have expected safer than germany puerto rico sold roughly 13 billion in general obligation bonds and another 18 billion in bonds backed by the island s sales tax revenues known by their spanish acronym cofina advertisement the revenue pledge and the high credit ratings it garnered was key to convincing investors to buy cofinas even as the island s economic troubles were becoming clear in 2007 the first cofina bonds received solid investment grade ratings just a year after a budget crisis shut the island s government down for two weeks in promoting the bonds says matt fabian a partner at municipal market analytics they pitched puerto rico as being safer than germany fast forward to 2016 and after puerto rico defaulted on its general obligation bonds those bondholders sued to grab a share of the sales tax revenues they claimed the money was rightfully theirs since the puerto rican constitution says that general obligation bonds must be paid first with all available resources places like chicago and new york state have issued sales tax bonds similar to puerto rico s investors have feared that any outcome which undermines the cofina s iron clad hold on the sales taxes could also upend long held assumptions about many other bond offerings built around gas taxes highway tolls and other specific revenue streams this has been an existential issue for the muni market says peter block head of municipal credit strategy at ramirez co who owns this revenue advertisement this has been an existential issue for the muni market after hard fought negotiations the judge overseeing the bankruptcy us district court judge laura taylor swain recently approved a settlement in which both sides can claim victory of sorts while the cofina bondholders will recoup much of their investment their hold on the funds proved far less than iron clad in an exchange of the old debt for new bonds issued as part of the deal senior cofina bondholders were supposed to receive 93 cents on the dollar while junior cofina holders were offered just 56 cents for every dollar they invested and when the new bonds were issued in mid february the swap was so poorly structured that many us based retail investors found they got far less than they were promised the cofina bondholders also agreed to give back 456 million in annual sales tax revenues to the government nearly half of the yearly revenues that had initially been pledged which can use the funds to pay the general obligation bondholders among others that was key to convincing the hedge funds gunning for the cofinas to drop their lawsuit and what has left investors questioning how safe other such structures will prove to be people are now looking at these structures with a completely different set of optics says jeffrey lipton the head of municipal research and strategy at investment bank oppenheimer co unless you are being appropriately compensated for the additional risk there s no reason to buy these bonds from weak issuers advertisement and the dispute isn t the only battle being fought over puerto rico s special revenue bonds that poses heightened risks for the broader muni bond market rocky road a january 2018 ruling by judge swain addressing a different set of revenue bonds which are backed by tolls collected by puerto rico s highways and transportation authority hta has also raised big questions for investors swain held that the hta which has 4 3 billion in outstanding debt doesn t have to make payments to its bondholders during the island s bankruptcy her decision was a direct contradiction of earlier state court rulings that special revenue bonds have to keep paying out while proceedings are underway that obligation has been another reason why investors consider special revenue bonds safer than general obligation bonds when municipalities default or go into bankruptcy they typically stop making general obligation bond payments the promise that revenue bonds will continue paying out gives them extra security in theory advertisement swain s ruling undermined that principle in practice raising further questions about the safety of special revenue bonds she s modifying things that a lot of people have held as sacrosanct says cate long who runs a research service for bondholders swain s decision is under appeal long like many analysts believe she got it wrong and the dispute will likely be litigated all the way to the supreme court here too the impact will be felt well beyond puerto rico if the ruling is upheld because the precedent could be applied to future municipal bankruptcies anywhere in the us the danger is that if you put a cloud on special revenues you re only going to increase the borrowing costs for all the state and local governments says municipal finance expert james spiotto a managing director of chapman strategic advisors advertisement how big could the impact be the national federation of municipal analysts nfma warns that even cities and states with strong finances could pay an extra 5 to 10 basis points 0 05 to 0 1 on their bonds but the real hit will be to those in financial distress they could see interest rates on special revenue bonds rise a full 30 to 50 basis points that may not sound like much but with local governments expected to issue 75 billion in revenue bonds per year for infrastructure over the next decade every basis point is meaningful in absolute terms altogether the nfma estimates that borrowers could pay between 2 billion and 6 billion in additional interest if swain s ruling stands those costs will be borne directly by the municipalities and states that issue the bonds which ultimately means residents will pick up the tab in higher taxes tolls or user fees spiotto warns that the rising costs could lead some infrastructure projects to be delayed or cancelled and in some cases financially stressed municipalities could lose access to the bond market altogether with the cofina settlement done and the hta appeal playing out focus over the coming months is expected to turn to sorting out puerto rico s next big slug of outstanding debt the general obligation bonds in a move that s sent a further chill through the market in mid january the federally appointed board managing the bankruptcy for puerto rico asked the court to invalidate more than 6 billion of the general obligation bonds issued in 2012 and 2014 the board argued that the bonds were issued in violation of puerto rico s constitutional debt limits advertisement the move is widely seen as an attempt to increase leverage over the bondholders as the negotiations over that debt get serious with little chance of succeeding were judge swain to allow it that decision too would be appealed given the sums involved likely all the way to the supreme court whatever the board s motivation one thing is certain it has made investors even more cautious about the potential machinations hard up municipalities are willing to engage in when the money runs low trying to negate the legality of the issuance opens up a whole other can of worms that that isn t good for anybody especially for the municipal marketplace as a whole says jonathan mondillo the head of municipal investments at aberdeen standard investments which owns general obligation and other puerto rican bonds if that doesn t make you skeptical as a bond investor i don t know what does and if all that wasn t complicated enough a recent appeals court decision has thrown another new wrench into the mix back in 2017 aurelius a hedge fund known for its aggressive tactics filed suit arguing that puerto rico s bankruptcy process itself violates the constitution and should be thrown out because the members of the federal oversight board were appointed by barack obama without senate confirmation judge swain ruled against aurelius last year but in mid february the appeals court reversed her and sided with aurelius while the court left in place the cofina deal and the many decisions the board has taken so far it said trump must properly appoint the current board or reconstitute it within 90 days that will be tough in the current political climate and in any case the board has asked the supreme court to review the decision and put a hold on the 90 day deadline the result will likely be further delays in sorting out a deal for the general obligation bonds as well as for the many smaller slugs of debt that remain to be resolved advertisement ratings scale even as the impact of puerto rico s debt restructuring remains unclear changes are coming to the muni market thanks to their perceived security credit ratings agencies had treated special revenue bonds essentially as independent entities often giving them significantly higher ratings than the general obligation bonds of the city or state that issued them this practice is coming to an end as the agencies move to link special revenue bond ratings much more closely to the underlying risk of the issuer in late 2017 for example chicago earned a high investment grade rating of aa from fitch ratings on a 2 5 billion offering of sales tax bonds that was fully seven notches higher than the city s general obligation bonds which were rated just above junk in the wake of swain s hta ruling however fitch warned investors that it would modify its rating criteria in may it downgraded chicago s sales tax bonds a hefty five notches bringing them more in line with the city s overall rating last fall s p too revised the criteria it uses to rate some 1 300 special revenue bonds now revenue bonds will at most be rated one or two notches above the related general obligation debt with rare exceptions this shift reflects the growing fear that cities or states that run into trouble will follow puerto rico s lead and try to redirect pledged revenues no matter the earlier guarantees advertisement at some point you re going to jettison your debtholders it goes to the fundamentals if you re a municipality you have to keep paying your police and fire and provide services says alfred medioli senior credit officer for moody s which has also revised its municipal criteria to account for the greater risks if you can t pay those operations at some point you re going to jettison your debtholders ratings agencies have taken a lot of criticism but their pronouncements still matter many investment firms have limits on how much lower ranked debt they can hold lower ratings could force portfolio managers to sell certain bonds or demand higher rates from issuers to account for the increased risks that dynamic is already playing out for troubled issuers like chicago which was forced to pay higher rates for its issue of sales tax bonds than it likely would have paid before puerto rico s troubles emerged and despite the risks plenty of investors ponied up for them given the low interest rate environment of recent years though investors are wary there s also a lot of money chasing higher yields and ignoring the lessons learned says fabian of municipal market analytics advertisement will that change when the economy slows stern of breckinridge capital argues that the us economy s long expansion has reduced the pressure on fiscally troubled governments right now there s probably a bit of a laissez faire attitude towards some of the weaker credits he says but when the tide goes out market sentiment could turn on them much more quickly than people currently believe when that happens many municipalities will find themselves facing far tougher conditions with far higher costs when they seek to raise money to pay for projects that will partly be due to broader economic trends and partly due to the fallout from the unique plight of puerto rico s devastated economy

chairman samuel landy president and chief executive officer anna chew vice president and chief financial officer and brett taft vice president it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to umh s president and chief executive officer samuel landy samuel a landy president and chief executive officer thank you very much nelli i am pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 2018 was another great year for umh during which we continued to successfully execute our long term business plan 2018 was highlighted by our portfolio growth earnings growth improvement in our sales operation and the strength of our operating platform we grew our portfolio of manufactured housing communities by 7 to 118 communities containing 21 500 developed home sites our total revenue increased by 15 to 130 million this growth was primarily driven by a 12 increase in rental and related income and a 45 increase in sales revenue this was our eighth consecutive year of delivering double digit growth of rental and related income and our third consecutive year of delivering double digit sales growth community net operating income increased by 13 this strong operating performance resulted in normalized ffo of 27 5 million representing a 27 increase over 2017 on a per share basis normalized ffo increased 12 to 0 74 per share during the year we acquired six communities containing 1 600 developed home sites for a total purchase price of 59 1 million these communities were acquired with a weighted average occupancy rate of approximately 79 three of the communities are in indiana and three are in ohio these communities have a significant upside potential through filling vacant sites raising rents to market sub metering utilities and developing additional sites the properties are generally in good condition and will require a shorter turnaround period than some of our previous acquisitions our acquisition pipeline currently consists of two communities containing 1 200 sites for a total purchase price of approximately 45 million the acquisition market remains very competitive which has caused cap rates to remain at or near all time lows we are optimistic about our ability to source future deals and continue to grow the company through acquisitions moving on to operations we continued to experience very strong demand for affordable housing in all of our markets this resulted in rental and related income of 114 million for 2018 which is an increase of 12 over 2017 community net operating income increased to 61 million representing an increase of 13 over 2017 our community operating expense ratio improved to 46 5 in 2018 from 47 in 2017 our overall occupancy rates at year end 2018 was 82 as compared to 81 4 at year end 2017 these exceptional results can be attributed to our recent acquisitions rent increases our rental home program and the overall strength of our business plan our same property metrics exhibit continued improvement in operating results same property income in 2018 was 103 million as compared to 97 million in 2017 representing an increase of 6 5 same property net operating income in 2018 was 58 million as compared to 53 million in 2017 representing an increase of 6 6 we are very pleased with the solid performance of our same property portfolio our same property occupancy rate at year end 2018 was 83 as compared to 82 6 at year end 2017 our same property rent per site increased to 449 at year end 2018 from 434 at year end 2017 representing an increase of 3 5 our same property rental home portfolio now consists of 5 870 homes with a healthy occupancy rate of 92 6 our home rental rates increased by 2 8 to 743 at year end 2018 during the year we added 905 rental homes to our rental home portfolio which now consists of 6 500 units we maintain a healthy occupancy rate of 92 3 our average home rental rate is 742 per month which includes site rent the rental home program is one of the key components of our business plan driving significant revenue growth year after year we acquire communities with low occupancy levels and utilize the rental home program to quickly increase our occupancy levels this results in more efficient community operations and higher property values we are then able to finance or refinance the communities effectively recapturing our investments in the communities for many residents our rental home is their first experience living in a manufactured home community the rental homes give many people the opportunity to experience the benefit of manufactured housing without making a long term commitment we are encouraged by the success of our sales operation this is our third consecutive year of double digit sales growth sales increased 45 in 2018 which led to a sales profit of approximately 75 000 this is the first time that we have posted a sales profit since 2006 gross sales for 2018 were 15 8 million with a gross profit of 26 as compared to 10 8 million with a gross profit of 22 in 2017 during the year we sold 295 homes with an average price of 53 400 as compared to 222 homes with an average price of 48 900 in 2017 our sales improvement can be attributed to regulatory relief improving economic conditions and the improvement in the quality of our communities we believe that these factors will continue to drive further sales growth umh s total portfolio encompasses 6 400 acres of land of which approximately 1 700 is raw vacant land that can be developed assuming that we can net four homes per acre we have the potential to develop an additional 6 800 sites we continue to make progress on the expansion of our existing manufactured home communities during 2018 we developed a total of 26 sites several projects that we had anticipated beginning construction in 2018 have slipped to 2019 for various reasons we are completing site work at several expansions and look forward to completing them this spring we believe that we can deliver 500 or more new sites in 2019 we also own 3 300 acres in the energy rich marcellus and utica shale regions owning land with these vast energy resources will prove to be a very lucrative investment the communities that we have acquired in these markets will benefit from an increase in occupancy resulting from increased employment in the region the american petroleum institute projects that ohio and pennsylvania will generate 138 000 jobs per year through the year 2035 cracker plants panda plants and the pipeline projects will continue to generate economic growth and capital investment in the region for years to come the united states is the world s number one producer of oil and natural gas and now a net exporter of natural gas these developments will be a game changer for ohio and pennsylvania leading to long term economic prosperity our core ffo and normalized ffo for 2018 were 0 72 and 0 74 respectively both fully covering our 0 72 dividend each year we improve upon our previous year s earnings looking at the year ahead we have budgeted a 4 site and home rent increase for 2019 and we expect to install and rent an additional 800 rental homes this should result in total revenue growth of approximately 10 million our net operating income should increase by 6 million we are optimistic that our increased home sales will continue and that 2019 should be a great year for our sales operation umh s business operations are as strong as ever umh should see another year of positive earnings growth and share price appreciation i would like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated umh team for all their hard work we are proud of the results achieved by our team and remain optimistic about the prospects for our company and our industry and now anna will provide you with greater detail on our results for the quarter anna t chew vice president chief financial officer thank you sam core funds from operations or core ffo was 7 4 million or 0 19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 6 million or 0 19 per diluted share for the prior year period normalized ffo which excludes realized gains on the sale of securities and other non recurring items was 7 4 million or 0 19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 3 million or 0 18 per diluted share for the prior year period for the full year 2018 core ffo was 27 million or 0 72 per diluted share compared to 23 5 million or 0 71 per diluted share for 2017 normalized ffo was 27 5 million or 0 74 per diluted share for 2018 compared to 21 7 million or 0 66 per diluted share for 2017 a 12 increase on a per share basis rental and related income for the quarter was 29 6 million compared to 26 1 million a year ago representing an increase of 13 for the full year rental and related income increased from 101 8 million in 2017 to 113 8 million in 2018 an increase of 12 these increases were primarily due to community acquisitions the addition of rental homes and the growth in occupancy community noi increased by 10 for the quarter from 13 9 million in 2017 to 15 4 million in 2018 for the full year community noi increased from 54 million in 2017 to 60 9 million in 2018 an increase of 13 this is the eighth consecutive year that we have achieved double digit year over year noi growth as we turn to our capital structure at year end we had approximately 439 million in debt of which 331 million was community level mortgage debt and 108 million were loans payable 77 of our total debt is fixed rate the weighted average interest rate on our mortgage debt was 4 29 at year end 2018 compared to 4 24 in the prior year we have enhanced our financial flexibility by renewing and expanding our unsecured revolving credit facility the expanded facility provides for an increase in our borrowing capacity from 50 million to 75 million with a 50 million accordion feature bringing the total potential availability up to 125 million the amended facility also extended the maturity date from march 2020 to november 2022 with a one year extension and reduced our interest rate at year end we have 50 million drawn down on our facility umh further increased our liquidity by issuing 2 million shares of a new 6 375 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately 48 million we use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes which included the purchase of manufactured homes for sale or lease to customers expansion of our existing communities and acquisitions of additional properties we have also raised 35 1 million through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan at year end umh had a total of 289 million in perpetual preferred equity our preferred stock combined with an equity market capitalization of 454 million and our 439 million in debt results in a total market capitalization of approximately 1 2 billion at year end from a credit standpoint our net debt to total market capitalization was 37 our net debt less securities to total market capitalization was 28 our net debt to adjusted ebitda was 6 8 times our net debt less securities to adjusted ebitda was 5 2 times our interest coverage was 3 7 times and our fixed charge coverage was 1 7 times from a liquidity standpoint we ended the year with 7 million in cash and cash equivalents 25 million available on our recently expanded credit facility and 19 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory we also had 100 million in our reit securities portfolio encumbered by 32 million in margin loans this portfolio represents approximately 9 of our undepreciated assets although the reit market experienced high volatility during the year in the long term these securities generally perform in line with the underlying real estate we limit our portfolio to no more than 15 of our undepreciated assets with our strong financial position we are well positioned to continue our growth initiatives and now let me turn it over to gene before we open it up for questions eugene w landy chairman thank you anna umh is very well positioned for the future we have selectively built our portfolio asset by asset over the past 51 years we believe that we have invested in value add communities with vacancies in markets that are poised to experience economic growth resulting in future higher occupancy levels rents and property value the bridge to the future is provided by our rental home program rental homes give us the ability to continue to grow revenue because financing for potential homeowners has been difficult to obtain rental homes also provide a vehicle to quickly stabilize and improve the operating results at our recent acquisitions once the community reaches stabilization we can finance or refinance the community recouping much of our investment our sales operation has returned to profitability while we are happy with this accomplishment we believe that sales can be a major profit center for the company in years to come umh s rent roll currently annualizes at approximately 120 million each year we raise rents 4 which should result in an additional 5 million in rental and related income this year over five years revenue growth on our existing portfolio from rent increases can be 25 million in additional revenue umh currently has 3 900 vacancies once occupied these vacant sites would generate an additional 20 million in revenue and net 11 million our housing product is highly competitive with apartments and conventional single family homes in both price and quality the housing market remains strong there was simply not enough affordable housing being constructed the current housing shortage is becoming more severe in many states they are beginning to experience an affordable housing crisis affordable housing is one of the only issues that can garner bipartisan support the manufactured housing industry is well positioned to help the country to develop much needed affordable housing at some point all our vacant sites would be full at that point the industry will have to develop new manufactured housing communities we are at the forefront of working with federal state and local officials to be able to develop new communities the mission of umh has always been to provide quality affordable housing that mission is as important now as it has ever been we are very proud of the company we have built and the service that we provide we will now be happy to take questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today comes from rob stevenson from janney please go ahead with your question robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst good morning guys sam you talked about the two properties in your acquisition pipeline 45 million price tag i believe what s the occupancy there is that sort of in that sort of 70 to 80 range that you ve been acquiring at recently higher lower how should we be thinking about that samuel a landy president and chief executive officer brett will answer that go ahead brett brett taft vice president yes so those two communities actually have a little bit of a lower occupancy rate the blended occupancy rate at 63 one of the properties is at 86 and the other property is at 51 the second property is actually an 800 space community so we believe that in the long term we can generate some substantial value robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst how much do you guys think that you re going to have to put into the properties over and above the 45 million price tag to get them to where you need to be brett taft vice president not as much as some of our previous acquisitions going back a few years as we mentioned on a couple earnings calls earlier this year the quality of our pipeline is a lot higher than it has been in the past so our primary investments will be in the rental homes and some capital improvements in paving streets and upgrading the infrastructure but not nearly as much as some of the previous acquisitions robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay and then what s the cost that you expect to spend to develop the 500 new sites that sam was talking about delivering this year samuel a landy president and chief executive officer yes sam here that s going to be approximately 60 000 per site multiple speakers robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay okay and then and that s just the site itself that doesn t include putting a home or anything else on it right samuel a landy president and chief executive officer correct right that s multiple speakers ready for a house yeah eugene w landy chairman if i can just add to that we try to do it two ways we build a park for 50 million and then we hope to sell the homes and have the homes in the park but we could also make it an all rental product we are very proud of our memphis blues project in memphis tennessee and that s the first park ever built that were all rental we built the park it costs 50 000 60 000 a site and we buy homes for 60 000 each we ve created a living unit of probably 1 000 square feet three bedrooms two bath for a combined price of less than 100 000 sometimes a little more than 100 000 which if you know the cost of housing today it s about 250 000 to 300 000 for an apartment and that s only one or two bedrooms we have three or four bedrooms robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst while you re on that asset where is the occupancy there today and how much are you sort of adding a month there samuel a landy president and chief executive officer so memphis blues the first phase was 37 lots which is 98 occupied or something like that and we ll be building the next 50 lots it s under construction right at this moment and demand is very strong anna t chew vice president chief financial officer and i just wanted to say that the first phase was 100 filled up within less than 12 months robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay samuel a landy president and chief executive officer and there is no government program to put a mortgage on those land and homes but we are working with the government and we are very confident that we re going to be a pioneer and get a government sponsored entity to give us a very nice mortgage on both land and home but we have to complete the second phase and get the occupancy robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay and then when you guys are sitting in there today thinking about the communities and the rental homes that you guys are likely to purchase and install in new communities this year et cetera where is the internal sort of bogie for occupancy in the portfolio 12 months from now when you re reporting year end 19 results i mean how significant could the bump wind up being in over the course of the year samuel a landy president and chief executive officer so last year we added 800 rentals when you count the acquisitions it s 900 homes but we also removed approximately 700 homes total from communities we owned or acquired that s a major benefit those old 1970 homes needed to be removed it s a major upgrade to the community to take those out and replace those with new and i think we did exactly what we projected to do before 2018 began that we would raise rents 4 which amounts to 4 million and we would add 800 rental units and go ahead to 6 4 million in revenue there and i project we ll do exactly the same for 2019 and in fact the december rent roll indicates that we re already going to be about 9 million ahead at year end which is right on target eugene w landy chairman if i can add one other thing we ve really upgraded our communities and we encourage all our investors to go on our website we have videos some of them are done by drones and the products are first class and we really encourage everybody to see the properties that umh owns today i can assure you that the quality is much better than it was three four years ago robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay and then one for anna obviously the securities portfolio balance has bounced back given the first quarter reit market rally have you guys invested any incremental capital into the securities portfolio since december 31st anna t chew vice president chief financial officer very minimal what we do is we do do our dividend reinvestment plan which we reinvest our dividends back in monmouth that s pretty much all that we ve done since year end robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay so no new stocks added to the portfolio just multiple speakers dividends anna t chew vice president chief financial officer minimal multiple speakers robert stevenson janney montgomery scott analyst okay perfect thanks guys appreciate it anna t chew vice president chief financial officer no problem operator operator instructions our next question comes from craig kucera from b riley fbr please go ahead with your question craig kucera b riley fbr analyst hey good morning guys wanted to ask about the same store operating expense increase which was pretty sizable can you provide a little additional color on that anna t chew vice president chief financial officer sure on same store we had in quarter four we had a little bit of an increase in insurance expense what had happened is we had mid year renewals and and of course that went up a little bit so in q3 it went up and then in q4 it went up a little bit more because we did also have some audits which came in in q4 we also had an additional year over year we had additional 600 rental homes that we added in same store so that increased and also if you look at our bad debt it increased but if you look at the total if you look at it as a percentage of rental and related revenue that total was 1 25 versus 1 29 in the prior year craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it so it doesn t sound like there was any meaningful tax true up or anything it was other items correct anna t chew vice president chief financial officer no that s correct craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it and just to follow up on the acquisitions are you still on track to close those in the second quarter or kind of when are you expecting to get those closed samuel a landy president and chief executive officer yes it s hard to say exactly we re hoping for the end of the second quarter but it may push off into the third quarter anna t chew vice president chief financial officer there s loan assumptions involved so it s hard to say because of that craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it and with the large pick up in sales certainly in the back half of the year is first quarter still trending very strong samuel a landy president and chief executive officer yes an important point going back to the fourth quarter our applications were up 21 5 and our approvals were up 29 and we see the trends continuing we see sales strengthening but as good as sales are nothing today compares to what things were like in the 1990s or 2002 through 2006 we still haven t come anywhere near that type of activity that we used to have on the rental front the acceptance of the product by the customer is fantastic which is why we rent 800 homes and maintain our 92 plus percent rental home occupancy so i m more excited we are always excited about sales but the rentals people really have to understand that because of the improvements of the quality of the house that we are we have a better product than ever as rental housing and it s being accepted and doing fantastic craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it and just one more moving to the securities portfolio do you have a sense of what the current mark is relative to where you guys were in fourth quarter as far as the recovery in value eugene w landy chairman we are up about 16 from the year end which was low we were up more than that but it drifted off now as anna pointed out the portfolio was very volatile the swings can be millions of dollars a day but under these new accounting rules we expect the first quarter to we got a profit on the securities from the low point december 31st craig kucera b riley fbr analyst got it all right thanks appreciate it anna t chew vice president chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from blake gesik from university of oregon investment group please go ahead with your question blake gesik university of oregon investment group analyst hi good morning everyone my first question is about the mortgage payables moving forward and just looking at that so the next three years the average weighted cost of mortgages are substantially higher than the weighted average cost i was wondering as to how the plans for the refinancing of those mortgages are looking and just the thought process moving forward on those loans anna t chew vice president chief financial officer well we have approximately four loans that are coming due in 2019 and 2020 and those loans are at an average weighted average interest rate of 5 9 so we expect that when we refinance those loans we would like to use again either one of the gses either freddie or fannie and they will qualify but we expect that when we refinance those loans we will have a reduced interest rate the interest rate went from 4 29 to 4 24 so it s a minimal the other way around 4 24 to 4 29 so it s a minimal increase in 2018 but we expect that we will maintain that because the new loan the old the loans coming due are at 5 9 eugene w landy chairman if i can add to that and anna does a wonderful job on the mortgage refinancing the government sponsored entities are very important to the manufactured housing industry and they are very important to providing affordable housing for the nation and so we think these programs exist today they re not anything we re proposing for the future they are great programs and if they continue our projections are that we re going to be able to refinance our products substantially over the next decade in fact that s one of the main things we do we plan to do is to fill our parks get rental increases over a long period of time and use the government programs to recycle our capital back to us and our shareholders and it s so important that continues we don t think that there is any great trend ph that the government sponsored entities will be changed because so many other industries in the housing industry depend on that as well but it s a real plus for us and it s really important for people to understand that when they analyze umh properties blake gesik university of oregon investment group analyst got you sounds really good stuff so another question i had is about the securities portfolio and looking forward since the accounting change is at fair market value are you seeing that you re going to take more a defensive stance moving forward with the portfolio given the increased volatility in the market and maybe even consider moving some of that into the fixed income market or are you exclusively kind of long exclusively in the portfolio what is the thought process just to maintain the liquidity aspect and the actual capital preservation moving forward eugene w landy chairman we ve maintained our first position is we keep the securities for liquidity second position is that we really believe in reits we think real estate investment trusts are liquid real estate and that if you invest in reits you re buying properties and we re very bullish on properties and for the whole reit industry now and it s happened before over the decades reits are now selling at a discount discount from their net asset value that s not unusual and at times they sell at discounts of 5 or 10 and at times they sell at premiums of 5 or 10 what is a little unusual right now we ve had a couple of portfolio companies that have really not done well and we re watching them very closely but we ve been in these portfolios a long time and our overall history investing in reits is that in the long term that was well as owning the properties directly blake gesik university of oregon investment group analyst got you one last question for anna eugene w landy chairman multiple speakers a change in the portfolio this is a small percentage of the company we are working on the pipeline for acquisitions and we are working on building products and we are investing in rental homes and so our capital structure is very important to us and the primary thing is to have the capital to buy the homes to improve the products to make acquisitions and to expand some of the existing products and all those capital needs they may want 100 million and the changes in the securities portfolio would be a small fraction of that blake gesik university of oregon investment group analyst got you perfect so anna one last question for you before i get off so i was wondering if there would be any possibility to break down the rental and related income on what that split looks like for that year to say this portion came from rental units this portion came from land leases and the rest of it came from other utility fees or something along those lines and just trying to get a better understanding of what that distribution looks like for the entirety of that line item because that s not breaking out currently ph anna t chew vice president chief financial officer well we have in our supplemental and also in our investor presentations how much how many rental units we have and how much is the average rental income of each unit and we have approximately 30 of our rental income is derived from our rental units so i think that would be a good number to use blake gesik university of oregon investment group analyst got you so you re hoping to maintain that number into the foreseeable future or you re going to try to increase that given the number of sites and also higher occupancy anna t chew vice president chief financial officer given the number of sites and given that we are we intend to increase our rental portfolio by approximately 800 units a year we want to put 800 new units into our communities i believe that that will increase blake gesik university of oregon investment group analyst got you perfect thank you anna t chew vice president chief financial officer multiple speakers we only have 3 900 vacant sites so operator our next question comes from brian rohman from boston partners please go ahead with your question brian rohman boston partners analyst hello good morning samuel a landy president and chief executive officer good morning brian rohman boston partners analyst bunch of different questions the securities portfolio i think it was gene referenced this he doesn t have to answer the questions whoever wants to answer the question there are several securities they have been under pressure and underperformed could you just mention those names eugene w landy chairman no we only have and anna ph discussed umh we have 12 companies in the portfolio they are public companies they do their own reports we read all those reports we circulate them and there are five six analysts that cover each of the companies and so for those who think it s material you re really welcome to get the names of the companies and do your own research in the companies but it s just not practical for me to brian rohman boston partners analyst no no no you misunderstood all i m asking you is what are i know cbl is one of them wanted really like two or three names just on the anna t chew vice president chief financial officer we have a listing of our total portfolio in our 10 k on page 78 brian rohman boston partners analyst okay fine i ll go there anna t chew vice president chief financial officer thank you brian rohman boston partners analyst the preferred not preferred securities the preferred debt that you ve issued you issued some more in 18 do you anticipate using that as a financing vehicle in 19 eugene w landy chairman absolutely when you study reits and study outperformance we think one of the pillars of capital should be preferred and it gives you leverage and normally with leverage you increase risk and normally with the leverage bad things are going to happen but with when you issue perpetual preferreds you get all of the benefits of leverage and the risk is nominal even the change in interest rates in five years they are callable we think preferreds are one of it from a financial energy engineering viewpoint they are a wonderful vehicle for the investor they get a higher rate of return and if the market is there they get liquidity even though they re perpetual and from the point of view of the reit we get permanent capital at a fixed rate and we re just inaudible and we know some of the best run reits such as storage public storage has had a wonderful record by concentrating on using preferred as a growth vehicle so the market right now for the last year has been virtually closed i think there was at one point there were only four public reits that issued preferred and there were probably 40 that called preferred so we think the market is going to open up and we hopefully will be issued preferred but we re always sensitive to rates and we also want to take the money down at approximately the time we re going to use it brian rohman boston partners analyst so you re saying right now it s relatively difficult to issue preferreds is that what you re saying eugene w landy chairman i m saying what i said the rate the difference between what the public companies want to pay and what the investors want to pay and when you get that you get no new issuances if we wanted to pay a higher number a preferred with a seven in front of it instead of a six in front of it we could issue preferred tomorrow but we would prefer to issue what did we do in the last preferred at at 6 25 anna t chew vice president chief financial officer 6 375 eugene w landy chairman yes 6 375 brian rohman boston partners analyst yeah and if you could do that and you re saying today would be significantly higher eugene w landy chairman no it will be higher brian rohman boston partners analyst okay fine and acquisitions for 2019 i m sorry did you give a number of what you expect and is it also driven by your access to the preferreds market samuel a landy president and chief executive officer no yes i ll just follow up on that so we have two communities under contract right now it s about 1 200 home sites 63 occupied for a total purchase price of 45 million or about 37 000 38 000 per bed brian rohman boston partners analyst okay so that s what s on the table right now and you have liquidity to do that regardless of whether or not you can finance it in the preferreds market is that correct samuel a landy president and chief executive officer that s correct brian rohman boston partners analyst okay and then just one other quick question you made reference to this and i noticed it on page 14 is that generally you said you basically look at four homes per acre is that the right number samuel a landy president and chief executive officer well if we re building sites and you ask what do we think the yield will be it will be about four homes per acre correct brian rohman boston partners analyst and then the acquisitions that are listed on page 14 they actually line up exactly with that number about four per acre samuel a landy president and chief executive officer and i ll point out while you are on that subject that newmark s knight frank just wrote the manufactured housing white paper of 2019 and they rate communities based on star rating five star four star three star two star one star and one of the things they look at is sites per acre with five star being four to seven homes per acre four star being six to nine sites per acre and three star being seven to 10 sites per acre so almost all of umh communities are four to five star and to the extent someone might call one of our communities that we acquire a three star because of the age of the home as when we acquired it we convert those communities to four and five star communities through our capital improvements and our additional rental brian rohman boston partners analyst and do you think and then last question and i can follow up later do you think you get higher rents per property with a lower density samuel a landy president and chief executive officer well so the number one factor in the rents is location because i ve seen take florida or california more than 20 homes per acre with the highest rents i could ever dream of so location is more of a factor but then the density that could go to the quality and could increase the rents if lower density brian rohman boston partners analyst okay samuel a landy president and chief executive officer could be higher quality and could increase the rents brian rohman boston partners analyst alright thank you thanks for answering my questions thanks for your time operator our next question comes from tony gleason from carnegie lake capital ph please go ahead with your question unidentified participant analyst good morning folks i m glad to see that sales have turned to profit that s a great sign couple of questions i was a little confused on the share count on page 2 of the presentation it was 32 6 million page 8 is 35 4 million and i m looking at bloomberg right now it says 37 8 million so i m trying to figure out what s the actual share count as of year end 12 31 samuel a landy president and chief executive officer last i looked was moments ago it was 38 million shares but anna is looking in the sup anna t chew vice president chief financial officer you re talking about 12 if you re looking at page 3 of the supplemental the 32 7 million was as of 12 31 17 unidentified participant analyst i m sorry okay alright and the 35 4 million on page 8 anna t chew vice president chief financial officer that s the weighted average shares outstanding it s not the shares at the end of the year that s the weighted average over the whole year of 2017 and 2018 unidentified participant analyst got it okay so total outstanding right now is 38 million anna t chew vice president chief financial officer correct well as of 12 31 unidentified participant analyst got it samuel a landy president and chief executive officer and that s a different number because i just opened this up 36 870 000 ph anna t chew vice president chief financial officer that s the weighted average outstanding for the year unidentified participant analyst okay so that if you re issuing shares toward the end of the year then those would be counted as less because they are not fully in the year number anna t chew vice president chief financial officer correct it s averaged unidentified participant analyst okay okay thank you for that can you grow the company in 2019 without issuing equity eugene w landy chairman when you say can we our policy is to be careful and to be safe and if we want to issue 100 million or 200 million in preferred we really have to have a good capital base and coverage and so we ve continued to issue common stock through the dividend reinvestment shareholder investment plan because that gives us a continual flow of capital to buy these homes and do the expansions we need 100 million budgeted for 2019 and we could probably borrow the 100 million but prudence dictates that we add some capital and hopefully as i stated we think we are going to the preferred market is going to open up and we re going to get a very nice infusion of capital in the repreferred securities unidentified participant analyst right okay well the share count keeps growing at that same rate as revenue so we re never getting the traction on a per share basis so i think that s really the crux of my question anna t chew vice president chief financial officer while our normalized ffo did go up this year 12 13 so we are making progress in that respect we are being able to use the equity that we have generated the equity that we have raised in order to generate positive earnings unidentified participant analyst yes yes eugene w landy chairman multiple speakers conclusion we are hopeful that over the next three to five years we re going to go to a 100 occupancy and we re hopeful over the next three to five years we ll have 20 higher rents because the value of these homes we rent them 750 800 a month and the competition is 1 100 a month and the cost that we produce these products sites and homes is much higher so we think we can really justify much higher rents so with full occupancy and with higher rents the company is going to generate a great deal more income but we are careful to issue more capital not issue too much more capital but on the other hand we want the ship to complete its voyage safely and so we keep issuing equity so that we don t get ourselves in a position where there is a shortage of capital i note that we watch what the other reits do some reits have deleveraged a 1 billion 2 billion and cut their earnings 50 million or 100 million other reits have leveraged up we want to keep the leverage which we think is low leverage approximately where we are now on a percentage basis so we don t think that when we finally reach our goal of full occupancy and higher rents we think the shared numbers will be better and not the same unidentified participant analyst okay well i m hopeful the stock goes to 20 ph as well but i think issuing more equity makes it harder to do that s all eugene w landy chairman it does in one respect and the other is though that everybody is bullish on the manufactured housing industry two of the best performing reits of course sun communities and els and they sell at i don t know 24 times earnings so if we make a dollar we are hopeful some day that 24 will be 20 but our small size is a handicap we re very pleased to see that so many people like favorable reports on the industry and what a great industry we re in and that affordable the solution to the affordable housing crisis is manufactured homes and then they say well there s only two public reits because we haven t reached the size and crossed the threshold so while issuing more stock under conventional economics and security studies may seem to be not the thing to do on the other hand the increased size gets us closer to be included with the other two when they write these favorable reports unidentified participant analyst well i hear you second just the portfolio the reit portfolio is creating a lot of angst and tension and certainly last year was not a particularly good year for the portfolio is there will management awkward question here will management and directors compensation be affected given the 50 million loss eugene w landy chairman well let me answer it this way we d be very happy if this company the earnings would be done on what is the european accounting system called anna anna t chew vice president chief financial officer it s a fair market accounting eugene w landy chairman fair market accounting i mean you want to use fair market accounting and fix our revenues we d be very happy to do that we have 20 000 sites they go up in value 100 million and the securities went down 24 million so we think if you want to go to fair market accounting and measure management performance we d vote for that too unidentified participant analyst well i ok i ll take that as a no i think it s worth considering that as a signal to shareholders that you share the pain in a portfolio loss that would be my perspective but appreciate you re answering my question thank you eugene w landy chairman okay operator operator instructions our next question is a follow up from craig kucera from b riley fbr please go ahead with your follow up craig kucera b riley fbr analyst hey guys just a quick one here you mentioned the shorter turnaround period on your recent acquisitions i think historically it s usually been about a three year time frame from when you buy a new acquisition and have to rip out some of the old homes et cetera does that get you down are you talking maybe about like a two year time frame or can you just elaborate a little bit on how quickly you could bring those up to a stabilized level of occupancy samuel a landy president and chief executive officer again it does all depend asset by asset they re all going to be different i think if you look back at 2015 2016 and older those were probably your three year turnaround period but if you look at 2017 which unfortunately just missed out on our same store numbers we ve really generated some substantial increases in occupancy revenue and ultimately noi and property value so i think two years is probably a closer estimate on those but again we will yeah we ultimately will continue to evaluate all acquisitions whether it be a two or a three year turnaround period so craig kucera b riley fbr analyst okay thanks operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time we ll conclude today s question and answer session i d like to turn the conference call

by howard schneider and balazs koranyi washington frankfurt reuters patient monetary policy muted inflation uncertainty over global trade and government policies that may be undermining the economy evidence of a world slipping back to an inflation less slow growth norm the outlook that prompted the u s federal reserve to halt its interest rate hikes in january has now forced a broader pivot among major trading nations as governments from beijing to ottawa take stock of a decaying outlook in announcing a sharp downgrade of euro zone growth and a surprise move to loosen monetary policy european central bank president mario draghi on thursday coined what may be the motto of the times continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty those five words sum up why the ecb pushed back consideration of any rate increase to next year and expanded lending to banks to stave off a credit crunch the action was a response to weak inflation and growth data following on the heels of the fed s pause of its tightening cycle the launch of stimulus in china this week and a debate over more action by the bank of japan the ecb s latest policy decision completes a dramatic turn from just a year ago when the world seemed in the midst of a synchronized expansion if anything the world economy is now throwing off signs that an era of coordinated stagnation may have arrived anchored by the long run demographics of aging populations and low productivity the situation has been aggravated draghi and other central bankers have noted by geopolitical risks like britain s plan to leave the european union and u s protectionist moves that have begun exacting global costs the ecb s forecast of overall 1 1 percent growth this year for the 19 eu nations that make up the euro zone is less than half of the 2 4 percent predicted a year ago u s growth is expected to slow as well as the impact of president donald trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut package as well as federal spending begin to wane the slowdown of foreign growth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed fed governor lael brainard said in remarks on thursday that continued the u s central bank s shift to what she called softer policy that persistent weakness she said reflects the complex challenges faced by china which this week marked down its growth forecast for 2019 to a 30 year low of between 6 percent and 6 5 percent weakness in germany and struggles in japan all overlaid with the turbulence caused by the ongoing trade conflict between the united states and several of its key economic partners and it is likely to make it harder for anyone to break out lower interest rate expectations in europe mean a likely rise in the u s dollar weaker inflation in the united states as imports grow cheaper and slower u s growth as the cost of american exports rise on world markets that will add to uncertainty about the u s outlook and further limit the fed s already diminished need to further raise rates the u s central bank lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018 signaled as late as december that more hikes were coming and then backed down in january broad uncertainty the ecb s u turn added to growing investor angst over a weakening global economy leading to sharp declines on global equity markets on thursday benchmark u s and european sovereign debt yields tumbled on the blow to inflation expectations draghi echoing fed chairman jerome powell s comments in january said it was largely the global environment and political risk that had forced the ecb to change course the challenges to european growth are mostly of external source including brexit and u s trade policy he said the uncertainty is over how long these will continue affecting the world economy the euro economy and confidence more generally that is a question that has become ever more important to policymakers worldwide as the trump administration intensified its efforts over the past year to challenge and rearrange the global trading system to the united states advantage as part of an america first policy in effect ecb officials argue a broad sense of uncertainty regarding u s trade policy brexit and other risks has now taken hold and begun to erode the economic outlook more severely the longer it persists recent studies have begun tallying the narrow costs of things like the tariffs imposed by trump with a recent analysis saying the measures imposed so far are taking about 4 5 billion per month directly out of the wallets of american consumers and businesses but the more chronic impact may be the corrosion of confidence in a global recovery that was running full tilt in 2017 and much of 2018 throughout that time u s central bankers spoke optimistically of tailwinds they felt would let them continue raising rates that has given way more recently to disappointing business investment weaker than expected consumption and market volatility that took a record 3 8 trillion out of u s household wealth late last year in europe much like in the united states draghi noted signs of continued economic health that included ongoing job gains and broad wage growth but they are not proving robust enough to lift growth beyond a very limited range and the hope now is that the shift by central banks will at least put a floor under the world economy that prevents anything more serious from occurring the ecb s action draghi noted did nothing to right the balance of risks europe is facing which remain tilted to the downside but only guard against something worse our decisions certainly increase resilience of the euro zone economy he said can they address the factors weighing on the euro zone economy they cannot
since the 2008 global financial crisis expansionary monetary policy has been the order of the day in most of the major advanced economies this approach comprising deep interest rate cuts and large scale asset purchases quantitative easing or qe has been credited with accelerating the recovery in the united states and the united kingdom and pulling the eurozone back from the brink of collapse as for japan which introduced monetary easing in late 2012 as the first arrow of abenomics prime minister shinzo abe s economic reform program the policy has contributed to the creation of about 2 5 million jobs yet with low interest rates implying that central banks will have little ammunition to fight the next economic downturn has reliance on generous monetary conditions to sustain growth gone too far the conventional view in line with textbook keynesian economics is that monetary expansion works through the interest rate by reducing the cost of money a lower interest rate stimulates domestic investment spurring growth once the interest rate gets too close to zero below which it usually cannot be reduced monetary easing is no longer an effective economic stimulus
