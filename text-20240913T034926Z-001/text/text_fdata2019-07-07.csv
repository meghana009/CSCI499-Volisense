on a residential street corner in buenos aires van koning market sells imported beers to the city s well heeled since it opened in june last year costs have soared the peso has plummeted meaning wholesale prices have shot up inflation is running at 26 the reduction of government subsidies means the monthly electricity bill has risen from 700 pesos to 4 000 pesos us 142 already losing customers sergio discenza the manager is reluctant to raise prices much in a normal country this would be a viable business he says but here everyone is struggling advertisement the year started badly for argentina when the worst drought in 50 years hit the harvest of maize and soy beans both important exports in may a stronger dollar and higher us treasury yields prompted international investors to flee risky assets most emerging market currencies suffered argentina s especially its twin fiscal and current account deficits have seen the peso lose more than a third of its value this year making it the world s worst performing currency a recession the fifth in a decade appears inevitable in may the central bank hiked interest rates to 40 to prop up the peso when that failed mauricio macri the president secured a us 50bn credit line from the imf the peso continued to fall on june 14th the central bank governor resigned admitting he had lost the confidence of investors luis caputo a former wall street trader was moved from the treasury to replace him mr caputo has had a tough start since his appointment the peso has slid by a further 4 and the merval argentina s benchmark stock index by 8 frustratingly for mr macri argentina s travails are in part a consequence of his efforts to put the economy on a firmer footing when he took office in december 2015 inflation was running at 25 he allowed the peso to float it quickly fell by 29 he also gave the central bank freedom to raise rates which encouraged foreign investors to buy government bonds and supported the currency it remained overvalued that kept imports high and made it hard for exports to compete the current account deficit rose to more than 5 of gdp meanwhile the government raised large amounts of foreign denominated debt to cover the fiscal deficit when investors cooled on emerging markets all that left argentina painfully exposed the imf credit line means most of argentina s external financing requirements are covered until 2020 but it is tied to austerity measures including cutting the budget deficit which reached 3 9 in 2017 to 1 3 of gdp next year and to zero by 2020 the savings are supposed to come from postponing infrastructure projects cutting subsidies and transfers to the provinces and shrinking the federal payroll but mr macri controls neither house of congress and investors fret that austerity lacks support if he were to lose the presidential election due in october 2019 the deal with the imf might collapse the currency crisis has also stoked social unrest argentines have long regarded the peso s strength against the dollar which is widely used for savings and property transactions as a yardstick for their country s economic performance on june 25th a general strike called by the general confederation of labour the largest trade union grouping in protest at the government s economic policies brought the country to a standstill according to capital economics a consultancy further strikes could force president macri into wage concessions slowing progress in bringing down inflation and the budget deficit the pressure on mr macri is unlikely to ease soon aggravating the rise in prices caused by the peso s weakness oil prices are on the way up as pay packets stretch less far consumption will suffer interest rates will have to remain high for some time putting companies off investment most analysts expect argentina to fall into recession in the third quarter advertisement a stronger harvest could mean a return to growth next year says irina moroni of fundación capital a consultancy in buenos aires but interest rate hikes elsewhere may yet hurt any future recovery in america because it puts investors off emerging markets and in brazil because of the impact on already feeble growth in argentina s largest trading partner in january the world bank predicted 3 growth for argentina s economy in 2019 last month it cut that forecast to 1 8 mr macri was elected because argentines sick of populist economic policies supported his plans for reform now many are wavering a recent poll of buenos aires residents found almost half saying they had been happier under his populist predecessor cristina fernández de kirchner we would probably have sold more beer under the previous government says mr discenza standing in his

mohieddine dino kronfol chief investment officer franklin templeton global sukuk and mena fixed income when it comes to fixed income investing we think bond markets in the gulf cooperation council gcc region deserve much more investor attention than they re receiving we ve seen the gulf cooperation council gcc 1 economies take some bold steps to implement both fiscal reforms and diversify economies away from their dependency on oil at the same time the gcc s phased inclusion in the j p morgan emerging market bond index embi 2 over the course of 2019 signals to us that the inclusion should lead to a significant increase in investor interest and demand for gcc bonds overall the evidence suggests gcc debt issuance which includes traditional bonds and sukuk shariah compliant bonds is on the rise these are exciting developments in what we think was an underappreciated asset class and we remain constructive on gcc debt here are four considerations we think could drive gcc debt for the remainder of the year 1 structural reforms one of the most important themes we re seeing in the mena region is the scale and speed of reforms from policymakers across gcc economies this includes the opening up of capital markets and the mobilization of the private sector which has come at a particularly important time given that the growth rate among gcc economies has been fairly modest over the last few years however we believe gcc policymakers do have the tools to help stimulate economic growth beyond current predicted gross domestic product gdp growth rates of 1 5 to 3 5 between 2019 and 2021 3 this includes removing the barriers to foreign trade within the gcc making financial services more widely available and developing debt markets we ll watch closely how policymakers can enact changes without compromising some of the more pressing fiscal consolidation goals they have particularly the progress they are making on diversifying economies away from oil and into non oil related sectors such as tourism and financial services some economies such as saudi arabia have continued to push for financial integration on a global scale the country recently launched a national industrial development and logistics program to attract around us 426 billion in investment by 2030 in a bid to meet its vision 2030 target of integrating its economy on an international scale 2 early stage in the credit cycle we re also paying close attention to where gcc debt markets are in the credit cycle especially as some developed markets are at a more advanced stage of their cycle gcc bonds are typically denominated in us dollars and tied to the fortunes of the us economy we think long term fundamentals are broadly improving in the gcc region but gross domestic product gdp growth is expected to be modest for the next three years supporting the rationale for fixed income allocations 4 despite this we are ultimately mindful that a potential correction in developed markets such as the united states could have a knock on effect on markets in the gcc region through the transmission of us monetary policy and the price of credit across the globe 3 improving valuations in our view valuations for gcc debt are still attractive relative to history we also think valuations are attractive relative to assets within similar credit ratings in other markets so we think there s a lot of potential opportunity for us to capture we d also add the growth of corporate issuances looks exciting to us pressure in some industries has led to a selloff opening up new bargains the growth of corporate issuances allows us new idiosyncratic risk that we can incorporate into our portfolios which is very different from the market beta risk that would really be driven by global factors 4 us interest rates it s not surprising that us interest rates are on our list of concerns markets have priced in at least one interest rate cut by the us federal reserve fed this year starting from this summer 5 we re paying special attention to the fed s interest rate trajectory in particular and the impact that can have on longer term rates over the next few years shattering misconceptions the gcc bond market is almost unrecognizable from a decade ago due to capital market development and government efforts to diversify economies away from a reliance on fossil fuels in our view a combination of ongoing structural reforms and improving valuations should likely attract additional foreign investment to the economy and continue to drive this trend and according to our research gcc bonds typically have a low correlation to oil prices and to other fixed income assets so can offer diversification as well as potentially higher risk adjusted returns see chart below 6 ultimately we are constructive in our short to medium term view for gcc debt we d consider the four aforementioned factors to be at the top of our minds in an asset class that we believe deserves more investor

morning in late may a worker had been killed in a scaffolding accident two days earlier and the metal workers union of attica was directing its anger at china cosco shipping the chinese state owned logistics giant that controls the port was the port of piraeus notorious for crippling strikes and protests until the last decade once again turning into a hotbed of dissent if anything the protest proved the opposite it was small maybe 100 workers showed up and a rarity chinese and greek government officials consider piraeus which was a broken down mess of a port for decades a showpiece investment in the belt and road initiative bri beijing s infrastructure based global development strategy that is sometimes known as the new silk road under chinese ownership piraeus has emerged as

west take on the flavour of a new cold war already there are rumours that a recent freeze on further port development by cosco which is ultimately controlled by the chinese communist party was the result of back channel u s and eu pressure in march the eu labelled china a systemic rival marking a hardened tone on beijing s ocean hopping industrial and security ambitions chinese naval vessels have been welcomed at piraeus a sight that must be anathema to the white house and commanders of the u s sixth fleet in the mediterranean piraeus is generally viewed as a winning investment by cosco the greek government the shipping companies and economists the chinese made piraeus competitive said miranda xafa a greek economist who is a senior fellow at the centre for international governance innovation and a former member of the international monetary fund s executive board jobs there used to be inherited they used to retire at age 50 with lump sum payments no more this is a privatization that has worked but cosco is suddenly no longer getting a free ride in piraeus in april without warning greece s powerful central archaeological council and museums kas declared much of piraeus an archeological site the decision froze big portions of cosco s plan to invest another 600 million 880 6 million in piraeus with the addition of luxury hotels a shopping mall warehouses and a very expensive cruise ship terminal in early july greece s port planning and development commission conditionally accepted but did not approve cosco s expansion plans the expansion may go nowhere until well after greece s snap election on july 7 on sunday night results showed the ruling radical left syriza party headed for defeat at the hands of the opposition conservatives new democracy is expected to support additional chinese investments in the port of piraeus as a matter of pride greeks tend to be highly political and a few are prone to conspiracy theories some say the americans encouraged the greek government to put the brakes on cosco s expansion plans though there is zero evidence to support this theory in early june a small but well known greek newspaper liberal implied that the kas decision was indeed political the government in doing a favour for the u s a has come up with so called archeological obstacles in piraeus it said the timing was certainly curious the kas decision came just after china welcomed greece into the club of central and eastern european countries 11 of them eu members known as the 16 1 group the 1 being china it is now the 17 1 group greek prime minister alexis tsipras who once opposed cosco s presence in piraeus as some of his radical left syriza party members still do has since become an enthusiastic backer of the shipping giant and the bri

heart of gritty piraeus to the ship repair yard to the northwest the waters just off the port were the site of the first great naval battle in recorded history in 480 bc during the greco persian wars greek triremes crippled a much larger persian force in the strait between piraeus and the island of salamis since the 19th century piraeus has been instrumental to greece s development the piraeus port authority ppa was established in 1930 and pier 2 the port s biggest container terminal was completed in 1997 five years later the ppa joined the athens stock exchange although the government kept a majority stake during those years the port was by all accounts barely functioning before cosco got there it was a congregation of wasp nests said konstantinos katsigiannis the athens lawyer who is president of the hellenic canadian chamber of commerce there were strikes demonstrations and clashes you name it it was unbelievably inefficient and crooked nektarios demenopoulos the deputy manager of public and investor relations for the ppa remembers that some dockworker strikes were by design so severe that they could trigger economic hardship in piraeus and athens strikes used to be a very big problem because the unions had monopoly power to close the biggest port in the country he said sometimes the supermarkets had a deficiency of products because of the strikes by 2008 the greek government was fed up with the strikes and the decrepit state of the container port whose main pier was running at half capacity and athens faced a crippling financial crisis that would prevent it from investing in piraeus the port s two biggest container operations pier 2 and pier 3 the latter only partly constructed were put up for auction the long term lease was won by a cosco company called piraeus container terminal the chinese revolution at piraeus was about to begin even before belt and road initiative had entered into the global development lexicon the takeover of the piers would launch one of china s biggest investments in europe kriton valleras adviser to the general secretariat of ports of greece s ministry of maritime affairs and insular policy said the piers had enormous potential as a key destination for cargo ships arriving from asia through the suez canal the piers needed a lot of improvement he said cosco sunk about 600 million into piers 2 and 3 to make them among the biggest and most automated in the mediterranean and a hub for transshipment the transfer of containers from large vessels to smaller ones so the cargo can be sent to smaller ports unlike many bri projects around the world no debt trap was created for the greek state the funds were raised and spent by cosco not loaned to greek agencies the overhaul has turned the port s container operations into a competitive force in 2007 piraeus did not rank among the top 15 mediterranean container ports by 2017 it was eighth measured by the total throughput of 20 foot equivalent containers known as teus according to data from europe s porteconomics site last year it had climbed to sixth position behind valencia spain with a throughput of 4 9 million teus cosco officials boast that

of 44 1 million on revenues of 56 2 million this is a business with high profit margins the smaller pier 1 under separate control within the cosco group is losing money cosco claims the piraeus container port has not lost a day of work to industrial action since it first invested in the vast operation in 2008 yes there have been strikes by dockworkers as there were last year but none was big enough to cripple the port we proudly say we have offered uninterrupted services for the last 10 years said tassos vamvakidis the commercial manager for the container port cosco got lucky about four years ago when the greek government under pressure from the european commission the european central bank and the international monetary fund the troika overseeing the greek bailouts insisted that greece ramp up its privatization program part of that effort would see the rest of piraeus privatized including the ferry passenger cruise ship ship repair and car terminals all of which were held under the ppa the privatization effort triggered a crisis in greece whose governments have long opposed privatizations as did the unions which considered them an invitation to mass layoffs and non unionized workers there were lots of strikes at piraeus in response said george pagoulatos a political economist and vice president of the hellenic foundation for european and foreign policy eliamep it was a typical left wing reaction to the privatization of a strategic asset but greece was desperate for foreign investment and the privatization went ahead in 2016 cosco bought 51 per cent of the ppa for about 300 million it has the option to raise its stake to 67 per cent once it completes some 293 million of mandatory investments the biggest being the expansion of the ferry passenger port 136 million and the overhaul of the ship repair yard 55 million many additional investments including the hotels and the cruise ship terminal are in limbo because of the kas freeze on their development the takeover of the ppa has not made everyone happy the unions have complained that cosco is loading up with non unionized workers the company declines to say what the split is between unionized and non unionized workers the association of passenger shipping companies has complained about the lack of cosco investment so far in the ferry terminals nothing has been done for the ferries association president michalis sakellis said we don t talk much to cosco and the job creation numbers while encouraging are hardly breathtaking mr demenopoulos the ppa s public and investor relations manager said the port excluding the core container business had 1 700 employees a decade ago today the number has fallen to a little more than 1 000 but the container business has created 2 000 new positions since cosco leased piers 1 and 2 in 2008 mr pagoulatos the eliamep economist said cosco s investment in piraeus has been a big win over all for greece it was a very positive investment he said it turned piraeus into one of the largest shipping centres in the world a great opportunity for greece open this photo in gallery port workers are seen near a crane lifting containers at the port of piraeus john kolesidis wires the investment may be buying more than piers and cranes in 2017 a year after cosco took majority ownership of the ppa mr tsipras s government vetoed an eu condemnation of china s human rights record at the united nations the government denied the veto was payback for the piraeus investment certainly china seems to be digging its economic claws into greece by going after strategic investments in 2016 china state grid the world s biggest utility bought 24 per cent of greece s power grid operator china is one of the main backers of the redevelopment of athens s abandoned hellinikon international airport an enormous project that has been stalled for years cosco is said to be considering the purchase of other greek ports and has signalled that ports in italy which this year officially joined the bri the first group of seven country to do so will be next the success of the piraeus investment will certainly burnish china s lobbying power in italy the euro zone s third largest economy mr pagoulatos says the bri investments in greece and elsewhere in europe are part of china s plans to raise its global political clout china wants to retain their trade flow and they will couple it with political influence so that these markets do not get closed to them he said greece is still anchored to the eu and has been kept intact within the euro zone with copious amounts of european bailout money but its affection for china is growing and at some point that is bound to set off alarm bells in washington and brussels if it hasn t already if a full blown cold war does erupt between china and the united states greece s allegiance may not be easy to predict
here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news of a surprisingly healthy rise in us payrolls but first a key index of american business spending and especially for investment has come in at its lowest in two years and the impact of the trade war on the two main participants is becoming clearer chinese exports to the us of goods that were slapped with tariffs dropped 14 by a total of us 18 bln in the year to june this was equivalent to 3 of china s total annual shipments to the us america suffered a heavier blow with tariff hit exports to china falling 38 or by us 23 bln this drop was equivalent to about 15 of all american annual exports to china and this data is sourced from official us trade sources and china is getting clearer it s goodwill gesture to buy more us farm products is conditional on being treated as an equal a beijing insider s social media account has said these purchases won t happen if the us continues to flip flop in its positions in its own turnabout china s investment in projects outside the country are drying up quickly the westland yili deal is an anomaly only us 35 bln has been committed in the first half of 2019 the lowest since 2013 that represents a 75 drop from the peak of such m a activity in the first half of 2016 china is increasingly worried about the rise and rise of the iron ore price and their peak steel trade group has now called for authorities to step in to control the market price calling for relevant government departments to crack down on monopolistic and intentionally unreasonable pricing the call saw iron ore prices fall nearly 4 on friday miners bhp and rio tinto s share prices also fell in japan officials are turning optimistic about their economic prospects after industrial production data turned higher now their business conditions index is reflecting that the prospect of a recession is fading in japan and economic growth becomes the new reality again globally may data for international passenger air travel showed solid growth increasing by 4 3 in year on year terms however the trend rate of growth has clearly slowed over recent months in the asia pacific region it was up less at 4 0 in the us non farm payrolls rose much more than expected in june up 224 000 and smoothing out the very low may result but that may result was actually revised even lower april was too the average for the two months isn t flash the average for the past three months is below par as well in this june result factory payrolls only rose a modest 17 000 reinforcing the weak survey results that the regional feds have been reporting in its semi annual report to congress the fed said the trade war tariffs are having a material and negative impact on american manufacturing see p30 most of the payroll gains in june were from hiring in healthcare 50 200 company admin jobs 51 000 local government 29 000 and in transportation 23 900 these four accounted for about 70 of the overall rise the other 22 categories accounted for the rest average hourly earnings are up 3 1 over the past year wall street was down on these results figuring that the us fed is now less likely to add monetary juice any time soon if current payroll growth is running at about its 2018 average the s p500 was down 0 2 on friday although that is less than the 0 5 falls recorded in europe earlier asian markets ended flat on the day the us fed next reviews its policy rate on august 1 nzt given that us economic growth in q2 seems to be running at only 1 3 the chances of a rate cut while they may have receded are not zero still with their mandate for both foster employment and 2 price stability with the us jobless rate now at 3 7 and inflation at 1 8 it will be hard to make the case that some emergency policy shift is required it s complicated in canada it might be even more complicated their inflation is running at 2 4 but their jobs data for june was particularly weak with jobs shrinking and their unemployment rate rising in germany things are clearer even if they are not good factory orders took an unexpectedly large dip in may down almost 9 and that is much more than the 5 fall in the previous month for a very large economy shifts as large as these these have global implications in turkey its strongman president has sacked the head of their central bank the governor of the bank had tried to keep their currency from falling to try and limit inflation but inflation is now running at 19 there the official benchmark interest rate is 24 but the high interest rate policy hasn t stopped their currency plunging in part because investors feared this sacking would happen anyway even sharper falls in the turkish currency are now expected and that means even higher inflation can be expected turkey can t really afford anything these days the ust 10yr yield is now at 2 04 a 9 bps jump on the us payrolls result their 2 10 curve is now at 17 bps and their negative 1 5 curve is at 16 bps both narrower there have been strong recoveries in other sovereign bond yields as well the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 36 up 8 bps overnight and a 2 bps rise over the week the china govt 10yr is up much less overnight only 1 bp and down 9 bps over the week to 3 19 while the nz govt 10 yr has mimicked the chinese up only 1 bp overnight and down 6 bps for the week and now at 1 54 gold is down

source hyperinflation trauma zimbabweans uneasy new dollar fin24 the move was bold and many did not see it coming in a bid to defend the new and fledgling zimbabweandollar against black market speculation the country s finance minister on june 25 outlawed using united states dollars and other foreign currencies in local transactions when news of the policy broke harare based independent economist john robertson thought it was a bad practical joke i am not fully convinced it s genuine robertson told al jazeera this idea is so bad it s a cause for concern i fear it may be an attempt in government to cause someone embarrassment we hope it is revised zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube had hinted on several occasions that a new zimbabwean dollar was in the works the country had already made a move toward it earlier this year when it introduced an interim currency the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar or zimdollar but a decade after devastating hyperinflation prompted the country to dollarise its economy by allowing the us greenback and other foreign currencies to be used as legal tender many zimbabweans are sceptical about the stability of the country s new currency and worried about what could happen if their livelihoods are tied to it not even six months old the fledgling zimdollar has suffered from speculative attacks that saw its value plummet by more than 150 before recovering for 67 year old david mkono the country s new currency has just added to his myriad problems mkono worked as a boilerman for zimbabwe s power utility company for 47 years paying into his pension in us dollars from 2009 until he retired last year at retirement i was going to get us 223 about r3 100 per month i am not sure how much i am going to get now with the new changes mkono told al jazeera i really don t know how to value this because i don t know what 223 is now in rtgs some economists see zimbabwe s swift outlawing of the us dollar as justified given most countries that dollarise their economies fail to successfully reintroduce a new local currency it s a chance to disprove the notion that once an economy dollarises it can t have its currency ever many countries have failed kipson gundani a harare based economist and executive director of the ceo africa roundtable told al jazeera while dollarisation can help stabilise an economy in the throes of hyperinflation there are drawbacks local currencies are a powerful symbol of sovereignty and national identity countries that dollarise also lose the power to directly influence their own economy through monetary policy but zimbabwe s economy is not exactly fertile ground for a new currency to take root the country is likely in recession and the international monetary fund predicts the economy could contract 5 2 his year industry is operating at less than half of its installed capacity reliance on imports which become more expensive as the local currency weakens is stubbornly high mkono who has two children aged 12 and 8 says soaring inflation is already making it difficult for him to provide food for his family the prices have gone up rapidly in the shops he said when i get my monthly allowance we realise that we can t buy basic things like mielie meal after paying for things like school fees mielie meal is zimbabwe s staple food and is made from maize or corn but some economists maintain that zimbabwe had to take bold steps to defend its sovereign currency even if conditions weren t perfect even if fundamentals were not yet right the use of multi currencies was not sustainable said gundani we are not producing optimally we are vulnerable on the import cover and our economy is in recession on a gdp level but we are coming from a background where the rtgs was already in circulation along with other currencies and was depreciating against the us dollar at an alarming rate and while confidence in the new currency may be in short supply gundani believes that if policymakers show discipline the zimdollar may yet have a shot last week the reserve bank of zimbabwe removed us 1 4bn about r19bn from circulation to shore up the zimdollar and announced it would inject us 48 7m about r689m into the economy a day after the announcement and the mop up exercise the zimdollar recovered some 40 of its value against the us dollar on the black market i believe this is an opportunity to create that confidence by doing the right things and desisting from doing the things that killed the first zimbabwe dollar such as printing money to finance budget deficits said gundani it s a big gamble that we cannot afford to lose
the resolution for a green new deal gnd made a splash in washington earlier this year it was an ecological moonshot calling for a wholesale decarbonization of the economy by 2030 and total transformation of the u s energy grid but the resolution also attests to a greater ambition bringing the u s back to the frontlines of a global struggle against climate crisis and now it is becoming the opening salvo in an international campaign for climate justice a decade before the gnd resolution was proposed by representatives alexandria ocasio cortez d new york and ed markey d massachusetts in congress the united nations environmental programme issued a plan for a global green new deal based on similar principles ending dependency on fossil fuels creating a green workforce and reducing poverty like the u s gnd the global version did not detail how it would be financed u s lawmakers are reviving the gnd concept in washington with a hugely ambitious goal of zeroing out emissions by 2030 nationwide it s increasingly clear from the size scope and urgency of the climate threat worldwide that the u s needs to play a chief role in spurring a global gnd alongside a domestic one the people s policy project ppp has mapped out a financial plan for a global green new deal which centers the u s as a primary financial supporter of the energy transition and decarbonization process in poorer countries the premise is that the u s carries a huge global ethical and economic responsibility to the current worldwide carbon crisis not just because the u s is one of the largest emitters but also because the poorest countries are extremely geographically and economically vulnerable to the extreme weather and mass displacement that climate change is rapidly intensifying nonetheless since the national gnd resolution which is focused almost completely on domestic goals for decarbonization and job creation faces fierce criticism within the u s is it realistic to latch it onto a much wider agenda to deal with climate crisis around the world in a follow up exchange with truthout jacob fawcett co author of the ppp report argued that the political challenge of financing a gnd on a global scale mostly comes down to whether we re willing to take climate change seriously or not for the global green new deal to work the u s would have to work on two parallel tracks dramatically cutting emissions domestically while fostering similar efforts in poorer countries the political economy research institute peri at the university of massachusetts amherst recommends generally that all countries particularly large and affluent ones like the u s should invest about 1 5 percent of gdp per year in energy efficiency and clean renewable investments however for poorer nations according to the institute s co director robert pollin it s the obligation of the rich countries to finance the poor countries this could ultimately be accomplished through forms of debt monetization pollin told truthout such as a green bond issued by the u s or european union or investing in an international institution such as the african development bank ppp s analysis focuses on the united nations green climate fund gcf an international financial organ created in 2010 through the u n climate talks researchers estimate that supporting a green new deal program in developing nations should involve an annual funding commitment of about 680 billion that figure is based on a global estimate by the u k based centre for climate change economics and policy for the cost of keeping the global economy within the carbon threshold of 450 parts per million ppm which would maintain the global temperature increase within 1 5 degrees celsius with a total projected cost of 2 trillion the u s share would be about 34 percent proportionate to its share of global gdp to finance the fund the u s could sell treasury bonds providing a steady stream of yearly funding or alternately establish a mandatory federal funding stream through annual congressional spending the commitment to the gcf does not preempt other forms of investment for example direct foreign aid donations or private sector commercial trade however as an international body focused on development and climate the gcf distributes funds through an independent decision making body that is relatively democratic and transparent governed by a board with representatives from different regions with equal weight given to richer and poorer countries according to fawcett a big advantage that the gcf has is that it gives everyone in the world a seat at the table rather than just letting private interests or the united states dictate how it will be spent still the gcf is hardly a perfect instrument it remains utterly dependent on wealthy donor countries which don t always cooperate the trump administration has reportedly actively obstructed its work and it has been slow to roll out its funding allocations still fawcett stressed this is not our money to dictate spending terms on it s money that we owe the international community to fix a problem that we largely created through our own historical co2 emissions a gnd focused on healing the most vulnerable communities could promote alternative ownership models such as electricity cooperatives based on decentralized energy generation for both the u s and the poor and middle income economies that would be the beneficiaries of this investment a green industrial policy would prioritize research and development of new green technologies subsidizing the expansion of wind solar and other sources and boosting energy efficiency and it would build on years of progress in government led stimulus of green energy development one common strategy is for national governments to directly promote the large scale deployment of renewables as an industrial consumer using solar and wind generation for government buildings and mass transit for example regional energy agencies could also steer consumer markets through feed in tariffs which establish long term contracts with utilities for purchasing renewable energy from local solar or wind farms the political economy research institute also points out that a gnd focused on healing the most vulnerable communities could promote alternative ownership models such as electricity cooperatives based on decentralized energy generation which will enable communities to thwart fossil fuel monopolies and leapfrog over grid based systems entirely and by skipping over to the most advanced technology for say a rural off grid solar farm poorer less industrialized communities not only get more value for their money but they also avoid the carbon emissions and pollution that larger economies churned out in the past in many ways some poorer economies are already especially well positioned to harness the gnd as a long term development agenda renewable investment is rising steadily in developing and emerging economies china is still generating the lion s share of green energy investment nearly a third of the global total of 332 billion in 2018 while other fledgling photo voltaic markets in india malaysia south africa and kenya are mushrooming across the global south in the u s alone government subsidies for fossil fuel consumption and coal production suck about 9 billion a year from public coffers but beyond subsidizing the development and consumption of renewables the hard part is actively discouraging the use of dirty energy sources which will require some form of comprehensive carbon taxation likewise governments would need to aggressively phase out the fossil fuel subsidies that keep gas cheap around the world these measures could free up a huge stash of revenue to invest in decarbonization the funds could go toward expanding solar and wind generation capacity research and development of clean energy technology or supporting displaced workers with training and income subsidies in the u s alone economic professor edward b barbier points out in a recent analysis that government subsidies for fossil fuel consumption and coal production suck about 9 billion a year from public coffers at the same time pricing carbon at 40 a ton in the upper range of the typical rate that is charged in countries where carbon taxes exist could raise about 76 billion per year while reducing carbon emissions by 17 5 billion metric tons by 2030 but cutting subsidies would doubtless trigger political resistance both from consumers who want cheap fuel and from the fossil fuel lobby that has long enjoyed inflated profits this makes it even more vital for the u s to buffer against such disruption by funding the transition in less resilient economies and protecting workers from the impacts of job loss or price spikes a parallel challenge for a global green new deal will be ensuring not only that the funding for projects is directed to poorer countries but also that those projects respect the ecological sovereignty and self determination of the most impacted communities pursuing a human rights based global gnd raises the question of climate colonialism according to georgetown philosophy professor olúfẹ mi o táíwò the rush for green development could spawn a new kind of resource curse if western governments and multinationals flock to the global south to for instance launch massive corporate solar farms or grab land for carbon offset projects designed to compensate for pollution generated elsewhere green new deal policies he argued in an op ed could empower communities on both sides of u s borders or they could promote climate colonialism through the deepening or expansion of foreign domination through climate initiatives climate justice advocates say green growth must involve democratizing the global green economy community control of climate mitigation projects and technology transfers that respect the land rights and social needs of frontline communities whatever the initial price tag champions of the global gnd say three things are certain that it can be financed through making the tax code fairer that the u s must support a parallel green transition in poorer countries and that in sheer cost benefit terms the benefits of avoiding total climate catastrophe go far beyond protecting the environment they could form the germ of a more equitable social system the international renewable energy agency estimates that expanding renewables to about two thirds of total energy supply would have a net positive impact on employment in 2050 in every region compared to the business as usual case along with significant improvements in social welfare measures driven by improvements in public health despite the clear rewards of green investment a massive economic transition program like the gnd could unravel without strong international cooperation affluent countries have over the years launched ambitious green growth plans or carbon tax schemes but their efforts have fallen short of their targets because they lacked sufficient funding or failed to implement structural reforms to overhaul their energy systems in the long term it will cost much less to transform the energy system than to do nothing launching a global gnd that pursues social equity and decarbonization in tandem hinges on the central concept of climate justice social protection and environmental protection are intertwined those two priorities are fused in one notable long term outcome of a green transition it pays for itself noting that energy costs decline as markets expand to a critical mass pollin says the financing should be constructed in a way that recognizes the long term cost savings which means over time it doesn t cost anything the benefits are even clearer when compared to rising cost of fossil fuels because we getting to the point at which it s more expensive to extract he added in the long term it will cost much less to transform the energy system than to do nothing but a global green new deal will require a big upfront investment before it starts paying for itself the u s now has a responsibility to deal with the global carbon burden by supporting the communities most at risk from the harms of fossil fuels and it can start by making a green new deal with the rest of the world before you go

mustafa chike obi just one month into the second term of president muhammadu buhari issues in the economy are once again on the front burners a former managing director of asset management corporation of nigeria amcon and managing partner alpha african advisory mr mustafa chike obi takes a critical look at the economy highlights its challenges and proffers solutions specifically chike obi faulted the economic recovery and growth plan ergp the economic blueprint of the government the economy according to him is not the priority of the president he speaks with kunle aderinokun and bamidele famoofo what have you been doing since you left as amcon managing director well as you know l work for a financial advisory company called alpha africa advisory we try to raise money for bigger world bank projects in nigeria we have found it very difficult to raise money in the last few years because many of the foreign companies don t find nigeria a very attractive destination for investment and that is the truth when you ask them why they mention a number of things they mention policy inconsistency managed foreign exchange regime security and the fact that nigerians are getting poorer and so the disposable stable income is not available so part of my mission in the last few years include my support for an alternative government in the person of atiku abubakar i realize we have to address so many issues and this government does not seem to be committed enough to address those issues and they seem more interested in congratulating themselves on how well they have done anybody that looks objectively at nigeria economically in the last four years cannot say we have done well so that is what l have been doing as you know l was the economic adviser to the atiku campaign and now that the campaign part of the election is over and we are in the legal arena i m now focusing on the economics and my business here as a financial analyst what are the things the government has not been doing well i always say unfortunately a modern economy is very complicated it is not something for amateurs to dabble into what you do in one place affects another place so we need to sit down to figure out what are our economic objectives and that comes from the president president should say what my vision of the economy is and then hire people to help him achieve that ambition i have not heard articulated any coherent economic vision by the president i hear things like i want foreign exchange stability that is not an economic vision foreign exchange stability is just a tool to an economic vision i have not heard any single coherent economic vision coming out of this government and i think that is a problem because once you have a vision then it is easy you get people who buy into that vision and those who are competent to accomplish that vision then it will not be difficult to execute but once you don t have a vision people would do their own thing cbn may do things that make sense to cbn ministry of budget and planning may do things that make sense to them while trade and investment will anything that makes sense to them but some of those things that make sense individually may not fit into a coherent plan so a tight fiscal policy would clash with a loose monetary policy and also a tight monetary policy may clash with a loose fiscal policy all those things can be assembled and the only person who can assemble them is the president but the president l m tired of saying this does not have a chief economic adviser mr dipeolu as competent as he may be is the chief economic adviser to the vice president his title is deputy chief economic adviser to the president because that is the way the presidency works how can an economy be such a priority and he does not have a chief economic adviser who coordinates your vision i think of all positions he should focus on this time around he must hire a chief economic adviser that coordinates all economic matters somebody he trusts somebody the nation trusts somebody that the international community can trust to me that is more important than the appointment of a chief of staff let s get a vision together so that what the cbn governor budget and planning and trade and investment do all fit into that vision as coordinated by the chief economic adviser who speaks for the president on economic matters i think that is a priority so that is one thing that has been done wrong by this administration and this cannot be blamed on the pdp it is entirely the fault of the president once we have that vision we can make projections l know what l want i want double digit growth tripling of our productivity and five to six million jobs a year created that s all l want other people can debate what they want but that is what mustafa chike obi wants once i can convince others that is what we need to do and why then anything fits into it then the next thing is to ask what monetary policy that would drive it what s the fiscal policy that would drive it what s the trade and investment policy that would drive it what s the plan that would drive it everything now fits in into the objectives it is from that objective you will get your foreign exchange policy your education policy infrastructure policy once you state what you are aiming at l think that is what we must be focused on may be it is three or four years too late but it is better late than never you have alleged that the government does not have any economic vision what s your take on the ergp which this government says is its own economic blueprint the ergp is a document that was championed by a man that l have a lot of respect for senator udoma udo udoma we were at king s college together we are friends he is a thorough professional and he meant well but udo udoma is a lawyer a very good lawyer he has a fantastic law firm and no matter how smart he is he is in an area where he has to learn a lot so with all due respect to him and this is not taking any shot at him i think the document should have been prepared first of all by the chief economic adviser to the president it should reflect the vision of the president i m talking about vision not execution when it is prepared outside the vision of the president it is necessarily in my opinion guessing what the president wants and you are trying to work around it so for example everyone on the economic team believes that the president wants a naira as strong as possible so they fashion all the theories around that but that is not an economic policy so when they say their aim is to have a gdp growth very modest they are anchoring it to some implied foreign exchange rate which will drive down the economy but i m saying let us convince the president that what matters is growth employment and productivity once he agrees we go back and say this is what applies so ergp for me is deficient not ambitious enough and it will not serve our purpose and again it is more like an execution of a document and not a vision what other things can the government do to grow the economy you must do many things we must grow our gdp by double digit we must be productive talking about productivity for example the yield of rice in nigeria is probably depending on who you are talking to is perhaps a third of the yield per hectare in thailand and yet we are competing in the same market you can jump around talking about how much rice you are producing but you are producing at a very inefficient level but l understand we cannot be productive immediately but we must get there the third thing is that we must employ our people contrary to what people say the uneducated unemployed youth is less dangerous than the educated unemployed youth the educated unemployed youth is the one that is organizing gangs to perpetrate crimes the uneducated ones cannot organise that level of crime so a lot of the crimes we are seeing are led by frustrated graduates so we must find employment for our people otherwise the money we spend on education especially tertiary education will be a waste we don t have much time to do it those are the things we must do once we agree we need experts to make them happen how do you grow gdp double digit and increase productivity i will give you an example i said this recently and everyone was laughing at me i said we should not buy any tailored cloth from abroad i picked tailoring for one reason i didn t pick tailoring because i want to ban clothes i picked tailoring because it will employ a lot of people it does not require a lot of capital training infrastructure you just need a sewing machine and the ability to cut clothes and sew it according to pattern it is something we can start with let s import the fabrics because fabric production cost money and when you look at clothes sewing and cutting and the fabrics constitute over 50 per cent of the cost of the cloth it s a way to start we can decide we want to be the sewing capital of africa we can easily become that in the next three years we can employ two million people in sewing easily but we have to learn skills after that i m going to furniture making import the woods if you want but the furniture that we use in this country especially in government offices should be made in nigeria it does not require that much infrastructure we can go from soft skills to harder ones i m not asking us to start making cars or computers in nigeria we can leave those for the japanese but we can compete with them in things like tailoring carpentry etc then we can go to shoe making we will be able to employ our youths while we grow our gdp when we do that and as we do it we will be able to afford more electricity roads etc but we have to start somewhere oil price hovers around 61 per barrel at the moment and analysts say they don t see it climb much higher in the medium to long term and nigeria s budget is benchmarked at 60 per barrel is this sustainable for the country let me say something l never understood since l came to nigeria why is the oil benchmark in the budget what does it matter i have never understood it you do a budget based on what you need and what do we need in this country let s assume a b c and d and they come at a certain cost then you ask yourself can l afford it and you say yes l can afford it because you have some money left over right you saved that money the other way round you say no l can t afford it then you ask yourself can l find a way to fund it if yes then you do it but if you can t look for the things to cut away from the budget that to me is how you do a budget so l don t see how the oil benchmark price comes into it rather than use the oil benchmark you can call up today the chicago mercantile exchange and they can give you a price that we can sell our daily oil production every three months because there is a forward price for oil if we want to sell 500million barrels in the next12 months we can have a fixed price as you make the money you deliver to pay if we actually want to use the benchmark we should not be guessing as we can use the forward price benchmark in the market why are we guessing if you give me 20minutes to call all the oil traders they will give the price of oil for the next five years we should hedge every year forward for us to have certainty if the price goes up or down we win all we are doing is locking the price each year and having certainty rather than dealing with fluctuations what s your position on the foreign exchange regime are you proposing a further devaluation of the naira i didn t say the naira should be devalued let me clarify what i m saying i said once we can establish the three things l have proposed i e growing the economy by double digit as soon as possible it won t happen tomorrow but we must get there if we agree to employ five to six million a year and become more productive the rest are just tools interest rate becomes a tool exchange rate becomes a tool any intelligent economist will tell you the way to go about these things once the president tells him those are the three things he wants this should include a policy on foreign exchange investment etc for example something as simple as anybody from the g 20 countries coming to nigeria does not need a visa but they will tell you we must reciprocate well if a policeman with a gun slaps you you don t reciprocate because he would shoot you and you would die you may find other ways of dealing with him you take the slap and go and complain somewhere but you don t reciprocate so when america says you don t come here without visa reciprocation is stupid we need america america does not need us but there are other ways to deal with america allow america to come to nigeria when he comes to the airport we would welcome him and he will spend his dollars here we should allow them to come with no visa as they are not interested in staying in our country so what i m saying is that policies should come out of the vision of the president and not the other way round i will tell you that when sanusi lamido sanusi was cbn governor he had a policy it s a one word policy stability he wanted financial system stability because there was a crisis he wanted foreign exchange stability interest rate stability and inflation stability that was his vision and he did those beautifully however after sanusi had achieved stability he should have moved on to growth but he didn t he stayed in stability what will you have done differently if you were the cbn governor i have said it several times i said it to jonathan okonjo iweala and even to the buhari government that the only thing that will save nigeria economically is a double digit growth so anything that is not supporting a double digit growth l would not do and everything that supports a double digit growth i would do what will support double digit growth lower interest rates and a weak currency will support double digit growth currency can either be strong appropriate or weak i m for the weak currency i want foreign goods to be so expensive that the middle class cannot afford it when i was growing up breakfast was ogi and akara now it is sausage and bacon it s nice i like sausage and bacon but does it develop nigeria no champagne was unheard of when growing up and everything we did to develop nigeria was in that period now to attend a party in lagos without champagne is almost like a failure so we will all have to make sacrifices to get to the goal but the goal has to be defined which is my problem right now we have been appreciating our currency every year it is not just stable but appreciating a stable currency will adjust by inflation every year you know why it has to adjust by inflation it s because if this cup of tea costs one dollar today it means it costs n360 so my inflation is 10 per cent this cup of tea as example from now will cost n396 due to increase of 10 percent but a cup of tea in america is still a dollar because you have no inflation so that n396 should be equal to the dollar but if it is not then l won t buy your tea at n396 i would take n360 of my money to buy a dollar and use the dollar to buy tea and save myself n36 so what happens to the man that is making tea in nigeria by the third year his tea should be at n500 per cup but the american tea is costing n360 then people will smuggle american tea atn360 and sell atn380 and make a profit meanwhile this man is trying to employ people and sell his tea at n500 he can t survive and that is the problem but if price of tea is adjusted by inflation he can sustain his business that s why all our businesses in nigeria that started well after the fifth year they are out of business because of competition from foreign businesses but an industry like banking that is not battling any foreign competition can stand in the face of rising inflation the target then should be to reduce inflation by efficiencies this comes from expertise and volume how does insecurity in the country affect the economy let me tell you something kidnapping before now was higher and then it came down now it is going back up emigration was high before and later people started coming back home now they are going back again the common denominator in those cycles is the economy if your economy is doing well the crime rate will drop kidnapping will drop and people will start coming back home and that is why l said we need to have a coherent policy you can choose to fight corruption and ignore the economy but by ignoring the economy you have created insecurity and crime now if he attacks security the economy will get worse the budget for police in new york is about 10billion a year which is half our budget security is not cheap you can say all you want but police are not getting paid if you see where they live it is squalor soldiers are saying they are not getting fed it is easy to say let us treat security but there is no money and the only way countries get money is by growing there gdp that is why l keep coming back to that if we grow our gdp we would solve a lot of these problems coming from lack of growth what s your take about the nation s tax regime i think the tax rate is too high but enforcement is too low enforcement comes from two things people feeling that they should pay because they are getting something from government so there is a moral side of taxation the other side is doing things that forces people to pay taxes on the rates side they are too high and on the enforcement side too low how do we improve enforcement like l said again revenue mobilisation is a big deal in nigeria today it is a big challenge in the budget i would propose the creation of ministry of revenue mobilisation i think it is that important and we should coordinate all the states because some overtax lagos state overtaxes but the people have no choice but l can bet that in the next 20 years businesses will start moving from lagos to friendlier states if the other states build infrastructure lagos state will be empty in the next 20 years unless they make changes in their tax rates for instance if we make the inner waterways usable and build ports across states and make the roads motor able lagos will be empty did you face any challenges that hindered you in any way as ceo of amcon well l defined the role of amcon very narrowly i didn t see amcon as that big institution in my head it had a very narrow job buy the non performing loans recapitalise the banks in other to avoid a banking crisis do your best to recover as much of the loans as you can what you can t recover the bank will pay in the long run that was the narrow definition and i stuck to it and l must say that there were some interference from the national assembly initially but part of it was their fault and mine i did not educate them enough about what amcon was doing but as we got to know each other better we got along very well and in the end the national assembly was very helpful to our cause they passed the amcon amendments act very fast and they did a very good job the national assembly was very helpful and the judiciary was extremely helpful the federal high court who had jurisdiction over amcon cases gave us everything we wanted they gave us judges to seal amcon cases it was wonderful the biggest problem we had was probably from the executive we are also members of the executive there was a lot of attempts to encroach on what we were doing at amcon even though they were not supposed to i remember the auditor general wanting to audit amcon while the law says he cannot audit it the law says they can approve the auditor and look at the result of the audit but never to audit amcon by themselves i don t want to pick names but there are a number of executive agencies that were problematic but in the end we worked it out because president goodluck jonathan was a very strong supporter of amcon whenever things get to his hearing he made the right calls he always went on the side of the law as far as l knew with amcon the other thing that i have always talked about is debtor not wanting to pay that is a natural thing and l don t think that is peculiar to nigeria our recovery rate was higher than other amcons in the world so the nigerian debtor was not as terrible as people said they would be those who could pay paid while those who could not pay but had the possibility of paying were accommodated under restructuring but some people just could not pay because they didn t have the money as 90 per cent of the problems was bad business crude oil price falling exchange rate falling having debt in dollars while revenue is in naira all of those things there were some frauds but very small so i tried hard not to blacklist many of them i tried to work with them because they are employing people and l thought employment was the most important thing that we need we kept most of the businesses alive because we thought there was a chance they would stay in business

canada s trade commissioner service offered via twitter this week to help executives struggling with this question what is a free trade agreement in that spirit let s revisit the subject of how one should interpret statistics canada s monthly labour force survey the lesson is mostly for currency traders who made some weird bets after statcan on friday reported that employment declined by 2 200 positions in june and the jobless rate increased to 5 5 per cent related stories the canadian dollar dropped about half a cent after the data were released which probably had something to do with traders wanting assets to purchase u s dollars since the value of the greenback jumped on the news that the u s economy in june added 224 000 jobs more than most analysts expected wall street rethought the likelihood of interest rate cuts this summer causing stock markets to tumble the calculation monetary stimulus is better for equities than full employment because it s 2019 but if part of the calculation is that the latest canadian numbers will trouble the bank of canada then some traders are likely going to lose some money i think currency markets totally missed the partly offsetting narrative that this is a very strong report derek holt a bank of nova scotia economist told clients in a note the jobs report was good not bad few of us listen but statcan encourages readers of the labour survey to pay attention to the trend not the month to month change which always comes with a huge margin of error the decline from may was too small on its own to say anything more than employment had plateaued at a high level the jobless rate was the second lowest recorded in the data set that goes back to 1976 so that s hardly a sign of weakness statcan s measure of the trend in hiring based on a calculation of the current month and the previous six months increased by almost 22 000 positions in june earlier this year when headline employment increased by an incredible 106 500 positions the trend reading rose by only 34 800 the economy is rarely as strong or as weak as the headlines and tweets on jobs day suggest canada s economy is essentially at full employment a situation where most people who want a job can get one the jobless rate rose because statcan counted more new people in the labour force than newly employed workers many economists interpret a growing workforce as a sign of confidence in the overall economy with the average pace of job growth still very strong in 2019 we do not see the modest pull back in employment as a sign of labour market softness said victoria clark an economist at citigroup inc the hiring numbers are the last significant indicator that bank of canada leaders will receive before they reset policy on july 10 and they cement the central bank s position as an outlier australia s central bank has been cutting interest rates the european central bank has made it clear that it is thinking about doing so and almost everyone assumes the u s federal reserve will lower its benchmark rate later this month in australia the unemployment rate has been climbing higher while inflation in europe and the u s remains weak the data warn that something is wrong it might seem odd but the bank of canada has been presented with little reason to follow its peers non energy exports surged 4 5 per cent in may the biggest monthly increase since july 2016 scotiabank s model of real time economic growth predicts gross domestic product will expand at annual rate of 2 7 per cent in the second quarter much faster than the boc assumed in april we see reasons for the bank to leave open the option that the next move might be a hike david watt an economist at hsbc in toronto told clients on july 5 watt s analysis has the boc leaving the policy rate unchanged through next year when weakness in the global economy will eventually force canadian policymakers to join the path taken by the australians americans and europeans but that would require a significant shift in domestic conditions the best information in the labour force survey is below the headlines the boc watches more granular indicators such as wage growth long term unemployment and the youth participation rate for signs of inflation pressure statcan said average hourly wages increased 3 8 per cent from june 2018 the biggest year over year increase since may 2018 the number of canadians in the labour force who reported being unemployed for more than 26 weeks shrunk to 155 400 the least since december 2008 and the youth participation rate climbed to 69 4 per cent the highest since august 2018 and above the historical average other central banks are worried about the outlook so the bank of canada will also be worried but few of the gauges on boc governor stephen poloz s dashboard are flashing warning signs the traders betting on lower interest rates in canada this year have set themselves up for disappointment email twitter kevinlibin copyright postmedia network inc 2019
home archives 2006 on 2019 the economic growth climate change conundrum in the years immediately preceding world war ii winston churchill is quoted as having said the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences world war ii purported to be a war to end all wars ended in 1945 after the usa dropped two nuclear bombs on japan it did not end wars but it did have huge consequences evidence of which is unfolding even today perhaps the greatest single consequence is the combination of growth of money and banking systems rampant exploitation of natural resources and the parallel growth of production consumption pollution of all sorts this in turn has spawned environmental and ecological consequences at a planetary scale with accompanying existential threats finance debt economic growth inequality a major fallout of world war ii was the formation in july 1944 of the bretton woods institutions the international monetary fund imf the international bank of reconstruction and development ibrd and the general agreement on tariff and trade gatt they created the financial order of the post war world and defined the rules boundaries and goal posts of financial and economic cooperation after reconstruction of war devastated europe the ibrd morphed into the world bank group which turned its attention to third world countries in 1995 the wto replaced the gatt the imf wb wto triad became the world s largest generator and provider of knowledge the fountain head of economic reform policies and programmes they prescribed economic reforms founded on the centrality of economic growth as measured principally by the rate of growth of the gdp this ideology for economic progress was taught in all major us and european and later in third world universities and created a multitude of indoctrinated economists of all nationalities who educated trained and advised the leaders and the elite of third world countries this ideology of economic growth on a corporate market consumer basis is neo liberalism promoted annually at the davos jamboree the bretton woods international financial institutions ifis were joined by banks like the asian development bank and african development bank and ifis from japan and european countries even lower tier ifi executives had access to the topmost echelons of governments hence ifis became the source of finance for development projects in the third world and also enablers for preparing project proposals and appointing consultants to educate and advise corruptible third world leaders to apply for and receive loans and solicit foreign investments thus banker driven debt economies expanded economic growth as a measure of national progress became the focus of economic thinking and was institutionalised in countries across the globe with impetus imparted and momentum maintained using the political economic clout of the imf wb and other ifis it was accepted worldwide because it suited the elite politician bureaucrat corporate nexus or pbc sometimes referred to as the deep state which has behind the screen control of governments of all countries admittedly much of the knowledge and finance provided for projects resulted in creation of infrastructural and other assets in third world countries but most of the accruing benefits went to economically better off sections of society with neglect of the poorer sections with grandiose plans for development calling for huge capital investments and loans from ifis available on pre condition of undertaking prescribed economic reforms many third world countries sank into debt some entered a debt trap when the outgo of interest on loans exceeded the revenue from projects plus export earnings overall this resulted in growing economic inequality within and between societies in admission of this an internal study group of the international monetary fund imf reported in july 2016 that their decades long advocacy and practice of economic reforms had serious failings the report is titled neoliberalism oversold with the boldfaced sentence instead of delivering growth some neoliberal policies have increased inequality thereby jeopardising durable expansion thomas piketty s 2013 incisive best seller capital in the twenty first century may possibly have triggered the imf admission need for a different economic model at a recent meeting of the imf and wb efforts were made to play down fears of a slowing global economy due a deteriorating trade climate the key phrases are fears of a slowing global economy and deteriorating trade climate the questions which arise are why should there be fear and who feels fear also questions are about what effect a deteriorating global trade climate stated to be principally about the economic conflict between the usa and china may have on the majority of the 7 2 billion global human inhabitants since the talk is global let s view other global matters the global economy being the sum of the economies of the countries on the globe and the economy of a country being the sum of the economies of its constituent states or regions it follows that at the very root of the global economy lies the economy of every human household taking the argument down to the household is justified by the etymology of the word economy which is from the greek word oikonomia referring to household management and thrift with eight of the world s wealthiest persons owning as much wealth as the bottom 50 per cent of humanity there appears huge justification for an alternative economic paradigm to replace the current one of unending year on year economic growth which has caused unjust and growing inequality within and between nations leading to political military economic confrontation between nations and social unrest within nations current economic model put simply even simplistically the current economic model is founded upon the need for growth of the national economy as a means to generate wealth gross domestic product gdp is a measure of total economic production representing the market value of all goods and services including personal consumption institutional purchases and sales and adding exports and subtracting imports gdp is generally accepted as a comprehensive yardstick to assess a nation s economic growth and its year on year growth indicates economic health the generation of wealth money precisely by economic growth accrues to the upper economic echelons and this is expected to trickle down to people who live if that s the right word in the lowest economic layers of society this has not happened in any country rather economic disparity has widened politics is slave to economics every government attempts to gain political advantage by claiming a higher gdp growth rate as demonstrative of better performance opposition political parties always attempt to play down the government s performance by contesting these figures even left oriented economists question the validity of seven per cent gdp growth rate claimed by the bjp led nda 2 government but do not question the economic model thus economists across the political spectrum have been and are on the gdp growth rate bandwagon and routinely quarrel about figures of the gdp growth rate questioning the computation methods or the validity of the statistical data used for computation there appears to be no understanding that the economic model has failed to reach economic benefit to the people at the bottom of the socio economic heap of humanity political promises notwithstanding apart from the economic model generating economic disparity and social unrest it is unsustainable from other perspectives politics is driven by an economic model that cannot address the here and now economic needs of food shelter health education jobs of vast numbers hence elections and voting are a cruel charade a drama scripted by parties and persons across the political spectrum to distract attention from the real life economic miseries of the invisible millions with promises of good days in the future the key agenda must be to accelerate growth is an article by none less than former chairman of the economic advisory council to india s prime minister the title and content of which indicates the mindset elections change governments but the economic growth ideology remains and its implementation maintains momentum even accelerates politics remains slave to economics and the pbc nexus remains in control regardless of which political party or tall leader is in power economic growth existential threat continuous economic growth year upon year is growth compounded and the size of an economy growing at say seven per cent would double in ten years the energy demanded acquired and consumed to enable such economic growth would also approximately double former rbi governor c rangarajan said in 2016 the potential to grow at 8 to 9 per cent at least for a decade exists we have to make it happen thus by 2026 with the government s concerted effort the size of the economy the energy consumed and global warming gw gases emitted for such growth would have more than doubled for india alone at the global level this worldwide energy mostly fossil fuel consumption year upon year which is integral to economic growth has resulted in atmospheric co2 rising to 415 ppm a level not exceeded for the last three million years this is accelerating gw and climate change cc which are existential threats to all life forms the direct cause and effect relationship between economic growth and gw cc is undeniable maintaining corporate control india s new economic policy formulated in 1991 by the then union finance minister dr manmohan singh was specifically about the imf wb orchestrated economic reform including structural adjustment all based firmly upon unending economic growth nep 1991 was effectively furthered by thousands of opinion policy and decision makers in governments and indian institutions of higher education who were trained in foreign universities and wb institutes these persons have had and continue to have easy access to and disproportionate influence in the corridors of power in central and state governments regardless of the political party in power such trained persons were and are in positions of power at various levels in various ministries and they promote the mind set of ideas policies proposals plans and projects to yield targeted rates of gdp growth so that india may progress this mind set has proposed and promoted capital and machine intensive mega projects which need to acquire land water and mineral resources for this state and or central governments with the help from the deep state circumvent bypass or amend laws enacted to protect people or the environ ment from such projects but governments justify such projects by touting economic growth a sales pitch which has always satisfied all political persuasions on the ground challenges by affected popu lations to such projects are met with police action in favour of the corporations and against protestors litigation is difficult and expensive and out of reach of poor project affected people and in any case usually fail sometimes the affected populations merely demand that extant laws be implemented faithfully but govern ments usually win against the people and corporations have their way people s resistance to amendments to weaken such laws has even been labelled as naxal or maoist to criminalise legitimate protest and individuals who help generally illiterate people affected by the project are subjected to slapp or charged under draconian laws like the uapa the message as to who is the boss is unequivocal the same economic policy has gained momentum with successive governments and under the bjp led nda government starting 2014 its implementation has been intensified across sectors over the years successive governments have sent top ministers travelling along with corporate honchos to the annual world economic forum at davos to decide how to spur economic growth and how to defeat economic competitors even as they propose sdgs and negotiate carbon credits notwith standing the wisdom brought home from davos is that worldwide economic growth is uncertain and growing economic inequality and climate change are worrying issues however questioning the economic growth paradigm is economic blasphemy economist dr rathin roy believes that india s rapid growth has been essentially powered by its top 100 million citizens the leading indicators of economic prosperity he says are things that these indians consume cars 2 wheelers air conditioners and so on having had their fill of home made goods they have now moved to imported luxuries foreign holidays and italian kitchens for example money generated by gdp growth is used for industrialised production of goods and services which depends upon extraction and consum ption of free natural capital of resources like minerals fuel fresh water and land this year on year unending gdp growth demands year on year increased consumption of natural capital while the production processes produce more and more pollution of land water and air unending consumption of goods and services is highly energy intensive and directly connected with energy use burning of fossil fuels principally oil it generates ghgs and increases gw however the only thing that economists appear to fear is a slowing global economy because the rate at which goods and services are purchased consumed is flagging corporate influence on economic policy has resulted in capital intensive mega projects designed to boost gdp growth which have countrywide and worldwide effects the reality of sustained public protests against these projects is a part of the worry brought home from davos still rather than addressing the causes of protests state and central govern ments influenced by the pbc nexus ignore rubbish or suppress them by police beatings or firings charging protestors with war against the state and sedition and jailing them under draconian laws or trumped up charges another method of the pbc nexus maintaining control is the creation of the revolving door by which key executives or scientists in industrial commercial corporations are manoeuvred into government administrative posts where they influence policy and seamlessly revert to the parent corporate sector after a tenure climate change on the one hand the ministry of environment and forests moef has been re named with climate change cc added to its designation so now moef cc and on the other this same ministry is part of the pbc nexus to slacken environmental laws rules and regulations so as to enable extractive and manufacturing industries and the hospitality industry to expand into new regions and generate profits this increases gdp and boosts economic growth but it is oblivious to the resulting intensification of gw and cc it is learned that scientists retiring or leaving the moeff cc are not replaced by scientists but by bureaucrats who cannot apply scientific rigour to environmental problems but uncritically obey bureaucratic and political dictats making a joke of environmental protection in 2008 the prime minister s council on climate change government of india issued a 56 page national action plan on climate change napcc it states emphasising the overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth rates to raiseliving standards the plan identifies measures that promote our development objectives while also yielding co benefits for addressing climate change effectively and outlines eight missions and three programs for implementation the napcc suffers from a fundamental conflict between the priority of maintaining high economic growth rates which do not raise living standards but increase economic disparity even while enhancing the ecological sustainability of india s development path as demonstrated below maintaining high economic growth rates raising gdp growth rates involves not merely higher consumption but growing rates of consumption of all sorts of goods and services this will raise demand and consumption of oil and inevitably result in increased ghg emissions and consequent increased gw promoting the present development objectives which are based upon economic growth actually defeat measures to reduce ghg emissions and reduce the intensity of the inevitable effects of climate change this is incompatible with yielding co benefits for addressing climate change effectively the present economic policy and cc are incompatible bed mates the former cannot sleep with the window open and the latter cannot sleep with the window closed trying to tackle cc while actually working to sustain rapid economic growth is as illogical as trying to mop a floor dry without turning off the tap the economic growth ideology is clearly unsustainable and inconsistencies in the overview principles and approach of napcc display a regrettable myopia in policy consequences the current economic model of endless year on year consumption driven production of goods and services taken at the national or global level has serious downstream effects drawing endlessly on the natural capital of primary mineral and other finite resources for projects to boost economic growth inevitably depletes it in turn it adversely affects the forests rivers and lakes land and oceans the ecological capital which depletes as natural capital and ecological capital are depleted by projects designed for the production consumption treadmill there is inevitable effect on people through displacement and loss of livelihood which destroys or adversely modifies the social structure of communities and families creating social tensions and unrest peace in society is social capital since development of any sort can only be successful in a peaceful society but the sacrosanct economic growth paradigm results in loss of social capital and this is evidenced by the glaring growing economic suffering and social unrest in urban rural and forest areas the divergence between money growing exponentially due to year on year economic growth and energy availability remaining stagnant or reducing can result in collapse of the financial system ominous signs of which are manifesting in different ways yet economists of all political persuasions willing prisoners within their ivory tower of economic growth urge the government of the day to adopt urgent measures to increase consumption of goods and services and strive for ever higher growth world leaders are uncomprehending or ignorant of the cause and effect relationship between economic policies and gw and cc they are unable to relate obvious negative inter societal and intra societal consequences with economic growth policies being helpless in the stranglehold of the neo liberal pbc deep state gw and cc is a major consequence of the economic growth paradigm homo sapiens has brought itself along with a host of other species to the brink of a great extinction the way forward it is not difficult to understand that tackling cc threats is priority one among a list of world wide socio political imperatives survival is not possible without protection preservation and conservation of natural resources and bio diversity for egalitarian provision of the basic needs of water food and energy clothing and shelter and health education welfare and employment for all emphasising the word all this is notwithstanding that tackling cc faces strong opposition from the ruling us administration and ignorance indifference opposition among most other governments worldwide since they all represent the interests of their respective pbc nexus more than that of the people whom they represent defeating the entrenched ideology of economic growth involves organising socio political initia tives to give primacy to sectors such as energy food water shelter jobs and employment health and education perhaps the most prominent is a political initiative in the usa called the green new deal which bring economics to heel in the larger interest of human societies the gnd will convert the old gray economy into a new sustainable economy that is environmentally sound economically viable and socially responsible it seeks to solve the climate crisis by combining quick action to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 along with an economic bill of rights the gnd sets a target year and proposes the way forward to meet that target unlike the sdgs which actually encourage economic growth proposed at davos the gnd is practical clear headed and socially responsible and deserves the most urgent study in all societies for implementation leaders and opinion makers in societies need to acquire the practical wisdom to understand that climate change due to global warming is an existential threat to most living species and certainly to human societes the threat is growing not receding measures based on that understanding need implementation to mitigate the effects of climate change and find an easier transition to so called deep adaptation necessary for species survival solutions for mitigation and adaptation as a survival route for human societies clearly lies in rejecting the evil of unending economic growth and adopting non fossil fuel based technologies our lives and the lives of future generations depend on it s g vombatkere was commissioned as an officer into the corps of engineers madras sappers in 1962 in 1993 the president of india awarded him the visishta seva medal

trumpâ s 2020 budget proposal reflects another significant increase in military spending along with corresponding cuts in spending by federal agencies tasked with the responsibility for providing critical services and income support policies for working class and poor people trumpâ s call for budget cuts by federal agencies is mirrored by the statutorily imposed austerity policies in most states and many municipalities those cuts represent the continuing imposition of neoliberal policies in the u s even though the â aâ word for austerity is almost never used to describe those policies yet austerity has been a central component of state policy at every level of government in the u s and in europe for the last four decades in europe as the consequences of neoliberal policies imposed on workers began to be felt and understood the result was intense opposition however in the u s the unevenness of how austerity policies were being applied in particular the elimination or reduction in social services that were perceived to be primarily directed at racialized workers political opposition was slow to materialize today however relatively privileged workers who were silent as the neoliberal â washington consensusâ was imposed on the laboring classes in the global south â through draconian structural adjustment policies that result in severe cutbacks in state expenditures for education healthcare state employment and other vital needs â have now come to understand that the neoliberal program of labor discipline and intensified extraction of value from workers did not spare them the deregulation of capital privatization of state functions â from road construction to prisons the dramatic reduction in state spending that results in cuts in state supported social services and goods like housing and access to reproductive services for the poor â represent the politics of austerity and the role of the neoliberal state this materialist analysis is vitally important for understanding the dialectical relationship between the general plight of workers in the u s and the bipartisan collaboration to raid the federal budget and to reduce social spending in order to increase spending on the military this perspective is also important for understanding the imposition of those policies as a violation of the fundamental human rights of workers the poor and the oppressed for the neoliberal state the concept of human rights does not exist as i have called to attention before a monumental rip off is about to take place once again both the democrats and republicans are united in their commitment to continue to feed the u s war machine with dollars extracted â to the tune of 750 billion dollars â from the working class and transferred to the pockets of the military industrial complex the only point of debate is now whether or not the pentagon will get the full 750 billion or around 733 billion but whether it is 750 billion or 733 billion the one sector that is not part of this debate is the public the attention of the public has been adroitly diverted by the absurd reality show that is russiagate but this week even though the budget debate has been disappeared by corporate media congress is set to begin debate on aspects of the budget and specifically on the national defense authorization act ndaa raising the alarm on this issue is especially critical at this moment as tensions escalate in the persian gulf the corporate media is once again abdicating its public responsibility to bring unbiased objective information to the public and instead is helping to generate support for war with iran the democrats who have led the way with anti iran policies over the last few decades will be under enormous pressure not to appear to be against enhancing military preparedness and are likely to find a way to give trump and the pentagon everything they want support for human rights and support for empire is an irreconcilable contradiction the assumption of post war capitalist order was that the state would be an instrument to blunt the more contradictory aspects of capitalism it would regulate the private sector provide social welfare support to the most marginal elements of working class and create conditions for full employment this was the keynesian logic and approach that informed liberal state policies beginning in the 1930s the idea of reforming human rights fits neatly into that paradigm as seen a stateâ s legitimacy was based on the extent to which it recognized protected and fulfilled the human rights of all its citizens and residents those rights included not only the right to information assembly speech and to participation in the national political life of the nation but also the right to food water healthcare education employment substantial social security throughout life and not just as a senior citizen the counterrevolutionary program of the late 60s and 70s especially the turn to neoliberalism which began in the 70s would reject this paradigm and redefine the role of the state the obligation of the state to recognize protect and fulfill human rights was eliminated from the role of the state under neoliberalism today the consequences of four decades of neoliberalism in the global south and now in the cosmopolitan north have created a crisis of legitimacy that has made state policies more dependent on force and militarism than in any other time including the civil war and the turmoil of the 1930s the ideological glue provided by the ability of capitalism to deliver the goods to enough of the population which guaranteed loyalty and support has been severely weakened by four decades of stagnant wages increasing debt a shrinking middle class obscene economic inequality and never ending wars that have been disproportionately shouldered by the working class today contrary to the claims of capitalism to guarantee the human right to a living wage ensuring â an existence worthy of human dignity â the average worker is making adjusted for inflation less than in 1973 i e some 46 years ago 140 million are either poor or have low income 80 living paycheck to paycheck 34 million are still without health insurance 40 million live in â official poverty â and more in unofficial poverty as measured by alternative supplemental poverty spm and more than half of those over 55 years old have no retirement funds other than social security in a report philp alston the unâ s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights points out that the us is one of the worldâ s wealthiest countries it spends more on national defense than china saudi arabia russia the united kingdom india france and japan combined however that choice in public expenditures must be seen in comparison to the other factors he lays out us infant mortality rates in 2013 were the highest in the developed world americans can expect to live shorter and sicker lives compared to people living in any other rich democracy and the â health gapâ between the us and its peer countries continues to grow us inequality levels are far higher than those in most european countries in terms of access to water and sanitation the us ranks 36th in the world the youth poverty rate in the united states is the highest across the oecd with one quarter of youth living in poverty compared to less than 14 across the oecd this is the backdrop and context for the budget â debateâ and trumpâ s call to cut spendings to departments of housing and urban development education labor health and human services the environmental protection agency and even the state department the u s could find 6 trillion dollars for war since 2003 and 16 trillion to bail out the banks after the financial sector crashed the economy but it canâ t find money to secure the human rights of the people this is the one sided class war that we find ourselves in a war with real deaths and slower systematic structural violence neither the democrats nor the republicans can be depended on to secure our rights or protect the world from the u s atrocities that responsibility falls on the people who reside at the center of the empire to not only struggle for ourselves but to put a brake on the empireâ s ability to spread death and destruction across the planet source url for african americans in particular neoliberalism has meant jobs lost hollowed out communities as industries relocated first to the south and then to mexico and china the disappearance of affordable housing schools and hospital closings infant and maternal mortality at global south levels and mass incarceration as the unskilled low wage black labor has become economically redundant this is the backdrop and context for the budget â

tokyo the once obscure school of macroeconomic thought known as modern monetary theory mmt has been attracting a lot of attention lately some us progressives such as representative alexandria ocasio cortez aoc and economists like james k galbraith now advocate including mmt in the policy conversation while others including kenneth rogoff dismiss it as problematic and even dangerous building on abba lerner s theory of functional finance mmt essentially argues that countries that issue their own currencies can never run out of money in the way private businesses can for us progressives like aoc and presidential candidate bernie sanders this implies that the federal reserve could print large amounts of money to fund initiatives with major long term benefits such as a job guarantee program or public infrastructure projects because the united states can borrow in its own currency the logic goes the surge in public sector debt would not pose any real danger to the economy 1 some mmt advocates including stephanie kelton a former economic adviser to sanders point to japan as proof that the approach works despite high public debt its economy is steadily recovering and standards of living are high moreover mmt advocates point out japan s expansionary monetary policies a central feature of prime minister shinzo abe s economic revitalisation strategy abenomics have not generated a much feared surge in inflation even within japan some argue that there is no need for a consumption tax hike to fund public spending but there is a serious problem with this logic japan s government is not as heavily indebted as is generally believed though japan s gross debt to gdp ratio at 240 per cent is the highest in the developed world what really matters for the government just like for private firms is the net debt to gdp ratio which accounts for real and financial assets and japan s public companies have very large real assets in fact by this measure japan is about on par with the us and doing much better than france and germany according to the international monetary fund s october 2018 fiscal monitor report managing public wealth further challenging kelton s assessment japan s primary balance has improved under abenomics thanks to its economic recovery this does not mean that mmt has no merit in japan or elsewhere in its campaign to increase consumption taxes japan s ministry of finance mof drilled into the public psyche the concept of ricardian equivalence a government cannot stimulate consumer demand with debt financed spending because people assume that whatever is gained now will be offset by higher taxes due in the future it was this campaign that drove the mof constantly to advertise the 240 per cent figure mmt can challenge this strict ricardian belief drawing attention to the potential of deficit financing say to boost employment through targeted social spending and indeed olivier blanchard and takeshi tashiro have already proposed using limited deficit financing to help bring japan s interest rates up to zero at a time when the government s borrowing costs are low and the effectiveness of monetary policy is weak implementing such a policy successfully however would demand careful attention to inflationary risks the current deflationary phase will not last forever eventually supply constraints will be reached and inflation will return if the government has been engaging in excessive deficit financed spending once inflation is triggered it could quickly spin out of control mmt lacks any safeguard against that outcome unlike for example the fiscal theory of the price level which expressly counts on an independent central bank to manage inflation in fact supplying money with a constant nominal interest rate as mmt seems to prescribe would be the worst thing to do during an inflationary period because the nominal market interest rate would probably be higher than the policy rate when discussing mmt i cannot help but recall goethe s poem the sorcerer s apprentice the sorcerer leaves his apprentice alone to carry out his chores rather than perform his duties as expected the apprentice decides to use the sorcerer s magic commanding a broom to carry buckets of water to fill a cauldron it helps for a while in fact for quite a long time but eventually the cauldron begins to overflow flooding the room and the apprentice cannot get the broom to stop adding more water when he splits the broom with an axe each piece becomes a new one fetching water at twice the speed just short of catastrophe the sorcerer returns and sets the situation right policymakers who recklessly implement mmt may find like the sorcerer s apprentice that once the policies are set in motion they will be difficult to stop and while a central bank can with the requisite authority and independence potentially step in to save the day it is no all powerful sorcerer koichi hamada is professor emeritus at yale university and a special

via gefira org the order of the current problems laid down below is random hard to say which factor will be the next catalyst maybe all or several at the same time decide for yourself 1 unresolved political conflicts ask yourself which conflicts have been finally resolved since the 2007 crisis in the middle east in the balkans in the former soviet union in ukraine the proxy war of the eu against russia in afghanistan pakistan libya in sudan there is no end to this list the uno nato the international coalitions for the defence of human rights or interventions of the major powers for the defence of their own interests in a region e g russia and the usa in syria only bring more unrest and destabilization in the individual regions and cost the western world pots of money aggressive foreign policy by the great powers and threats to geopolitics will continue to put a massive strain on the world s economy and pose a risk to investors 2 the most powerful countries in the world have been arming themselves for years world military spending increased by 2 6 percent last year to around 1 82 trillion a new high since 1988 the mainstream media unlike in the sixties of the last century are reluctant to talk about the new cold war because they are fully engaged in creating the delusion of a united peaceful humanity 3 since its inception marxism has been an ideology that has not inscribed itself as anything positive in the history of any country because of marxist ideas more than 100 million people died in europe in the 20th century according to the calculations of the french historian stéphane courtois the western elites remain untouched by this and continue to pay homage to the fathers of destruction using their language their ideas speaking of internationalism equality of all peoples and races unification of all nations support for the poor who are supposed to reach the same level as the rich support for the people who disregard the genuine values of western civilization lgbt and the new letters constantly being added citizens of eu countries and others who do not believe in the harmfulness of such ideology should rather take to heart the latest communist miracle venezuela otherwise they will soon be painfully confronted with the consequences of the immigration policy the green lie the wrong social policy which does not care about just redistribution of wealth and the whole wrong foreign and energy policy of the left green scene even now the middle and lower classes in france italy and other countries are suffering because of the left green ideology that for years has been causing their purchasing power and standard of living to fall see yellow vests 4 the people who have been a major force for the development of the modern world for 200 years the white people in europe america russia and south africa and the indigenous peoples of the most creative nations in asia japan and south korea are shrinking the new patents scientific discoveries and industrial innovations will not come from africa or southeast asia the immigrants will without however exerting a positive influence on the development of western thought 5 many countries are replenishing their gold reserves especially china russia and turkey all three countries will become independent of the dollar in the near future they must be able to defend the value of their currencies in the event of the next conflict which is why they are increasing their reserves of the yellow metal as the next crisis approaches the price of gold also rises 6 cryptocurrencies are gaining in importance as safe havens large corporations facebook and amazon and states venezuela are also creating new cryptocurrencies which can be interpreted as distrust of the existing financial system which may soon collapse we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us 7 the mountain of debt is growing all over the world the indebtedness of individual countries and their citizens has long since exceeded the criteria set by the imf and other institutions example japan s national debt is 236 4 of gdp this means that the entire japanese economy would have to work for 2364 years in order to completely transfer the proceeds to the creditors of the japanese state in order to pay off the national debt while according to the euro convergence criteria the debt should not exceed 60 of gdp in 2017 the national debt of greece was 181 8 and that of italy 131 8 the economic crisis in southern europe did not end it was only swept under the carpet for a short time the global banking system is so closely networked and filled with opaque financial products even more so than during the 2007 crisis in which over indebtedness is hidden that now a small collapse for example in the italian banking sector will drag everyone into the abyss 8 a prelude to recession is also the so called yield curve which shows the ratio between interest rates on bonds with short and long maturities at present the yield curve of us government bonds is inverted i e short term interest rates rise above long term which is considered by economic experts to be one of the safest indicators of future economic weakness 9 while the stock markets are in euphoria there are being published the worst indicators of economic activity for years pmi they are doing particularly badly recently in asia and australia south korean exports have been recognised for years as another early indicator of economic trends and as they are also falling this points at least to a recession in world trade 10 the environment has long since reached the limits of its capacity for 20 or 30 years the dirtiest most polluting resource and people destroying industry has been consistently relocated to emerging countries and the third world now these countries are standing up and no longer want to be trash cans and cheap producers on the planet in 2016 the eu shipped 1 6 million tons of garbage to the largest people s republic of asia and now the government in beijing no longer wants to take over the garbage dumps from the west the environmental problems in china will affect entire value chains all over the world 11 the world s water reserves are shrinking global freshwater consumption will increase by 300 in the next 30 years in the year 2025 3 1 billion people will be affected by water shortages the battle for water is the background to many political and ethnic conflicts see israel and palestine sudan and other african countries global warming has been affecting agricultural production in europe russia brazil and the usa for years as a result the prices of food and tap water are rising which in the long run will lead to protests and conflicts in detroit alone the cost of unpaid water bills was 89 million dollars by 2014 12 the ecb and the central bank of japan have reached the limits of their stimuli they are left with only tricks such as the introduction of the minus interest rate which will ruin pensioners savings why is mario draghi talking about lower interest rates and other ecb stimuli now that the european economy is supposedly flourishing is he feeling the coming crisis 13 it s not about being clairvoyants it s about learning from history what does the record of economic cycles show us an amazing fact we are in the middle of the longest economic boom in history is it not wishful thinking that it will continue for a long time to come

carl dunlap and sommer johnson are pictured in may at the home they rent in douglasville georgia photo by elijah nouvelage for the washington post sommer johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year she was engaged working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance s mother died a week before their wedding day triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am said johnson 39 who lives in douglasville georgia an atlanta suburb i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever the economic expansion this week became the longest in u s history surpassing the 1990s boom which lasted exactly a decade the stock market is at record levels with the dow jones industrial average closing at a new high wednesday ahead of the july 4 holiday and president donald trump has made the economy s strong performance a centerpiece of his re election campaign but this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles leaving many americans in a vulnerable position this is a two tier recovery said matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs about 60 percent of americans have benefited financially he said while 40 percent have not the 40 percent which mish calls the lower tier have seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt they tend not to own homes or many stocks in discussions with 30 americans unable to pay all of their bills a clear pattern emerged most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss cancer car trouble or storm damage the extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills and they never fully rebounded economists fear such precarious financial situations put many americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the great recession so many americans are living paycheck to paycheck said signe mary mckernan vice president of the center of labor human services and population at the urban institute we are headed toward a political crisis if not an economic one their vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors first the average american family has yet to recover fully from the crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year while wage growth has accelerated in recent months especially for the lowest paid workers families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing half of u s jobs pay less than 18 58 an hour and more than a third pay less than 15 which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future trump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more americans up financially including blue collar workers the formerly incarcerated and minorities in contrast democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality how to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race just because folks on wall street think things are fine doesn t mean most americans feel like things are fine said ray boshara director of the center for household financial stability at the federal reserve bank of st louis when every day is a rainy day for millions of families things are not fine to get by americans have borrowed heavily in recent years total u s household debt is now 13 7 trillion surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms according to the federal reserve bank of new york the surge in debt this time around is for cars and college not mortgages johnson knows these issues all too well her family of five including two teenagers and an infant daughter was making it on her 31 000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband s part time job as a clerk but it took longer to sell her mother in law s house than the couple expected the modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out but the bills for the funeral carrying the extra house rent health insurance and the new baby kept coming johnson s husband carl dunlap has applied repeatedly for full time jobs but has not been able to get one he picked up as many extra hours as he could at work but it wasn t enough already in debt for college and a used volkswagen passat she bought in 2017 johnson turned to friends and family for help but she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the 350 a month auto loan she picked day care and her family lost a vehicle she recalls the exact moment it happened 10 p m on a thursday night in early march she saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living room window and ran outside barefoot i just stood there and watched it go which was tough johnson said that was the first car i ever bought for myself and we needed it the couple carpool to work now trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the vw that is no longer in their possession older and wealthier and usually white americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession as home prices and stocks have soared in contrast data from the fed and the credit score company equifax show that families of color younger americans born after 1970 and households earning less than 60 000 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis and they tend to carry heavy debt loads often taking out loans for college which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy or loans to pay bills which can put them further behind the prevailing view among wall street investors and washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low meaning most people can make their monthly payments credit quality is about as good as i ve ever seen it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low income households certainly nothing compared to times past but boshara of the st louis fed pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year the opposite of what wall street expected in good economic times four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills despite the strong economy according to a quarterly survey by ubs that has shown no improvement since 2014 and looking at how households

with the year now halfway over 2019 has shaped up as a solid period for the economy and a good time for americans to gain ground on their finances jobs are plentiful stock and housing prices are rising and both inflation and interest rates remain tame not everyone is prospering but the overall momentum is favorable the second half of 2019 could look a lot like the first but with increasing political rhetoric as the presidential race shifts into high gear here are some likely money themes over the remaining six months of the year 1 tracking the expansion the economy has grown for 120 months now through june matching the longest expansion ever even with first quarter gross domestic product notching an impressive 3 1 uptick speculation will continue on just how long the current cycle can last the short answer is that it can keep going indefinitely as there s no immutable rule about the duration of expansions however economists and others will continue to look for indications of trouble headlines tend to play up signs of the next downturn especially as the business cycle continues to mature noted jim glassman head of commercial banking at jpmorgan chase he cited a 2 2 drop in industrial production so far this year as one worrisome signal though not one that he expects will push the economy into recession the economic tea leaves are of particular interest with the presidential election coming up if the expansion stays on course that will favor president donald trump and other incumbents 2 positive investment returns not everyone has a stake in the stock or housing markets but those who do are faring well stock market benchmarks such as the standard poor s 500 index have been flirting with and hitting record highs fueled by strong profits the s p 500 was up nearly 20 so far this year through july 4 housing also has appreciated though not nearly as much average prices in 20 large metro areas tracked by s p corelogic case shiller were up a bit more than 1 so far this year through april in the absence of war worsening trade tensions or other surprises the second half of 2019 could remain favorable especially with interest rates and inflation under control stock prices are due for a swoon they often come in september or october but the bull market should remain intact as long as the economy continues to grow in fact years like 2019 that precede presidential election years tend to be strong like the current economic cycle the ongoing 10 year upward trend for stock prices is among the longest on record it will end eventually but probably not this year 10 years later afters stock market crash here s what we still don t get 3 promises promises with the presidential election campaign swinging into high gear candidates will advance proposals that could greatly affect your finances examples include student debt forgiveness plans tax credits for renters wealth taxes and even slavery reparations many such proposals share a common goal of trying to narrow the nation s rich poor gap but they come with a cost aside from the difficulty of deciding who should qualify for some of these benefits such programs could be expensive the national debt already exceeds 22 trillion one campaign promise you probably won t hear is how to get all that red ink under control few candidates have put social security and medicare front and center among their campaign pledges even though both systems are under financial stress the longer we wait to solve these issues the more difficult the fixes will be i don t think presidential candidates have really engaged on those issues at this point said andrew eschtruth a spokesman for the retirement research center at boston college one exception he said is democratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders who has proposed expanded benefits as well as increased tax revenue mainly from higher earners to help shore up social security s finances 4 retirement changes possible no major social security reforms appear in the works for the rest of this year but some modest retirement tweaks could be in order for example the u s house of representatives passage of the secure act in may with broad bipartisan support raises the potential for expansion of 401 k style plans the legislation would make it easier for smaller employers to offer these workplace benefits and extend the programs to part time workers among 401 k participants responding to a recent charles schwab survey an overwhelming majority described these plans as an essential workplace incentive the programs were cited as a must have benefit by 87 of participants trailing only health insurance at 89 incidentally survey respondents on average cited 1 7 million as the magic savings number that workers should try to accumulate for retirement most americans aren t anywhere close no regrets 5 ways to avoid regret with social security retirement planning 5 mostly stable interest rates trump has called for lower interest rates to keep the economic momentum going he might get his wish with at least one federal reserve interest rate cut over the second half of 2019 but that won t drastically alter the current landscape of mostly stable rates and inflation mark vaselkiv a chief investment officer for t rowe price described the current climate as one characterized by stable interest rates and mostly flat bond prices and yields in a commentary he said he considered a quarter point fed rate cut as increasingly likely in coming months all that suggests conventional loans will remain reasonably inexpensive for people with sufficiently good credit scores to obtain one not everyone is so fortunate access to affordable credit remains elusive for many americans who often must resort to high cost payday and auto title loans some 121 million americans have subprime scores and 45 million are credit investible with no history reported credit bureau experian access to credit is one indicator of having or lacking middle class status reach wiles at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or 602 444 8616
record long economic expansion and gold ladies and gentlemen it has finally happened the current expansion already goes on for 121 months becoming the longest economic boom in the us history should we celebrate now or should we worry as all good things come to an end and whatever lasts long ends up even faster we invite you to read our today s article which assesses the vitality of the current expansion and find out whether the u s economy in a good shape or on the edge of collapse and what all of this implies for the gold market ladies and gentlemen it has finally happened the current expansion already goes on for 121 months which means that the previous record of 120 months is now history thus it has become the longest economic boom in the u s history should we celebrate now or should we worry as all good things come to an end and whatever lasts long ends up even faster is the u s economy in a good shape or on the edge of collapse let s make an assessment first of all the gdp growth is at a robust pace of 3 percent while the unemployment rate is at 3 6 percent a 50 year low as one can see in the chart below it does not look like any replay of the great recession does it actually the rate of employment growth is exceptionally rich much stronger that the mere gdp growth would predict chart 1 the real gdp growth red line left axis in y o y and the unemployment rate green line right axis u3 in from q1 2007 to q1 2019 moreover inflation is slightly below 2 percent which is definitely not a problem for the economy while the stock market is up by more than 50 percent since 2016 as the chart below shows actually solid gdp growth and low inflation constitute goldilocks economy which is welcomed by the wall street we have analyzed the goldilocks economy in the june edition of the market overview chart 2 the cpi annual rate red line left axis in and the s p 500 index green line right axis from july 2009 to may 2019 last but not least retail sales rebounded in may while industrial production remains solid see the june 18 edition of the gold news monitor as we have examined in the march edition of the market overview most of the recessionary indicators do not flesh red hence we remain rather optimistic about the outlook for u s economy no doubt that it appears in a much better shape than japan or the eurozone but even according to the absolute criteria there is no immediate danger on the horizon does it mean that we do not see any threats of course not there are three main risks first the inversion of the yield curve although the yield curve could indeed lose some of its predictive power this is something what the pundits used to say before each financial crisis this time is different they announced recklessly just to be surprised by the good old crash therefore we take the recent inversion of the yield curve seriously but we are far from panicking why it is because we do not see a corresponding tightening in credit conditions historically the yield curve inverted because of the liquidity shortage that happens when the indebted entrepreneurs begin to sustain losses and turn so desperate for a loan to finish their investment projects that they are willing to pay more for a short term loans than for a long term obligation however as the chart below shows the credit conditions remain easy the red line on the chart below stays below zero which indicates looser than average credit conditions so the recent inversion of the yield curve does not necessarily signal the upcoming recession at least not yet but the yield curve related risks have clearly increased recently so keeping an eye out for this indicator is certainly worthwhile chart 3 yield curve green line right axis spread between 10 year and 3 month treasuries in and the chicago fed national financial conditions credit subindex red line left axis index from january 1982 to may 2019 second trade wars we still believe that trump and xi will eventually reach a deal especially that they announced trade truce in june should they fail to do that new tariffs and other protectionist measures could significantly disrupt the global supply chains affecting negatively the corporate profits and the whole economy and third debt the scale of private and public debt is dangerously outrageous in many cases even higher than before the great recession total public and private debt in many countries is above 320 percent of gdp according to the imf it goes without saying that the debt driven economic expansion is not sustainable at current interest rates the debt seems to be cheap and worth of loading on balance sheet however the low bond yields do not reflect low risk in general but rather financial repression when the central banks normalize their monetary policy the mirage of low yields will disappear what does our overview imply for the gold market the u s economic picture is better than many people think while it s not perfect it s not as bad as widely believed it suggests that the economy has still some room to run bad news for the gold bulls we know the consensus is that america is headed for a recession by the end of 2020 we are not yet convinced there will be a growth slowdown that s very likely given that the effect of fiscal stimulus will wane but a downturn is another kettle of fish however the economic slowdown combined with the fears of recession might be enough to increase the safe haven demand for gold many people buy the yellow metal when the economy is already in the recession but smart money flows into the

with the trump xi meeting leading to a restart of trade negotiations and the opec summit resulting in an extension of the production cuts two major uncertainties facing the oil market have been put to rest for the time being the next pivotal variable facing oil prices in the short run could come from an unlikely source on friday the labor department government reported a surprisingly strong jobs report with the u s adding 224 000 jobs in june much higher than analysts had assumed that reduced fears of a severe economic slowdown especially after the u s only added 72 000 jobs the month before unemployment remained below 4 percent and the record length of the current economic expansion continues good news right odd then that oil prices barely budged and actually fell slightly during midday trading on friday one would assume that a larger than expected employment report particularly during a period of time when pessimism has dominated the market narrative would push oil prices up concerns of flagging oil demand have dragged down oil prices so an unexpected bout of positive news should put those fears to rest however the flip side of a strong jobs report is that the whole rationale for the u s federal reserve to cut interest rates which investors assumed could come as soon as this month is now called into question we do not know how or when these issues will be resolved we are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u s economic outlook and as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective fed chair jerome powell said a month ago related oil prices set for worst weekly drop in five weeks those comments were widely interpreted as a willingness to cut interest rates and in fact there has been rising expectations that the cut would occur in july completing a 180 degree turn for the central bank after multiple rate hikes last year but unemployment is at historically low levels and the u s continues to add jobs even as the global economy has shown signs of slowing down we ve always seen a more notable deceleration in employment ahead of a cut avery shenfeld chief economist at canadian imperial bank of commerce told bloomberg i m not as convinced as the market that the fed has to move in july rate cuts are likely coming but the fed has to be very careful to not be seen as pushed by the market and the white house while most headlines rightly focus on opec maneuvers the fed has enormous influence over the oil market because crude is priced in dollars a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for most countries depressing demand the reverse is also true a weaker dollar as a forthcoming rate cut would bring on pushes up demand related u s oil rig count falls amid rising production before the jobs report traders put the odds of a 50 basis point cut at nearly 30 percent but slashed those bets to just an 8 percent chance after seeing the latest employment figures according to cnbc the bounce back in the june jobs number may splash cold water on the notion of an imminent fed rate cut said tony bedikian head of global markets at citizens bank still it s not at all clear that the u s economy is out of the woods aside from the recent jump in job growth there are worrying signs looming an economist with the st louis fed said that the slump in the u s housing market is consistent with the possibility of a late 2019 or early 2020 recession manufacturing activity has stagnated auto sales have fallen year on year for six straight months perhaps most significantly the u s china trade war drags on despite the recent agreement to revive negotiations the u s only recently hiked tariffs from 10 to 25 percent on 250 billion worth of chinese imports so the pain has yet to really be felt china is showing more distressing signs of a slowdown which of course can boomerang back on the american economy so perhaps the fed will ignore the strong jobs report and still cut rates but oil traders are suddenly not so sure advertisement by nick cunningham of oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
our hypothesis that the market had reached peak dovishness toward the fed remains intact after the employment data was the strongest since january the and the ticked up edged 0 2 higher and with revisions maintained a 3 1 year over year pace which is a bit disappointing the jobs report trumps the pmi ism data and suggests that although the economy slowed in q2 the sky is not falling there is no great urgency for the and surely not by the half a percentage point move that many economists have advocated the market quickly took the odds of such a move from a little more than a 1 in 4 chance to about a 1 in 50 chance the backing up of u s yields spurred a sharp sell off in europe that offset most of the draghi lagarde inspired rally and will spur a sharp sell off in asia to start the new week coupled with a still robust labor market the u s is expected to report in the coming week that disinflationary forces remain in check while headline may ease it is mostly because of food and energy prices the is expected to remain steady at 2 0 prior or january 2012 the federal reserve did not have a formal inflation target the mandate from congress is for price stability greenspan had famously defined price stability as that level of inflation that does not impact businesses given the lack of a scientific basis or what passes for it in the dismal science and the imprecision of our measurements is there really a need to make a fetish of two percent inflation the federal reserve should declare victory it has achieved price stability with full employment in a record long expansion cycle powell is unlikely to do that at his on july 10 and 11 yet if he were going to lean against the rate cut that is nearly fully discounted by the market for later this month this would be the venue it might be too late to persuade the market that it will not cut rates now but powell can lean against the idea that it will cut rates 75 bp this year by emphasizing the still robust expansion hard data jobs and auto sales strong financial conditions that many think is frothy and perhaps couching a cut in terms of insurance besides the market has already done a lot of the lifting while the fed has been patient the note yield has fallen nearly 65 bp this year and the yield has fallen a little more than 60 bp the fed has already signaled the end of its tightening cycle to much effect the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet has still left it larger than many had previously expected at the same time there are indeed storm clouds on the horizon or what powell called crosscurrents the uk seems to be drifting toward a no deal brexit as both candidates to replace may are campaigning on ideas like renegotiating the withdrawal agreement eschewing the backstop that the ec has already rejected and rest assured the new configuration of the ec will be no more sympathetic to the uk s posture the uk economy appears to have bounced back in may from a poor april the monthly is expected to have risen by 0 3 after a 0 4 contraction in april it was likely fueled by a strong recovery in industrial production 1 5 in may after a dismal 2 7 decline in april and a slight expansion of services 0 1 from flat the is expected to have widened and perhaps there is some pre brexit inventory stocking taking place yet boe governor carney s recent rhetoric has turned more gloomy and this likely presages a change in the central bank s rhetoric and forward guidance at the next meeting on august 1 the unexpected sharp drop in german snapped a two month advance and dashed the signal of the reaching a seven month high in june it warns of downside risk to the figure that starts the new week a 0 3 gain had been expected after the outsized april drop of 1 9 french and italian data are due out in the middle of the week small increases are expected spain reported a better than expected 0 3 gain 0 5 median forecast in the bloomberg survey between draghi s recent comments and the nomination of lagarde as his replacement has sparked a dramatic rally in fixed income many see lagarde as an extension of draghi s commitment and general strategy rather then draghi s predecessor and fellow countryman trichet however even before we get there the of last month s meeting will be released on july 11 they will be scrutinized for the extent of the easing bias the market accepts that the ecb will cut rates the question is when and by how much the current pricing in the derivatives market suggests around a 1 in 3 chance the ecb will cut the deposit rate by 10 bp to minus 45 bp later this month and by the end of the year the deposit rate will be minus 60 bp or lower an unanswerable question a decade after the great financial crisis and is how low can interest rates go many real money managers appear to be building cash holdings on ideas that the negative rates out 30 years in switzerland are not sustainable rising stocks amid falling earnings cannot persist yet many observers have been arguing this for years interest rates were supposed to rise when the central banks stopped buying them but they didn t asset managers and many businesses do not seem prepared for the persistence of lower and negative rates though in our understanding it is the most likely scenario trade tensions represent a significant unknown and cross current the resumption of talks while freezing the tariffs at the new elevated level is a holding pattern and the outlook does not look particularly favorable both sides are demanding actionables that the other rejects china wants to talk about huawei and resolve that and requires assurances any agreement will include the lifting of all punitive tariffs trump signaled the willingness to allow u s companies to sell some products and services to huawei though it is not precisely clear what this entails or whether the stigma remains the u s appears to demand a fundamental shift in china s economy away from the statist command model china of course is not the only source of trade tension for the u s between retaliation for subsidies for airbus pa that the wto ruled illegal the eu s attempt to create a special purpose vehicle designed to facilitate trade in medicine and food initially the persistent haranguing about nato contributions even though the eu spends four times more than russia on defense and the threat of auto tariffs promise many potential flashpoints the u s levied a 400 tariff on steel from vietnam amid signs that korean and taiwanese producers may have been re exporting from vietnam to circumvent tariffs separately trump was explicit accusing vietnam of being among the more egregious currency manipulators more broadly trump s penchant for verbally intervening in the foreign exchange market and now implicitly threatening intervention may risk weaponizing the currency market like firing of special investor mueller or demoting powell if not firing him trump has been unable to follow through with such threats which we suspect speaks to the institutional resilience in the u s despite claims in the u s that china s economy is genuinely hurting under the impact of 25 tariffs on roughly half of their exports to america officials have been reluctant to provide significant stimulus it has encouraged financial institutions to lend and lend they have aggregate financing for june is expected to show the second consecutive increase through the first five months of the year it is running a little more than 25 higher than the same year ago period money supply measured by m2 has risen at an average pace of 8 4 through may this year which is slightly faster than in the first five months of 2018 china will report june and reserves probably increased slightly in june likely reflecting valuation shifts contrary to trump s claims that china is manipulating its currency or some economists claim that a weaker is desirable to offset the tariff increase the pboc appears to have consistently set the yuan stronger than private sector models suggest both and are expected to have fallen for the past seven months chinese exports have alternated in a sawtooth pattern between year over year gains and drops in dollar terms may s 1 1 gain is expected to have been followed by a 0 6 decline in june china s imports are expected to have fallen around 4 5 in the year through june after an 8 5 fall in may imports have averaged a 3 7 decline in the january may period this year in the same period last year imports grew by an average of 21 5 and 20 4 in 2017 prices and gaming tariffs are likely playing a role and we advise against reading too much into short term trends note that in yuan terms china s exports rose an average of 5 8 in the first part of this year while imports averaged a 1 7 gain the is the only major central bank that meets in the week ahead july 10 the bank of canada is firmly on hold the headline disappointed but this was because of the loss of part time positions full time positions grew by 24k this was the weakest gain in q2 but consider that last year s average was about a third less also wage growth accelerated for permanent workers by 3 6 year over year it put this in context hourly wages rose 1 5 year over year last december and climbed to 2 3 by the end of q1

a close eye on the trade war ignited by the united states that has set up barriers provoking retaliation by mainly china and leaving many countries wary of threats and contemplating opportunities since 1998 the united states has become the largest importer of chinese goods in 2015 china became the united states largest trade partner instead of canada as the size of goods exchange between both countries hit 500 billion occupying 15 percent of total u s trade professor of economics investment and international finance and chairman of the egyptian forum for economic studies rashad abdo tells egypt today that u s president donald trump made clear in his campaign that america first and that he would face the ultimate threat embodied in china the economics professor adds that the u s president declared at the time he would impose tariffs on steel imports after trump had become president the trade war started with raising tariffs to be 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports the affected countries included the u s allies and not just china which ranks fifth as a steel and aluminum exporter to the united states the top four are in order canada mexico south korea and brazil consequently canada threatened it would increase tariffs on its imports from the u s as well the economics professor explains china is the main target of the tariffs because it exports countless and diverse products to the united states while imports very little from it that has caused the balance of trade to be in favor of china the goal of the u s tariffs is to push china to purchase more u s products another reason behind such trade war waged by the united states is that china steals product ideas developed by american companies china develops those ideas and sells the products at lower prices abdo clarifies the united states has been urging china to protect the intellectual property of american companies the united states alleges china of adopting policies that force american companies to transfer technology to chinese ones thus one of its demands to end the trade war is that china stops such practices the united states imposed additional tariffs worth 60 billion china responded by levying tariffs on certain imports such as soybeans the tariffs are imposed on imports from all countries which will negatively impact their purchasing power in turn that will take its toll on the u s exports for instance european imports of the united states vehicles may decline abdo highlights professor of economics at ain shams university yomn al hamaky tells egypt today the united states is even setting up barriers with countries it has free trade agreements with such as nafta states and eu states those are considered violations of freedom of trade and breaches of the wto regulations protectionism always hurts everybody egypt has put forward a motion to be granted an exemption egypt may not be able to increase its exports to the u s because they are relatively expensive compared to other countries although the value of egypt s currency is less than that of china some categories of the factors of production are more expensive for instance we do not produce steel pellets we import them in hard currency abdo says egypt has a chance to increase its exports to the united states the sectors that can benefit include the garment furniture leather food and handicraft industries our competitors in the garment sector can be vietnam and philippines we should encourage small exporters and raise their awareness of the opportunities we do not take enough benefit from the gsp and our shares of u s imports are quite low india for instance was successful in benefiting from the gsp so it boosted its exports and the trade balance was in its favor hamaky stresses the revenues of the suez canal will fall if the international trade shrinks the purchasing power of the citizens in some countries may decline which can take its toll on tourism that s why we started to market egypt as a travel destination among potential chinese and eastern european tourists abdo adds as for whether china can direct its steel exports to egypt abdo says when the prices of steel rose imports from ukraine and turkey increased since energy is subsidized there those countries benefited more by exporting as a result egyptian producers had to lower steel prices that is why steel producers demand that they acquire gas in low prices abdo clarifies it is worthy to mention that the ministry of trade and industry decided in december 2017 to maintain tariffs on steel rebar from china turkey and ukraine for five years extending a temporary tariff that had been imposed in june 2017 china invests in other countries for specific reasons china has long term visions and expected the u s decisions chinese investments in egypt got subsidies from the chinese state but the eu figured out professor of economics at cairo university s faculty of economics and political science ahmed ghoneim tells egypt today the size of international trade will shrink many countries will produce less and the manufacturing inputs they import from other countries will decline abdo says on the short run the world will experience a decline in international trade and international economic growth on the long run it is hard to make speculations yet trump s policies do not indicate a de escalation will occur china will not raise its imports the depression that occurred last century may happen again ghoneim says abdo speculates a currency war may happen as some countries can devalue their currencies to export more abdo stresses that it is the role of the imf to monitor such practices he adds that banks will be affected badly because of the decline in transactions and thus the commission they get the countries that can benefit will be mexico and countries whose production costs are low the prices of oil and minerals will fall because of the decline in production the u s understands those facts so it considers levying tariffs on imports from such countries abdo explains he gave the example of mexico that is favored by automakers to assemble vehicles in may trump threatened to impose a 25 percent tariffs on vehicles imported from mexico abdo commented on the status of u s companies that manufacture in china and whose products are being subject to tariffs saying they sell most of their production to other countries than the u s but still their homeland is a big market that can impose sanctions on the world countries like what happened with iran on the contrary hamaky says some american companies are decreasing their investments in china and moving to neighboring countries such as vietnam cambodia indonesia philippines and other asian countries there are no substitutes for china as its prices are the cheapest worldwide it will rather decrease its margins of profit the u s companies will continue to manufacture in developing countries and those operating in china will remain because they got used to the market and the decision to move is not easy ghoneim says american producers will suffer because they import certain manufacturing inputs from china the shares of prominent u s technology companies fell in the stock market abdo says the american farmers exporting to china will be impacted badly despite trump s subsidies the united states has no advantage in some sectors such as the garment industry because of the high wages of workers also low income citizens in china will be affected negatively professor of economics at ain shams university yomn al hamaky the united states tried to ban huawei s access to android so it would collapse nevertheless huawei can create an alternative within three months and then at least half of the world countries may ditch google and choose huawei the uae and south korea signed a contract with huawei to obtain the 5g technology the company has also a partial contract with the united kingdom abdo says the g5 technology was acquired by huawei but has not reached the united states yet there is a major drawback of the g5 because it will annul many industries and give rise to others such as the industry of self driving cars the united states produces only traditional cars the g5 depends on data and information so it may facilitate espionage activities by acquiring state secrets abdo adds unemployment in the united states may decline to 3 5 percent from nine percent the united states made new gas discoveries since china purchases gas from the united states the latter can exert pressure on the former however the united states will not always benefit in wars everyone is a loser abdo stipulates china will increase its imports from the united states that will slow down the escalation from the part of the united states that will make room to study the negative impact of the tariffs and to hold a calm dialogue trade protection harms all parties hamaky estimates commenting on the u s china agreement to a tentative trade truce as reported by the financial times the vietnamese customs department pledged to combat the fraudulent labeling of chinese goods as made in vietnam in a note published by societe generale s chinese economy specialist wei yao chinese exports of electronics parts to taiwan and vietnam grew sharply compared with last year as reported by quartz societe generale estimates that can be a sign of knockdown whereas a product is disassembled in china and reassembled later in a foreign country tricks like knockdown can work on the short run abdo says on the other hand ghoneim highlights that products are subject to the rules of origin so putting the label made in whatever country will not cover the fact that they were made in china importing countries can verify the origin many flooding cases unraveled by using such criteria ghoneim explains the knockdown is initially a business choice and adjustment to the economic conditions china invests in markets in africa europe and asia based on the circumstances of each market its ability to absorb its products and the relations between china and those countries hamaky clarifies over 20 percent of u s imports used to be made in china in the first four months of 2019 the figure dropped to less than 18 percent according to data released by the u s international trade commission the top seven countries whose export shares to the u s grew the most during that period compared to the same duration last year are mexico 0 75 vietnam 0 70 south korea 0 48 taiwan 0 37 france 0 33 india 0 26 and japan 0 21 the tariffs have mainly targeted electronics advanced machinery and industrial parts hence the share of vietnam that already exports electronics to the u s was expected to increase the shares of korean and taiwanese exports increased in the other two categories a report by the new york federal reserve bank suggested that those tariffs will cost a typical american household 831 annually u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin argued before the house of representatives in may that the impact will be mitigated by several factors one of those is that companies at the united states will switch to products from other countries than china however the federal reserve s report suggests that american companies may resort to more expensive countries which would reduce the revenues collected from tariffs on chinese goods the other factors mentioned by the treasury secretary are currency effects and lowering of profit margins among others in january reuters reported that china contemplates boosting its imports from the united states over six years until 2024 to eliminate the trade surplus that hit last year 324 billion to reach zero by the aforementioned date the rise in purchases from the united states over the six years must be worth 1 trillion societe generale states that foreign investment in vietnam and thailand has hiked since the beginning of this year the taiwanese electronics company foxconn the world s largest contract assembler of consumer electronics for companies such as apple is moving production from china to india and vietnam in may the ceo of brooks running announced it was moving operations from china to vietnam because of shoe tariffs similar steps were taken by other corporates because the wages of workers in other countries are less of those of chinese workers in february 2018 the united states imposed a 30 percent tariff on all solar panel imports exempting only canada and a 20 percent tariff on washing machines in march 2018 the united states imposed a 25 percent tariff on all steel imports exempting argentina australia brazil and south korea and a 10 percent tariff on all aluminium imports exempting argentina and australia in july and august 2018 the united states increased tariffs on 50 billion worth of high tech chinese products to become 25 percent instead of 10 percent the number of high tech products affected is 1 300 that is the first time the united state targeted chinese products in specific in may 2019 the united states raised tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent in the same month the u s president announced in a tweet that tariffs on 325b worth of goods may soon be subject to the increase as well until present the chinese goods facing the 150 percent rise of tariffs are telecommunications equipment 19 1 billion computer circuit boards 12 5 billion processing units 5 6 billion metal furniture non seats 4 1 billion computer parts 3 1 billion wooden furniture 2 9 billion static converters 2 7 billion vinyl tile floor coverings 2 5 billion seats with wooden frames 2 5 billion and car parts 2 3 billion as reported by bloomberg in may 2017 the united states penalized zte the chinese telecommunications equipment company for exporting u s goods to north korean and iran violating the sanctions imposed against them the penalty included a fine worth 1 19 billion and a punishment against the employees involved the company did not abide by the latter penalty so the u s commerce department threatened to bar all american firms from selling key parts such as microchips to zte in april 2018 the united states started to implement a seven year ban on exports to zte two months later the ban was lifted and replaced by a 1 billion fine while allowing a new compliance team staffed by american experts as reported by cnbc in april 2018 china levied tariffs ranging from 15 25 percent on 128 products including fruit wine seamless steel pipes pork and recycled aluminium that was in retaliation for the u s tariffs on steel and aluminum in august 2018 china imposed 25 percent tariff on 545 u s goods that are worth 34 billion including agricultural products automobiles and aquatic products in june 2019 china increased tariffs by 25 percent 20 percent and 10 percent on 5 140 american products worth 60 billion it has also hinted that it would restrict rare earth exports to its rival china offers 80 percent of rare earth elements production in february u s president donald trump tweeted that his country would impose tariffs on 11 billion of eu products as a response to subsidies granted by the union to airbus the european union responded that it was preparing a list of tariffs to counter american subsidies to boeing the three experts affirm that such war between boeing and airbus has been going on for decades hamaky clarifies that the wto rules on their disputes case by case on wednesday trump alleged the eu and china of devaluing their currencies ghoneim comments trump is trying to paralyze the wto he refuses to appoint judges for the appellate body that implements the dispute settlement mechanisms if you wonder where was the wto when the united states increased the tariffs the answer is trump threatened to withdraw from the wto after china had sought its help abdo clarifies in august 2018 china lodged a formal case against the u s at the wto because of the tariffs on solar panels and a complaint because of the 25 percent tariffs on chinese goods worth 16 billion on june 5 india was excluded from the generalized system of preferences gsp that covered 5 6 billion worth of indian exports as a result indian steel and aluminum products are no longer subject to duty free benefits on june 14 india levied tariffs worth 235 million on 29 u s products worth 1 4 billion those tariffs are up to 70 percent of the value of the products in 2018 the value of us india bilateral trade was 142 billion increasing sevenfold since 2001 major indian imports from the united states include almond and fresh apples those are worth 645 million and 165 million respectively india is not a least developing country and has a free trade agreement with the eu so it was excluded from the gsp ghoneim explains ghoneim and hamaky attribute the u s decision to the fact that the balance of trade was becoming in favor of india
our hypothesis that the market had reached peak dovishness toward the fed remains intact after the employment data job growth was the strongest since january the participation rate and the unemployment rate ticked up average hourly earnings edged 0 2 higher and with revisions maintained a 3 1 year over year pace which is a bit disappointing the jobs report trumps the pmi ism data and suggests that although the economy slowed in q2 the sky is not falling there is no great urgency for the fed to act and surely not by the half a percentage point move that many economists have advocated the market quickly took the odds of such a move from a little more than a 1 in 4 chance to about a 1 in 50 chance the backing up of us yields spurred a sharp sell off in europe that offset most of draghi lagarde inspired rally and will spur a sharp sell off in asia to start the new week coupled with a still robust labor market the us is expected to report in the coming week that disinflationary forces remain in check while headline cpi may ease it is mostly because of food and energy prices the core rate is expected to remain steady at 2 0 prior or january 2012 the federal reserve did not have a formal inflation target the mandate from congress is for price stability greenspan had famously defined price stability as that level of inflation that does not impact businesses given the lack of a scientific basis or what passes for it in the dismal science and the imprecision of our measurements is there really a need to make a fetish of two percent inflation the federal reserve should declare victory it has achieved price stability with full employment in a record long expansion cycle powell is unlikely to do that at his congressional testimony on july 10 and 11 yet if he were going to lean against the rate cut that is nearly fully discounted by the market for later this month this would be the venue it might be too late to persuade the market that it will not cut rates now but powell can lean against the idea that it will cut rates 75 bp this year by emphasizing the still robust expansion hard data jobs and auto sales strong financial conditions that many think is frothy and perhaps couching a cut in terms of insurance besides the market has already done a lot of the lifting while the fed has been patient the 10 year note yield has fallen nearly 65 bp this year and the two year yield has fallen a little more than 60 bp the fed has already signaled the end of its tightening cycle to much effect the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet leaving it larger than many had previously expected at the same time there are indeed storm clouds on the horizon or what powell called crosscurrents the uk seems to be drifting toward a no deal brexit as both candidates to replace may are campaigning on ideas like renegotiating the withdrawal agreement eschewing the backstop that the ec has already rejected and rest assured the new configuration of the ec will be no more sympathetic to the uk s posture the uk economy appears to have bounced back in may from a poor april the monthly gdp is expected to have risen by 0 3 after a 0 4 contraction in april it was likely fueled by a strong recovery in industrial production 1 5 in may after a dismal 2 7 decline in april and a slight expansion of services 0 1 from flat the trade deficit is expected to have widened and perhaps there is some pre brexit inventory stocking taking place yet boe governor carney s recent rhetoric has turned more gloomy and this likely presages a change in the central bank s rhetoric and forward guidance at the next meeting on august 1 the unexpected sharp drop in german factory orders snapped a two month advance and dashed the signal of the composite pmi reaching a seven month high in june it warns of downside risk to industrial output figure that starts the new week a 0 3 gain had been expected after the outsized april drop of 1 9 french and italian data are due out in the middle of the week small increases are expected spain reported a better than expected 0 3 gain 0 5 median forecast in the bloomberg survey between draghi s recent comments and the nomination of lagarde as his replacement has sparked a dramatic rally in fixed income many see lagarde as an extension of draghi s commitment and general strategy rather then draghi s predecessor and fellow countryman trichet however even before we get there the ecb record of last month s meeting will be released on july 11 they will be scrutinized for the extent of the easing bias the market accepts that the ecb will cut rates the question is when and by how much the current pricing in the derivatives market suggests around a 1 in 3 chance the ecb will cut the deposit rate by 10 bp to minus 45 bp later this month and by the end of the year the deposit rate will be minus 60 bp or lower an unanswerable question a decade after the great financial crisis and is how low can interest rates go many real money managers appear to be building cash holdings on ideas that the negative rates out 30 years in switzerland are not sustainable rising stocks amid falling earnings cannot persist yet many observers have been arguing this for years interest rates were supposed to rise when the central banks stopped buying them but they didn t asset managers and many businesses do not seem prepared for the persistence of lower and negative rates though in our understanding it is the most likely scenario trade tensions represent a significant unknown and cross current the resumption of talks while freezing the tariffs at the new elevated level is a holding pattern and the outlook does not look particularly favorable both sides are demanding actionables that the other rejects china wants to talk about huawei and resolve that and requires assurances any agreement will include the lifting of all punitive tariffs trump signaled the willingness to allow us companies to sell some products and services to huawei though it is not precisely clear what this entails or whether the stigma remains the us appears to demand a fundamental shift in china s economy away from the statist command model china of course is not the only source of trade tension for the us between retaliation for subsidies for airbus that the wto ruled illegal the eu s attempt to create a special purpose vehicle designed to facilitate trade in medicine and food initially the persistent haranguing about nato contributions even though the eu spends four times more than russia on defense and the threat of auto tariffs promise many potential flashpoints the us levied a 400 tariff on steel from vietnam amid signs that korean and taiwanese producers may have been re exporting from vietnam to circumvent tariffs separately trump was explicit accusing vietnam of being among the more egregious currency manipulators more broadly trump s penchant for verbally intervening in the foreign exchange market and now implicitly threatening intervention may risk weaponizing the currency market like firing of special investor mueller or demoting powell if not firing him trump has been unable to follow through with such threats which we suspect speaks to the institutional resilience in the us despite claims in the us that china s economy is genuinely hurting under the impact of 25 tariffs on roughly half of their exports to america officials have been reluctant to provide significant stimulus it has encouraged financial institutions to lend and lend they have aggregate financing for june is expected to show the second consecutive increase through the first five months of the year it is running a little more than 25 higher than the same year ago period money supply measured by m2 has risen at an average pace of 8 4 through may this year which is slightly faster than in the first five months of 2018 china will report june reserve figures and trade reserves probably increased slightly in june likely reflecting valuation shifts contrary to trump s claims that china is manipulating its currency or some economists claim that a weaker yuan is desirable to offset the tariff increase the pboc appears to have consistently set the yuan stronger than private sector models suggest both imports and exports are expected to have fallen for the past seven months chinese exports have alternated in a sawtooth pattern between year over year gains and drops in dollar terms may s 1 1 gain is expected to have been followed by a 0 6 decline in june china s imports are expected to have fallen around 4 5 in the year through june after an 8 5 fall in may imports have averaged a 3 7 decline in the jan may period this year in the same period last year imports grew by an average of 21 5 and 20 4 in 2017 prices and gaming tariffs are likely playing a role and we advise against reading too much into short term trends note that in yuan terms china s exports rose an average of 5 8 in the first part of this year while imports averaged a 1 7 gain the bank of canada is the only major central bank that meets in the week ahead july 10 the bank of canada is firmly on hold the headline jobs growth disappointed but this was because of the loss of part time positions full time positions grew by 24k this was the weakest gain in q2 but consider that last year s average was about a third less also wage growth accelerated for permanent workers by 3 6 year over year it put this in context hourly wages rose 1 5 year over year last december and climbed to 2 3 by the end of q1

ireland must do all it can to prevent being caught in europe s political slow lane as the leading contenders line up to run the eu and european cental bank writes kyran fitzgerald europe s leaders have finally come up with the names of the people they would like to see filling the top jobs across the union for the next few years as far as ireland is concerned three of those jobs really matter the presidency of the european commission the presidency of the council of ministers and last but certainly not least the presidency of the ecb it was clear for some time that the frontrunner for the commission job the centre right german mep manfred weber had failed to gain sufficient traction the baton for a while appeared to pass to the dutch socialist frans timmermans a straight talking politician however he was knocked off course by an alliance of rightist east european leaders and western european politicians from the centre right european people s party which includes fine gael mr timmermans had led the charge against the hungarians and poles over clampdowns on the opposition by their governments he effectively suffered because of his determination that eu countries many in receipt of generous transfers should stick by the basic liberal principles promoted by the eu the emergence of ursula von der leyen as a nominee to head the commission has caused surprise and not a little disquiet in germany itself ms der leyen was once seen as the likely successor to angela merkel as chancellor but her reputation has tanked since she became defence minister several years ago she has recovered some ground securing significant extra funding for the military this year after a series of scandals although none were personal to her the german social democrats and elements of the media are furious over her appointment which is seen as a classic deal crafted by chancellor merkel ms der leyen comes from a political patrician background her father ernst albrecht once served as head of the ec s competition directorate before being appointed as prime minister of the german state of lower saxony the commission certainly needs a bit of a jump start after the bumpy tenure in office of the bibulous if politically shrewd jean claude juncker while its core role is as the eu s civil service a strong commission can make a real difference this requires leadership at the top in 1984 europe had drifted under the dreary presidency of gaston thorn another one of the benelux bunch which tends to bag the top jobs enter jacques delors who gathered a strong team around him including the briton arthur cockfield and irishman peter sutherland mr delors set in train the single market project which in turn helped to propel the irish economy to a new place on the back of us investment attracted by a more vibrant europe mr delors pushed through his vision of a social europe helping to win over support from the political left while gradually alienating margaret thatcher with the consequences we are now living with the incomer ms der leyen if she secures the backing of sceptical meps faces a huge set of challenges germany s economic locomotive is creaking as demand in china and other emerging economies stalls and trade wars threaten a strong german economy is vital to broader european prosperity without it the germans will simply shrink back from their commitment to the broader continental cause pulling their wallets tight to their chests since early 2018 the relationship between the us and its european partners has been fraught last summer mr juncker travelled to the us capital and schmoozed his way out of a confrontation with us president donald trump the problem was postponed but not dealt with the chic and understated ms der leyen if nominated will have to display some steel in standing up to president trump and his fluctuating team of underlings the news that the danish government is reappointing margrethe vestager to the commission has been widely welcomed ms vestager could turn out to be a key lieutenant margrethe vestager she has been an active competition commissioner cracking down on anti competitive behaviour with more vigour than is the case with her us counterparts ms vestager has stood up to the mighty technology sector battalions even if her sanctioning of apple over its tax avoidance practices has caused a degree of embarrassment in government buildings over here ms vestager who was tipped for the top job herself is likely to be a very strong force in the next commission ready to back the new eu president should she or perhaps he be really willing to roll up their sleeves and embark on a new wave of reform a us eu trade war combined with a possibility of a disorderly uk departure threatens a disruptive recessionary downturn that could expose further fissures across the eurozone in particular the nomination of the imf head and former french finance minister christine lagarde to head up the ecb caused surprise as ms lagarde had been mentioned in connection with the commission job certainly she would be well capable of filling mr delors large shoes but now she is headed instead for frankfurt despite quibbles about a lack of a background in finance ms lagarde s near certain arrival is a source of much relief she is likely to emerge as the leader among central bankers the head of the us federal reserve jerome powell who is a lawyer by background like lagarde does not have the frenchwoman s air of authority easy grace and communication skills the great fear among centre left apostles and those from heavily indebted countries such as ireland was that a more hawkish figure such as a german central banker would take charge at the ecb this threat has disappeared for the next five years almost certainly quantitative easing has its critics and many argue with force that it has promoted a credit bubble but few question the decisions of the outgoing ecb president mario draghi mr draghi is credited with nothing less than doing all it takes to save the euro and economic and political disaster across europe ms lagarde s nomination is not universally popular however ecb policymaker benoit coeure defended on sunday her nomination saying that she was uniquely qualified ms lagarde has faced criticism that she is not a trained economist since european leaders tapped her last week to replace mr draghi christine lagarde is uniquely qualified to lead the ecb at a time when challenges are both internal and external to the eurozone mr coeure told journalists on the sidelines of an economic conference in southern france she knows how the global economy works she knows how europe works and she knows how to talk to financial markets he added french finance minister bruno le maire had earlier said that european finance ministers need to find a compromise candidate to replace ms lagarde as the head of the imf european leaders nominated ms lagarde last week raising the question of who would in turn replace her at the imf speaking on the sidelines of an economics and business conference in southern france mr le maire said that european finance ministers would discuss the issue at a meeting in brussels on tuesday christine lagarde we need to find a compromise at the european level i hope that we will find a compromise about the best candidate the best european candidate for the imf he told journalists if we have a good european candidate we might have a good candidate for the imf he added in response to a question about whether bank of england governor mark carney could be fielded as europe s candidate though born and raised in canada mr carney who is also a former governor of the bank of canada holds irish and british passports in addition to his canadian citizenship a french official said that mr le maire was due to discuss the issue with french president macron over the weekend and that he was likely to speak with mr carney beforehand france was aware that support was building for mr carney the official added saying that if paris decided to back him it would be sooner rather than later traditionally the washington based imf has been led by a european while its sister institution the world bank has been run by an american back at the ecb ms lagarde is likely to rely heavily on the ecb s irish chief economist philip lane mr lane is set to be ireland s key representative at the top end of the european top table the ecb faces a huge challenge in ensuring that the benefits of quantitative easing are felt by the broader economy the ecb needs the cooperation of member governments in implementing reforms to labour markets and preparing their economies for the challenges posed by climate change and the new smart economy which could upend many of europe s traditional industries agriculture included christine lagarde and philip lane to date frankfurt has largely been left with the lion s share of the task of doing what it takes to drive the eu economy forward the burden should be shared the eu could and must play a key role in coordinating the response to this challenge that will include a major programme of reinvestment member states will have to act together to minimise duplication and disruption the eu federalists should soon have their own man at the top of the system as president of the council of ministers in the form of the outgoing prime minister of belgium charles michel it will be vital that the council and commission work hand in glove this role was created by the lisbon treaty and mr michel will be the third occupant of the job following fellow belgian herman van rompuy and latterly the pole donald tusk mr michel is a genial francophone liberal who in 2014 became belgium s youngest prime minister since 1845 his father served as foreign minister so mr michel is also part of the brussels pedigree chum class as is so often the case the eu has picked out its permanent rulers from among the old continental elite we can only hope that the new stars can live up to the billing if they simply fade into significance they could drag the rest of us with them it is generally accepted that there is a shift of authority from ms merkel towards french president emmanuel macron who has been pressing with limited success to date for greater emphasis on federal solutions mr macron has been pushed back but he has not gone away the irish government needs to work hard to build alternative visions for the future development of the eu so as to ensure that we do not find ourselves caught in the slow lane in a union moving forward at two or more speeds additional reporting reuters

when the governments in the advanced nations abandoned full employment as an overarching macroeconomic objective and instead starting pursuing what i have called full employability they stopped seeing unemployment as a policy target to be minimised and began using it as a policy tool to suppress inflation as mass unemployment rose the politics were massaged by the mainstream of my profession who claimed that the level of unemployment that constituted full employment had risen this was the nairu era and so there was really no problem governments adopted the neoliberal line that they didn t create jobs and had to target fiscal surpluses to ensure their position was sustainable the costs in lost income and human suffering have been enormous most people would not have any idea of the massive scale of these losses that accumulate day after day now it seems the sound finance school is going a step further we are probably facing an environmental emergency in the coming period years decades but the question commentators keep asking is not what we can do about it but how can we pay for it so sound finance has already destroyed the lives of millions of people around the world as a result of mass unemployment and poverty now it is turning its focus on the rest of us madness paradigm change has to come sooner rather than later the mass unemployment problem i discussed the shift from full employment to full employability in this blog post among others a new progressive agenda september 28 2010 we also discussed the shift in policy approach to unemployment under neoliberalism in our 2008 book full employment abandoned i also discussed the costs of unemployment in these blog posts among others 1 the daily losses from unemployment january 13 2010 2 the costs of unemployment again january 13 2012 as a reminder sustained unemployment imposes significant economic personal and social costs that include loss of current output social exclusion and the loss of freedom skill loss psychological harm ill health and reduced life expectancy loss of motivation the undermining of human relations and family life racial and gender inequality and loss of social values and responsibility these costs are enormous and dwarf the measures that various governments have come up with to estimate losses arising from so called microeconomic inefficiencies such as transport systems not running on time etc when i last did these estimates i found that in the september quarter 2009 the daily gdp losses that the us economy was enduring for example as a result of the decline in economy activity below it previous peak stood at us10 3 billion per day so over one month they were losing us310 billion approximately and that was just in lost gdp from the lack of jobs if one added in those other costs identified above then the daily losses would be much more than this even under conservative assumptions the economic and social costs of sustained high unemployment are extremely high the inability of unemployed individuals and their families to function in the market economy gives rise to many forms of social dysfunction in addition to output loss the apparent failure of neo liberal supply side policies to reduce unemployment prior to the crisis is now highlighted during the crisis there is now an urgent need to address the large pools of unemployment in world economies there is never a financial reason why currency issuing governments should allow mass unemployment to endure in the way they have over the last three decades the first response that governments can always introduce as a base case defense against these losses is a job guarantee however spurious arguments about governments not having sufficient fiscal space or fiscal headroom or how are they going to pay for it and all the rest of the nonsense has condemned citizens to unnecessarily endure the massive costs of extended periods of unemployment our social concern for their welfare has been diminished because we have bought the sound finance narrative that governments are performing well if they run fiscal surpluses irrespective of the situation and further by the relentless divide and conquer strategies deployed to make it look as though the unemployed have choices but are lazy and desire to be supported by the rest of us neither part of the story is correct if unemployment impacted on more of us then the situation would be different for sure it would be less easy to demonise the victims of the deliberate choice by governments not to net spend at levels that are required to sustain full employment when we come to discussions of climate change however we are talking about an issue that can impact on all of us even though it is clear that poorer communities tend to be hit the worst by environmental degradation this is especially the case in poorer nations where their real resource bases have been pillaged by richer nations under spurious export led growth strategies under the aegis of the world bank and the imf but it still remains that climate change is a global threat that cannot be as easily dismissed as mass unemployment in the neoliberal rhetoric the problem is that while climate change denial is rampant an even more insidious problem is that the how are we going to pay for it ruse is alive and well in this debate even among progressives who are demanding immediate action climate action solution plant some trees i read an article in the latest edition of the science journal published july 5 2019 the global tree restoration potential which was a research report written by jean francois bastin yelena finegold claude garcia danilo mollicone marcelo rezende devin routh constantin m zohner and thomas w crowther all of whom are associated with various environmental biological agricultural and forestry research institutions across europe the article requires library access but the summary points are clear enough the authors note at the outset that photosynthetic carbon capture by trees is likely to be among our most effective strategies to limit the rise of co2 concentrations across the globe accordingly the restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation the authors note that the current estimates in this regard suggest that an increase of 1 billion ha of forest will be necessary to limit global warming to 1 5 c by 2050 the research question then is whether these restoration goals are achievable because we do not know how much tree cover might be possible under current or future climate conditions or where these trees could exist they then build models using direct measurements of tree cover independent of satellite derived models from protected areas where vegetation cover has been relatively unaffected by human activity and then they interpolate these natural tree cover estimates across the globe to generate a predictive understanding of the potential tree cover in the absence of human activity they used 78 774 direct photo interpretation measurements of tree cover across all protected regions of the world they found that about two thirds of terrestial land 8 7 billion ha could support forest which is 3 2 billion ha more than the current forested area around 1 4 billion ha of this potential forest is located in croplands 99 and urban areas 10 tree cover exists in areas that were previously degraded dominated by sparse vegetation grasslands and degraded bare soils some further modifications in the technique then produced a final estimate of 0 9 billion hectares are found outside cropland and urban regions and may represent regions for potential restoration in other words they essentially subtracted existing forest and existing agricultural and urban areas to derive a final estimate it turns out that more than 50 of the tree restoration potential can be found in only six countries in million hectares russia 151 united states 103 canada 78 4 australia 58 brazil 49 7 and china 40 2 stressing the important responsibility of some of the world s leading economies the problem is that only 10 per cent of the 48 countries that signed up for the bonn challenge to bring 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030 have plans in place to actually achieve their targets the authors find that over 43 of the countries have committed to restore an area that is less than 50 of the area available for restoration so a lot of work to be done but prior national commitments have to be stronger if you go to the bonn challenge home page you can see a map of the commitments currently in place my own country australia led by a government of climate change deniers has made zero commitments in the uk only scotland has made a modest commitment none of the western european nations have made a commitment the eu is not leading the charge here the authors concluded that the restoration project would be overwhelmingly more powerful than all of the other climate change solutions proposed that last quote came from a uk guardian article july 4 2019 from its environmental editor tree planting has mind blowing potential to tackle climate crisis which considered the science report the guardian interviewed the authors and made the point that the most powerful solution to climate change does not require any new technologies it is available now just plant trees the science report is silent on how such a restoration project would be made operational the guardian article introduces this topic in this way the study published in the journal science determines the potential for tree planting but does not address how a global tree planting programme would be paid for and delivered they ask the authors for suggestions and we learn that we could restore 1tn trees for 300bn one author proposed that 300bn would be within reach of a coalition of billionaire philanthropists and the public once again we have a disconnect in the public debate between climate action discussions and the capacities of the governments in modern monetary systems no one asked the us government how will we pay for it when it introduced the troubled asset relief program in october 2008 which was designed to purchase toxic assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector how much was immediately authorised under the tarp answer us700 billion the actual amount ended up less than that but the point is obvious here we have a solution 1 that is available now 2 is considered the most effective response that can be made to combat the climate issue 3 involves a small investment in relative terms to accomplish and the environmental editor of the guardian hasn t thought to suggest that fiat currency issuing governments have all the capacity they need to immediately authorise the required expenditures after all we are only talking about saving the planet here the reason the debate gets locked down like this when it comes to financial implications is the same reason we have tolerated elevated levels of unemployment and the massive wastage that has accompanied the joblessness the public debate has become locked down by neoliberal notions of public finance so called sound finance it is why climate change activists have to learn modern monetary theory mmt to overcome this economic ignorance the perfect match tree planting and job creation clearly tree planting is not rocket science and the skills necessary to undertake these reafforestation projects would be within the reach of most workers a progressive editor or commentator should never be questioning how we can pay for a tree planting project they should be lobbying at every chance governments to end their sound finance mindsets this particular climate solution would also help create thousands of low skill but highly valued jobs especially in nations that have high levels of unemployment or hidden unemployment in the informal economy it is clear that the private sector or the market system is not going to undertake such a project and the jobs are perfect for a job guarantee program a total win win all we need is the political will and some education conclusion the neoliberals continually drown the populace in a swathe of austerity myths the government has run out of money deficits will drive up interest rates deficits will cause hyperinflation deficits will rack up unsustainable debts on our grandchildren bond markets will punish governments who run continuous deficits deficits undermine growth because the private sector thwarts their intent by increasing saving to pay for higher implied taxes in the future direct job creation creates unreal jobs that are worthless a job guarantee would undermine the capacity of private employers to attract labour and drive down productivity etc the list goes on none of them have any credence we are continually being drawn towards conclusions that unemployment is not really a problem because people choose to remain jobless the culprit is singled as the income support system which subsidises those choices or depending on the day of the week the other culprit is excessive real wages or then on another day it might be hiring and firing protections etc we are told that if the labour market was deregulated and the income support system abandoned then we would quickly eliminate unemployment put people on the margin of starvation and they will work out of desperation we see that approach in the poorest nations where families scavenge through rubbish and sewerage heaps for the barest scraps of food that is what desperation and a lack of jobs ends up leading to hopefully the climate urgency will help groups in society that might otherwise not seek to understand macroeconomics to seek out such an understanding modern monetary theory mmt provides an empowering framework for designing effective responses that can link the needs for more work with available and effective solutions for those interested in climate action now is the time a superior empowering understanding is available an effective climate solution trees is available that is enough for today c copyright 2019 william mitchell all rights reserved
us rates and the usd increased sharply on friday night after stronger than expected payrolls led the market to scale back expectations of a 50bp fed rate cut in july us equities initially fell after the payrolls report but bounced back to close only slightly lower on the day amidst the stronger usd the nzd underperformed and fell almost 1 the non farm payrolls report revealed 224k jobs growth in june well above the market consensus of 160k and much higher than may s surprisingly low 72k print the three month moving average of payrolls growth rose to 171k lower than last year s average of 223k reflecting some slowing in the us economy but still at a level that should over time keep the unemployment rate trending lower the unemployment rate in june ticked up to 3 7 due to an increase in the participation rate while wages were slightly softer than expected the payrolls report eased market fears of a more abrupt slowdown in the us economy and fed rate cut expectations were scaled back accordingly the fed is still widely expected to cut rates later this month given its recent messaging to the market subdued inflation and softening in us and global activity indicators but the probability attached to a 50bp rate cut in july has been significantly reduced the market is now pricing 27bps for the fed s meeting later this month down from 33bps prior to payrolls the market prices 96bps of fed rate cuts by the end of next year down from 109bps previously the 2 year us treasury yield rose 10bps to 1 85 while the 10 year yield rose 8bps to 2 03 with both moving back into recent trading ranges it will be interesting to see if treasury yields can hold these gains tonight as investor participation on friday was lighter than usual after independence day while payrolls seems unlikely to be a game changer for the market it brought at least a temporary pause to the rapid decline in global rates the 10 year yields on german bunds and uk gilts increased 3 5bps and 6bps respectively on friday equity markets initially reacted negatively to the prospect of less aggressive monetary stimulus from the fed s p500 futures fell over 1 from their intraday highs before recovering over the remainder of the session to close only 0 2 lower on the day defensive stocks such as real estate and utilities which have been the beneficiaries of the recent falls in rates as investors turn their attention to dividend based stocks as an alternative to lower yielding fixed income were the underperformers on the day in contrast the kbw bank index was up 0 8 with the prospect of less aggressive fed easing perceived as more favourable for bank net interest margins unsurprisingly the usd got a boost from the payrolls release and was up around 0 5 in index terms over the past fortnight the usd appears to have found a short term base and the usd indices are now firmly back in mid range territory trump meanwhile renewed his attack on the fed claiming the central bank doesn t have a clue and accused it of having raised rates too soon too often the canadian dollar was the best performing currency within the g10 down only 0 2 against the usd after the canadian employment report showed a much stronger increase in wage growth canadian employment growth was flat on the month but this followed six months of very strong gains the market pared back its expectations of rate cuts by the bank of canada but one remains fully priced over the next 12 months the aud fell 0 6 to 0 6780 similar to the moves in the eur jpy and gbp the 5 4 in iron ore futures in singapore after the china iron and steel association asked regulators to investigate whether non market factors were behind the recent rise in prices didn t seem to have much of an impact on the aud also in australia on friday the government passed its budget tax package through the senate which our nab colleagues estimate equates to about 0 3 of annual gdp although the boost to growth is likely to be a little less if households save part of the tax offset and some is spent on imports the nzd underperformed most of the g10 on friday and closed down 0 9 at 0 6630 leaving it back in the lower half of its trading range for 2019 in the domestic rates market the 10 year swap rate fell 1bp on friday reaching a fresh record low of 1 715 on a closing basis nz rates will open higher and the curve steeper today on the trade front white house economic advisor larry kudlow confirmed that us and chinese negotiators had recently restarted dialogue over the phone and that a face to face meeting was likely at some point in the near future whether the negotiators can find a solution to the difficult structural issues that remain between the two sides is another matter and kudlow cautioned there was no timeline to reach an agreement the focus in the week ahead is powell s semi annual testimony to the house and senate on wednesday and thursday nights respectively the fed released its semi annual monetary policy report to congress on friday which reiterated that the central bank would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion the market will be listening for any clues from powell on the monetary policy outlook in light of the upside surprise to payrolls several other key fed speakers are also out this week including new york fed president john williams and chicago fed president charles evans while the minutes to the june fomc meeting are released on wednesday night the minutes to the ecb s last governing council meeting are also released this week
the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland has never been more disunited the campaign for britain to leave the european union eu has brought down prime minister theresa may and she is likely to be succeeded by boris johnson a nationalist demagogue a british version of donald trump the brexit crisis has created gulfs within the conservative and labour parties which have dominated for decades whose support and credibility is plummeting triggered by the failure of government and parliament to implement the result of the 2016 referendum when 51 9 of the electorate voted to leave the eu against 48 1 to remain the deal that may negotiated with the other 27 eu member countries has been rejected three times by parliament because so many of her own party s mps voted with the opposition johnson has promised to renegotiate an agreement but says that if as likely the eu refuses to make any serious concessions he will take the uk out without any deal though this may once again be rejected by parliament even the country s unity is in the balance scotland which voted to remain in the eu is now moving closer to achieving a majority in favour of independence if there is no negotiated deal northern ireland which also voted to remain faces the prospect of customs barriers across its borders with the republic of ireland creating massive economic problems and social tensions for people on both sides of the border the british media s coverage of the brexit crisis has focused narrowly on the immediate consequences of either leaving or staying in the eu but the current chaos reflects deeper schisms within british society which is why the present events in the uk are full of lessons for south africa and other countries it raises important issues around the nation state nationalism and internationalism european union the eu formerly the european economic community eec was formed in 1957 as an attempt by the biggest capitalist powers led by germany and france to confront the globalisation of the world economy and its domination by the usa it did not weaken the independence of separate nation states which retained all their powers to impose their rule over their population especially the working class but aimed to build a capitalist club to ensure that the ruling elites got the biggest possible share in the wealth being generated in the postwar economic boom in this they were partially successful which led to the eu s steady expansion to its present 28 member countries 1975 referendum after britain was invited to join the eec in 173 it held a referendum in 1975 in which 67 2 voted to join and 32 8 against the arguments on both sides then were similar to some of those being deployed 44 years later on the right there was a clear majority in the conservative party to join the capitalist eec reflecting the view of their paymasters in big business but they were opposed by a minority of nationalists and racists who demagogically raised the spectre of being swamped by foreign immigrants most labour party leaders lined up with the conservatives in favour of a yes vote but this argument was rejected by a majority of the working class rank and file who opposed joining what they saw as a capitalist alliance to strengthen the power of the employers hold down wages cut public spending and increase inequality this view failed to win a majority mainly because of the lack of an alternative to the eec simply being outside the eec would solve none of the workers problems what was lacking was a strong call for a socialist european federation based on genuine internationalism brexit the main difference in today s debate is that the conservative party has become even more divided and almost completely captured by the brexit faction boris johnson has used nationalist racist and xenophobic demagogy to whip up support for brexit he has lied about possible benefits from withdrawal and promised billions of pounds for education social care and the heath service despite his party having spent the last few years cutting expenditure in all these areas these divisions led to a 14 8 drop in the vote for conservatives in the may european parliament elections when it got fewer votes than four other parties yet in these same elections the labour party at a time when it should have capitalised on the government s failures to surge into the lead shed 11 3 of votes and came third just as in 1975 the party is riven with divisions between brexiters and remainers which has led to a lack of any clear policy leading to complete paralysis which will remain unless the party and trade union members intervene to adopt a clear socialist alternative the reason why so many working class voters voted for brexit was not just to leave the eu but a protest at their deteriorating quality of life inequality is widening wages in real terms are still below their level in 2007 low paid casual work and zero hour contracts are now the norm for millions of workers around four million children live in poverty household debt is at a record high knife and offensive weapon crimes have risen to their highest level for nearly a decade there has been an increase in the number of black and asian people experiencing racism the government is even planning to try and use homelessness charities to identify illegal immigrants sleeping rough so they can deport them but leaving the eu will solve none of these problems especially if carried through without any agreement with the eu which will make all these problems even worse that is why labour has to offer an internationalist socialist alternative to the eu in the form of a socialist federation of the people of europe lessons for africa similar challenges face the people of africa the most important difference however is that unlike europe its national boundaries were imposed by european imperialist powers britain france germany and portugal who were carving up the continent and plundering its natural resources the states they created were administrative structures to enslave and subjugate the people and took no account of the history languages or cultures of the people after these african states achieved political independence political power shifted to a comprador bourgeoisie who benefit from the economic structures of imperialism they are primarily concerned with protecting their class interests within the boundaries inherited from the imperialists economic power however has stayed with the imperialist powers who continued to control their former colonies to export cheap natural resources and raw materials to the former colonisers and transfer the huge profits they made into overseas tax havens frantz fanon argued that national autonomy was a prison that would turn independence into a curse for the poor and that any possibility of real human liberation required the abolition of national frontiers in a single continual movement the nationalist leaders he wrote becomes a sort of little caste avid and voracious only too glad to accept the dividends that the former colonial power hands out to it jacob zuma and his cronies are the perfect examples of this a corrupt elite who mouth radical slogans about fighting white monopoly capitalism but do nothing to act on these promises while plundering the billions of rands of the country s resources for their own enrichment they pay lip service to the idea of pan africanism but have done absolutely nothing to bring it about their austerity programmes and adoption of neoliberal policies have created desperate levels of poverty which have led to the rise of xenophobic attacks on fellow workers from other countries and calls for tighter border controls to keep out illegal immigrants the african union au is little more than a talk shop for these emerging capitalist leaders like them it proclaims to be motivated by the spirit of pan africanism and african solidarity but has neither the power nor the political will to challenge the corrupt capitalist leaders of its member states or to take any serious steps to bring down the imperialist boundaries brics is even less likely to bring any benefits for the majority of south africans it is an alliance with four capitalist powers who are united only in wanting to become new global superpowers to challenge the usa and eu workers of the world unite the african working class should have no illusions that either the au or its present governments will deliver a united continent or do anything to overthrow the capitalist monopolies which have pillaged the resources of africa and still dominate the continent s economies with their local comprador allies

most of pacificaâ s coast is armored but even with these defenses the city still had to buy out a row of bluff top homes later converting the street into a trail down by the sand more homes were

need to start doing that cost benefit analysis â said charles lester director of uc santa barbaraâ s ocean and coastal policy center who has consulted for a number of towns including pacifica on sea level rise planning â if we donâ t start managing retreat now how much is it going to cost later â in hundreds of pages of planning documents officials concluded that moving inland in future decades might pencil out to be the most cost effective option for a number of neighborhoods seawalls keep failing they said and the ocean is winning much of the shoreline protection could be overwhelmed with as little as 1 foot of sea level rise but many lambasted the proposal fired up by a property rights campaign by the real estate industry homeowners flooded city meetings knocked on neighborsâ doors and plastered signs around town the mayor became the town punching bag and new leaders were voted in to help pacifica stand its ground â â managed retreatâ is code word for give up â on our homes and the town itself â said mark stechbart who worries that pacifica and in turn his own homeâ s value will be dismissed by future developers insurers and buyers â this is not just some intellectual exercise these are real people and a real town at stake â for suzanne drake a historical society volunteer who cobbled together enough money during the recession to buy â the ugliest house on the prettiest street in town â talk of managed retreat has kicked up an anger she didnâ t know she had the words are like a scarlet letter she said how could anyone get a 30 year mortgage if city documents say the entire street might be condemned in the future and turned into a beach how will she get insurance or permits to remodel her home â the public has rights to the beach but i apparently donâ t have rights to my house â she said after one particularly heated meeting that pitted homeowners against conservationists â iâ m a left of left democrat but these environmental zealots are next level â the issue has divided this close knit town whose residents open conversations by touting the number of years theyâ ve lived here and â in recent months â by how many feet they live above sea

pacifica will become â an economic wastelandâ if the long term vision is retreat they accuse the cityâ s study of undervaluing homes businesses hiking trails and golf courses when calculating the public benefits of letting go preserving tourism businesses and development opportunities they said should play into any future plan others say pacifica has already outlived its time thereâ s a reason why an empty parcel by the water has failed for years to attract developers they said and why the taco bell can still afford prime oceanfront views how much pacifica ultimately decides to retreat both sides agree could be the litmus test for whatâ s going to happen to the rest of california one recent morning drake stood on her second story deck and talked over the roar of sand dozers clearing roads the area floods whenever waves top the seawall or thereâ s a break in the berm the city brings in a pump during the winter to push stormwater back into the ocean without that seawall or berm her neighborhood and the nearby golf course would easily flood without these kinds of defenses sewage lines wastewater treatment plants schools and other public infrastructure would be at risk advertisement what officials need to do drake said is build larger seawalls and commit to saving the town she sees pacifica on the cusp of becoming something special â a town that could finally have a nice library perhaps or a beautiful downtown with coffeehouses and places to shop the big white house next door sold not long ago for more than 1 5 million she said pacifica is still worth something so why would officials let it go city officials have heeded the backlash and rewritten their plan to address the rising sea key seawalls will be extended and the words â managed retreatâ have been

anyoneâ s home or give up on the town he just looked at the data and tried to think ahead the city has little money to build bigger seawalls no money for sand replenishment no money to compensate homeowners for the loss of their property so he reasoned that pacifica had a better shot of getting outside funding by showing it had thought through every option and come up with a plan worrying about what this planning document would do to home values is a privilege with an expiration date he fears that by 2050 â this stuff will all become moot â â weâ ll be in survival mode â he said â the other aspects of climate change are going to simply just overwhelm us as a society â he takes out his new business card embossed with the words â environmental advocate â â what kind of world â he

gotten tougher on seawalls it urged city leaders to do everything within their power to consider alternative options including managed retreat but that position has not won the commission friends

world of clear rules and clean transactions realtors are in a bind unlike other hazard zones in california there are no mandatory disclosures for homes that might be subject to relocation or other sea level rise plans in the future clearly defined disclosures would help people better understand whether the home theyâ re buying could actually be a long term investment â right now if we over disclose

going to do what sheâ s going to do and we canâ t do anything about it judy taylor california assn of realtors whatâ s debated by her industry is not so much climate change she said but how much longer owners can extend the life and value of homes â and how they can do so while navigating the bureaucratic system of coastal permits â we have dealt with property being taken for bridges for

entire shoreline â the whole region is going to need to see these trade offs on a grand scale it may well be that you wipe out beaches in one section of coast and preserve them on other sections of coast â but weâ re ill equipped for that â said aaron peskin a san francisco supervisor who serves on both the california coastal commission and san francisco bay conservation and development

what to save and what to abandon destroy a beach here to protect critical infrastructure move back elsewhere and restore a beach david revell a coastal geomorphologist who has consulted for a number of cities said this kind of policy forces leaders to consider what sacrifices could be made versus where along the coast must be defended â pick where â he said â just donâ t say everywhere â replenishing beaches a race against nature people often talk about the beach as a thing a place an area that doesnâ t move in reality a beach is more of a process imagine a river of sand moving parallel to the shore from malibu to santa monica to manhattan beach until the ocean pulls it offshore this sand is always on the move flowing down from mountain streams and waterways and stopping only temporarily on any specific beach any human disruption to this river of sand could reveal itself elsewhere pacifica may be eroding so quickly in part because of all the sand dredging farther up

del mar beach preservation coalition â and then what about the next road and the road after that â at some point everyone is going to say â no weâ re not just going to retreat away from the ocean â â city leaders finally agreed and said they would keep an open mind about relocating the rail line the fire station and other city owned infrastructure â but took out any mention of private property the land here is too valuable they reasoned and the threat of lawsuits too high adding sand will be the solution for now terry gaasterland a data scientist who led the sea level task force and ended up running for office over the issue said sheâ s confident more studies and more time will uncover ways to coexist with the ocean and save the town advertisement del mar can afford to both protect homes and save the beach said gaasterland who s now on the city council â weâ re not going to be packing our bags â but if past sand projects are any indicator del mar and its neighbors might be in for a surprise for every jetty and breakwater that has helped keep santa monica and venice wide and sandy dockweiler and beaches farther down the coast in turn needed their own supply of sand which then disappeared and flowed onto beaches farther south sand although it might seem limitless is not free itâ s the most exploited and consumed natural resource in the world after fresh water federal agencies states cities and private companies across the nation are all trying to stake their claim and because sand is always on the move adding more of it is anything but permanent erosion runs its course all the same this makes â beach nourishmentâ difficult to sustain adding 240 000 cubic yards of sand â the amount for example to make a half mile long beach about 100 feet wide â requires 24 000 dump trucks full of sand even working seven days a week it would take more than 16 months to bring in that much sand depending on how fast the sand washes away a project of this scale would need to be repeated every few years according to reports by gary griggs who has studied coastal systems across california and taught at uc santa cruzâ s institute of marine sciences for more than 50 years in 2001 officials in san diego county pumped about 2 million cubic yards of sand from offshore onto 12 beaches â the first large scale attempt by california officials to add sand to disappearing beaches it cost city state and federal taxpayers 17 5 million the effort was short lived most of the beaches had narrowed significantly by the following year the extra sand griggs found â was removed within a day when the first large waves of the winter arrived â a second attempt by the county â with twice as much money â yielded similar results a number of homes at broad beach are supported by concrete columns rock walls and sandbags have also been deployed as protection from the sea mel melcon los angeles times these costs have also paralyzed communities along malibuâ s disappearing shoreline broad beach once so wide that dunes had room to grow along the sand now hardly lives up to its name building mansions on the sand also took up about 200 feet of the beach and dunes leaving

tide â when the sun moon and earth are aligned closest together creating a higher than high tide they had alerted imperial beach which filled more than 500 sandbags just in time and warned residents to board up their homes these king tides are becoming a new normal said merrifield whose team hopes to fill in data gaps that could help more communities better understand their risks imperial beach doesnâ t even track the number of times the ocean tops the seawall â crews just clean the road before most residents wake up during the king tides in january large waves swept over seawalls and flooded streets in imperial beach with water and sand howard lipin san diego union tribune tracking the frequency of flood events and how much itâ s increasing will make these truths harder to ignore

s coastal development took place in the years after world war ii during the less stormy period of a climate cycle known as the pacific decadal oscillation favorable winds pulled warmer water offshore and the west coast had cool denser water that took up less volume â suppressing the rate of sea rise below the global average but scientists in the last decade have seen a dramatic shift the waters

managed retreat he said the town doesnâ t even have a parks department it just got its first real grocery store the city and its consultants have come up with some big ideas â but lack the political support and capital to get started buy out these first few row of homes along the coast for example and rent them at market value three decades of rent should be enough to recoup the costs the city or a land trust at that time could then decide what to do with the properties for now dedina is focused on relocating some public infrastructure and building more homes and businesses further inland heâ s also suing a number of oil companies in hopes of funding arguing that they should be held responsible for the costs of coastal flooding because their emissions contribute to sea level rise â ultimately the city canâ t protect private property owners we need to be upfront about that â he said â the insurance industry or the state needs to figure that one out â the state has taken some action but is largely still confronting this 21st century problem with decades old laws and thinking the california coastal act â the defining road map to managing the stateâ s shoreline â did not factor in sea level rise when it was written in 1976 right now managed retreat is just a slogan it needs to become a reality where we actually talk about how are we going to actually manage the retreat phil king beach economist lawmakers are aware of the problem and they have told cities they must start addressing climate adaptation in their planning but sacramento has otherwise shied away from issuing mandatory directions the california coastal commission through modest grants and some general guidance has been encouraging local officials to consider â everything in the toolkit including managed retreat â when updating city policies phil king an economist and professor at san francisco state university who has consulted for a number of beach cities said that what californians need is a clear statewide plan managed retreat sounds scary but it just means retreating with everyone knowing what the rules are he said will there be a public subsidy how is it going to be applied whoâ s going to get it and does everyone think itâ s fair bankruptcy law could be a model he said because it makes a messy process as orderly as possible managed retreat is similar dealing with a loss and making sure that everyone absorbs the loss in the most reasonable equitable way â right now managed retreat is just a slogan it needs to become a reality where we actually talk about how are we going to actually manage the retreat â said king whose studies showed that retreat does end up penciling out for many communities as the most cost effective solution in the long run â if we start to think about managed retreat today we can avoid the problems that people had with the fires in paradise where all of a sudden everything just disappears â advertisement imperial beachâ s buyback and rent proposal is one idea he said and if a seawall has to exist in the short term to protect private property or infrastructure perhaps a greater authority like the state lands commission could charge rent for it these funds could then be used toward other efforts to manage and preserve the coastline much of californiaâ s climate change efforts have centered on reducing carbon emissions and the rate of global warming rather than dealing with how to live with these increasing hazards said heather cooley research director of the pacific institute an oakland think tank that has studied the economic impact of sea level rise â we need to do both â she said â weâ re already locked into a certain amount of climate change and we need to adapt to the effects that we know we re going to be experiencing â a few bills under consideration now in sacramento acknowledge these problems â appointing a chief climate resilience officer calling for a plan to reuse dredged sand for coastal restoration projects creating an inventory of the stateâ s wetlands and a special fund for â coastal adaptation access and resilienceâ â but none tackles managed retreat head on â living shorelines â which substitute seawalls with vegetation that could serve both as protection and public open space has been gaining popularity as a less politically fraught approach some lawmakers see this as a way to buy more time as the backlash over relocation continues the fear of political suicide should not paralyze those in power from studying the how where and why of managed retreat said katharine mach a senior research scientist at stanford who has helped lead national and global climate change assessments in the same way state leaders paved the way on other environmental issues what california does now on managed retreat could help set some standards for others across the country she said jack ainsworth executive director of the coastal commission points to the work his agency has done within its legal power commissioners are tough on any new construction that gets in the way of the rising sea they passed a resolution last year pledging that seawalls would be permitted only if absolutely necessary theyâ re butting heads with homeowners and real estate groups drafting a new guidance document for cities to use to balance preserving coastal resources and protecting homes people have to understand that this is a crisis jack ainsworth california coastal commission executive director beyond that he said the commission is stuck only lawmakers can establish new disclosure laws only state city and federal leaders can determine how much money they are willing to spend to come up with a clear plan for the future and ultimately how to pay for the retreat where necessary across the state and the nation many people know the sea is coming and exactly whatâ s at risk â but no one seems ready to drop that first domino and rattle the status quo â this conspiracy of silence

buildings before disaster hits ainsworth said when staff is short or pressure comes from those wealthy enough to fight back in perpetuity the coastal commission has in the past pushed tough issues down the road but ainsworth said california cannot afford that with sea level rise â people have to understand â he said â that this is a crisis â gleason beach a lost coast a few winding turns past

the tuul river snakes through the southern edge of ulaanbaatar mongolia s sprawling capital city coiling westward until discharging into the orkhon river near the center of the orkhontuul sum and ultimately flowing into lake baikal in siberia the arctic and beyond like the onon and kherlen rivers the tuul originates in the khentii mountains near the sacred burkhan khaldun or god mountain according to the secret history of the mongols mongolia s oldest literary work chronicling the story of temujin and his rise to become genghis khan chinggis khaan the slopes of the burkhan khaldun served as a place of refuge worship governance and ultimately burial for the world conqueror in the telling of anthropologist jack weatherford chinggis khaan was more than an unprecedented and fearsome military leader he was a nation builder who embraced the rule of law protected religious freedom promoted international trade and established new diplomatic relations among the great population centers of asia and europe the mongolian empire connected a formerly disjointed world by creating a single intercontinental system of communication commerce technology and politics due to chinngis khaan the globe was shaken and a new order commenced the historian edward gibbon observed today mongolia s reach may be less grand but while the country faces significant challenges both domestically and regionally mongolia remains poised to shape the modern world indeed with the united states as its partner mongolia can overcome its obstacles and contribute to building a free and open indo pacific tough neighborhood mongolia must deal with substantial structural challenges as a landlocked country with a population of only three million the difficulty begins with geography all goods leaving or entering mongolia must traverse the territory and airspace of its two more populous and powerful neighbors russia and china the trans mongolian railway mongolia s chief rail network is single track extending nearly 700 miles from the russian border in the north to the chinese border in the south when entering china trains must switch to a new gauge a time consuming process the russian government holds a 51 percent stake in mongolia s railway an interest which hinders the development of a more efficient rail transport network in 2016 russia sold it 49 percent stake in erdenet copper mine which historically served as the country s most important economic engine but moscow maintains a tight grip on the economy supplying 90 percent of mongolia s energy refined oil this influence extends to other spheres as well a walk through ulaanbaatar reveals the lasting cultural legacies of soviet rule from the opera house to the wedding palace to the socialist murals of the zaisan memorial on the southern border sharing the wind swept sands of the gobi desert is china approximately 6 million ethnic mongols live in china s inner mongolia twice the population of mongolia proper with the world s second largest economy china receives approximately 90 percent of all mongolian exports such as coal copper and other ores crude oil and unprocessed cashmere and supplies mongolia with more than one third of its imports china is also the country s single largest source of foreign investment in the words of a congressional report china is mongolia s economic lifeline this dependency has created tensions with china that spill over into other areas for example mongolia has historic links to tibetan buddhism and the dalai lama a title first created by mongolian leader altan khan in the 16th century in retaliation for the dalai lama s visits to mongolia china has temporarily shut its borders with mongolia and in 2016 enacted tariffs on mongolian products after forcing a promise from ulaanbaatar not to invite the dalai lama in the future china s foreign ministry boasted we hope that mongolia has taken this lesson to heart expanding the geography one lesson learned is to expand the neighborhood mongolia has turned to third neighbors aligned countries that do not share contiguous borders with mongolia for economic engagement and strategic support for example through strong relationships with democratic third neighbors such as japan and south korea mongolia is working to strengthen stability and cooperation in the region uranium rich mongolia has been active in supporting nuclear non proliferation and the peaceful resolution of disputes in northeast asia in this regard mongolia which balances diplomatic ties with both north and south korea has sought to foster stability on the korean peninsula in early june during the 6th ulaanbaatar dialogue on northeast asian security japanese delegates actively sought out north korean counterparts to lay the foundation for future negotiations on denuclearization of the nearby korean peninsula japan s efforts are particularly noticeable after the collapse of american summit diplomacy in danang although tokyo s shuttle diplomacy may be more cautious after japanese prime minister shinzo abe s ill fated trip to tehran mongolia describes the united states as its most important third neighbor and has leveraged its relationship with washington to shape events on a global scale for instance in june mongolia and the united states co sponsored the 17th iteration of khaan quest a military exercise simulating united nations peacekeeping operations involving contingents from 31 countries ranging from australia to zambia admiral philip s davidson commander of u s indo pacific command arrived in mongolia to open the event and underscored the geopolitical significance of mongolia khaan quest also supports the country s ongoing participation in united nations global peacekeeping operations around 10 percent of mongolia s armed forces are serving in oversees un peacekeeping operations the interoperability and capacity of the mongolian military has also been strengthened through important contributions to u s military and coalition campaigns in afghanistan iraq and kosovo ulaanbaatar and washington have also supported shared goals and values in partnerships on the international stage for example mongolia has held the chairmanship of the u s supported community of democracies an intergovernmental organization based in warsaw that advocates for common democratic values the countries have also cooperated in the asean regional forum at the united nations mongolia has proven a reliable ally of the united states consistently voting with the u s in general assembly resolutions mongolia has also curried america s favor by enforcing u n security council sanctions targeting north korea s unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs as recognized in the recent u s department of defense s indo pacific strategy report at the same time ulaanbaatar has sought to leverage its position to facilitate discourse between washington and pyongyang over the years the ulaanbaatar dialogue has provided a discrete forum for track one and track two diplomacy as the only country in asia to transition from communism to democracy and as a verified nuclear weapons free zone mongolia would be an intriguing locale should there ever be another u s dprk leadership summit the weight of american power also affects the balance of mongolia s third neighbor policy specifically mongolia has reportedly resisted becoming a full member of the shanghai cooperation organization sco led by moscow and beijing due in part to the signal it may send to washington and other western capitals similar deliberations and ambivalence impact ulaanbaatar s potential participation in china s belt and road initiative bri indeed by strengthening ties with the united states mongolia can resist the push and pull of the region and chart its own course in foreign affairs strengthening the bond during mongolian prime minister ukhnaagiin khürelsükh s official visit to washington in september 2018 the countries announced the u s mongolia expanded comprehensive partnership which signaled a deepening of the bilateral relationship particularly in economic and commercial ties the timing was appropriate since 2013 with the drop in global commodity prices and china s economic slowdown mongolia has experienced a relative economic slump ulaanbaatar s skyline may be dotted with tower cranes but according to my conversations with locals many of those construction projects have been stalled since the earlier boom period american foreign investment and trade can provide a means for lifting mongolia s economy on june 3 2019 in ulaanbaatar during a meeting of the american chamber of commerce for mongolia amcham u s ambassador michael klecheski highlighted several challenges for achieving this objective first and foremost mongolia must resolve and make clear its position on oyu tolgoi the mega mining project in the south commonly referred to as ot ot is jointly owned by the government of mongolia 34 percent and turquoise hill resources 66 percent of which rio tinto owns 51 percent access to what may be one of the largest copper deposits in the world could be a boon for ulaanbaatar which relies on mining revenues to fund at least 30 percent of the national budget however in a bow to economic nationalism mongolia s parliament has called for renegotiating the terms of ot to seek an increase the government s ownership stake thereby injecting uncertainty into the regulatory environment and delaying implementation of the mining development s second phase in addition to united states export import bank financing the u s government must also consider its 35 percent american equity ownership stake in ot u s ambassador michael klecheski described ot as a bellwether for foreign investors a test of the prospect for tapping the country s estimated 1 3 trillion mineral wealth the very future of mongolia second washington is seeking full implementation of the bilateral transparency agreement signed in 2013 and entered into force in 2017 designed to improve mongolia s investment climate the agreement makes new laws and regulations affecting international commerce subject to a 60 day public comment period and requires those laws to be published in english similar to the u s federal rulemaking process the office of the u s trade representative ustr described the transparency agreement as representing the first time that the united states has concluded a stand alone agreement addressing transparency in matters related to international trade and investment during discussions under the trade and investment framework agreement tifa in april the ustr raised concerns that mongolia was behind schedule in setting up the electronic system for notice and comment rulemaking and ambassador klecheksi raised the issue again at the amcham meeting third and more broadly mongolia must show progress in battling corruption making regulatory decision making less opaque transparency international the non governmental organization that measures public corruption ranked mongolia 93 out of 180 countries under the 2018 corruption perception index alongside kosovo macedonia and albania in eastern europe and panama and columbia in the americas in its most recent statement on the investment climate the u s embassy in ulaanbaatar urged mongolia to stem constant non transparent amending of legal and regulatory rules which frustrates mongolia s ability to stabilize its business environment and risks losing the fdi mongolia needs to grow by taking steps such as out the pervasive corruption threatening the foundational institutions of democracy such actions would also help mongolia with demands called for under its program with international monetary fund the united states is attempting to assist in the public reform process by training judges and prosecutors and awarding a second millennial challenge corporation compact worth 350 million the compact will support economic development by improving the water supply of ulaanbaatar but more can be done for example through the global procurement initiative the u s trade and development agency can assist mongolia with instituting best practices for procurement and avoid the debt traps and corruption that may be associated with other forms of infrastructure development in the region in addition washington can explore using new authority under the so called build act signed into law by president trump last september to provide alternative investment sources and technical assistance for infrastructure projects interestingly the u s congress has taken the lead in furthering the economic bond with mongolia on april 10 2019 congressman ted yoho r fl re introduced the mongolia third neighbor trade act h r 2219 which authorizes duty free treatment for certain articles imported from mongolia namely cashmere wool mongolia produces over a third of the world s raw cashmere but most mongolian raw cashmere is exported to china and the united states buys nearly all of its cashmere products from china through this legislation congressman yoho and like minded bipartisan allies like senator ben cardin d md are seeking to bypass china increase trade between the united states and mongolia and strengthen mongolia s economic sovereignty amcham members visited washington in late june to meet with the trump administration and congressional leaders to push for the new law jay liotta who serves on amcham s advisory board and has been on the ground in mongolia for the past two decades described to me the significance of the legislation the third neighbor trade act will build a direct relationship between the american consumer and the mongolian people who currently rely upon the industry to provide income to over 100 000 people 90 percent of whom are women and 80 percent of whom are people below the age of 35 indeed if mongolia is to build its future consolidate its democracy and avoid the resource curse the country will need to diversify its economy and the united states is in a position to help old story new image if you follow the tuul s stony riverbed to the outskirts of ulaanbaatar you arrive at chinggis khaan international airport in the terminal above the comings and goings of the modern world hangs a portrait of the 13th century hero with a benevolent gaze one irony is that chinggis khaan himself never allowed his own portrait to be drawn during his lifetime so his serene repose is merely artistic fancy another is that the impact of mongolia on the contemporary globe if not misunderstood is widely underappreciated this legacy like the future of mongolia is changing before our eyes after nearly 70 years as a soviet satellite state the country has made a peaceful transition to democracy and embraced free market reforms mongolia is now authoring a new chapter in world history in partnership with the united states mongolia can retell an old story with a new image that of a 21st century state that upholds the rule of law promotes tolerance encourages international trade and bridges diplomatic relations among divided nations with the promise on its horizon beneath its eternal blue sky perhaps mongolia will someday be said to have left the world shaken once again that would be an irony worth pursuing roncevert ganan almond is a partner and vice president at the wicks group and adjunct professor of law at georgetown university law center in washington d c he has counseled government

leer en espaã ol the california coast grew and prospered during a remarkable moment in history when the sea was at its tamest but the mighty pacific unbeknownst to all was nearing its final years of a calm but unusual cycle that had lulled dreaming settlers into a false sense of endless summer elsewhere miami has been drowning louisiana shrinking north carolinaâ s beaches disappearing like a time lapse with no ending while other regions grappled with destructive waves and rising seas the west coast for decades was spared by a rare confluence of favorable winds and cooler water this â sea level rise suppression â as scientists call it went largely undetected blinded from the consequences of a warming planet californians kept building right to the waterâ s edge advertisement but lines in the sand are meant to shift in the last 100 years the sea rose less than 9 inches in california by the end of this century the surge could be greater than 9 feet wildfire and drought dominate the climate change debates in the state yet this less talked about reality has california cornered the coastline is eroding with every tide and storm but everything built before we knew better â pacific coast highway multimillion dollar homes in malibu the rail line to san diego â is fixed in place with nowhere to go but the world is getting hotter the great ice sheets still melting the rising ocean a slow moving disaster that has already swept past californiaâ s front door seaside cliffs are crumbling in pacifica bringing down entire buildings balboa island barely above sea level is spending 1 8 million to raise the wall that separates it from the ocean winter storms pummeled a capistrano beach boardwalk turning the idyllic shoreline into a construction zone as bulldozers rushed to stack boulders into a barricade from san diego to humboldt counties homeowners scramble to fend off increasing erosion and storm surges pleading with officials for bigger seawalls that can hold back the even bigger ocean there are only so many ways to play against the rising sea seawalls are one option but they come with a hidden cost â forcing the sand before them to wash away for every new seawall protecting a home or a road a beach for the people is sacrificed adding sand to disappearing beaches is another tactic but that race against nature lasts only so long as thereâ s money and enough sand then thereâ s what scientists and economists and number crunching consultants call â managed retreatâ move back relocate essentially cede the land to nature these words alone have roiled the few cities bold enough to utter them mayors have been ousted planning documents rewritten campaigns waged over the very thought of turning prime real estate back into dunes and beaches retreat is as un american as it gets neighborhood groups declared to win california must defend but at what cost should california become one long wall of concrete against the ocean will there still be sandy beaches

slowly warming water â but refuse to confront the reality of the sea as it pushes deeper into our cities weâ ve all played by the shore and built castles in the sand but seem to forget what happens next the ocean always wins pacifica a town on the edge on the bluffs and shores of pacifica a postcard stretch of coastal hamlets just south of san francisco residents fear that planning for sea level rise means condemning their own community to extinction here what other cities in california are only beginning to worry about in the abstract is already a much lived reality powerful waves crest over the main pier and threaten roads with names such as beach boulevard and shoreview avenue blasts of sand batter walls and homes windows shatter cliffs collapse residents bear witness to entire chunks of hillside crumbling into the surf below in one part of town the ocean chewed away more than 90 feet of bluff in less than a decade people were able to walk pacifica as an entire stretch of beach in the 1970s but the open shoreline shrank over the years as the city built seawalls piled rocks coated its fragile sandstone cliffs with special concrete to protect what nature was taking by force today most of pacificaâ s coast is armored but even with these defenses the city still had to buy out a row of bluff top homes later converting the street into a trail down by the sand more homes were removed and a public parking lot rebuilt 50 feet farther inland along beach boulevard signs caution dog walkers and joggers that waves may break over the seawall the pavement is often wet from high surf cars are urged to keep moving locals are wise enough to not linger too long by the aging pier a woman who did was hit in 2006 by a wave that blew over when she was finally able to breathe and open her eyes she was stunned to find she had been swept to the back of someoneâ s garage her arm hooked through a barbecue pit the shocks continued years of drought followed by heavy storms in 2016 forced more than a dozen bluff top residences to be tagged as unsafe three apartment buildings â suddenly dangling off the edge â could not be saved and were demolished remnants of a bluff top apartment building in pacifica fell down to the beach where large rocks form a barrier against the rising sea carolyn cole los angeles times if we donâ t start managing retreat now how much is it going to cost later charles lester director of uc santa barbaraâ s ocean and coastal policy center responding to just this most recent el niã o season has cost pacifica 16 million â no small change for a town whose 36 million operating budget relies mostly on property taxes officials are still seeking funds to cover damage from 2016 and remain mired in an eminent domain battle over two of the buildings pacifica has become this story of unplanned forced retreat experts say and the public got stuck with the bill â thereâ s a public cost and a private cost in any choice that we make and we need to start doing that cost benefit analysis â said charles lester director of uc santa barbaraâ s ocean and coastal policy center who has consulted for a number of towns including pacifica on sea level rise planning â if we donâ t start managing retreat now how much is it going to cost later â in hundreds of pages of planning documents officials concluded that moving inland in future decades might pencil out to be the most cost effective option for a number of neighborhoods seawalls keep failing they said and the ocean is winning much of the shoreline protection could be overwhelmed with as little as 1 foot of sea level rise but many lambasted the proposal fired up by a property rights campaign by the real estate industry homeowners flooded city meetings knocked on neighborsâ doors and plastered signs around town the mayor became the town punching bag and new leaders were voted in to help pacifica stand its ground â â managed retreatâ is code word for give up â on our homes and the town itself â said mark stechbart who worries that pacifica and in turn his own homeâ s value will be dismissed by future developers insurers and buyers â this is not just some intellectual exercise these are real people and a real town at stake â for suzanne drake a historical society volunteer who cobbled together enough money during the recession to buy â the ugliest house on the prettiest street in town â talk of managed retreat has kicked up an anger she didnâ t know she had the words are like a scarlet letter she said how could anyone get a 30 year mortgage if city documents say the entire street might be condemned in the future and turned into a beach how will she get insurance or permits to remodel her home â the public has rights to the beach but i apparently donâ t have rights to my house â she said after one particularly heated meeting that pitted homeowners against conservationists â iâ m a left of left democrat but these environmental zealots are next level â the issue has divided this close knit town whose residents open conversations by touting the number of years theyâ ve lived here and â in recent months â by how many feet they live above sea level outbursts at council meetings have become the norm and depending on whoâ s angriest that day environmentalists the real estate industry the city or the california coastal commission is enemy no 1 advertisement the specter of managed retreat has galvanized retired engineers policy wonks â even the president of the local democrats club â to speak alongside real estate groups worried that pacifica will become â an economic wastelandâ if the long term vision is retreat they accuse the cityâ s study of undervaluing homes businesses hiking trails and golf courses when calculating the public benefits of letting go preserving tourism businesses and development opportunities they said should play into any future plan others say pacifica has already outlived its time thereâ s a reason why an empty parcel by the water has failed for years to attract developers they said and why the taco bell can still afford prime oceanfront views how much pacifica ultimately decides to retreat both sides agree could be the litmus test for whatâ s going to happen to the rest of california one recent morning drake stood on her second story deck and talked over the roar of sand dozers clearing roads the area floods whenever waves top the seawall or thereâ s a break in the berm the city brings in a pump during the winter to push stormwater back into the ocean without that seawall or berm her neighborhood and the nearby golf course would easily flood without these kinds of defenses sewage lines wastewater treatment plants schools and other public infrastructure would be at risk advertisement what officials need to do drake said is build larger seawalls and commit to saving the town she sees pacifica on the cusp of becoming something special â a town that could finally have a nice library perhaps or a beautiful downtown with coffeehouses and places to shop the big white house next door sold not long ago for more than 1 5 million she said pacifica is still worth something so why would officials let it go city officials have heeded the backlash and rewritten their plan to address the rising sea key seawalls will be extended and the words â managed retreatâ have been

anyoneâ s home or give up on the town he just looked at the data and tried to think ahead the city has little money to build bigger seawalls no money for sand replenishment no money to compensate homeowners for the loss of their property so he reasoned that pacifica had a better shot of getting outside funding by showing it had thought through every option and come up with a plan worrying about what this planning document would do to home values is a privilege with an expiration date he fears that by 2050 â this stuff will all become moot â â weâ ll be in survival mode â he said â the other aspects of climate change are going to simply just overwhelm us as a society â he takes out his new business card embossed with the words â environmental advocate â â what kind of world â he

protection at what cost your home is your castle the biggest investment most families make so the impulse of course is to defend it the go to tactic is the seawall made from piles of boulders gunite coated cliffs or concrete slabs as high as two stories seawalls dissipate wave energy and fend off surging water but these defenses arenâ t cheap a single homeowner can spend as much as 200 000 a mile long wall can cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars repairs sometimes cost as much as the wall itself defending the entire state could cost homeowners and taxpayers more than 22 billion in the next 20 years if the sea rises even a moderate amount according to a recent study by the center for climate integrity and each seawall is a choice conscious or not to sacrifice the beach in front the

level rise doesnâ t just impact homeowners it impacts every person who wants to go to the beach â and the beach state law declares belongs to everyone so the coastal commission in recent years has gotten tougher on seawalls it urged city leaders to do everything within their power to consider alternative options including managed retreat but that position has not won the commission friends

hits judy taylor a state director of the california assn of realtors who has lived along the coast in the half moon bay area for 45 years said uncertainty over sea level rise planning has upended her world of clear rules and clean transactions realtors are in a bind unlike other hazard zones in california there are no mandatory disclosures for homes that might be subject to relocation or other sea level rise plans in the future clearly defined disclosures would help people better understand whether the home theyâ re buying could actually be a long term investment â right now if we over disclose itâ s going to sabotage the seller s transaction â taylor said â if we under disclose then the buyer is going to have serious heartburn â we have never before dealt with the fact that mother natureâ s going to do what sheâ s going to do and we canâ t do anything about it judy taylor california assn of realtors whatâ s debated by her industry is not so much climate change she said but how much longer owners can extend the life and value of homes â and how they can do so while navigating the bureaucratic system of coastal permits â we have dealt with property being taken for bridges for roads for even shopping centers but we have never before dealt with the fact that mother natureâ s going to do what sheâ s going to do and we canâ t do anything about it â taylor said â so how do we

voters for 425 million to lay the foundation for a bigger seawall last fall 82 of them said yes â a huge feat in a world where shelling out this much money usually comes only after a big disaster

only so many and even with 120 million which bought out 300 homes on staten island that funding would probably amount to 10 or so homes in malibu after years of deliberation san francisco finally agreed to take down the rock wall remove two lanes of the coastal highway and turn the open space into a coastal trail even this plan for retreat came with some compromises a shorter â low profile

who led spurâ s ocean beach master plan â but if you start early it can be considerably less painful â than waiting for a crisis â officials have since convened a sea level rise task force created an action plan established new regional strategies finding the long term answers many now say requires thinking beyond parcel by parcel and instead coordinating across city boundaries and looking at the entire shoreline â the whole region is going to need to see these trade offs on a grand scale it may well be that you wipe out beaches in one section of coast and preserve them on other sections of coast â but weâ re ill equipped for that â said aaron peskin a san francisco supervisor who serves on both the california coastal commission and san francisco bay conservation and development commission â itâ s either planned retreat or unplanned retreat one way or another weâ ll have to give something up so if weâ re going to do it right shouldn t we have a sensible set of plans â big picture planning has proved possible elsewhere in the state of washington leaders are pledging no overall net loss of the coastâ s remaining wetlands a similar approach in california could help decide what to save and what to abandon destroy a beach here to protect critical infrastructure move back elsewhere and restore a beach david revell a coastal geomorphologist who has consulted for a number of cities said this kind of policy forces leaders to consider what sacrifices could be made versus where along the coast must be defended â pick where â he said â just donâ t say everywhere â replenishing beaches a race against nature people often talk about the beach as a thing a place an area that doesnâ t move in reality a beach is more of a process imagine a river of sand moving parallel to the shore from malibu to santa monica to manhattan beach until the ocean pulls it offshore this sand is always on the move flowing down from mountain streams and waterways and stopping only temporarily on any specific beach any human disruption to this river of sand could reveal itself elsewhere pacifica may be eroding so quickly in part because of all the sand dredging farther up the coast in san francisco bay many malibu beaches have lost significant amounts of sand after the building of pacific coast highway in santa monica fresh sediment rarely reaches the coast now that humans have dammed up the creeks and turned the l a river into a concrete channel advertisement los angeles responded to these alterations of nature with more alterations adding sand to the beach began as early as the 1930s in santa monica bay breakwaters jetties and other retention structures have also been constructed to help hold in all the sand as a result these iconic beaches are 150 to 500 feet wider than normal beach towns like del mar a tiny affluent enclave north of san diego have all but declared this to be their survival tactic tucked among sandstone bluffs two lagoons and the

retreating residents demanded where do you stop â if you let the first row of homes go the whole area behind it floods â said jon corn a resident and attorney representing dozens of homeowners in the del mar beach preservation coalition â and then what about the next road and the road after that â at some point everyone is going to say â no weâ re not just going to retreat away from the ocean â â city leaders finally agreed and said they would keep an open mind about relocating the rail line the fire station and other city owned infrastructure â but took out any mention of private property the land here is too valuable they reasoned and the threat of lawsuits too high adding sand will be the solution for now terry gaasterland a data scientist who led the sea level task force and ended up running for office over the issue said sheâ s confident more studies and more time will uncover ways to coexist with the ocean and save the town advertisement del mar can afford to both protect homes and save the beach said gaasterland who s now on the city council â weâ re not going to be packing our bags â but if past sand projects are any indicator del mar and its neighbors might be in for a surprise for every jetty and breakwater that has helped keep santa monica and venice wide and sandy dockweiler and beaches farther down the coast in turn needed their own supply of sand which then disappeared and flowed onto beaches farther south sand although it might seem limitless is not free itâ s the most exploited and consumed natural resource in the world after fresh water federal agencies states cities and private companies across the nation are all trying to stake their claim and because sand is always on the move adding more of it is anything but permanent erosion runs its course all the same this makes â beach nourishmentâ difficult to sustain adding 240 000 cubic yards of sand â the amount for example to make a half mile long beach about 100 feet wide â requires 24 000 dump trucks full of sand even working seven days a week it would take more than 16 months to bring in that much sand depending on how fast the sand washes away a project of this scale would need to be repeated every few years according to reports by gary griggs who has studied coastal systems across california and taught at uc santa cruzâ s institute of marine sciences for more than 50 years in 2001 officials in san diego county pumped about 2 million cubic yards of sand from offshore onto 12 beaches â the first large scale attempt by california officials to add sand to disappearing beaches it cost city state and federal taxpayers 17 5 million the effort was short lived most of the beaches had narrowed significantly by the following year the extra sand griggs found â was removed within a day when the first large waves of the winter arrived â a second attempt by the county â with twice as much money â yielded similar results a number of homes at broad beach are supported by concrete columns rock walls and sandbags have also been deployed as protection from the sea mel melcon los angeles times these costs have also paralyzed communities along malibuâ s disappearing shoreline broad beach once so wide that dunes had room to grow along the sand now hardly lives up to its name building mansions on the sand also took up about 200 feet of the beach and dunes leaving

california cities spriggs sees whatâ s been happening across the state and calls managed retreat an ideology being pushed by extreme environmentalists with no rules or standards â nobody has explained how urbanized managed retreat works what it would look like and how it would be paid for â he said â we need time to build a consensus we donâ t even have money for â more detailed studies on what the

devoured more than 3 feet of sand in one morning high surf and king tides in january flooded the southern end of seacoast drive in imperial beach howard lipin san diego union tribune â when that surge came over the seawall it was just a blanket of water there was so much force â said mark merrifield director of scrippsâ center for climate change impacts and adaptation â it was just crazy â his team has been studying ways to forecast floods and were watching that morning because they knew the waves would be particularly powerful their data had projected that this would come just ahead of a king tide â when the sun moon and earth are aligned closest together creating a higher than high tide they had alerted imperial beach which filled more than 500 sandbags just in time and warned residents to board up their homes these king tides are becoming a new normal said merrifield whose team hopes to fill in data gaps that could help more communities better understand their risks imperial beach doesnâ t even track the number of times the ocean tops the seawall â crews just clean the road before most residents wake up during the king tides in january large waves swept over seawalls and flooded streets in imperial beach with water and sand howard lipin san diego union tribune tracking the frequency of flood events and how much itâ s increasing will make these truths harder to ignore thereâ s no debate he said â sea level rise is the heart of climate change thatâ s â where all the heat is going into the ocean â that rising ocean for decades had spared california much of the stateâ s coastal development took place in the years after world war ii during the less stormy period of a climate cycle known as the pacific decadal oscillation favorable winds pulled warmer water offshore and the west coast had cool denser water that took up less volume â suppressing the rate of sea rise below the global average but scientists in the last decade have seen a dramatic shift the waters off the west coast are now much warmer the sea is now rising faster here than elsewhere in the world the morning after the worst of the surge imperial beach mayor serge dedina parked his prius and

managed retreat he said the town doesnâ t even have a parks department it just got its first real grocery store the city and its consultants have come up with some big ideas â but lack the political support and capital to get started buy out these first few row of homes along the coast for example and rent them at market value three decades of rent should be enough to recoup the costs the city or a land trust at that time could then decide what to do with the properties for now dedina is focused on relocating some public infrastructure and building more homes and businesses further inland heâ s also suing a number of oil companies in hopes of funding arguing that they should be held responsible for the costs of coastal flooding because their emissions contribute to sea level rise â ultimately the city canâ t protect private property owners we need to be upfront about that â he said â the insurance industry or the state needs to figure that one out â the state has taken some action but is largely still confronting this 21st century problem with decades old laws and thinking the california coastal act â the defining road map to managing the stateâ s shoreline â did not factor in sea level rise when it was written in 1976 right now managed retreat is just a slogan it needs to become a reality where we actually talk about how are we going to actually manage the retreat phil king beach economist lawmakers are aware of the problem and they have told cities they must start addressing climate adaptation in their planning but sacramento has otherwise shied away from issuing mandatory directions the california coastal commission through modest grants and some general guidance has been encouraging local officials to consider â everything in the toolkit including managed retreat â when updating city policies phil king an economist and professor at san francisco state university who has consulted for a number of beach cities said that what californians need is a clear statewide plan managed retreat sounds scary but it just means retreating with everyone knowing what the rules are he said will there be a public subsidy how is it going to be applied whoâ s going to get it and does everyone think itâ s fair bankruptcy law could be a model he said because it makes a messy process as orderly as possible managed retreat is similar dealing with a loss and making sure that everyone absorbs the loss in the most reasonable equitable way â right now managed retreat is just a slogan it needs to become a reality where we actually talk about how are we going to actually manage the retreat â said king whose studies showed that retreat does end up penciling out for many communities as the most cost effective solution in the long run â if we start to think about managed retreat today we can avoid the problems that people had with the fires in paradise where all of a sudden everything just disappears â advertisement imperial beachâ s buyback and rent proposal is one idea he said and if a seawall has to exist in the short term to protect private property or infrastructure perhaps a greater authority like the state lands commission could charge rent for it these funds could then be used toward other efforts to manage and preserve the coastline much of californiaâ s climate change efforts have centered on reducing carbon emissions and the rate of global warming rather than dealing with how to live with these increasing hazards said heather cooley research director of the pacific institute an oakland think tank that has studied the economic impact of sea level rise â we need to do both â she said â weâ re already locked into a certain amount of climate change and we need to adapt to the effects that we know we re going to be experiencing â a few bills under consideration now in sacramento acknowledge these problems â appointing a chief climate resilience officer calling for a plan to reuse dredged sand for coastal restoration projects creating an inventory of the stateâ s wetlands and a special fund for â coastal adaptation access and resilienceâ â but none tackles managed retreat head on â living shorelines â which substitute seawalls with vegetation that could serve both as protection and public open space has been gaining popularity as a less politically fraught approach some lawmakers see this as a way to buy more time as the backlash over relocation continues the fear of political suicide should not paralyze those in power from studying the how where and why of managed retreat said katharine mach a senior research scientist at stanford who has helped lead national and global climate change assessments in the same way state leaders paved the way on other environmental issues what california does now on managed retreat could help set some standards for others across the country she said jack ainsworth executive director of the coastal commission points to the work his agency has done within its legal power commissioners are tough on any new construction that gets in the way of the rising sea they passed a resolution last year pledging that seawalls would be permitted only if absolutely necessary theyâ re butting heads with homeowners and real estate groups drafting a new guidance document for cities to use to balance preserving coastal resources and protecting homes people have to understand that this is a crisis jack ainsworth california coastal commission executive director beyond that he said the commission is stuck only lawmakers can establish new disclosure laws only state city and federal leaders can determine how much money they are willing to spend to come up with a clear plan for the future and ultimately how to pay for the retreat where necessary across the state and the nation many people know the sea is coming and exactly whatâ s at risk â but no one seems ready to drop that first domino and rattle the status quo â this conspiracy of silence â as one economist from the union of concerned scientists publicly called it can go on for only so long society as a whole saves 6 in avoided costs for every 1 spent to acquire or demolish flood prone buildings before disaster hits ainsworth said when staff is short or pressure comes from those wealthy enough to fight back in perpetuity the coastal commission has in the past pushed tough issues down the road but ainsworth said california cannot afford that with sea level rise â people have to understand â he said â that this is a crisis â gleason beach a lost coast a few winding turns past

its capital city roots back to 1932 when present day owner daniel d aprile s grandfather opened a bustling market that became a mainstay on one of hartford s most vibrant small business corridors however things changed dramatically over the decades shifting demographics a shrinking customer base and higher rents all made doing business in hartford more difficult daniel d aprile said in a

only bifurcated property tax system in which commercial property owners pay a higher tax rate than residential homeowners hartford s challenges are a statewide concern because the city s fortunes are directly tied to the state s especially as more employers and skilled workers want to be in or near vibrant cities despite its challenges some business leaders are still bullish about hartford s future especially given downtown s new vibrancy in recent years helped by the additions of dunkin donuts park uconn s west hartford campus a fledgling tech scene and about 1 500 new apartment units i m more optimistic about hartford s increasing attractiveness as a location for companies due to the urbanization trend said jon putnam executive director of commercial realty broker cushman wakefield a long decline the start of the decline of hartford s property tax base and system can be traced to the mid 20th century when the city like many others in connecticut and across the u s was going through major economic and demographic shifts as more people moved to the suburbs that squeezed out a large portion of hartford s middle class and the affluence that went along with it the city s manufacturing and industrial base also began to shrink while its impoverished populace grew leading to higher city government costs as taxes rose to compensate more properties also shifted to nonprofit ownership that came on top of the enormous share of city property already owned by tax exempt institutions like colleges hospitals sewage plants and even the state itself over the past half century the portion of hartford s tax exempt grand list has more than doubled state government reimburses the city for some of its tax exempt property but it doesn t come close to filling the gap city government too has exacerbated the problem over the decades by overborrowing making pension promises whose costs have outpaced grand list growth and then kicking the can down the road either through short term and costly debt restructurings or by raising taxes however bronin who is running for reelection this year said much larger structural issues have been the leading cause of hartford s fiscal stress at the root of the problem is the fundamental flaw of having an 18 square mile city with an enormous concentration of non taxable property and intense concentration of poverty and asking that city to run itself on only one local source of revenue he said referring to the fact that municipalities in connecticut are only allowed to raise revenue through the property tax in addition to permit and other fees the biggest problem is that you have a city built on the tax base of a suburb that from the start is a structural flaw that has all kinds of consequences bronin said his administration is running a very lean government and has made deep cuts over the last few years the city council just passed the mayor s 573 2 million budget for fiscal 2020 which does raise spending by 3 2 million but doesn t rely on borrowing and keeps the city s workforce excluding public safety personnel 11 percent below 2015 levels notably since taking office in 2016 bronin has also managed to not increase the city s sky high mill rate out of whack property taxes hartford s financial and economic instability over the years have birthed arguably the most dysfunctional commercial property tax structure this state has seen in the last half century besides the exorbitant mill rate hartford is the only connecticut municipality allowed to assess commercial property at a higher tax rate to calculate any property tax bill in connecticut owners must multiply their property s assessed value by a city s or town s mill rate and then divide by 1 000 in the 1970s connecticut passed a law requiring municipalities to adopt a 70 percent assessment ratio that means to determine the assessed value of a property whether it s a single family home commercial property or apartment assessors multiply its market value by 70 percent by the late 1970s hartford faced a crisis the city was in the middle of its first revaluation in 17 years and many residential properties experienced a significant spike in value if all properties were assessed at the same level some homeowners faced average tax increases of well over 80 percent which was deemed practically and politically untenable so city officials hatched an agreement with state policymakers that among other things allowed hartford to lower its residential assessment ratio to 45 8 percent that shielded homeowners from a major tax hike while leaving commercial property owners with a higher tax rate that initial bifurcated tax structure was actually phased out by 1986 but adopted again in 2006 and remains in place today commercial and apartment properties are assessed at 70 percent of value while single family homes are assessed at 35 percent there is a formula in place that gradually raises the residential assessment ratio to 70 percent but it will take decades before that happens said city assessor john s philip one source of hartford s problems over the years is that it often waited long periods between revaluations when that coincided with wild swings in the real estate market it led to dramatic changes in assessed property values for example hartford waited 10 years before conducting its 1998 1999 reval which shrank the city s grand list 38 percent to 3 6 billion while the mill rate jumped from 29 50 to 47 the grand list nosedived because assessed property values hadn t fully taken into account the effects of the late 1980s and early 1990s savings and loan crisis which put connecticut and the nation into recession hartford s mill rate has stabilized since 2011 there have been no tax increases under the bronin administration but the mill rate went on a consistent and steady climb at the turn of the 21st century going from 29 50 in 1998 to its current 74 29 mills today creating a desirable city despite hartford s tax burden the city particularly downtown has seen noticeable development and investment in recent years most of it however has been subsidized by the state or is the beneficiary of city tax breaks still many employers find it necessary to have a hartford presence especially as millennials and others desire urban settings where they can live work and play in fact hartford has seen some employers move from the suburbs to downtown in recent years to be closer to a wider talent pool and the various amenities the city offers the vacancy rate for class a office space downtown is 17 7 percent down from 25 5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 according to commercial realty firm cbre the city s overall office vacancy rate fell from 26 1 percent to 16 5 percent over that same period the state s purchase of two major office towers and the conversion of vacant office buildings into apartments have helped lower the vacancy rate meanwhile the grand list despite being well below historical highs is up 23 percent since 2006 the city lately has also attracted out of state realty investment including from new york landlord shelbourne global solutions llc shelbourne has invested more than 200 million since 2014 to buy up some of downtown hartford s most prized office towers cementing it as one of the center city s most prominent landlords most recently it teamed up with hartford parking giant laz parking to buy the city s iconic gold building skyscraper for 70 5 million shelbourne managing member ben schlossberg said his group finds the city attractive because it s walkable uniquely located between new york and boston and has a strong corporate and higher education presence however he is also cognizant of hartford s high tax rate shelbourne sued the city a few years ago after its appeal for lower property taxes on several of its recently revalued buildings was denied it eventually brokered a tax break deal with the city to resolve the issue without that helping hand some of shelbourne s properties would have gone into foreclosure schlossberg said an issue familiar to downtown especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we are very excited about what is going on in hartford schlossberg said however he added the state needs to find a way to lower the mill rate which is oppressive travelers cos is one employer that has made significant investment in hartford in recent years the property and casualty insurer spent about 55 million giving its famous travelers tower office high rise and campus a facelift it s currently spending millions more to spruce up its interior offices the company was also one of three insurers in addition to the hartford and aetna to promise a combined 50 million donation to the city over five years to help hartford deal with its budget crisis travelers which is the second highest taxpayer in the city with 143 2 million in assessed real estate and property is aware of the high property tax rate but is also bullish about hartford s future said andy bessette the company s executive vice president and chief administrative officer he said companies look at more than just taxes when deciding where to locate and he s attracted to hartford because of the insurance talent here and the quality of life and amenities the region offers bessette also sits on the board of the capital region development authority which has helped finance development of 1 500 apartment units downtown in recent years that along with a growing innovation ecosystem has added to the center city s vibrancy do we care about property taxes absolutely bessette said adding he recognizes that the high tax rate might impact small and midsize companies more than a large corporation would you like to have them

first a review of last week s events eur usd as forecasted the meeting of us president donald trump with prc president xi jinping on the final day of the osaka summit did not put an end to the trade war the leaders were able to agree only on a respite in the hostilities and the resumption of trade and economic consultations however this result was perceived by the market with moderate optimism the dollar was strengthening its positions for the whole day of monday having dropped the pair almost 100 points this was followed by a long lull which could only be broken by the publication of data from the us labor market on friday the number of new jobs created outside the agricultural sector nfp increased more than three times in june compared with may from 72k to 224k which allowed the dollar to press the euro further the pair almost reached the level of 1 1200 after which a small rebound followed and it ended the trading session at 1 1225 gbp usd the main candidate for the post of british prime minister boris johnson continues to play the role of horror for markets johnson s statements regarding the possibility of a hard brexit without a deal put pressure on the pound dropping its quotes to the levels of the end of 2016 beginning of 2017 it is natural that the positive statistics from the american labor market influenced the dynamics of the pair as well as a result the forecast that had been given by most experts last week turned out to be correct as expected the pair recorded a local low in the 1 2480 zone after which it climbed 45 points where it met the end of the working five day session usd jpy recall that a clear forecast for this pair could not be formed a week ago 40 of the experts had voted for the strengthening of the japanese currency and the movement of the pair to the south another 30 turned their looks to the north while the rest of the analysts just shrugged shoulders as a result they were all right the pair dropped to the level of 107 52 by the middle of the week and then turned up and on friday july 5 it returned to the highs of monday july 01 thus the dollar was able to win back only about 55 points from the yen in five days practically keeping within the boundaries of the side corridor of the first half of this june cryptocurrencies the btc usd updated the two week low last tuesday dropping to 9 725 that is after an explosive growth of 155 in may june bitcoin lost almost half of what it earned in these two months in just seven days from june 26 to july 2 there is nothing surprising in this cryptocurrency volatility and many experts talk about possible corrections of 30 and even 50 but is it possible to call such fluctuations a correction after the fall bitcoin turned around and somewhat regained its position rising to 11 100 by the evening of friday july 5th ethereum eth usd ripple xrp usd and litecoin ltc usd following the benchmark coin showed similar ups and downs on average the weekly range of fluctuations of coins was from 17 to 23 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd market reacted with great attention to the june data on employment in the us according to many experts they may influence the decision of the fed regarding the interest rate reduction according to forecasts this could happen at the meeting of the federal reserve on july 31 a low nfp would seriously increase the likelihood of a rate cut by 25 or even 50 basis points but as mentioned above nfp has grown more than 3 times it turns out that the situation in the us economy is not so critical so why then pursue a policy of easing and give away cheap money investors will try to hear the answer to this question from the speeches of fed chairman j powell on july 09 10 and 11 as well as read in the lines of the minutes of the fed meeting on wednesday july 10 the ecb meeting will take place this wednesday markets are also expecting additional measures to stimulate the eu economy from the european regulator hour x is scheduled for july 25 in whose direction the scales will swing is not yet clear the easing of the monetary policy by the fed may weaken the dollar a similar easing by the ecb will push the euro down and it can happen at the same time just one observation the yield of 30 year german government bonds showed a decrease up to a base point which coincided with the dynamics of the yield of 30 year us bonds by the way couple of words about germany this country will publish a number of macroeconomic data on monday july 8 including statistics on the trade balance for may according to forecasts it may be positive which will somewhat strengthen the position of the euro however despite this 60 of experts believe that the pair has not yet reached the local bottom and expect to see it in the zone of 1 1100 1 1185 90 of trend indicators and 80 of oscillators on h4 and d 1 agree with them as for the remaining 40 of analysts in their opinion the pair will not be able to break through support in the 1 1185 zone and will return to 1 1275 1 1320 the next targets are 1 1350 and 1 1400 it should be noted that in the transition from the weekly to monthly forecast the number of bull supporters among experts increases from 40 to 65 they are supported by 20 of the oscillators that are now in the oversold zone gbp usd despite statements by the head of the bank of england mark carney most experts believe that neither on august 1 nor even on september 19 will interest rates on the pound be reduced hope on the soft brexit does not fade this provides a support to the british currency although minor another positive factor for the pound is that this currency has now reached the zone of a three week low that is why 60 of experts expect the pair to rebound up and keep in the range of 1 125 0 1 2750 the nearest resistance levels are 1 2570 and 1 2700 supported by the graphical analysis on d1 40 of analysts adhere to the opposite point of view according to which the pair should fall to the lows of december 2018 january 2019 to the zone 1 2405 1 2475 as for the indicators the vast majority of them are red on both h4 and d1 however already about 15 of oscillators signal the pair is oversold usd jpy interest in the yen is weakening against the backdrop of the strengthening dollar and the growing attractiveness of risky assets but it is only 40 of analysts who expect that the pair will be able to overcome resistance in the area of 108 50 108 80 and rise to the echelon of 109 00 109 60 the remaining 60 of experts believe that the pair will move for some time in the side channel 107 55 108 50 attempting to break through its lower boundary and if successful can sink to the horizon 106 75 15 of oscillators on h4 and d1 which are in the overbought zone signal about the possible movement of the pair downwards cryptocurrencies in general the news background is positive for the crypto market bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to attract major experienced investors for example according to bloomberg the billionaire from the old guard 75 year old henry r kravis could not resist either and has recently become an investor in the cryptocurrency fund of parafi capital interest in bitcoin has peaked in the past 17 months the subject has bypassed by the number of requests in google donald trump and kim kardashian who previously occupied the first and second places even the chinese authorities have changed their attitude to cryptocurrencies in the report of the official information agency of the country xinhua bitcoin was called an asset that has the characteristics of an ideal safe haven for investors the optimistic forecast remains the same 50 100 thousand per btc coin in the next one and a half years at the same time correction drop downs are possible reaching 50 percent or more in the meantime 30 of experts say that the btc usd pair may drop to support 9 200 40 expect it to rise to a height of 14 000 and 30 talk about lateral movement in the channel 9 725 12

even if other countries are unable to extricate themselves from us networks of interdependence in the short term incentives to do so will strengthen in the longer run cambridge us president donald trump has been accused of weaponizing economic globalization sanctions tariffs and the restriction of access to dollars have been major instruments of his foreign policy and he has been unconstrained by allies institutions or rules in using them according to the economist america derives its clout not just from troops and aircraft carriers but from being the central node in the network that underpins globalization this mesh of firms ideas and standards reflects and magnifies american prowess but trump s approach may spark a crisis and it is eroding america s most valuable asset its legitimacy trump is not the first president to manipulate economic interdependence nor is the united states the only country to do so for example in 1973 arab states used an oil embargo to punish the us for supporting israel in the yom kippur war shortly thereafter robert o keohane and i published power and interdependence a book that explored the variety of ways in which asymmetrical interdependence can be manipulated as a source of power but we also warned that short term gains sometimes turn into long term losses for example during that period president richard m nixon restricted us soybean exports in hopes of dampening inflation but in the longer term soybean markets in brazil expanded rapidly and competed with american producers in 2010 after a collision of chinese and japanese ships near the disputed senkaku diaoyu islands in the east china sea china punished japan by restricting exports of rare earth metals which are essential in modern electronics the result was that japan lent money to an australian mining company with a refinery in malaysia which today meets nearly one third of japanese demand in addition the mountain pass mine in california which had shut in the early 2000s was reopened china s share of global rare earth production has fallen from more than 95 percent in 2010 to 70 percent last year this year in a not too subtle response to trump s tariffs chinese president xi jinping made sure he was photographed visiting a rare earth production site whose exports are vital to us electronics producers the us and other countries have legitimate complaints about chinese economic behavior such as the theft of intellectual property and subsidies to state owned companies that have tilted the playing field in trade moreover there are important security reasons for the us to avoid becoming dependent on chinese companies like huawei for 5g wireless and china has refused to allow facebook or google to operate within its great firewall for security reasons related to freedom of speech but it is one thing to restrict certain technologies and companies for security reasons and quite another to cause massive disruption of commercial supply chains to develop political influence it is not clear how long the influence will last or what the long term costs will turn out to be even if other countries are unable to extricate themselves from us networks of interdependence in the short term incentives to do so will strengthen in the longer run in the meantime there will be costly damage to the international institutions that limit conflict and create global public goods as henry kissinger has pointed out world order depends not only on a stable balance of power but also on a sense of legitimacy to which institutions contribute trump was right to respond to chinese economic behavior but he was wrong to do it without regard for the costs imposed on us allies and international institutions the same problem weakens his policies toward iran and europe alliances like nato stabilize expectations and the existence of institutions like the united nations the nuclear non proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency enhances security open markets and economic globalization can be disruptive but they also create wealth albeit often unequally distributed maintaining financial stability is crucial to the daily lives of millions of americans and foreigners alike even though they may not notice it until it is absent and regardless of what a nativist populist backlash does to economic globalization ecological globalization is unavoidable greenhouse gases and pandemics do not respect political borders the laws of populist politics which have dictated trump s denial of the science and his withdrawal of the us from the 2015 paris climate agreement are incompatible with the laws of physics states will increasingly need a framework to enhance cooperation on the use of the sea and space and on combating climate change and pandemics referring to such a framework as a liberal international order confuses choices by conflating promotion of liberal democratic values with the creation of an institutional framework for promoting global public goods china and the us disagree about liberal democracy but we share an interest in developing an open rules based system to manage economic and ecological interdependence some defenders of the trump administration argue that his unorthodox style and willingness to break rules and spurn institutions will produce major gains on issues like north korea s nuclear weapons china s coerced technology transfer or regime change in iran but the relationship of power and interdependence changes over time and too much manipulation of america s privileged position in global interdependence could prove self defeating as the economist argued the institutional costs of using a wrecking ball approach may reduce american power in the long run in that case trump s approach will prove costly for america s national security prosperity and way of life joseph s nye jr is a professor at harvard university and author of the forthcoming

just over a week ago president of cuba miguel díaz canel said that starting this month all state employed workers will receive the first of what is likely to be several salary increases his widely reported announcement responded to shared concern among cubans that their salaries have become inadequate in relation to the cost of living far more significantly however and barely mentioned outside of cuba the decision was just one of several potentially far reaching economic reforms in his remarks subsequently published under the headline update of the cuban socialist model president díaz canel told participants at a meeting in the city of pinar del rio that cuba is about to embark on what might best be described as an unconventional process of economic reform and the long overdue process of breathing new life into the country s struggling economy is about to begin what emerged is a picture of a new and peculiarly cuban economic model that mixes incentives market forces expert advice currency reform and decentralised and managerially led decision making with exhortation social commitment accounting and centralised planning headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters taken together the new approach appears to break decisively with the concept of a top down centrally directed socialist economy in favour of one that is still socially oriented but managed within a plan derived from bottom up inputs and decentralised and more liberal decision making while the ideas still have to be formally considered by the country s national assembly and its commissions when they meet later this month president díaz canel made clear that what is being proposed has been systematically debated for months by a working group that included academic economists and other experts space does not permit more than an outline of some of the new measures but the proposed increase in salaries is closely related to reforms to pricing which are intended together to quote cuba s president to bring about monetary and exchange unification and the elimination of subsidies at present cuba has two currencies that operate in parallel resulting in very low national peso cup prices for the basic goods and services that cuba s system guarantees while most other items considered less essential are valued in convertible pesos cuc creating distortions that damage the country s ability to develop since currency unification is likely to be inflationary and make cup earning cubans poorer gradual but significant increases in state salaries along with subsidy reform and encouraging savings are the essential precursors to change for this reason the decision to address both wage and prices marks the start of what will be a complex and potentially socially disruptive process leading to a single currency as such it represents a major change of policy designed to make the management of cuba s socially oriented economy and stimulating growth more orthodox the new measures go further breaking with the past by seeking to incentivise initiative and success for example in future state enterprises will be allowed to retain any surplus beyond what is due to the state and to decide themselves whether such sums can be reinvested or used for co investment with foreign companies or non state enterprises by encouraging state companies to take their own decisions as to how to increase efficiency and productivity and allowing them to incentivise workers within more generous guidelines cuba s council of ministers hope that domestic self sufficiency will increase president díaz canel also said that a development bank is to be established that will be able to finance projects separately from existing state allocations given to enterprise and that other measures yet to be announced will aim to encourage agricultural production and municipal self sufficiency essential to all of this he said will be the strengthening of accounting accountability and overcoming the inertia of the tired he also signalled that the measures proposed which are inter related may have to be adapted and if successful could lead to further reforms all of this may seem timid in relation to the measures taken to stimulate growth in the free market economies of the rest of the region however in a cuban context they represent a significant step towards freeing the market by devolving decision making to managers enterprises and collectives in ways that enable both the state and all state workers to benefit from success put another way the system being proposed incentivises those in the state economy to take decisions take responsibility for their actions and benefit from them within certain limits rather than just trying to meet unambitious or over ambitious targets determined by bureaucrats how well cubans adapt to this if the country can overcome its initiative stifling bureaucracy and dated structures and whether influential conservatives within the higher reaches of the cuban government and communist party allow such changes to become irreversible remains to be seen paradoxically however us policy may unintentionally be on the side of the economic reformers so swingeing has been the effect of washington s new sanctions and so extreme the remarks of individuals such as the us national security adviser john bolton that senior figures in cuba s communist party and government appear to have accepted that to survive cuba s idling socialist system has little option other than to undergo rapid reform adopt new thinking become more internally self sufficient appeal to the young and increase efficiency and productivity just as surprisingly the extraterritorial effect of us sanctions and the appalling internal situation in venezuela may also be helping cuba for the first time washington s close allies have become publicly critical of its cuba policy making clear their concern that isolating the island at a time of generational change is counterproductive destabilising undermines free and frank discussion on reform and creates significant new openings for russia and china they have also recognised that cuba may have a unique role in helping resolve the internal political and humanitarian crisis in venezuela in his remarks president díaz canel said that cuba now has greater potentialities is more prepared has developed a concept of resistance over sixty years and has learnt from the experience of surviving the period of extreme austerity which followed the collapse of the former soviet union for the sake of the cuban people and regional stability it is to be hoped that this new and unconventional approach works and that cuba s liberal reform minded economists can successfully deliver a basis for further socially oriented economic change david jessop is a consultant to the caribbean council david jessop caribbean council org
the tensions between the united states us and iran were already high when iran breached its internationally agreed stockpile limit of low enriched uranium iran s foreign minister mohammad javad zarif stated that the country now had more than 300kg of uranium hexafluoride which is equal to 202 8kg of low enriched uranium the latter being the limit agreed to under the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa or the iran nuclear deal the breach was confirmed by the international atomic energy agency iaea however a spokesman for iran s foreign ministry said that the breaches of the deal were reversible however the tensions between the two nations are set to attain a new high as iran has announced that is going to breach the enrichment limit currently set at 3 67 per cent under the 2015 iran nuclear deal the decision to breach the limit was announced by ali rabiee a government spokesperson in tehran on sunday july 7 background the iran nuclear deal the jcpoa was signed in july 2015 between iran and the us the united kingdom china france germany and russia the 159 page agreement is fairly technical but focusses on five major fronts stockpile enrichment centrifuges inspections and sanctions the deal had iran giving up 97 per cent of its enriched uranium thus bringing down its stockpile from 10 000kg to merely 300kg the uranium enrichment the percentage composition of the uranium 235 isotope was capped at 3 67 per cent to put things in perspective uranium used for medical research is enriched at 20 per cent while those used for weapons is 90 per cent enriched thus these two aspects of the deal ensured iran did not have a thriving nuclear weapon development programme also iran had to give up 3 4th of its centrifuges critical to the process of enrichment further weakening its nuclear programme inspections and monitoring were agreed upon in return the iranian economy was given a lease of life with the removal of sanctions thus boosting the socio economic prospects of its 80 million people the nuclear experts have offered a mixed reaction to the breach of the uranium stockpile given the minimum threshold for a crude nuclear weapon is 400kg of uranium enriched to 20 per cent u 235 iran may be able to weaponise uranium but shall find itself limited by its own lack of capacity for deployment of the warhead what worries some other nuclear experts however is the enrichment breach which iran is plalning to go ahead with iran plans to breach the uranium enrichment cap currently at 3 67 per cent thus falling back on its commitments on two major fronts within the jcpoa even though iran would still be a long way from having a working nuclear weapon ready for deployment across a continent it may inspire iran to accelerate its otherwise weakened nuclear programme the us president donald trump however appears to be without a coherent strategy the lack of any plan to deal with iran after the walkout is starting to take a toll on trump as he finds himself unable to commit to war or get the iranian leadership back to the drawing board for a jcpoa 2 0 trump as of now is losing the narrative battle against iran on multiple fronts friends no more firstly on the issue of walking out of the jcpoa he finds himself without much support back home or across the world the democrats have voiced their disagreement against the walkout on multiple occasions the other signatories to the jcpoa have also stated their concerns and are going to look to preserve the deal while china said that dialogue was better than confrontation both france and germany along with russia and the united kingdom have repeatedly expressed their disappointment and hailed grave consequences for the stability of the middle east if the jcpoa ceased to exist secondly european governments are already working overtime to preserve their economic relationship with iran via a special purpose vehicle spv instex or the instrument in support of trade exchanges established in january 2019 by france germany and the united kingdom the spv will enable non dollar trade with iran for goods like food medicine and other humanitarian requirements while the spv was functional since january no transactions had been made until very recently last week the french german and british collectively known as the e 3 promised a capital injection of a few million euros and an instex credit line to get the transactions going the spv shall be used to make payments from the european companies that import iranian goods to those european companies that export goods to iran as per a report of an iranian news agency russia has also expressed interest in joining the instex meanwhile austria belgium finland netherlands slovenia spain and sweden have backed the instex programme the very establishment of instex shows how diverged the interests and intentions of the us and europe are in the middle east the circumvention of the us sanctions on iran by europe and possibly soon by the remaining two signatories via instex not only isolates the us but also opens up room for a jcpoa 2 0 without the us as a member vanishing ships three countries are now evading the us sanctions in other ways too as per an elaborate report in the new york times ships transferring cargo to and from the persian gulf are vanishing shipping fleets are now defying restrictions and going dark and off the grid thus making it hard for analysts and other shipping companies to track them according to a maritime treaty of the united nations ships using the international routes and transferring over 300 tons of goods are required to have an automatic identification system ais this ais enables search and rescue helps in tracking the shipping traffic and is helpful in avoiding collisions by going off the grid these fleets make it difficult for the authorities to punish them under the sanctions authorised by the us against iran for instance ships travelling from chinese ports in the east to the persian gulf via indian ports turn off their ais transponders as they enter the iranian region thus making it impossible for tracking companies to locate them as per the report this has been going on for the last 18 months with ships not registering their location in the persian gulf but having regular deliveries and shipments to other nearby ports in oman bahrain and saudi arabia the intelligence agencies of the us and israel have stated that the islamic revolutionary guard corps a branch of the iranian armed forces which was recently designated as a terrorist group by the us has deep interests in the oil and petroleum business in iran thus the petrodollars from the export of cheap oil add to the military strength of iran further aggravating the us crude oil tankers with a gross tonnage capacity of over 85 000 tons are hard to track when they manually disable their ais transponders given these tankers can carry enough oil to meet 5 per cent of us daily oil consumption their circumventing the us sanctions adds to the strength of iran the long war in yemen and the skirmishes in the gulf four the ongoing proxy war between saudi arabia and iran in yemen is starting to take its toll on the interests of the us in the region the united arab emirates has pledged to pull out most of its forces from yemen fighting against the houthi rebels backed by iran the uae was saudi arabia s biggest ally in the war in yemen uae is also seen by the us as an important partner of the coalition challenging iran s supremacy in the region thus the exit of uae from yemen reinstates the myth of iranian supremacy in the region further adding to the growing stress between saudi arabia and iran five even though iran has been actively involved in low scale sabotage operations against the us and its allies the latter is limited by its own appetite for another war in the middle east after iraq in may 2019 iran was reportedly involved in the attack on four commercial ships in the gulf of oman last month two oil tankers were attacked near the strait of hormuz tensions attained a peak when the irgc announced that it had taken down a us rq 4a global hawk surveillance drone while the us official position was that the drone was in international airspace the iranian state claims otherwise saying that it was shot down as it violated their airspace in retaliation the us was planning to go ahead with air strikes on iranian military targets that would have killed 150 people before trump called it off at the last minute signalling how the us was not looking for a wider conflict against iran iran an economy in shambles it is not only the us without a strategy as even iran today finds itself dented by the sanctions imposed by the us though instex and the petrodollars do offer the leadership some hope the iranian economy is dwindling as per the international monetary fund imf iran registered a negative growth percentage in 2018 as the sanctions were imposed the imf forecasts for 2019 predict a negative growth rate of 6 per cent for iran s gdp however the forecast may have to be revised if waivers on sanctions are offered to iran s crude oil importers later this year by the us iran s oil output has also suffered beginning of 2018 iran s crude oil production stood at 3 8 million barrels per day mbd by march 2019 the production stood at 1 1 mbd china and india have reduced their crude oil imports from iran by 39 and 47 per cent respectively between may and october of 2018 india imported 563 000 barrels per day while china imported 590 000 between november 2018 and march 2019 the import figures for india and china stood at 300 000 barrels and 360 000 barrels respectively an estimate puts the loss of the decline in iranian crude oil imports at 10 billion the iranian currency has suffered too since the sanctions were reinstated the rial iran s official currency has lost 60 per cent of its value against the dollar this has also been attributed to the macroeconomic crisis within the country and a large demand for foreign currency given the citizens are fast losing trust in the rial inflation has also skyrocketed in the country while it was less than 10 per cent in 2017 it has gone beyond 30 per cent in late 2018 since the sanctions came into play this has increased the cost of living rapidly and is taking a toll on businesses within the country the per capita income has also been on the decline in iran since the last 12 months final word the lack of direct communication is aiding this nuclear cold war what complicates the tensions between iran and the us further is a lack of direct contact while trump has been taking on north korea on the issue of denuclearisation and china on the issue of tariffs direct contact with the leadership in both countries has ensured a sustained dialogue with respect to iran the us finds itself undone given the jcpoa walkout without any plan of action the walkout has also eroded the good old american credibility and therefore the us will have a tough time negotiating another nuclear deal if it ever wants to for iran there is no incentive in pursuing a jcpoa 2 0 and hence they have chosen the path of low key attacks and provocations the iranian leadership is looking to build a narrative against the us as evident by iran s decision to breach two critical aspects of the jcpoa days before the g 20 summit last month in osaka japan while europe china and russia would look to preserve the jcpoa iran will exert pressure on them to get the us to eliminate the sanctions by threatening to go back on its nuclear commitments the timing is critical with respect to the us as well as trump would be looking to get re elected for another term given 2020 is going to be an election year the last thing trump would want is the prospect of a full fledged war with iran without an exit strategy for now the two sides are engaged in a cold war without any of them making much headway while trump would be hoping to win a second term choke iran with more sanctions and arm twist them into a jcpoa 2 0 the iranians would be hoping for in their own words a saner leader to deal with yes iran and the us are not going to war anytime soon but the question that remains is for how long will they keep this cold war going and ensure no miscaluclation on either side results in a real one

photo credit us coast guard originally posted to the jcpa website introduction while 700 000 refugees wait in chaos on the shores of the mediterranean sea in the hope of reaching europe confusion reigns on the other side there is a profound lack of means ideas and laws to safely distribute these desperate migrants among the 28 member states of the european union furthermore among the authorities there is a clear inability to distinguish between refugees economic migrants and even criminals which of these migrants are in search of employment and which of them are fanatics seeking to fight against the western infidels advertisement when these immigrants are accepted many countries do not possess the ability to integrate them within their own societies often immigrants end up confined in camps and ghettos many of them face severe problems created by their own cultures which are frequently so very different from western cultures and may even be antagonistic to european principles for example in italy around 70 000 immigrants arrived in 2015 but in 2017 this total was reduced to a bit more than 23 000 1 however even though the numbers have shrunk the general sense of alarm surrounding the immigrant issue has not lessened the psychological impact has not followed the numbers in fact the opposite is the case the issue of absorbing immigrants into europe has continued growing creating new politics and societies and affecting the continent s entire future the issue of real refugees vs economic migrants still raises overwhelming questions and the problems are still immense for this reason it is worthwhile examining this issue along with the concerns of the western world the psychological pressure on europe that has caused a secessionist trend among several nation states of the european union has overwhelmed the fact that the number of people illegally crossing into europe actually dropped last year to its lowest level in five years while there has been a spike in the number reaching spain an estimated 150 000 people entered the european union through irregular crossings in 2018 according to frontex the border and coast guard agency that is the lowest total since 2013 and it is 92 percent below the peak of 2015 after 2018 italy s new government and its attitude toward immigration is the basic reason for the dramatic fall of the previous government which failed to solve the issue the migrants taking the central mediterranean route from libya algeria and tunisia to italy may be a little more than 23 000 representing an 80 percent drop from last year how this reduction was achieved requires a great deal of discussion and raises the question of how the flow of immigrants can be slowed or halted and if it should be stopped after all the human tendency is to help a person in need or distress in danger hungry or seeking protection for his her children europe s global crisis the growing disagreements within the european union over opening or closing borders the imposition of quotas and systems of admission and other issues are leading to serious discord among the member states these issues have become the main cause of a growing crisis among eu countries due to a deterioration of the economic situation with deep divisions growing between western and eastern european states most noticeably it has deepened a schism between germany and the rest of the old continent this gulf was already there due to the preeminence of the constantly growing german economy in comparison to the rest of europe which is in crisis this has refueled the ancient conflict and divisions that led to the original establishment of the european union it is not surprising that harsh accusations have been made against german chancellor angela merkel for the way she managed the dominance of her country s economy and her attitude toward immigration most of this criticism has come from countries that are burdened by a heavy public debt while immigrants continue to flock in such as greece these accusations have formed a strong rebuttal of the position of germany s present leadership as merkel has decided upon an open door policy as discussed further on this crisis has arisen at a time where there are many signs of the unsustainability of the european union as a unitary institution or a seed for a future united states of europe this situation predated 1992 when the treaty of maastricht was signed after many hesitations that reflected internal cracks in the façade of a united europe when the treaty of paris was signed in 1951 creating the original european coal and steel community which eventually metamorphosed into the european union of today the main problem of its signatories was resisting soviet pressure and the original project merely sought to build a common market for coal and steel however the founding document of european ideology or the pan european gospel first emerged in 1941 as a counterweight to the europe of nazi fascist nationalists this was the famous ventotene manifesto written by the socialist eugenio colorni the radical liberal ernesto rossi and the former communist altiero spinelli during their confinement under the italian fascist regime if one carefully reads its pages which many quote without being sufficiently familiar with them you will find the national state is described as a war mongering monster destined to produce a nazi plutocratic degeneration that exudes the rotten stink of homeland and soil and even race the imagined european federal state is in the perspective of the manifesto s authors a world that reforms society against inequalities and privileges even democracy is seen as a dead weight against the backdrop of the socialist hope pervading the text these are the roots of a united europe from its very inception the two world wars having covered half a century with the gigantic layer of the blood of 100 million victims who perished between 1914 and 1945 only reinforced this ideology of giving people peace and prosperity abolishing borders and enhancing commonalities in the same vein the european union lacks a normal constitution after two referenda in france and the netherlands on whether to create an eu constitution the no votes won out in 2005 instead the european union s constitutional basis is built upon substantive case laws and a somewhat vast comic network of rules all of which culminated in the treaty of lisbon which was signed in 2007 the european union is essentially an enormous illegible corpus that takes care of everything even the slightest trifle from lamps to dairy products with the aim of producing good world government to follow this through there are 750 elected members of the european parliament as well as 42 500 civil servants who move from hall to hall from office to office inside the labyrinths of the eu building for this the already depleted taxpayer pays 9 billion per year in administration costs and salaries ranging from 1 600 to 16 000 euros equal to 1 800 to 18 200 per month the monetary union of 1990 and the creation of the schengen area in 1995 which abolished internal borders within europe were built upon this basis this led to a long period of grace in which there has been a growing eu economy long lasting peace and prosperity for a long time germany managed the leadership of the european union with authority and wisdom amid grumbling and antipathies from other member states until european hysteria subverted greece and brought on brexit the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union until 2008 a favorable and peaceful objective situation prevailed in europe it is no small achievement for countries that were always at war and hated each other over the centuries to participate in this kind of federation consider the animus of france versus england france and england both against germany everyone despising italy nobody even taking spain into consideration the netherlands as an ornament northern european countries seen as a curiosity and so forth at the same time the terrible conflicts that developed in serbia which russia eventually managed never received a single response from the european union the arab spring a crisis emerged in europe reaching its peak in 2008 when the arab spring unexpectedly turned into a source of severe concern as an uninterrupted flow of displaced migrants surged into the continent the year 2008 was the year of the american credit crunch when the large u s investment bank lehman brothers collapsed it was the biggest financial crisis the world had ever seen since the great depression of the 1930s on august 8 2008 another critical event occurred when russia invaded georgia following this in 2014 a revolution occurred in ukraine against the backdrop of that country s association agreement with the european union where russia also got involved and eventually attempted to annex the crimea and sevastopol all of this clearly showed that after the balkan war the conflicts in europe were far from over amid this global chaos europe witnessed another split when germany attempted to remind its european partners to abide by their economic promises while the other european countries contested german supremacy all eu members including the dramatic example of greece had to submit to a request to comply with the ideas of austerity tax payments and focusing on their public debt at first the problem of the borders was not raised every eu country had its own problems and each one blamed the others germany blamed everybody else and everybody else blamed chancellor merkel but the problem became more blatant when refugees began to flood the mediterranean shores as well as the headlines in an impoverished europe where unemployment is rampant and the future of its youth is uncertain the impoverished middle classes of europe suddenly became a new actor that changed the continent s narrative universalism was the original idea behind post nationalism the main ideology of the european union it was inspired by the dismissal of the nationalism that had dominated europe for over a century and brought cataclysmic world wars the aspiration was to diminish ethnic religious and geographic borders and replace them with vast transnational alternatives but the post national fraternal europe whose leader is angela merkel who served as a minister at the age of 37 in reunited germany s first government was pushed toward a deep crisis just by the questioning of the borders issue in relation to immigration many european countries have witnessed the rise of irate political forces around the simple refusal to accept growing rates of immigration to cite the new york times merkel has staked her legacy on upholding the european union a core tenet of the bloc is to maintain open borders among member states 2 these issues are deeply interconnected and it is no coincidence that the european anti immigration parties are also the most euro skeptic merkel s project has crashed twice tragically externally due to her incapacity to reaffirm eu values in the face of the illiberal democratic wind blowing from the east and internally where her naïve optimism has backfired raising popular support for the extreme right and even threatening her 13 year long reign merkel s near fall is nothing less than an example of the crisis of the european dream as a whole root causes of the migration crisis it is still quite surprising how hard it has been for europe to understand the fundamental importance of its problem it is a mistake to see immigration as a sudden invasion that picked up in 2015 but became much smaller in 2016 in fact immigration is a constant characteristic of the european union and is a part of its very raison d être the dublin convention that unsuccessfully tried to organize the distribution of immigrants between 1997 and 1998 was the direct result of internal and external events after the maastricht agreement and the adoption of the euro as the common currency the immigration that followed was directly connected to the european conviction that opening borders or better destroying them was a very positive idea a turning point was in 2014 when the european union which at the time had 15 members from western europe welcomed cyprus and malta and most importantly eight new countries from the former soviet bloc the czech republic hungary poland slovakia slovenia estonia latvia and lithuania bulgaria and romania had already joined in 2007 compared to the past the economic disparity between the original bloc and the new states raised fears of an uncontrolled flow of low level workers moving from east to west to undertake welfare tourism this reached the extent that in france a fictional character the polish plumber became a popular symbol of this phenomenon 3 in effect after a pilot period of restraint for the new countries citizens internal mobility within europe consistently rose today romania and poland are currently the two countries exporting the largest national groups in the european union with respectively 2 and 1 5 million eu migrants 4 meanwhile tumultuous events outside the continent pushed third country nationals mostly muslim from africa and the middle east to move away from their birthplaces in the hope of reaching europe the causes of immigration through the mediterranean sea and over the turkish borders have been increasing over the past 10 years they include the arab spring with the consequential horrific syrian civil war the chaotic iraqi situation the frightening presence of the islamic state the wave of african wars that has its epicenter in libya revolts against old dictators and violent militias such as boko haram in nigeria all of these tragic and momentous events have been pushing men women and children toward the mediterranean shores at the same time shiite iran and its ally hizbullah have taken advantage of the chaos terrorizing the population of the middle east extrajudicial killings tortures and abduction by the shiite militias in iraq against the sunnis including young boys have been widely documented 5 after the massacre of the yarmouk camp undertaken by assad with the complicit silence of hizbullah in 2015 even the palestinians have started to turn against their old champion 6 as a consequence a flourishing criminal trade of human beings is pushing masses of people toward rickety boats that can easily be sunk by the waves or the negligence and murderous behavior of the smugglers whose interest is to move the largest mass they can notwithstanding the danger for this reason almost 17 000 people have found their deaths in the sea between 2014 and 2018 7 according to ispi data one out of every 10 people who departed from the shores of libya either died or went missing in the first months of 2018 8 in general only half of the people who leave libya make it to their intended destination they are brought back or incarcerated and in recent years they have been cruelly kept on the libyan side of the mediterranean sea by the same smugglers who used to sail them on their shaky crafts on the other hand ships belonging to ngos sail into the waters to save the drowning people with the effect of encouraging them to undertake the journey but sometimes the real aim of these efforts is to increase the ngo s own importance or to get public finance the european countries have displayed differing reactions but the attempt to stem the tide of immigration is evident notwithstanding any rhetoric even before the mass arrival of immigrants in 2015 amnesty international estimates that between 2007 and 2013 the european union spent almost 2 billion on fences surveillance systems and patrols on land and sea immediately this raises the question of who has the right to cross borders in search of asylum under international law at the same time there is a parallel problem of saving lives that are in danger the europeans could see plenty of people dying every day in the mediterranean sea of course lives must be saved but what should happen next almost three million people claimed asylum in the european union in 2015 and 2016 their arrival was chaotic with many drowning in the sea others bypassed the laws governing the acceptance of refugees and they spread out over europe disappearing further afield never properly identifying themselves according to the dublin convention of 1997 and 1998 which was replaced in 2003 by the eu dublin ii regulation a request for protection must be handled by the country of first entrance which also must assist the claimant throughout the process only some european countries have had to deal with this heavy burden causing their own populations to become more and more panicked and confused and psychological and technical obstacles arose everywhere the dublin mechanism put the heaviest burden on frontier states such as italy greece spain malta and cyprus the scenes of desperation and confusion of the ships arriving after saving the migrants at lampedusa island off the southern coast of italy for instance became daily news the number of people killed by stormy waves became a regular tally on news broadcasts the sense of guilt was overbearing when a photo appeared of a small child lying dead on a beach and the pain rocked the european union whose main aim and hope was to overcome their historical colonial past and old racial and ethnocentric feelings germany and the european divide germany provides the best example of the desperate will to present a different attitude toward the problem of mass migration from a different and often antagonistic culture such as islamism germany saw the european union as a symbol of its redemption from its horrific past the attitude of angela merkel while certainly morally appreciable was to open the gates of europe completely to the immigrants with the particular aim of helping political refugees in contrast to nazism which was totally nationalist the germany of the european union chose to be european and post nationalist its former xenophobia was transformed into welcoming all strangers and its old aggressive attitude became a hymn for peace of course this idea was connected to the concept of european leadership which has always unconsciously been important in germany s mindset along with economic dynamism and a sense of superiority however many other countries of the european union did not perceive this attitude as a positive example while the idea of saving the people in danger was accepted almost everywhere at least in western europe as a matter of fact it was then followed by the problem of quotas and a fair division of this work but the idea was never put into practice because some countries such as hungary simply refused any entrance to immigrants at all furthermore while naval laws made it natural to carry the people rescued either to the closest port or to the nation of the rescue ship frequent news reports of smugglers and human trafficking made the stream of immigration appear dubious and questionable at the same time angela merkel was losing the struggle to quash nationalism by removing ethnic religious and geographic borders her slogan we can do it today looks very much like the yes we can of obama in the end chancellor merkel opened germany s borders to an influx of more than one million9 middle eastern refugees many of whom german citizens would soon want to expel this only served to fuel the growth of nationalism in the countries where the immigrants were explicitly not welcomed and national pride did not suffer any guilt feelings for this at all such countries included poland hungary and the czech republic which sat decisively on the other side of the argument declaring that immigration was destroying their national identity and also not least that their economy could not stand such a burden italy s interior minister matteo salvini closed the country s ports to migrant boats in june 2018 and in november his government passed a new law abolishing the humanitarian protection category for migrants who do not meet italy s asylum criteria as a result many had to leave the immigration center and entered a legal limbo drifting in a situation of uncertainty that pushes them in an outlaw situation or toward some other european country non governmental organizations have come under pressure to stop mediterranean operations that are believed to be not only rescue operations but also a sort of hidden alliance with the criminal organizations that sell cheap travel in extremely unsound boats to poor people and entire families with children thereby increasing the fatal incidents in the mediterranean sea actually some of these criminal organizations trafficking in human beings are suspected of pushing people to leave taking their money and holding women and children in camps in libya in inhuman conditions at the same time the growing presence of immigrants in europe has created many fundamental problems in europe such as increasing the rate of family violence and exploitation of women putting in danger the freedom of women 10 raising levels of homophobia 11 increasing criminality 12 and in some cases even feeding the ranks of terrorist groups 13 in turn the social upheaval in the european countries undermines leadership and the relations between nation states european leaders held an emergency summer summit in 2018 but they have so far dodged any formal agreement on refugee quotas with central states rejecting any form of mandatory action meanwhile the migrants are looking for new routes and new kinds of transportations like small dinghies that bring only little groups across stormy seas they disembark in new landing sites and rapidly disappear into the countryside on the other hand in november 2017 a coalition of human rights groups published a list of the 33 293 people who died since 1993 as a result of the militarization of asylum laws detention policies and deportations in europe 14 it showed that the generous attitude of opening doors does not always fit in with the structure of existing immigration laws the instructions that appear in the general guides for the reception of people in danger and the regulations for those who wish to remain in the countries where they land are null and void in spite of the apparent invitation for them to stay furthermore it is almost impossible to accurately identify qualify and build categories for these migrants as they are often defined by the ngos and even the pope because it is almost impossible to ascertain whether an immigrant really provides his real name when asked to give his identity at the border furthermore those countries that have refused refugees without even trying to identify who is in danger have openly violated international law most critically of all as far as a code of behavior is concerned these countries have abandoned any european criteria reflecting an eu national identity as a result of the migration question which is this code s first test all attempts to regulate the traffic of migrants have gone in an irregular direction the deal with turkey in march 2016 which was to be the first real major obstacle to the flow of immigrants has reduced the number of syrians heading to europe but while 12 million people have been displaced by the syrian civil war overall a total of 5 million which is growing by the minute are living outside their country many of whom are in urgent need of the humanitarian assistance 15 challenges and moral duties the truth is that even the most dedicated research on how to deal with the migrants divide the refugees from economic migrants and establish a legality connected to a moral stance does not work at the end of the day both the nations that have welcomed these migrants and the countries that keep them out are all on the same page the migrants suffer when they are kept out of a country but they also suffer when they find themselves in camps inside the borders they so much wanted to reach there living conditions are often terrible sometimes they wait months before their situation is examined and their requests are taken into consideration international law aims to protect refugees while allowing the host countries to retain control of their borders and presence the definition of a refugee is subject to a constant struggle over who is deserving and who is not the unhcr refugee convention of 1951 defines a refugee as a person who has left his country due to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion this definition did not cover everyone who fled a war zone but it changed following pressure from the newly independent african states in the 1960s and later on again from the latin american countries in the 1980s however while people forced from their homes by economic disaster or catastrophic climate change are still not included in this definition no one can deny that they are a growing mass today in effect the power to decide who is a refugee remains mostly in the hands of nation states and when people flee from a country where terrorism causes catastrophes or war displaces the masses it is still very hard to consider their needs without also considering local public opinion which is becoming disgruntled by the presence of so many immigrants therefore once migrants cross the sea after incredible adventures and pass through the cruel filters of the smugglers traffickers and similar they are sequestered in remote accommodations far from city centers their right to work is limited and their access to welfare benefits is selective but in no way is their problem solved and neither is the recipient state s dilemma the era of immigration has created a gray zone where the western morality of respecting human life becomes a real question mark when the former italian minister of the interior marco minniti declared his victory in containing the refugees it was quite clear that the moral price he paid went far beyond the normal standard having obliged with the use of violence men women and children to remain in libya against their will the same problem arose when other migrants were sent back to libya after an agreement signed with the libyan navy sometimes the privileges given to migrants cause problems for the citizens of the host nation such as when the economic help received by the immigrants in the form of pensions and subsidies are used to buy goods back in morocco or libya rather than being channeled back into the host country s economy suspicions may arise over the reasons why a migrant is demanding asylum furthermore there are currently 66 million displaced persons in the world and the number of 700 000 people waiting for a possibility to sail from the coast of libya is enough to make both the leadership and the populations of eu countries question the extent of the duty that european society has toward this overwhelming mass in 2012 the european union was awarded the nobel prize as a community of nations that has overcome war and fought totalitarianism and will always stand by those who are in pursuit of peace and human dignity as declared by jose manuel barroso president of the european commission but can this be said when many europeans feel their peace and human dignity cultures and traditions that led to the establishment of democracy and the renunciation of violence are threatened paradoxically the effort to achieve peace of mind for the wave of immigrants is undermining the peace of mind for an entire continent frighteningly european racism is showing its persistence as part of the fight against immigration while conversely the real foundations of various popular fears are evident there is a clear general lack of a moral stance within the shared laws or principles that should guide policy and there is also an inability to measure the real problems included in the immigration question such as a possible existential threat to europe s culture and its citizens mass displacement and the inability to deal with it are not only causing humanitarian problems for europe s democratic societies the immigration question needs to be resolved in its entirety taking into account its cultural security religious and social magnitude including the problems of terrorism and the disruption of western liberal customs unfortunately many governments prefer not to emphasize this issue in 2003 the european union financed a research project on growing anti semitism as a revival of this ancient hatred had been noticed the results were such that romano prodi then president of the european commission decided that the results should not be made public this was because it was extremely clear that contemporary anti semitism in europe had a major muslim component this is just one example of how the culture of the immigrants can clash with western values the fact that right wing parties in europe have taken power in hungary poland italy and austria and have obtained significant gains almost everywhere else cannot therefore be attributed only to populism and demagoguery in this case it is neither wickedness nor a negative interest that is at stake but rather identity security and order which people rightly or wrongly consider to be priorities the idea of uniting the nation states of europe has shown its limits older values like land culture belonging and language are taking center stage and the individualistic idea is entering a crisis people prefer to revere the concept of solidarity for their own nation while the idea of peace has not been disregarded today it has again become connected with homogeneity is this attitude right or wrong in truth while the question of self defense has been put in a corner in recent years clashes of culture and religions and use of terrorism have become more acute despite the efforts of leaders to silence them this book intends to explore these intricate and contradictory issues and it attempts to provide workable solutions to the problems of migration by shying away from both naïve openness and cruel rejection we will try to give answers to the following questions what moral and legal criteria should be followed to differentiate between those we must admit and those we can or must reject how can orderly migration pathways and selection procedures be assured when is it morally wrong and when is it reasonable to deny entry to a migrant what can we demand both from migrants and the host society for everyone to coexist peacefully respecting the law and the individual rights of both sides what can be done to address the root causes of migration in the countries of departure to minimize the flow of migrants as much as possible answering these questions will help to establish a moral code to be used as a compass for civil nations in deciding when and how to welcome or reject migrants balancing the duties of protection toward the host population with those we treat humanely by virtue of our cultural and ethical heritage notes
president donald trump s declaration that trade wars are good and easy to win will surely go down in the history books as a classic utterance but not in a good way instead it will go alongside dick cheney s prediction on the eve of the iraq war that we will in fact be welcomed as liberators that is it will be used to illustrate the arrogance and ignorance that so often drives crucial policy decisions for the reality is that trump isn t winning his trade wars true his tariffs have hurt china and other foreign economies but they ve hurt america too economists at the new york fed estimate that the average household will end up paying more than 1 000 a year in higher prices and there s no hint that the tariffs are achieving trump s presumed goal which is to pressure other countries into making significant policy changes what after all is a trade war neither economists nor historians use the term for situations in which a country imposes tariffs for domestic political reasons as the united states routinely did until the 1930s no it s only a trade war if the goal of the tariffs is coercion imposing pain on other countries to force them to change their policies in our favor and while the pain is real the coercion just isn t happening all the tariffs trump imposed on canada and mexico in an attempt to force a renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement led to a new agreement so similar to the old one that you need a magnifying glass to see the differences and the new one may not even make it through congress advertising and at the recent group of 20 summit trump agreed to a pause in the china trade war holding off on new tariffs in return as far as we can tell for some vaguely conciliatory language but why are trump s trade wars failing mexico is a small economy next to a giant so you might think trump almost certainly did think that it would be easy to browbeat china is an economic superpower in its own right but it sells far more to us than it buys in return which you might imagine makes it vulnerable to u s pressure so why can t trump impose his economic will there are i d argue three reasons first belief that we can easily win trade wars reflects the same kind of solipsism that has so disastrously warped our iran policy too many americans in positions of power seem unable to grasp the reality that we re not the only country with a distinctive culture history and identity proud of our independence and extremely unwilling to make concessions that feel like giving in to foreign bullies millions for defense but not one cent for tribute isn t a uniquely american sentiment in particular the idea that china of all nations will agree to a deal that looks like a humiliating capitulation to the united states is just crazy second trump s tariff men are living in the past out of touch with the realities of the modern economy they talk nostalgically about the policies of william mckinley but back then the question where was this thing made generally had a simple answer these days almost every manufactured good is the product of a global value chain that crosses multiple national borders this raises the stakes u s business was hysterical at the prospect of disrupting nafta because so much of its production relies on mexican inputs it also scrambles the effects of tariffs when you tax goods assembled in china but with many of the components from korea or japan assembly doesn t shift to america it just moves to other asian countries like vietnam advertising finally trump s trade war is unpopular in fact it polls remarkably poorly and so is he this leaves him politically vulnerable to foreign retaliation china may not buy as much from the united states as it sells but its agricultural market is crucial to farm state voters trump desperately needs to hold on to so trump s vision of an easy trade victory is turning into a political war of attrition that he personally is probably less able to sustain than china s leadership even though china s economy is feeling the pain so how will this end trade wars almost never have clear victors but they often leave long lasting scars on the world economy the light truck tariffs the u s imposed in 1964 in an unsuccessful effort to force europe to buy our frozen chickens are still in place 55 years later do you have something to say share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email letters seattletimes com and please include your full name address and telephone number for verification only letters are limited to 200 words trump s trade wars are vastly bigger than the trade wars of the past but they ll probably have the same result no doubt trump will try to spin some trivial foreign concessions as a great victory but the actual result will just be to make everyone poorer at the same time trump s casual trashing of past trade agreements has badly damaged american credibility and weakened the international rule of law oh and did i mention that mckinley s tariffs were deeply unpopular even at the time in fact in his final speech on the subject mckinley offered what sounds like a direct response to and rejection of trumpism declaring that commercial wars are unprofitable and calling for goodwill and friendly trade relations
in the face of faltering confidence in the prospects of a two state solution palestinians find themselves once again in a state of limbo bound by a peace process that has not only failed to award them independence but has only deepened their suffering and heightened the conflict s intractability time and time again it has been argued that due to the interlocked physical reality mutual population penetrations shared natural resources rights of refugees the inherently unjust nature of separation and the deep spiritual and historical ties to the land shared by palestinians and israelis alike sustainable peace can only be achieved through integration even if a two state solution were to be established palestinian independence would exist in name only whether it be based on a secular democratic structure a binational framework or a creative parallel state apparatus the only path to genuine lasting peace between palestinians and israelis clearly lies in extensive levels of cooperation a reality of coexistence and the extensive process of establishing mutual recognition today the palestinian israeli conflict has assumed a new position amidst a rapidly changing middle east and a tumultuous shift in the division of world power eclipsed by the proliferation of high intensity armed conflicts throughout the region from the ongoing syrian civil war which has commanded the attention of international policymakers and aid organizations to the rising tensions between iran and saudi arabia which have come to shape key regional alliances and conflict zones the palestinian question has largely fallen by the wayside this convoluted reality has contributed to a crippling impasse that disproportionately impacts palestinians as their suffering continues isolated from international and regional focus across the board conflict resolution discourse has ignored perhaps the most vital component of a future solution palestinian youth in palestine and across the middle east young people constitute a much larger portion of the population than their counterparts in the west however despite their demographic weight their needs have largely gone unnoticed and their opinions often violently suppressed the consequences of their marginalization were made clear with the outbreak of the arab spring as thousands of youth across the region found a voice following decades of suppression in palestine emerging from the ashes of the oslo process the youth demographic represents a fresh path toward resolution and an opportunity to lead the necessary shifts in conflict discourse hence it is vital that future attempts at resolution consider the needs of young palestinians in order to provide the equality of voice that is necessary in achieving a just inclusive settlement the goal of this article is to examine how the next generation of palestinians might avoid succumbing to a future of perennial suffering in silence under the status quo and how instead it might regain attention and reframe the conflict discourse thus we must ask would the quest for equal rights be better served through a civil rights based approach with the aim of achieving an integrative solution to the conflict at this impasse in the words of menachem klein the ball is in the palestinians court as they face israel s complex oppressive machine in addition to international apathy palestinians face the arduous tasks of regaining global attention to their efforts to balance the asymmetrical relationship on which the conflict has been based for decades and reframing the conflict parameters this calls for a paradigmatic shift from political agendas that dictate separation to a rendering of palestinians and israelis as internal rather than external to each other by removing the aura of separation and the façade of two separate nation states the conflict can be framed truthfully as one between a settler colonial movement and the indigenous population in this frame self determination rather than statehood represents the main concern of palestinians since self determination belongs not to national groups as national groups but to the legitimate residents of any region whose status is unsettled 1 with this in mind young palestinians must first address their own fragmentation in a battle against israeli divide and conquer tactics reevaluate the roles of their own political institutions and lay the groundwork for a prolonged civil rights campaign that will cement the one state reality abandoning separation for good the role of the palestinian authority perhaps the most imperative issue for evaluation is the role of the political bodies that currently serve to represent the palestinian struggle for self determination emerging as a product of the oslo accords the palestinian authority pa was founded to serve as a semi autonomous government structure with the goal of facilitating the eventual establishment of an independent palestinian state within the 1967 borders palestinians have since viewed the pa as the primary vehicle for aspirations of statehood and sovereignty and the central focal point for institution building however the palestinian leadership has come under growing criticism regarding issues ranging from internal corruption and inefficiency to their failure to lessen the burdens of occupation let alone achieve actual independence a recent poll by the palestinian center for policy and survey research found that a majority of palestinians actually view the pa as a burden over 64 percent want president mahmoud abbas to resign and a vast margin have lost faith in the administration s ability to continue the peace process and establish an independent state 2 some have even abandoned their calls for independence for fear of the substandard political reality that the pa would establish if statehood were to be achieved while it is abundantly clear that the pa has failed in its central objective of achieving independence it can be argued that the inherent nature of this form of palestinian leadership is counterproductive to an integrative solution to the conflict the first and most obvious point of criticism lies in the accusations of institutional weakness and corruption that have plagued the pa since its inception the pa is almost entirely dependent on aid from external sources ranging from the u s government to sympathetic arab governments and influencers between 2001 and 2008 the level of donor aid to the pa increased by 500 percent reaching a staggering 58 percent of the gdp a level of dependence that continues to rise 3 while much of the economic growth in the palestinian territories can be attributed to increases in donor aid a 2012 world bank report found that the growth is not sustainable due to its heavy dependence on continued flows of indefinite external funds 4 the fracturing of the palestinian economy at the hands of the israeli occupation has effectively morphed the palestinian existence into a humanitarian problem laying responsibility for sustaining the palestinian population in the hands of the pa and the international community the incessant dependence on aid has instilled in palestinians a sense that they are intruders on their own land living in submission and dependence and has engineer them into perpetual beggars 5 as a result the international community s commitment to relief and charity rather than assisting in the quest to achieve palestinian self determination has simply allowed the perpetuation and consolidation of the status quo silence and cooperation in regard to the ongoing occupation has been the main condition for continued funding and the central reason the pa is permitted to continue with limited autonomy palestinian tax revenue is actually controlled by israel which has repeatedly withheld funding from the pa in retaliation for acts of palestinian resistance that range from violence to attempts to further the case for independence in the united nations in march 2015 israel withheld over 130 million in monthly tax and customs revenue to punish the pa for its attempts to join the international criminal court a move that would raise pressure on israel regarding potential war crimes 6 with mounting debt the pa has found itself increasingly unable to pay employee salaries further increasing its dependence on donor support and exacting a devastating effect on the economy due to this high dependence on donor aid and israeli economic cooperation palestinians are further silenced for fear of losing the sustenance they require more significant than the institutional and financial weaknesses of the pa is the fact that the governing body fails to adequately represent the entirety of the palestinian population and actually enhances the occupation rather than providing an effective channel for resistance since its establishment the pa has failed at representing a majority of the palestinian population due to its push for an independent state within the west bank and gaza strip focusing almost exclusively on programs catered toward palestinians of the occupied territories to further compound this the right of return for millions of palestinian refugees has been put on hold in today s negotiations to the point that palestinian officials have themselves admitted that refugees may never be included in a final deal additionally the pa does not represent the palestinian citizens of israel as they have come to form their own political organizations independently in effect not only does the pa fail to represent a majority of the palestinian population it furthers the fragmentation of the palestinian movement and political identity most importantly the pa has come to serve two central roles that allow for the continuation of the israeli occupation and the overarching conflict paradigm first the pa relieves the occupier from the bulk of the costly and routine responsibilities of conducting a protracted military occupation while serving as a façade of independent government it assumes roles ranging from providing goods and services to those living under occupation to establishing an internal security network that cooperates with the israeli military to prevent resistance from the occupied population the pa security forces have even been known to forcibly stifle protests against the israeli occupation and have been accused of carrying out torture and infringing on free speech a report issued by the ramallah based coalition for accountability and integrity found that the security sector received over 1 078 billion of the overall 3 86 billion palestinian budget a portion of the budget that was larger than the health and education sectors combined 7 as a result the professionalized pa security forces have been dubbed subcontractors that allow israel to maintain the occupation while avoiding direct contact that damages its image abroad in other words the dirty work is carried out by the pa themselves further perpetuating israel s disengagement initiative and allowing israel to selectively extricate itself from the equation yet maintain overarching control over the entirety of the territories second the pa effectively shields israel from the non jewish demographic threat keeping the ever growing palestinian population on the other side of the divide by building semi autonomous political infrastructure and pursuing policies aimed at achieving independent statehood the pa gave israel an alternative to outright ethnic cleansing in their attempts to maintain a jewish majority within israel proper while simultaneously and gradually expanding israel s territory in effect any palestinian government bent on independence inherently opposes and obstructs the formalization of the one state reality this puts the final touch on israel s disengagement strategy all while directing palestinian resistance efforts to the goal of independence and furthering israel s conflict narrative that blurs the internal asymmetrical relationship that actually defines israeli palestinian relations the pa has come to represent an unproductive conduit of palestinian energy as anger is channeled through petty internal disputes and accusations of corruption that merely contribute to the continued disintegration of potential palestinian political clout popular frustration has not been effectively translated into mobilization against the israeli occupation but rather toward ongoing disputes like the divide between fatah and hamas while resistance was once expressed through grassroots led actions like the first intifada palestinians now depend on the weak pa and its futile negotiation attempts in hopes of achieving the central goals of self determination and an end to the occupation in truth the pa has come to truly embody aspirations for statehood thus epitomizing a path doomed for continued failure the future of palestinian nonviolent resistance with this in mind it is clear that the only way to shift the conflict discourse away from the failed two state paradigm and toward an integrative movement for self determination is by dissolving the pa forcing israel to reassume full occupation responsibilities over the west bank and gaza strip since the dissolution of the pa would represent a tactical component of the strategic shift palestinians will have to refrain from establishing institutions or interim autonomous governance in order to force israel to face two options the first would be israel s consolidation of the one state reality which would subsequently pave the way for a protracted palestinian civil rights movement the second would be israel s termination of the occupation entirely which according to precedent seems highly unlikely of course this would necessitate an agreement with hamas and all palestinian political factions in order to ensure that they do not attempt to take advantage of the potential vacuum to expand their powers palestinian political representatives will have to focus their leadership efforts on mobilizing the masses through a grassroots campaign for nonviolence the absence of the pa and in essence any autonomous government would effectively render the palestinian israeli relationship increasingly reminiscent of apartheid south africa a vital comparison in the process of reframing the conflict paradigm as one between a settler colonial power and the indigenous population and a potentially strategic move that the israeli leadership has been openly wary of although it is important to recognize the disparities between the two situations in particular the fact that the south african state depended on black south africans for cheap labor and then denied them the right to vote the prospects of the palestinian population falling under direct control of the israeli government drastically alters the situation will the now leaderless palestinians then be able to vote freely in israeli elections or will israel deny them that right among others in an effort to maintain israel s status as a jewish state effectively delegitimizing israel s widely touted claims of being the only democracy in the middle east with this in mind the south african experience presents not only an encouraging example of what was once a seemingly impossible reconciliation process but a model of potentially productive tactics that may be implemented in a strategic push for an integrative solution to the conflict the civil rights struggle against apartheid in south africa gained worldwide attention exposing the injustices of the apartheid regime and gaining vast international support which proved vital in buttressing the internal civil rights movement that triggered the ultimate fall of the apartheid regime for decades in line with the overarching fear of a demographic imbalance israeli leaders have repeatedly noted the threat that a palestinian civil rights movement within an integrative state framework would be to the future of the jewish state in 2004 ehud olmert then deputy prime minister of israel commented that more and more palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated two state solution because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an algerian paradigm to a south african one that is of course a much cleaner struggle a much more popular struggle and ultimately a much more powerful one for us it would mean the end of a jewish state 8 thus the palestinian demographic advantage is clear not necessarily as a means of strictly pursuing an integrative solution but as a vital bargaining chip for civil rights faced with a formalization of its status as a clearly undemocratic state israel will have to either permanently give up its expansionist ideals by granting palestinian independence or abandon its status as a democratic state choosing the latter would mean enduring a protracted civil rights movement that would likely end in either a secular democracy or a binational state if israel s nondemocratic nature is successfully exposed to the world the international pro israel lobby will find it increasingly difficult to defend israel s moral position it was after all the clarity of the cause that made south africa s anti apartheid movement so attractive to the world community the clear inbuilt framework for injustice and the obvious asymmetrical relationship between the indigenous oppressed and settler colonial oppressor differentiates the south african anti apartheid movement from the current palestinian struggle for self determination and justice despite facing similar discriminatory policies both in the occupied territories and israel palestinians struggle has historically been more fragmented complex and defined by a false narrative of separation thus the palestinian movement must strive to address its own fragmentation reestablish a united palestinian front and embark on a nonviolent civil rights movement aimed at exposing the one state reality and israel s settler colonial status at this point the only viable means of shifting discourse would involve a combination of internal pressure through mass organized nonviolent movement with a campaign to muster international support the new palestinian struggle must be for rights self determination and justice in an integrative solution creating this unified framework would require substantial effort to organize and mobilize the palestinian population which for the past decades has remained locked in a simultaneous mélange of all three stages of pallo jordan s resistance theory 9 many support military resistance in hopes of expelling what they see as a settler population some back the direct negotiation process while others have accepted the one state reality and hope to join palestinian israelis in the call for civil rights and integration clearly only one of these positions recognizes both the permanence of israeli jews and the failure of the separation discourse establishing a shared understanding of the need for integration and the one state reality that already exists must represent the first order of business in the push for a shift in discourse in order to remedy their fragmentation palestinians must identify a universal platform based on a discourse that focuses on the pre 1948 palestinian experience and that underscores the indigenous settler colonial relationship this process must be constructed around an inclusive vision of palestinian identity not only uniting palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip but including the palestinian refugee and diaspora population in dialog historically excluded from the peace process the palestinian refugee population must play a central role in the discourse shift as their reality serves as a living embodiment of the palestinian suffering that began even before 1948 and the palestinian indigenous identity that must be reclaimed however it is paramount to first dispel the abstract utopian discourse of return 10 that frames the right of return within a false narrative of what palestine once was and can be for example an independent palestinian state will not be capable of absorbing an influx of refugees and it is equally unrealistic to expect israelis to accept any number of refugees into their midst regardless of the integrative solution envisioned yet palestinian refugees must be accorded rights to a spectrum of remedial options that include the right to return restitution and resettlement as noted in multiple united nations resolutions and international laws and norms 11 most important however is the restoration of functioning representation to the refugee community in other words their demands must be placed equally alongside those of palestinians within israel and the occupied palestinian territories as part and parcel of the unified platform for resistance accordingly palestinians must prepare for a protracted process of what omar barghouti terms ethical de colonization or de zionization involving simultaneous dialectic processes of both reflection and praxis anchored in international law and focused on the ultimate goal of social and political inclusion 12 this involves engaging in a process of breaking down the deeply entrenched oppressor oppressed dichotomy a practice similar to that which occurred and continues to transpire in south africa here palestinians should highlight the importance of recognizing the difference in rights of self determination between the settler colonial power and the indigenous palestinians and ask the question are jewish israelis entitled to self determination in historic palestine as a separate exclusive community at the expense of the rights of the palestinians recognizing the exclusive detached settler colonial rights to self determination inherently undermines that of the indigenous population based on un general assembly resolution 3236 the palestinian right to self determination was elevated to the recognized status of an inalienable right differentiating it from the acquired rights of the settler colonial population 13 thus the exercising of settler colonial self determination that actively excludes the indigenous population is not only illegal under international norms and law but immoral as it directly denies palestinians their basic rights this is not to deny the rights to self determination of jewish israelis anywhere but rather to begin a discourse that is aimed at dismantling their privileged settler colonial status however by taking this approach palestinians walk a very fine line as these arguments have understandably been interpreted by jewish israelis as they were by white south africans with existential fear in truth one of the central factors that contributed to ending apartheid in south africa was the african national congress s presentation of an integrative plan of inclusion rather than violent exclusion 14 against the backdrop of calls for equality white south africans had expressed fears of being driven into the sea these mirror the qualms of many israeli jews ultimately palestinians must incorporate a genuine understanding of the driving factors behind the existential fears that many israeli jews endure not merely for the sake of morality but for the chance for mutual engagement between moderates of both sides thus much of the potential for success of the next stage in the palestinian struggle will be dependent on emulating the call for inclusionary reforms that genuinely make israeli jews full partners in building and developing a new shared society free from all colonial subjugation and discrimination the most magnanimous offer any oppressed indigenous population can present to its oppressors 15 therefore the path to sustainable peace and internal palestinian self determination must be based on three central tenets that clearly mirror those of recent rights based initiatives like the boycott divestments and sanctions bds movement ending the occupation ensuring equality through an integrative solution and recognizing the centrality of the refugee right of return reference may also be made to the core principles put forth in the future vision documents that were penned by a group of palestinian israeli politicians and intellectuals led by shawki khatib head of the supreme follow up committee of the palestinians in israel and of the national committee of the heads of arab local councils this vision outlined three basic principles including the fundamental rights of palestinians in israel equality before the law and self determination and autonomy calling for a dismantling of jewish preference and a binational state with equal rights 16 this platform must be built upon achieving palestinian unity the interdependence of individual and collective rights and the technical and moral need for integration however as was the case in south africa this can never be achieved through continued appeasement or begging alone the use of armed force as a means of attaining their political goals has not only proven ineffective historically for palestinians but pits palestinians against israelis in an arena where is strongest and the palestinians are weakest 17 more importantly the use of violence often serves to equate both parties rather than forwarding a narrative of the oppressed resisting their oppressor and giving the palestinians the distinct moral high ground 18 with their demographic advantage palestinians must utilize the only means of resistance that has historically proven effective nonviolent civil disobedience through the utilization of an official mass based civil rights movement inspired by both the south african struggle against apartheid and the first intifada palestinians can work to pressure israel through direct nonviolent disruptive actions while simultaneously regaining interest and vital support from the international community the role of the international community with israel s firmly rooted military economic and diplomatic superiority the palestinians cannot exert sufficient pressure alone even with an effective mass civil rights movement this underscores the vital role that the international community and israelis play as a balancing force in any future stage of the palestinian struggle without foreign intervention through diplomatic pressure sanctions and general divestment the palestinians simply have little sway this is the central reason that prime minister netanyahu has been so adamantly against engaging in indirect negotiation processes that include the mediation or support of international actors like the united nations that aren t unquestioned protectors of israeli interest instead israeli leaders insist on direct negotiations with their palestinian counterparts representing the most effective way of taking full advantage of the asymmetrical balance of power and ensuring that any agreement follows israel s guidelines as a response to israel s apprehension of international mediation the palestinian rights movement must be tailored to attract and entice an international audience and build support on current initiatives like the bds movement that are already gaining ground across the globe without the pa the bds movement will benefit from more visible materialization of the settler colonial indigenous dynamic making the call for blanket boycotts on israel more applicable thus strengthened the bds movement will provide the international wing of the internally led nonviolent civil rights movement tasked with raising international pressure on israel the gradual worldwide shift in support for the palestinians represents an opportune moment to engage in a widespread shift in official discourse according to a recent study by the pew research center liberal democrats in the united states have adopted increasingly pro palestinian stances and more importantly millennials have become increasingly sympathetic to the palestinian cause 19 the u s presidential election of 2016 displayed this shift as bernie sanders was able to compete for the democratic party nomination despite overtly criticizing israeli policy and citing the suffering of palestinians according to joel kovel the struggles of the palestinians themselves to achieve the status of an actual people in the world s eye have finally borne fruit and this combined with the continual demythologizing of zionist claims has finally created the condition for the awakening of a collective conscience on their behalf 20 this presents a unique opportunity for palestinian youth to exhibit their political activism through the growing channels of expression that have become increasingly available through social media and the spread of easy access to direct information however with the trump administration s clear unbridled support of israel and its expansionist intentions palestinians must work to situate their struggle as a fundamental component of the liberal opposition campaign in the united states if palestinians can maintain a platform of nonviolence and visibly endure the brutality they inevitably face the international community will find it increasingly difficult to maintain support for an openly violent undemocratic israel the youth role at this point we are confronted with perhaps the most challenging question can palestinians coalesce form a united front and then sustain a committed nonviolent movement in the face of continued occupation and violent oppression to answer this we can point to the ever persistent determination of palestinian youth who despite the crippling hardship they face prove their ability to mobilize and productively channel their political energy on a daily basis in truth an uprooting of the status quo in favor of a renewed civil rights based movement provides the most opportunity for palestinian youth who have emerged out of the failure of the peace process ambitious and restless yet voiceless and disenfranchised today well over 30 percent of the palestinian population is between the ages of 15 and 29 signifying a sizable portion of the population that has not benefited from adequate political input much like their counterparts across the arab region a recent palestinian center for policy and survey research study found that palestinian youth between the ages of 18 and 22 are least supportive of the two state solution and are most intrigued by one state proposals especially when faced with a realistic description of what an independent palestinian state would look like 21 in reality in the age of globalization the disintegration of political borders and exposure to the internet palestinian youth are less interested in their predecessors goals of achieving an independent state and are more focused on gaining individual rights regardless of the political backdrop through their frustration and desperation an increasing number of young palestinians have retreated from political involvement and have instead turned to individual struggles additionally a growing number have come to view armed violence as the only means of achieving their political goals 22 this has been most obvious with the recent trend of lone wolf knife attacks that have been predominantly carried out by young palestinian teens these recent outbursts of violence by young palestinians not only represent attacks on their occupiers but more importantly symbolize assaults on the status quo in other words they show that young palestinians have already begun abandoning what they see as a failed path and are attempting to take matters into their own hands with no other alternative or conduit for their political input their potential energy is lost to desperation however dwarfing these sporadic outbursts of violence and proving the potential for sustained nonviolence have been the ongoing protest movements pioneered by young palestinians for more than a year palestinian youth have positioned themselves at the forefront of the ongoing great march of return staging regular nonviolent protests along the gaza border and bearing the brunt of a violent israeli response that has led to the death of more than 200 unarmed demonstrators including journalists and children as young as 14 23 although hamas continues its attempts to hijack the movement tainting the demonstrations with efforts to stage unsuccessful breaches of the border young palestinians persist they continue to confront live sniper fire in an effort that despite their persistence will likely change little on the ground another recent example of the ubiquitous determination of palestinian youth was the recent set of protests in jerusalem sparked in response to israeli occupation measures that included the closure of the al aqsa compound with little international support and in the face of an extremely violent response from israeli forces the determination and persistence of young palestinians forced israeli concessions in what was at the very least a symbolic victory equally important was the fact that both hamas and the pa played little to no role in mobilization but rather grassroots efforts proved most effective perhaps the most applicable source of inspiration that can be harnessed by today s youth is the first intifada a hallmark of palestinian nonviolent resistance and a vital model to build on the first intifada which began in 1987 and led to the start of the oslo peace process arguably represented the most effective means of pressuring israel both internally and externally a proof of the ability of young palestinians to mobilize without a central leadership and a successful way of drastically shifting the conflict discourse as anger boiled over palestinians took to the streets in huge numbers without a central leadership or iconic figureheads they engaged in nonviolent demonstrations blocked roads staged sit ins and strikes and vociferously and openly expressed their palestinian identity with palestinian flags and an overwhelming sense of unity in fact the israel defense forces itself actually classified 97 percent of intifada activities as nonviolent 24 as the uprisings continued they were met with devastating violence from israeli forces including beatings notably the publicized order by then defense minister yizhak rabin to break the arms and legs of protesters live ammunition house demolitions curfews imprisonment and torture 25 the violent response resulted in the death of more than 1 370 palestinian civilians with tens of thousands severely injured or imprisoned 26 the nonviolent protests and the violent israeli response thrust the realities of palestinian suffering and anger into focus for israelis causing many to begin to question their own government and its occupation and even began to gain the attention of the international community swayed by images of children confronting tanks and heavily armed soldiers 27 these acts successfully displayed the vast discrepancy in power between the palestinian people and israel s war machine and led to a reversal of the narrative that israel represented the david in the fight against the arab and palestinian goliath 28 one of the primary indicators of the uprising s international political impact was the united states refraining from its customary veto of un security council resolutions criticizing israel 29 at home israeli criticism of their own government s disproportionate use of force contributed to the rise of the labor movement s pro peace platform and sparked an increase in palestinian israeli solidarity groups ultimately the intifada represented the central factor in actually bringing both parties to the negotiating table as it ensured that the palestinian problem could not be ignored the intifada also showed the ability of palestinians to mobilize without a central leadership at the helm and to shift the conflict discourse the swell of largely unorganized popular action emerged as a grassroots movement and displayed the potential power of palestinians despite their territorial fragmentation with the palestinian leadership in exile in tunisia at the time palestinians proved that they don t necessarily need a gandhi figure to lead their struggle against israeli occupation by glancing back to the first intifada as an example of the potential of a mass civil rights based movement palestinian youth can build on the already vast array of nonviolent modes of resistance that they already employ ranging from peaceful sit ins to heightened support of the international bds campaigns however as their actions expand young palestinians must be prepared to bear the brunt of an israeli reaction that may be even more intense than previously experienced with palestinians calling for equal rights in an integrative solution the israeli government will seek to justify a violent crackdown by arguing that the nation s jewishness and ultimately its survival depend on it palestinians will be forced to withstand substantial pressure and maintain their dedication to nonviolence in hopes of simultaneously pressuring israelis as well as gaining sympathy over 62 percent of israelis perceived palestinian resistance during the first intifada as violent despite evidence to the contrary 30 this will represent an increasingly difficult feat with the rise of the far right within israel and the extensive impact of the disengagement policies however if palestinians can maintain a generally nonviolent stance and absorb the blows of the israeli reaction israel will find it increasingly difficult to defend its self perceived victim status if sufficient effort is dedicated to shifting discourse mobilizing palestinian youth effectively channeling their political energy and even training them in methods of nonviolent protest young palestinians will find themselves in a unique position of influence as they constitute the most vital component of a mass palestinian civil rights movement instead of fighting for leaders and a political process that has repeatedly failed them a strategic shift will present an opportunity for grassroots organization and an effective nonviolent channel for their pent up energy palestinian youth have come to realize that their struggle is not for illusive borders and imbalanced political agreements but rather for liberation from jewish primacy in zionism s ultimate vision of israel they will fight for their own civil rights dignity and the chance to develop their lives past the limits in which they are contained under occupation and political stagnation in truth palestinian youth are not unfamiliar with assuming the center stage in leading widespread nonviolent resistance against israeli occupation and they repeatedly demonstrate their mobilizing prowess young palestinians represent a budding amalgam of frustration and hope effectively representing the only viable weapon against israel s crushing political machine conclusion the downfall of the two state solution did not merely emerge with the fragmenting effect of israel s facts on the ground the political gridlock that prevents their removal and their crippling impact on the viability of a future palestinian state rather the two state proposals and the overarching theme of separation have been based on an inherently unjust conflict discourse that ignores the central causes of the conflict and disregards vast swathes of the palestinian population ensuring that a solution that is based upon these principles will be doomed before its implementation by following this one sided approach to solving the conflict the current peace process ignores the core roots of palestinian identity and suffering simply reconfiguring or repackaging the continuous israeli domination of almost every aspect of palestinian existence more importantly the continuation of the current two state approach displays the acceptance of zionism s unwarranted settler colonial territorial claim over that of the area s indigenous inhabitants making the palestinian right to self determination subordinate to the recognition of israel s right to maintaining an exclusively jewish state in truth it is the palestinian people that have adjusted their outlooks to suit the trajectory of the zionist project and have lost their claim to sovereignty self determination and collective dignity by settling for separation neither palestinians nor israelis will forgo their claims to historic palestine and it is just as unlikely that either party will accept the division of what they both see as their rightful homeland due to this mutual unremitting hold along with the physical reality that exists as a result a just solution can only be reached through some form of integration that recognizes equal individual rights while simultaneously acknowledging the underlying and undeniable nationalist identities that are so deeply rooted in both peoples with alternatives largely undeveloped due to their absence from the official discourse palestinians must lead the shift in strategic approach in order to reevaluate the meaning of their struggle the palestinians resilient as they have been for decades must recognize that statehood no longer represents a vehicle capable of achieving their aspirations of self determination and equal rights which means that the reality of israel s unjust settler colonial sovereignty can only be combated by turning the conflict inward to do so palestinians must look to the first intifada and the south african struggle against apartheid as not only examples of more effective ways of exerting both internal and external pressure on the settler colonial power in question but vital ways of reframing and coming to terms with their own reality in order to confront the inevitable upcoming stage of resistance in john kerry s words if the choice is one state israel can either be jewish or democratic it cannot be both 31 israel will be forced to choose either granting equal rights to palestinians through instituting a one state secular democracy and creating a binational state or accepting palestinian independence with the recognition of the territorial and population integration that will have to accompany it this proposal is not meant to serve as a definitive solution to the palestinian israeli conflict but represents what may be the only means for palestinians to regain interest in their cause reframe the conflict parameters and embark on a path toward rights regardless of the specific political state structure in essence this merely lays forth the next stage of the palestinian struggle for self determination and equal human rights which will be a protracted civil rights movement with the aim of ensuring that the status quo is not sustainable for israel in the long run however israel s most comprehensive success and the factor that continues to serve as a shield against struggles for justice has been their ability to deeply fragment not only the physical existence of palestinians but more importantly their very identity in truth the fate of the next stage of the palestinian struggle for rights and dignity will be dependent on their ability to unite transcend their physical and political divisions and rebuild their shared sense of identity but after undergoing such a thorough systematic process of fragmentation through occupation and expulsion the question is whether a unified palestinian platform can even be identified and maintained in the face of inevitably severe israeli repression will palestinians prove capable of overcoming the countless physical and political boundaries that have been constructed at their every turn will the oppressed become oppressors themselves or will they be forced to fade into silent suffering in the shadow of history as have so many as the world complacently accepts another casualty of settler

traditionally we indians honor warriors we honor not only our own warriors but also our adversaries when they act with honor as well as courage the dominant culture has a mixed record in looking after warriors when the war is over trying to put warriors back in the position they would have occupied had they not gone to war is not awarding them an honor it s partial payment of a debt the united states got off to a bad start when pay of revolutionary war soldiers was suspended during the war in 1777 because the value of the continental dollar was declining so rapidly as to make the currency near worthless anyway dead men collect no pensions after independence was won in 1783 paying its soldiers quickly fell off the agenda of the new nation revolutionary war officers formed an officers only lobby called the order of cincinnati to get what they had been promised half pay for life if they served for the duration when it became clear the money was not there george washington brokered a compromise a bond worth five years pay at maturity most officers sold their bonds at deep discounts and ordinary soldiers got nothing congress finally funded pensions for indigent revolutionary war veterans in 1818 and extended them to all surviving veterans in 1832 so the average age of the few surviving vets was 67 after waiting almost 50 years for what was owed them most died within five years note that life expectancy at birth for those who served in the american revolution was 36 years the official history of the department of veterans affairs relates that only 3 000 revolutionary war soldiers drew any pension at most out of about 200 000 men and two women we know of who saw combat this tradition of delayed compensation for veterans continued in wwi after which vets got a bonus certificate redeemable in 1945 the great depression intervened and most veterans found themselves unemployed they began demanding early redemption of their bonus certificates and some 43 000 demonstrators calling themselves the bonus army came to washington and vowed to stay camping in public places until the bonuses were paid don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free on the orders of president herbert hoover general douglas macarthur supported by six battle tanks commanded by then major george s patton attacked the bonus army and burned their encampments hoover got public blame and suffered retribution at the polls that same year 1932 although it was retribution for the great depression that sunk him newly elected president franklin d roosevelt faced with a smaller bonus army making the same demands sent his wife eleanor into the veterans camp alone as a result of her negotiations fdr issued an executive order waiving the enlistment requirements for wwi veterans so they could get immediate work with the civilian conservation corps congress finally paid the bonuses over fdr s veto in 1936 president hoover did leave one legacy for veterans when he proposed in his 1929 state of the union to consolidate all veterans programs that had been spread across three bureaus into one agency on july 21 1930 hoover signed an executive order creating the veterans administration the suffering of world war i veterans helped assure that world war ii veterans would become the first generation to be offered prompt and comprehensive benefits this was the first gi bill of rights covering medical care education home ownership and even temporary support while seeking employment the gi bill especially in breaking down historical barriers to higher education changed the united states forever the new commitment to veterans became law in 1944 but it was not until 1959 that the va would adopt a motto that described a standard of conduct veterans would allegedly have a right to demand the va motto came from one of the finest speeches ever given by a president abraham lincoln s second inaugural with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations pretty words alone however don t heal broken soldiers excellent care if you can get it veterans of wwi what they called the great war or the war to end all wars until wwii came along got 60 and a train ticket home after much agitation that was supplemented by the bonus act but congress put off the expense of actually paying the bonuses until 1945 not anticipating the country would be back at war in 1941 the violence in the streets against the bonus army from wwi was so recent when wwii began and the need for military service was so great smart politics called for more attention to the needs of veterans wwii service came with new expectations about how returning warriors would be treated and the politicians who got bloody noses from the wwi vets were mostly still in charge still the wwii gi bill was controversial on the grounds of cost and of moral hazard opponents feared that the taxpaying makers would be bankrupted by a new class of takers moral hazard was the point made by the chair of the house committee for veterans affairs john rankin d mississippi when he remarked during discussion of the gi bill the bane of the british empire has been the dole system the wwii gi bill passed over both objections instead of bankruptcy the country began a period of unprecedented prosperity instead of creating a class of bums the middle class expanded by the gi bill became the primary engine of that prosperity gi loans drove postwar demand for housing creating construction financing and sales jobs gi education raised the skill levels and therefore the wages of an entire generation these outcomes balanced out the substantial costs to the taxpayers by creating more taxpayers in higher tax brackets than had existed before the war the 16 million men and women who served active duty in wwii were a larger portion of those eligible for military service by age and health than we ve pressed into service before or since the timing of the enlistments was as important to planning for veterans as the number of enlistments just about everybody was in uniform for the duration the upside to the duration hitch was the motivational saying the way home is through berlin or tokyo the downside was so many people hitting the civilian economy and becoming eligible for gi bill benefits at the same time perhaps overwhelming the fragile new system as it happened the predicted flood of newly discharged gis hit colleges and the housing market that had been moribund during the war harder than it hit the treasury the most fearsome benefit in the gi bill to the budget hawks the one most like the dole was the controversial 52 20 clause offering 20 a week about 280 in today s dollars for a year to vets seeking work the cost turned out to be trivial rather than a budget buster less than 20 percent of the funds set aside for 52 20 were ever paid out because most returning gis found work right away or took advantage of education benefits don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free va medical care also took leaps forward after wwii with the numbers of eligible men at an all time high as well as more women veterans than ever before the va was off on an expansion that has never stopped and seldom paused when the first head of the va resigned in 1945 the man picked to navigate the major changes in store was gen omar bradley hero of the north african campaign and commander of most of the american ground forces in the final push from normandy to berlin bradley s appointment signaled that the va would be a serious post war priority bradley recruited gen paul hawley chief surgeon for the european theater to form the va department of medicine hawley got more bang for taxpayers bucks by matching va hospitals with medical schools the hospitals got the services of interns and the medical schools got a set of research subjects that could not be duplicated in the civilian world bradley s first report on the department of medicine described 97 va hospitals on line with 25 more under construction and major additions to 11 more all that amounted to a bit over 100 000 beds to serve a tsunami of 15 million veterans coming home from europe and the pacific as the armed forces dialed back to occupation duty all beds were full in no time and both the army and the navy had to share available beds with the va while the building of new va hospitals and the expansion of existing ones continued the population to be served was the greatest number of returning veterans in u s history but the degree of difficulty was further ramped up by the fact that they all showed up at once the wave of wounded warriors from wwii was a major shock to the new medical system since the system was built out to accommodate the end of wwii injured veterans have entered into the system from battles in korea vietnam grenada panama somalia kuwait iraq and afghanistan in addition to the devastating physical trauma military doctors have always seen there have been modern hazards like agent orange exposure from operation ranch hand in vietnam and gulf war syndrome from breathing the chemicals released when saddam hussein torched oil fields the constant recycling into combat zones since 2001 has ramped up what we now call post traumatic stress disorder ptsd formerly known as soldier s heart shell shock and battle fatigue about the time the first gulf war veterans were hitting the va system 1997 congress got one of the few straight up comparisons of the cost of federal medical programs ever done medicare was spending 5 450 per patient but medicare served the elderly the va was spending 4 798 by comparison the indian health service was a cheap date at 1 578 patient satisfaction can only be measured after people get into the system and that has been the rub for the va while any veteran can report to a va hospital patients are classified by disabilities received in the line of duty the degree of disability not only defines a place in line but also how much of the cost the veteran has to pay if any the scandal of how long the va was taking to make disability determinations began to break in 2012 and intensified in the light shined by a new vets organization iraq and afghanistan veterans of america that average processing time was 262 days which was then a 20 year high don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free republican presidential candidate carly fiorina claimed in the september 16 2015 gop debate that 307 000 veterans died waiting for health care the washington post rated that statement two pinocchios because there is no way to draw that conclusion from the va inspector general report she cited because others made the same mistake they spared her three pinocchios but the 307 000 number represents the number of records coded pending in the va database but coded as deceased in the social security database the va database includes veterans who died before the beginning of the enrollment system in 1998 and veterans who never applied for anything and persons who are not veterans at all the post characterized it as a contact list the misunderstanding of the ig report does point out a reason for delay in processing disability claims until very recently all the paper was moved by hand as if the computer revolution never happened in the va a similar but separate scandal originated in the phoenix va in 2014 this time involving veterans who were already enrolled in the system but were unreasonably delayed in seeing a doctor the delay was bad enough but worse the wait times were falsified to make delays appear shorter deaths while awaiting care were an issue and a cnn report in april of 2014 claimed at least 40 veterans had died in phoenix alone the va had established a goal of getting veterans in non emergency cases to a doctor within 30 days back in 1995 in spite of reports that goal was not being met the va shortened it to 14 days in 2011 two va doctors have expressed what they thought of shortening an unmet deadline in extremely colorful language that unfortunately they will not allow me to repeat the reason for the delay was lack of enough doctors and nurses in light of the aging of vietnam veterans and the growing flow of iraq and afghanistan veterans into the system the delay had reason lying about the delay did not the manipulation of wait time data first discovered in phoenix was found in many va hospitals across the country the number of veterans who lost their lives as a result has been argued ever since but nobody can claim that number to be zero as a result of the wait time scandal secretary of veterans affairs and former general eric shinseki lost his job by all accounts shinseki was a soldier s general whose heart was in the right place but he was handicapped by thinking that just because he gave an order it would be obeyed president obama replaced shinseki with army veteran and former procter gamble ceo robert mcdonald the thinking was that the problems in the va were management problems that called for the skills associated with business while the management shakeup was going on the veterans access choice and accountability act of 2014 was making its way through congress with the bipartisan team of independent member of the democratic caucus sen bernie sanders of vermont and republican sen john mccain of arizona as sponsors president obama signed the bill into law on august 7 2014 it added 16 billion to the va budget with 10 billion to get civilian care for veterans on the wait list and 6 billion to hire more doctors and nurses it also gave the secretary of veterans affairs the power to fire people that had inexplicably not existed before three months later the person in charge of the phoenix facility that kicked off the scandal was finally fired it did the va image no good when it came out that she had been paid over 90 000 while on administrative leave following the scandal other high level administrators were fired in alabama georgia and pennsylvania as well as at va headquarters the total of eight people fired almost certainly is less than the number of veterans who lost their lives over either the treatment delays or the cover ups that prevented fixing the treatment delays the wait times for both disability determinations and doctor appointments have diminished substantially since the heads rolled and they continue to move in the right direction although there is some complaint that moving the backlog in medical care has expanded the backlog in other va programs va hospitals continue to train medical students and to lead research into traumatic brain injury and the design of prosthetic devices care for women veterans continues to improve treatment for ptsd remains inadequate but not for lack of attention rise of the chicken hawks the world war ii generation shook up the old idea that only the upper class went to college indian hispanic and african american veterans became plaintiffs in lawsuits to open up the right to vote women having violated traditional sex roles to keep the economy going on the home front were disinclined to surrender their new status the naacp had put the civil rights movement on hold for the duration of wwii except for demanding access to all jobs in the military the gi bill quickly overwhelmed historically black colleges and a series of lawsuits was begun that over time integrated professional schools graduate schools and colleges naacp litigation finally culminated in brown v board of education the beginning of the end of segregation by law although segregation by custom and as a side effect of segregation by class remains to this day discrimination was not ended by the wwii gi bill what ended was the willingness of non whites to suffer quietly litigation was slow and changes incremental by 1946 new york and parts of bordering new jersey recorded over 67 000 zero down payment home loans guaranteed by the gi bill less than 100 went to non white veterans in the same year the university of pennsylvania thought to be the least discriminatory school in the ivy league enrolled all of 46 black students in a student body of 9 000 change was slow and painful and came mostly in the courts through the 50s but when the children of the wwii generation decided in the 60s and the 70s it was time for direct action they were building on the education and experience and yes the courage of their elders after wwii the threat of nuclear annihilation confined wars between the u s and u s s r to proxy wars in former colonial states these are the wars the baby boom generation grew into and they lacked the moral clarity and near unanimous support of wwii so did the veterans the makeup of the veteran population has changed since wwii through the vietnam war the numbers of persons serving in the military were under two percent of the population although much higher in indian country about 90 percent of indian vietnam vets were volunteers and over half served in combat a va report in 2006 taking in desert shield storm enduring freedom and iraqi freedom showed indians still serving out of proportion to their numbers in the general population interestingly indians are overrepresented in the navy marine corps and coast guard but underrepresented in the army and air force six percent of veterans are women a number that has climbed ever since wwii ten percent of indian veterans are women when the u s went to an all volunteer military after vietnam the number of persons serving dropped to under one percent of the general population and the number of indians serving dropped as well because of a more rigid requirement of a high school diploma according to the va educational attainments of newer indian veterans look more like the general population than in previous generations with fewer people serving in the military fewer veterans are being elected to congress where responsibility for va funding starts congress also has the constitutional authority to declare war an authority that has fallen into disuse since wwii in the years after wwii over half of the people serving in congress were veterans while it seemed like everybody did military service in what we now call the good war in fact it was just under 10 percent twice that among american indians the number of veterans in the population dropped rapidly in the cold war years but their numbers in congress continued to grow peaking at about three quarters of congress in 1971 since 1971 the numbers of veterans serving in congress have been declining they currently stand at about 20 percent veterans in a body charged with picking which wars to fight and what resources to devote to veterans afterwards the vietnam war was highly controversial and when men of military age during vietnam began to assume positions of power and authority we saw the rise of the american chicken hawk the chicken hawks supported the vietnam war to the last drop of other people s blood while they had as one of them put it other priorities or bone spurs some voters are offended to see persons who opposed the vietnam war such as bill clinton elected to high office but more are offended by persons actively in favor of the war who could not be bothered to fight willard mitt romney spoke out in favor of the war he didn t fight and it was perhaps no surprise that none of his five sons found time to pull a hitch either george w bush was able to score a spot in the air national guard where he was able to avoid the war and learn to wear a flight suit all at once in the 2016 election cycle several chicken hawks were contesting to make the most bellicose noises in favor of sending other people to fight for their country the only veterans in the entire field were republicans rick perry and lindsey graham and democrat jim webb and all of those candidates fell by the wayside early president obama liked to brag that va funding was at a historic high that in itself is not terribly meaningful because funding would be at a historic high because the amount of business is more meaningful facts were that under obama the va budget rose 68 percent and the backlogs that were going up changed direction while va funding is supposed to be exempt from the budget madness of sequestration across the board cuts thought to be so idiotic they would force congress to agree on targeted cuts veterans still got hammered as sequestration forced federal state and local governments to cut payrolls those jobs normally carry veterans preferences and the downside to those preferences is that the middle aged people being turned out are disproportionately veterans wal mart can only hire so many greeters veteran unemployment is at an all time low as the economic recovery continued under trump but it s hard not to see the political impact of the rise of the chicken hawks in the perverse history of sen jim webb s d virginia update of the gi bill webb a marine corps and vietnam veteran and father of a marine introduced the new gi bill on the day after he was sworn in it quickly drew public opposition from president george w bush and sen john mccain their concern was that richer education benefits would harm retention rates the congressional budget office scoring predicted that the new gi bill might decrease retention but it would increase recruitments by similar numbers still bush threatened a veto and mccain did his best to bury it in committee which is a time honored way to kill a bill without anybody having to go on the record opposed bush finally agreed to sign it in a package deal to continue funding the iraq and afghanistan wars outside the normal budget process for 2008 mccain did not come off the campaign trail to vote for the compromise barack obama did obama attacked mccain for turning veterans education into a partisan issue mccain responded by noting that obama did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform while most of the politicians obstructing jim webb s bill were chicken hawks sen mccain can never be tarred with that brush still it was a bit much when president bush invited mccain to the signing ceremony as if it were mccain s work product rather than something webb had to do the heavy lifting to accomplish looking back most observers would agree that the fight over military retention was really the same fight as the original gi bill it was all about the money for webb the new gi bill was a major reason he wanted to be in the senate but the other was ending the iraq war something he was not able to accomplish webb is not exactly a pacifist having returned from vietnam with two purple hearts two bronze stars the silver star and the navy cross having done what he felt he could do he did not stand for reelection the combination of chicken hawks and budget hawks is potentially deadly for veterans before obama was elected the immediate costs of war were off budget the costs of caring for veterans could not be moved off budget because of all the infrastructure to be supported so budget hawks were always lurking around va expenditures rumbling underneath all the challenges veterans face homelessness unemployment substance abuse suicide is the social experiment the u s is running on the one percent who choose to defend the country how much ptsd is generated by deploying to a combat zone every other year indefinitely ptsd cases overrun the va treatment efforts now will the incidence of ptsd continue to grow will the symptoms decline over time without treatment what kinds of treatments are most effective we don t really know the answers to any of these questions as long as only one percent of the population serves but we keep extending old wars and starting new ones this social experiment moves forward into unknown territory it would be ironic if veterans survived multiple deployments to combat zones and then fell victim to the budget priorities of the chicken hawks who sent them this post was previously published on www medium com and is republished

ten years after a us backed coup handed honduras over to big business the country is rising up a leader of deposed president manuel zelaya s party explains to the grayzone what s behind the protest wave by alex rubinstein the streets of honduras were filled with protesters and clouds of tear gas as the month of june began the national police fanned out through the country to crush the protests with heavy handed tactics at the direction of president juan orlando hernández the us supported neoliberal leader who won power in elections marred by documented fraud as the protests peaked fire was set to the doors of the american embassy in the capital tegucigalpa in an apparent act of retribution against the united states for its role in propping up the widely unpopular president it was a striking act of symbolic resistance that recalled events in 1988 when hondurans burned the vehicles of us embassy personnel to protest washington s dirty war against nicaragua the fortifications installed around the us embassy after that incident may have prevented the latest burning from consuming the rest of the building ten years ago the democratically elected center left honduran president manuel zelaya was whisked away from his residence in a brazen military raid supported by the united states zelaya s removal cleared the path for the interests of big business across the country as the ten year anniversary of the u s supported coup approaches hondurans are rising up against neoliberal austerity measures imposed by washington and the international monetary fund imf that have triggered mass public sector layoffs and raised prices on basic goods following mass demonstrations on friday may 31 which were especially sizable in the capital of tegucigalpa the grayzone spoke by phone with gerardo torres secretary of international affairs for the liberty and refoundation party libre the new party to which zelaya now belongs yesterday and today we declared a national strike which was successful the estimate is that there were over a hundred demonstrations in honduras in the last two days he said throughout the month of may healthcare workers and educators organized widespread demonstrations against decrees by hernández that put their livelihoods in immediate jeopardy honduran citizens have followed these public sector workers into the streets infuriated by imf loans that required the government increase electricity costs while slashing healthcare and education anger about the abuses of foreign mining companies was also a major factor in the protest grievances honduran people went out in the streets and not only the health workers and teachers but all of the workers and political organizations and people that are fighting against mining companies the people that are fighting for land and for the defense of their territories for their natural resources we all got together with the teachers and the health workers libre s torres explained we have been in a struggle for more than a month in recent days the demonstrations have increased right now honduran police are repressing a protest road blockade in southeastern danli while today they repressed protest at el salvador honduras border see video there was also a march in tegucigalpa today honduras pic twitter com nl9ojzrgpj honduras solidarity hondurassol june 12 2019 in early may the imf and the honduran government reached a staff level agreement on a usd 311 million loan meaning that it still requires approval from the imf executive board according to the imf the agreement reforms the public electricity company empresa nacional de energía eléctrica enee energy distribution was privatized in 2014 and sold off to the highest bidder the honduran commercial finance bank it isn t clear what reforms the new imf deal will bring on torres said that the imf is demanding that education and healthcare the public system should pass to the control of intervention boards that would oversee and manage a change to the system the problem is that those agreements that the government has already signed allowed them to fire many people a key objective of the economic program is to maintain macroeconomic stability while enacting economic and institutional reforms to foster inclusive growth policies will build on previous achievements to strengthen the policy and institutional framework the imf says by touting its previous achievements in honduras the imf has signaled how out of tune it is with the country s poor and working class who have experienced no such gains in their own livelihoods while the imf s macroeconomic agenda has fostered economic growth it has been anything but inclusive restricted to country s elite and the drug cartels they work with the conditions faced by the poor majority have only worsened negotiating a neoliberal nightmare while the measures that would be imposed under the new imf deal remain unknown the effects of neoliberalization on honduras s health and education sectors have brought economic punishment down on the country s workers the government s spending on education nearly a third of the overall budget one year after the coup has been slashed to less than a fifth according to honduran economist hugo noé pino healthcare spending was slashed by 20 percent meanwhile honduras has the highest poverty rate in the continental americas 65 7 by the last available official government count in 2016 with a staggering 42 5 of the entire population classified as living in extreme poverty the harshest austerity measures were meted out by juan orlando hernandez a us friendly politicians whose election in 2013 violated the honduran constitution and was marred by fraud following his first year in office hernández oversaw the layoffs of 2 000 employees of the government owned electric company known as enee thousands of sanitation and public telecommunications workers have also been let go under the government of hernández meanwhile repeated fuel price hikes since 2012 have devastated the working class and sparked popular resentment corruption has gone hand in hand with the austerity measures and are now described simply as honduras s operating system massive protests in 2015 followed the revelation that hernández s allies had gutted the honduran institute for social security ihss stealing healthcare funds to finance electoral campaign and defrauding the public through selling wildly overpriced placebos to the ihss for vast profits while protesters demanded an anti corruption body akin to the then robust united nations led cicig in neighboring guatemala they were instead handed a toothless anti fraud mission called maccih anthropologist adrienne pine an associate professor at american university who has lived in honduras and written extensively on the country told the grayzone the maccih is frankly something of a laughingstock in honduras seen as a technocratic tool of the u s government to legitimize the hernández regime it has pursued mostly small safe targets in cases that do little to threaten the current structures of power put in place through the u s supported 2009 coup but when the biggest example of corruption imaginable the blatant theft of the country s election happened on its watch in 2017 the maccih remained silent pine said and when you have violently anti democratic policies like imf led efforts to privatize healthcare and education overriding the will of the honduran people that doesn t fit within the maccih s narrow definition of corruption either back in 2014 a paper from the washington based center for economic and policy research cepr think tank on a 189 million imf loan noted that the poor would bear the brunt of the economic shock therapy five years later with this prediction confirmed hernández is pushing for more austerity in the name of reform as torres explained we have seen in the hernández government how he has destroyed all of our public services with the intention to transfer those public services to private hands in a neoliberal strategy that we all know very well you destroy the public institutions and then you say that there is no other way to save it unless it s passed to the private sector designing a de facto dictatorship when he was elected president of honduras in 2009 manuel zelaya struck a less radical posture than those of most of his progressive counterparts across latin america he brought a minimum wage to the country and instituted some much needed economic reforms it was only after he signed cooperation agreements with venezuela through the petrocaribe economic alliance and began to work towards resolutions on land disputes between poor and indigenous populations that multinational corporations government insiders and u s backed civil society groups began to turn up the heat in the lead up to the coup cia cutouts like the national endowment for democracy ned and united states agency for international development usaid were pumping 50 million a year into honduras for democracy promotion us backed civil society groups like the honduran council of private enterprise and the center for international private enterprise focused on driving a wedge between big business and zelaya by june 2009 the coup plotters were confident enough to make their move the night before they came for zelaya they met with a high ranking u s military official the defense department was reportedly concerned that zelaya s presidency gave venezuela s then president hugo chavez increasing influence in the country in an early morning military operation zelaya was rushed onto a plane bound for costa rica the plane took a pit stop at the u s s soto cano air base known locally as palmerola zelaya described the operation as a kidnapping upon landing in costa rica a little less than a month later the u s embassy in honduras sent a cable to the white house and a handful of higher ups in the state department including secretary hillary clinton the cable later released by wikileaks declared that there was no doubt that the raid constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup describing the coup as a kidnapping the embassy concluded that none of the arguments of regime change supporters had any substantive validity under the honduran constitution some are outright false while clinton s state department did not openly endorse the coup it immediately defied the organization of american states oas unanimous demand that zelaya immediately return as president clinton unilaterally circumvented the oas informally recognizing the business friendly roberto micheletti as the democratically elected president to be the negotiations took place at gunpoint once zelaya returned to honduras and were designed to legitimize the coup behind democratic guise clinton s long time confidante lanny davis meanwhile was hired by the honduran chapter of the business council of latin america to serve as the primary beltway lobbyist for the coup together with clinton davis consolidated a regime change narrative within washington circles the post coup elections in 2009 marked by fraud and violence brought porfirio pepe lobo sosa into the office of presidency lobo sosa like the current president was also adjacent to drug trafficking his son fabio lobo is serving a 24 year sentence in the united states for conspiring to import cocaine into the country meanwhile lobo sosa s wife rosa elena de lobo is facing up to 80 years in jail for having pilfered nearly usd 500 000 from public coffers during his time in office ironically lobo sosa is now calling for his successor juan orlando hernández to resign due to austerity measures ushered in by his government and enforced through the militarization of the country juan orlando hernández quickly became a hated figure among average hondurans nevertheless he announced he would run for reelection which is explicitly banned by the constitution what s more hernandez s party was banking its success on a series of dirty tricks during the run up to the 2017 election the economist obtained a two hour recording from a participant in a training session held by hernández s national party for party activists manning voting tables at polling stations on election day by the economist s count the session s leader advocates at least five vote rigging methods couching them in banal terms such as strategy and technique the magazine reported hernandez s opponent salvador nasralla was five points ahead with most of the vote counted but suddenly election authorities stopped releasing results almost two days later when the vote counting resumed nasralla s lead had vanished allowing hernández to squeak by with a tiny margin of victory election observers from the organization for american states noted the lack of guarantees and transparency as well as the accumulation of irregularities mistakes and systemic problems that have surrounded this electoral process during the pre electoral phase election day and the post electoral phase that as a corollary do not allow the mission to have certainty about the results from an on the ground perspective torres recounted the timeline of the vote counting process to the grayzone when they had 80 percent of the votes counted we were winning by five points and so they shut down the system 466 times until they started winning again we went to the streets and we were on the streets for a month fighting then the u s ambassador heidi fulton appeared before the nation saying that the united states recognized hernández as the winner then they provided the support of the united states military forces and they continued giving money to hernández repressing the resistance protests against the apparent fraud exploded around the country the office of the un high commissioner for human rights found that at least 22 civilians were killed in the protests and at least 16 of them were gunned down by police 1 300 people were thrown in jail many in military detention centers we have two compañeros who are still in prison a year and a half after they were accused of burning the front door of a hotel in tegucigalpa torres noted edwin espinal and raúl álvarez await trial in the military run u s style maximum security la tolva prison 16 months later edwin espinal and raúl álvarez are political prisoners edwin s case in particular is particularly egregious as he is a well known human rights defender who has been threatened arbitrarily detained and even tortured dozens of times by honduran security forces since the coup for his work organizing for social justice causes adrienne pine told the grayzone his criminalization for standing up for human rights and democracy stands in stark contrast to the impunity enjoyed by the violent state security forces and death squads pine continued the fact that edwin has protective measures issued by the inter american human rights court meant nothing to the u s supported regime which has placed him and raúl in pre trial detention in a prison designed for the most violent organized criminals putting both of their lives at serious risk edwin has lost nearly fifty pounds and has been refused necessary medical care honduran prisons are notoriously inhumane due to poor sanitation overcrowding and insufficient nutritional standards the country s prison system is designed to accommodate 10 600 inmates but held nearly twice that in 2018 the un high commissioner s office cites credible and consistent testimonies that those detained during the 2017 electoral crisis were subjected to abuse in some cases constituting torture and that the police had fired upon protesters indiscriminately the same report also found that during the protests at least six journalists were attacked by police and broadcasts that criticized the government were shut down attacks on the press during the post electoral crisis were just the tip of the iceberg however even the ministry of justice and human rights of honduras itself a part of the government documented the murder of 25 journalists between 2014 and 2016 while hernández was in power in 2016 the body also registered 16 violent attacks on lawyers in which 13 were killed since the 2009 coup according to the human rights organization cattrachas more than 300 lgttbi lesbian gay trans travesti bisexual and intersex hondurans have been killed the numbers represent a dramatic increase in violent hate crimes against the community compared with previous periods the below graph shows the number of violent murders against members of the lgttbi community per year in red compared with the number of cases for which anyone has been charged with the crime and in 2019 alone prior to the current uprising the un human rights office received 51 complaints about murders of human rights defenders in the country of which at least 21 have been verified by un human rights office a new criminal code to go into effect in november published on may 10 lays bare the prosecutorial priorities of the honduran government for one the law reduces the maximum prison sentence for aggravated drug trafficking by five years some new penalties introduced under the law bring prison sentences as low as four years for trafficking crimes it also opens up the door for traffickers who cooperate with investigations by authorities the legal reforms were proposed in the wake of the 2018 arrest of president hernández s brother juan antonio hernández in miami on drug trafficking charges according to libre s torres the us has looked the other way while the hernández government has done the bidding of powerful local drug cartels the united states knew in 2017 that juan orlando hernandez was being investigated over participation with drug cartels and still supported him and allowed him to forcefully stay in power with an illegal reelection and without winning he said meanwhile journalists and publishers face fresh risks under the new criminal code including crimes against honor and crimes against morality defamation and slander may now come with increased prison sentences including more than a year behind bars prison sentences for women who get abortions and doctors who perform them will increase to up to six and 10 years respectively participation in illicit meetings and protests will also be punishable by up to four years in prison while protest leaders and financiers could face 15 years these draconian measures have been met with virtual silence from washington and little coverage in a corporate us media that served as a megaphone for nicaragua s right wing opposition when it launched a coup in april 2018 the hypocrisy is really obvious torres said nicaragua is just beside honduras we are neighbors and it s interesting how in two countries that are so close that are in the same region the u s has such different policies the contradiction in treatment between honduras and nicaragua can be easily understood in terms of us military interests just over 50 miles from tegucigalpa is the palmerola soto cano military base where the us army has free reign hernández supported us threats against venezuela acceded to trump s call to move the honduran embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem in violation of international law and agreed to surges in us troops in the country s northern territory to have more control in the caribbean and central america even though the dea has some investigation into hernández it is clear that the u s southern command wants hernández in power torres explained taking aim at the fountainhead on friday tires were set on fire in the doorway of the u s embassy in tegucigalpa the associated press reported that it wasn t clear why those who set fire to tires at the embassy s doorstep weren t stopped by guards outside the embassy while the uprising has been largely peaceful acts of property destruction have occurred protest leader and head of the honduran medical association dr suyapa figueroa blamed infiltrators from this country s dictatorial government in response to a tweet friday by reporter gilda silvestrucci noting that 20 minutes has passed since a group of masked individuals set and there were no police officers or firefighters to be seen the black fraternal organization of honduras ofraneh responded what a coincidence one of the most surveilled and protected locations in honduras earlier in the day a national police truck was seen transporting tires manifestantes queman sede de la embajada de estados unidos en tegucigalpa honduras como protesta del apoyo de donald trump al gobierno corrupto de juan orlando hernández como no es venezuela los medios callan el hecho antonioguterres mbachelet onu_es pontifex_es un pic twitter com yuuk4ku7rb javier alexander roa roajavier may 31 2019 adrienne pine the anthropologist at american university noted the similarities between false flag operation that took place at the tegucigalpa marriott and the embassy fire are obvious in the former instance police uncharacteristically disappeared from the scene numerous infiltrators from the national party were clearly identified and recorded inciting and participating in violence yet only longtime human rights defenders were criminalized and are being held as political prisoners pine continued the same thing happened last friday you see the unprecedented absence of security forces at the u s embassy just before a group of heavily disguised individuals set the fire and the immediate targeting of social justice activists despite a similar lack of evidence that they played any role in the vandalism while the fire very well may have been an act of sabotage by an agent provocateur it could have also been the result of the pent up anger of the honduran population at the united states for its role in the coup and dictatorship that followed bystanders at the scene chanted american trash american trash as the fire burned since may 24 the embassy had issued three security alerts and two demonstration alerts it also issued a statement condemning the arson which read the acts of violence that took place today at the u s embassy in honduras are unacceptable we are working closely with the honduran authorities to bring those responsible to justice a week later protest leaders refused a government offer for dialogue vowing only to engage in talks once the government s imf backed scheme targeting the healthcare and education sectors are withdrawn a few days later activists announced that social security workers from the ihss would join the struggle though the protests were triggered by the latest round of privatization measures hondurans are also lashing out against the outside powers that imposed these policies the action against the u s embassy is something that has been historically prepared in the mind of the people torres told the grayzone people are aware that the united states embassy is the only reason why juan orlando hernández is still the president of honduras

home archives 2006 on 2019 mig at the centre of the narrative of elections by suranjita ray ever since garibihatao poverty eradication became the most popular slogan which appealed to the large majority of poor people across the country that brought the congress party to power in the 1970s the poll manifestoes of leading political parties have focused on several poverty alleviation programmes and schemes despite various interpretations of understanding poverty and its causes that has made it difficult to arrive at a consensus on the poverty alleviation strategies minimum income guarantee mig income assurance has remained central to poverty eradication and has been endorsed by several political parties to legitimise their manifestoes as pro poor and pro people while the bharatiya janata party blames the congress party of having betrayed india in the name of poverty for almost 70 years the congress party describes the nyunatam aay yojana nyay as a surgical strike on poverty as it will undo anyay injustice by empowering the poor to overcome the recent impairments that policies of demonetisation and a flawed goods and service tax have caused this blame game has reignited the debate on poverty which re emphasises that poverty cannot be reduced to income deprivation alone nyay a big promise to abolish poverty unlike several schemes that target the farm households for income support such as the central government s pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi pm kisan yojana biju janata dal s krushak assistance for livelihood and income augmentation kalia scheme in odisha telangana rashtra samithi party s farmers investment support scheme fiss rythu bandhu in telangana and all india trinamul congress party s krisak bandhu scheme in bengal the congress party claims that nyay is a universal scheme that promises a direct cash transfer of rs 6000 per month and rs 72 000 per year to 50 million very poor families amongst the poorest 20 per cent of india s population nyay promises 12 times an annual income transfer than pm kisan yojana and claims to be the biggest anti poverty programme that will benefit 25 crore poor which will cost 3 6 lakh crore per annum it also claims to be women centric as the money would be credited to the bank account of the woman of the household the congress spokespersons defend that a minimum basic income will ensure equality and justice for the poor people they argue that consultation with renowned economists and experts suggest that the poorest indians live on rs 6000 and helping them with an additional amount of rs 6000 would lift them above poverty in remonetising the economy nyay will jump start the indian economy like a vehicle that is started by a key though the economy growing at a faster pace will not necessarily alleviate poverty supporters of nyay argue that income transfer will enable the poor to meet their essential needs by spending the money praveen chakravarty chairperson of the data analytics department of the congress party believes that an unconditional cash transfer gives the economic freedom where some families might choose to indulge in consumption while others may choose to upgrade the skills of their children this will restart the economic engine kickstart the economy as a consumption boost will give rise to pick up in the investment demand this will create new jobs and increasedtax revenues will lead to the second part of nyay which will jump start the economy while the congress party president ruled out the role of progressive taxation levying higher taxes on the rich middle class the question of resources for such schemes largely remains unanswered alongside the past experiences suggest that since a majority of the poor depend on the informal sector or casual work and self employment the difficulty to learn about the accurate income of each household remains surveys and studies conducted all over the country have found large scale exclusion and inclusion errors in the methodology used in the below poverty line bpl census in 1992 1997 and 2002 resulting in further errors in selecting households for certain schemes and programmes of the ministry of rural development and the state governments while the basic income cash transfer schemes experimented in a few countries such as finland and brazil to address the rising inequalities have some merits in achieving welfare and a decline in poverty rate very few studies show the long term effects of large income transfers in fact income assurance only addresses the symptom of poverty therefore while the economists and policy analysts such as thomas piketty lucas chancel and raghuram rajan argue in favour of the scheme nyay they also caution that the latter should not be taken as a miracle or a final solution they argue that while reducing monetary poverty is important nyay should be supplemented with health and education to address human capability deprivation such deprivations contribute to the decline in human capabilities to earn sufficient income through labour work poverty a systemic deprivation our past experience reveals that an increased growth in the economy has also seen increasing inequality and poverty and sections of society have continued to remain excluded deprived marginalised alienated and are vulnerable to the processes of impoverishment across the country ray 2010a 21 26 therefore under standing poverty as a condition characterised by severe deprivation of basic human needs that not only depends on income but also on access to social services saw the shift in the approaches from estimating poverty based on the income necessary to acquire a daily consumption of 2400 kilocalories in rural areas and 2100 kilocalories in urban areas as per the 1979 nutrition expert group to the planning commission to the necessity to consider lack of basic needs such as access to education shelter health sanitation drinking water and other basic services that become important in measuring poverty failure of basic capabilities results in a vicious circle of chronic under nutrition poor health unsanitary conditions which in turn increases their vulnerability to infectious diseases that hinders their motivation and reduces their capacity to physical work and thus deems them forever in hopeless poverty dreze and sen 1989 13 15 therefore investments in basic services such as health education physical infras tructure water and sanitation that build human capabilities become essential to eradicate multi dimensional poverty the rights based approach of the government for the past several years has reinforced its pro poor mandate through major policy changes such as right to employment education health shelter information and food security alongside its moral obligation the legal obligation of the state ensures that the rights of its citizens are secured a range of poverty alleviation programmes that integrated development projects micro finance and employment welfare schemes and services in health and education in particular emphasise that social spending is not only consumption but also leads to investments in productive capacity see also dehaan 2011 cited in ray 2011 321 344 however since the dominant poverty alleviation approaches have reinforced the residual approach as they focus on the outcomes most poverty studies have focused on measuring the outcomes and the question of how many are poor has always received more attention the identification of the poor and targeting them by specific programmes have become important than the more fundamental question of what are the underlying causes of poverty and the underlying structures which keep certain sections deprived and excluded poverty is the consequence of the inability to generate sufficient resources to meet basic needs which to a large extent is because of the structural conditions poverty is embedded in the structures of deprivation exclusion marginalisation and impoverishment structural poverty is economic social political cultural and psychological deprivations that constrain the full realisation of developmental potentiality of an individual group or a community therefore despite the significance of the absolute core in poverty and the need to meet nutritional requirements to avoid diseases to be sheltered to be clothed to be educated to live without shame the prescriptive definition of basic needs based primarily on the assertions of experts by simply referring to the physical needs of the individual is further debated though ensuring basic needs is a positive intervention towards poverty reduction eradicating poverty which is systemic deprivation is associated with powerlessness exclusion exploitation oppression deprivation alienation atrocities humiliation and a loss of dignity which block opportunities for escape from poverty for certain communities groups or individuals therefore despite several policies to improve health nutrition employment and education which are important for capability building we find that entitlements and empowerment remain a distant dream for the majority amartya sen argues that the absoluteness is neither constant over time nor invariant between societies sen1985 669 76 barbara harriss points out that measuring the poverty line should investigate the regionally specified relations of the poor to the process of production exchange as well as biological and social reproduction the rationality of choice made by the poor between investment and consumption the trends in the wage determination occupational portfolios household mobility and sequence of reaction to shock harriss 1992 16 as an interlocking condition of asset less underemploy ment low wages and incomes proneness to decease illiteracy gender and economic vulnerabilities social disadvantage and political powerlessness ibid 28 poverty is the consequential effect of structural inequality and systemic deprivations which produce and reinforce conditions of poverty despite its multidimensional and multifaceted nature which demands multi pronged and dynamic approaches the cross cutting element of poverty is always the structural deprivation and disempowerment of the marginalised and impoverished it is primarily the denial of ownership and control over the basic productive resources that marginalises and impoverishes the deprived and disadvantaged since poverty is the consequential effect of structural deprivation it is important to understand the structures which determine the power relations studies which trace the root causes of poverty find that engaging with the critical evaluation of myths oral traditions folklore people s memory contemporary practices and cultural beliefs explain in many ways the historical processes of increasing alienation of land land fragmentation and land encroachment distress sale of land alienation of labour and produce of labour particularly of a class caste group or a community over the years see also mohanty trivedi ray and sukumar 2010 deo cited in ray 2010 221 234 landlessness and margina lisation result from long term process of structural inequality which creates deprivation and denies basic entitlements required for minimum subsistence to certain sections of society need for structural change while the universal basic social welfare services and social security schemes need to be much more effective and the implementation of the existing subsidies for the poor such as the targeted public distribution system mid day meal programmes and employment guaranteed schemes such as the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act and minimum support price to the distress farmers need to be strengthened it is pertinent to analyse the undelivered promises and lack of political will suppressing data on unemployment and making claims that job seekers have become job givers cannot help us to address the root causes of the high unemployment rate and increasing rural distress while certain sections in society such as the malnourished and sick people the old the differently abled and the deprived and distressed need immediate income support a majority of the poorest people need to be empowered by either owning and controlling or having accessibility to the basic productive resources therefore alongside social protection or social security structural intervention should play a constructive role in eradicating the processes of deprivation marginalisation and exclusion though the unconditional transfer of a specified minimum income support to the poor has appealed the ordinary citizens to a large extent as it might go a long way in assisting to fulfil the immediate needs related to health education and indebtedness whether such schemes result in building the capability of the deprived in the long run to enable them to escape the traps of diseases debt and indebtedness and escape the processes of impoverishment famishment deprivation and denial of ownership and control over basic productive resources labour and produce of the labour still remain a major challenge as long as the root causes of indebtedness and deprivation remain unaddressed income transfers as short term policies and schemes will remain as mere relief measures the relief measures taken by the state are temporary and non structural and result in dependency syndrome therefore one of the greater challenges for policy makers to guarantee basic right to livelihood is to address the structural conditions which generate and perpetuate poverty and deprivation in certain regions for certain sections of society the themes and parameters to draw the poverty line should be in accordance with the local conditions and should not be laid down from above an accelerated growth can only be sustainable in the long run if socio economic and political development takes place at the grassroots in accordance with the demands and needs of the local people it is important to understand poverty from the vantage point of the poor and deprived the oppressed and underdeveloped disentitled and powerless people in many interior regions rather than the human development indices alone that are determined by the state and non state institutions poverty alleviation programmes will remain merely relief measures as long as the state fails to make structural intervention a larger agenda remains to link the bottom up approach and grassroots initiatives of people who are not to be seen as users and choosers but as active participants in formulating and implementing policies the non involvement of people at the local level in decision making and only targeting them as beneficiaries lack of participation and political will and poor delivery system are some of the crucial factors that are not only responsible for the non implementation of poverty alleviation programmes but also for the failure to address the underlying causes of poverty in the context of increasing unemployment and agrarian distress long term policies that address the structural causes of poverty alongside addressing the immediate causes are important the poverty alleviation programmes should be more than mere relief measures thus minimum income guarantee income transfers and other social security measures need to be supplemented by structural interventions which address the root causes of processes of inequalities margina lisation oppressions disparities deprivations alienations disentitlements and disempowerment state policies should prioritise entitlement and control over the basic productive resources which to a large extent determine relations of production and exchange which are often unequal exploitative and oppressive freedom from poverty should be recognised not just as a human right but also as a political right it is important that the poor survive with dignity

sometimes being happy to work is about an absence of pressure this blog is a fantastic example while i enjoy posting a few times per day much of this probably has to do with the fact that i don t have to do any of it sure i would love for 500 000 visitors a month to click on my site but i don t think that would change much of anything and when the results become inconsequential we are free to enjoy the process if only the byproducts we cause were unimportant in a few other areas of life too one thing that makes a passion enjoyable is that you don t have to worry about results you can strive for triumph or you can potter around tinker explore without worrying about efficiency or outcomes other people may wonder why you ve been happy to work on the same old car for years even though it s still not running but that doesn t matter to you an atmosphere of growth brings great happiness but at the same time happiness sometimes also comes when you re free from the pressure to see much growth that s not surprising often the opposite of a great truth is also true gretchen rubin the happiness project

it is hoped that the african continental free trade area afcfta the largest since the creation of the world trade organisation in 1994 will help unlock africa s long stymied economic potential by boosting intra regional trade strengthening supply chains and spreading expertise the eyes of the world are turned to africa egyptian president and african union chairman abdel fattah al sisi said at the summit s opening ceremony afcfta will reinforce our negotiating position on the international stage it will represent an important step advertisement africa has much to do its intra regional trade accounted for just 17 per cent of exports in 2017 versus 59 per cent in asia and 69 per cent in europe and africa has missed out on the economic booms that other trade blocs have experienced in recent decades economists say significant challenges remain including poor road and rail links large areas of unrest excessive border bureaucracy and petty corruption that have held back growth and integration members have committed to eliminating tariffs on most goods which will increase trade in the region by between 15 per cent and 25 per cent in the medium term but this would double if these other issues were dealt with according to the international monetary fund imf estimates the imf in a may report described a free trade zone as a potential economic game changer of the kind that has boosted growth in europe and north america but it added a note of caution advertisement reducing tariffs alone is not sufficient it said africa already has an alphabet soup of competing and overlapping trade zones ecowas in the west eac in the east sadc in the south and comesa in the east and south but only the eac driven mainly by kenya has made significant progress toward a common market in goods and services these regional economic communities rec will continue to trade among themselves as they do now the role of afcfta is to liberalise trade among those member states that are not currently in the same rec said trudi hartzenberg director at tralac a south africa based trade law organisation advertisement the zone s potential clout received a boost on tuesday when nigeria the largest economy in africa agreed to sign the agreement at the summit benin has also since agreed to join fifty four of the continent s 55 states have signed up but only 25 have ratified one obstacle in negotiations will be the countries conflicting motives for undiversified but relatively developed economies like nigeria which relies heavily on oil exports the benefits of membership will likely be smaller than others said john ashbourne senior emerging markets economist at the capital economics advertisement nigerian officials have expressed concern that the country could be flooded with low priced goods confounding efforts to encourage moribund local manufacturing and expand farming in contrast south africa s manufacturers which are among the most developed in africa could quickly expand outside their usual export markets and into west and north africa giving them an advantage over manufacturers from other countries ashbourne said the presidents of both countries are attending the summit the vast difference in countries economic heft is another complicating factor in negotiations nigeria egypt and south africa account for over 50 per cent of africa s cumulative gdp while its six sovereign island nations represent about one per cent advertisement it will be important to address those disparities to ensure that special and differential treatments for the least developed countries are adopted and successfully implemented said landry signe a fellow at the brookings institution s africa growth initiative

pekka haavisto l first vice prime minister of ukraine and minister of economic developmentand trade stepan kubiv c r and lithuania minister of foreign affairs linus linkevicius 2nd r wave during a family photo at the ukrainian reform conference in toronto ontario on july 2 2019 photo by lars hagberg afp editor s note this publication is the work of the bleyzer foundation a kyiv based international non profit organization whose mission is to promote the development of the private sector and the use of best practices in government policies to create investment friendly and business friendly environments compared to its peer counties ukraine s economy has performed poorly since independence in 1991 according to international monetary fund data ukraine s annual rate of economic growth since 1993 the first year with reliable statistics for the former soviet union to 2018 was 2 9 percent annually by contrast neighboring countries had much higher annual rates of growth during this period estonia 9 7 percent bulgaria 9 1 percent lithuania 9 percent slovakia 5 5 percent poland 5 4 percent and czech republic 4 2 percent kazakhstan grew by 12 5 percent annually while georgia also hit double digit annual growth at 10 9 percent in addition according to the world bank s doing business reports ukraine has the most unfavorable investment climate among this group of countries at the time of independence in 1991 ukraine had the greatest potential among former planned economies to develop quickly it was the second largest european country with a large population it had a well educated and skilled labor force rich agricultural soil good mineral resources a strong technical and industrial base and a reasonably developed infrastructure however despite these advantages the country failed to increase gdp at high rates and improve the quality of life of its people with long recessions lasting many years why has ukraine performed so poorly we believe that the main reason for ukraine s poor performance is that it was never able to establish a truly free and competitive market economy international experience shows that the two key elements of an efficient market are strong competition and freedom to operate in the market with minimum government interference freedom to do business without government interference will result in competition freedom to do business is the driving force while competition is the regulator of behavior market competition and freedom are therefore the key engines for growth and development in ukraine the transition from central planning to a market economy was seriously repressed by vested business interests which benefited from maintaining the pre market status quo in fact ukraine s economy still retains many of the characteristics of the former soviet union with many monopolies excessive government intervention in the economy centralized decision making very weak rule of law and widespread corruption by contrast the neighboring countries embarked on rapid transitions to institutions and policies associated with free and competitive market economies the international experience of successful countries shows that reforms to create a market economy must be quickly implemented without delay sluggish change and a slow reforms process have not yielded good results because delays provide enough time for vested interests to create strong resistance and further slow the reform process only swift and bold reform programs have a chance of success in addition an uncertain business environment discourages market entry and the adoption of better technologies in turn these policies bred corruption corruption was not the cause of poor economic performance but one of the results of inadequate free and competitive market oriented institutions and policies two of the most important actions that ukraine can take to establish a free decentralized and competitive market are the following introduce competition by rapidly de monopolizing the economy ukraine s markets are highly monopolized not because of successful individual businesses but because vested interests have close ties to those in power in addition to private monopolies the country has retained many government monopolies of the former soviet union all of these monopolies should be promptly broken down or eliminated this is particularly relevant for government monopolies in revenue generating activities which can be carried out more effectively by private companies government monopolies use their position to inhibit competition as they enjoy privileges not available to the private sector including easier access to government decisions preferential tax treatments subsidies inconsistent pricing inconsistent procurement etc today government monopolies and quasi monopolies are competing unfairly with the private sector in many revenue generating sectors such as oil and gas electricity generation water supply transportation and logistics etc the elimination of government monopolies should be accompanied by the privatization of the majority of the 3 500 state enterprises that are still operating and providing illegal benefits to selected people the role of the government should be to support private sector activities rather than to suppress or compete with them stop grand scale corruption the country has been continuously exploited by groups of individuals that maintained control of key posts in various agencies including the cabinet of ministers the parliament and the judiciary they have siphoned billions of dollars from the country which has cost ukraine up to 200 billion per year in lost gdp since independence the new leaders should just take the lead in refusing to receive money briefcases these examples would encourage others to do the same and also to refuse to pay or take bribes this should be complemented by a comprehensive framework to fight widespread corruption in the country ukraine is not unique in facing corruption countries that have been successful in stopping corruption have used a three tier framework that includes measures to 1 prevent corruption by making it more difficult and more costly to undertake 2 ensure effective enforcement by a responsible and qualified judiciary and 3 educate and secure public support for anti corruption activities in addition in order to support economic growth in ukraine there is a need to deal with russia s aggression which is increasing political risks and dissuading investments the new president and government will need to find ways to alleviate the hostilities supported by russia in crimea and the donbas this should include an agreement with russia to move its troops out of the country and terminate its hybrid warfare and misinformation campaigns ukraine will also need to carry out intensive social programs and investments to win back the support of the eastern population a strong and successful ukraine would be the first line of defense in europe it would show other former soviet republics that are not yet reformed that it is possible to have another more successful path through open and democratic elections the election of president volodymyr zelensky provides a unique opportunity for a breakthrough and leap forward towards a more modern and more developed country one that can improve the happiness and quality of life of ukrainians and can support the european union and other countries in critical areas zelensky is an excellent communicator and has the support of over 73 percent of the ukrainian people with a clear mandate to change the status quo and improve the quality of life these are unique circumstances that have created a moment of opportunity to transform the country and implement the changes long needed to reach the levels already achieved by ukraine s peers
accra the international monetary fund said ghana remains at a high risk of debt distress as the west african nation plans to clear arrears owed by energy utilities through the sale of a 10 billion cedi 2 3bn local currency bond ghana and the washington based lender are in talks over the terms of a three year debt support program that is scheduled to conclude in april 2018 as the world s second biggest cocoa producer s debt rose to 73 of gross domestic product at the end of last year the government said last month that it may issue a bond through a special purpose vehicle to clear the debts that the state owned electricity company and petroleum service providers owe to banks and other credit providers the part of the bond used to finance the debt and arrears accumulated by the state owned enterprises themselves would increase the stock of government debt the imf said on wednesday in an emailed response to questions ghana remains at high risk of debt distress continued fiscal consolidation would be required to bring public sector debt on a clearly declining trajectory finance minister ken ofori atta didn t answer calls seeking comment mustapha hamid a government spokesperson didn t immediately answer calls or respond to a request for comment by text message bank of ghana governor ernest addison who was appointed in april said last month that the bond sale wouldn t add to the debt stock if the government issues it through a special purpose vehicle and uses energy sector levies to service it if that is done then it might not necessarily be part of the government s debt addison told reporters on may 22 it depends on how that is handled discussions between the parties on how the bailout programme s objective of lower public debt can be achieved are continuing and include the possibility of extending the debt programme the imf said in the email any extension would have to be requested by the ghanaian authorities and we understand they are considering the matter the lender said read fin24 s top stories trending on twitter fin24 s top stories
however in order for the world bank and imf to implement their policies they global financial institutions began offering loans to poor countries but only if the poor countries privatized their economies and allowed western corporations free access to their raw materials and markets that was a poverty trap and many poor countries realized this when it was already too late we were in deep waters that was the beginning of much of the problems we face today in africa now we are in a vicious cycle of poverty and there seems to be no way out the western corporations flourish while the poor countries die in poverty in other words the poor in africa continue to feed the greedy rich corporations in the western world the poor get poorer while the rich get richer people continue to die from extreme poverty and hunger in africa and other parts of the world but not so many people know that the world bank imf and the world trade organization wto are behind almost all of these it is a new form of war whereby the rich western corporations employ the poverty of the poor and the ignorance of the innocent as top weapons of mass destruction in other words the imf world bank and wto are the triple enemies of progress in almost every developing country in the world today now let s see how the world bank imf and wto operate in sub saharan africa take a country like ghana for example ghana is blessed with abundance of natural resources the world bank and imf are very interested in countries such as ghana where they can easily control the natural resources and the markets there used to be some prosperous rich farming communities in the northern parts of ghana and the government of ghana used to give those rice producing farmers some subsidies to increase productivity thus providing enough food to feed the nation and increasing national income ni however the imf and world bank stood in and told the ghanaian government that they the global financial institutions would not offer any loans unless there s reduction in the amount spent on farming subsidies which benefitted poor rice farmers with significant impact on the ghanaian economy the main reason for this was that ghana had to import rice from western countries such as the united states a major partner of the world bank and imf now ghana imports most of its rice from abroad at huge costs every year so at the end of the day ghana owes the world bank and imf huge amounts of money however the money did not remain in the ghanaian economy because ghana had to use the loan to import food from abroad meanwhile the rice producing communities in ghana could have helped produce enough rice to feed the nation and even export some abroad to make more profit at this time the northern communities in ghana remain the poorest in the country with no better jobs and no opportunities at all in most parts young boys and girls some as young as 9 years old are migrating to the southern parts of the country to major cities and towns such as kumasi and accra a very dangerous journey for kids all in search for jobs so they can take care of their poor dying families back home most of these kids locally known as kayayo never return home some die along the way and some return worse than before and all thanks to the imf and world bank although part of the borrowed fund was returned to the imf and world bank we still owe them a lot that is why most developing countries have piled up loans over the years sometimes you hear debt cancellation and you may think they forgive poor countries their debts but that is not how it works in reality the world bank and imf never forgive because the outrageous amount of money owed to these financial institutions including the wto and united states of america a major partner to the imf and world bank is directly and indirectly controlling almost all the affairs of those poor countries in other words if you don t obey what the imf and world bank say then you must pay back the debt and since you cannot pay back the owed money you have no better option than to whatever you are told any leader who doesn t obey the world bank imf and wto among others is considered a terrorist and must be assassinated in most cases for example when there is an oil discovery in a developing country that owes money to the global financial institutions and their partners and the leader refuses to corporate and allow western corporations take over oil exploration business these errant individuals are quickly unseated dead or alive the case of libya s muammar ghaddafi and war in iraq explain this factual theory in summary the world bank and imf elect only obedient leaders to rule in poor countries because such political situations aid hijacking of the countries economy and markets source the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were set up during the end of the second world war wwii to rebuild the economies of europe however in order for the world bank and imf to implement their policies they global financial institutions began offering loans to poor countries but only if the poor countries privatized their economies and allowed western corporations

every developing country in the world today now let s see how the world bank imf and wto operate in sub saharan africa take a country like ghana for example ghana is blessed with abundance of natural resources the world bank and imf are very interested in countries such as ghana where they can easily control the natural resources and the markets there used to be some prosperous rich farming communities in the northern parts of ghana and the government of ghana used to give those rice producing farmers some subsidies to increase productivity thus providing enough food to feed the nation and increasing national income ni however the imf and world bank stood in and told the ghanaian government that they the global financial institutions would not offer any loans unless there s reduction in the amount spent on farming subsidies which benefitted poor rice farmers with significant impact on the ghanaian economy the main reason for this was that ghana had to import rice from western countries such as the united states a major partner of the world bank and imf now ghana imports most of its rice from abroad at huge costs every year so at the end of the day ghana owes the world bank and imf huge amounts of money however the money did not remain in the ghanaian economy because ghana had to use the loan to import food from abroad meanwhile the rice producing communities in ghana could have helped produce enough rice to feed the nation and even export some abroad to make more profit at this time the northern communities in ghana remain the poorest in the country with no better jobs and no opportunities at all in most parts young boys and girls some as young as 9 years old are migrating to the southern parts of the country to major cities and towns such as kumasi and accra a very dangerous journey for kids all in search for jobs so they can take care of their poor dying families back home most of these kids locally known as kayayo never return home some die along the way and some return worse than before and all thanks to the imf and world bank although part of the borrowed fund was returned to the imf and world bank we still owe them a lot that is why most developing countries have piled up loans over the years sometimes you hear debt cancellation and you may think they forgive poor countries their debts but that is not how it works in reality the world bank and imf never forgive because the outrageous amount of money owed to these financial institutions including the wto and united states of america a major partner to the imf and world bank is directly and indirectly controlling almost all the affairs of those poor countries in other words if you don t obey what the imf and world bank say then you must pay back the debt and since you cannot pay back the owed money you have no better option than to whatever you are told any leader who doesn t obey the world bank imf and wto among others is considered a terrorist and must be assassinated in most cases for example when there is an oil discovery in a developing country that owes money to the global financial institutions and their partners and the leader refuses to corporate and allow western corporations take over oil exploration business these errant individuals are quickly unseated dead or alive the case of libya s muammar ghaddafi and war in iraq explain this factual theory in summary the world bank and imf elect only obedient leaders to rule in poor countries because such political situations aid hijacking of the countries economy and markets source 1 like

deployment of the nearby people s liberation army contingent that earlier announced it was holding drills to review combat abilities in emergency dispatches the timing of china s efforts to politically narrow the rights of the special administrative region is closely tied to an international monetary fund forecast that china s current account balance would turn negative in 2022 due to the effects of the u s china trade war and other developments the imf said china had 2 1 trillion in external net assets as of 2018 but over 1 2 trillion of the trade surplus generated over the last decade had disappeared diana choyleva of enodo economics observed that throughout its miraculous growth phase china avoided the plight of emerging markets in latin america whose low domestic saving rates resulted in recurrent balance of payments crises worse than the 600 billion in chinese capital flight that the imf is worried about she warns that the current account surplus has already plunged

by adam n michel and travis nix the heritage foundation tns july 4 means independence day for americans but for italians it s a day to celebrate a different type of freedom it s their tax freedom day the day when taxpayers have finally earned enough money to pay the country s tax bill italy s tax freedom day falls almost three months after taxpayers in the united states paid off our tax bill on april 16 italy is not alone in europe when it comes to high taxes workers in neighboring countries have to labor on average more than two months longer than americans to pay the taxman in france they have to work for more than half the year twice as long as americans the united kingdom has one of the lower tax burdens in the european union but its tax freedom day still comes 43 days after america s the reason these countries have such high tax burdens comes down to one policy choice expansive government welfare systems a large welfare state is increasingly popular among american voters presidential candidates on the left have almost universally endorsed some version of medicare for all free college a green new deal paid family leave and other expensive government programs we are told not to worry about the cost the rich will pay for all the new spending but popular proposals such as a financial transactions tax a 70 top tax rate or a wealth tax would raise only about 6 of their proposed spending in europe it s not the rich who pay for these programs lower and middle income workers pay for the expensive european welfare state through high taxes on wages and consumption workers in europe making two thirds their country s average wage the equivalent of 37 000 a year pay a 50 marginal tax on every additional dollar they earn if a below average wage earner gets a raise the government takes half of every additional dollar that same worker also has to pay a 20 value added tax eu style sales tax when they spend whatever income they are allowed to keep a 37 000 salary is not wealthy based on american or european standards in the u s that same taxpayer is charged a 32 marginal wage tax and pays only a 6 sales tax on average in france lower and middle income workers face some of the highest tax burdens marginal tax rates on below average income earners are 70 in france and they have to work a full three and a half months longer than workers in the u s to reach tax freedom day high tax burdens have negative effects on the well being of the country s citizens and the programs they fund are less effective at meeting their goals than the private sector alternatives the reason is simple private providers have to compete for business by producing value for consumers government monopolies can perform poorly and stay in business as taxpayers aren t given the choice to take their money elsewhere high taxes and generous government provided benefits reduce the value people gain from working harder to get a promotion or pay raise because they know the government will take half their new income when you don t benefit from the fruits of your own labor there is less incentive to start your own business or be an entrepreneur high taxes facilitate a culture of complacency we have more than our independence and political freedoms to be thankful for on july 4 americans should be thankful they do not have to work as long as their european counterparts to pay the nation s tax burden when candidates talk about increasing spending u s taxpayers should understand that big government is expensive and must be paid for by all taxpayers not just the rich the 2017 tax cuts put more money back in the pockets of american workers further lessening american s tax burden these savings are only temporary if washington s spending growth continues on the current destructive course growing annual deficits without spending controls mean congress eventually will raise taxes looking to europe is a good guide to see what america s future looks like if we continue down the path of ever larger government programs the progressive agenda is a roadmap for soaking the middle class reducing spending and cutting taxes further would safeguard america s historic position as a place of not only political freedoms but also economic freedom adam michel is a senior policy analyst in the grover m hermann center for the federal budget at the heritage foundation heritage org travis nix is a member of heritage s young leader program
on friday at 8 30 am et the bls will release the employment report for june the consensus is for an increase of 165 000 non farm payroll jobs in june and for the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 3 6 last month the bls reported 75 000 jobs added in may here is a summary of recent data the adp employment report showed an increase of only 102 000 private sector payroll jobs in june this was below the consensus expectations of 150 000 private sector payroll jobs added the adp report hasn t been very useful in predicting the bls report for any one month but in general this suggests employment growth below expectations the ism manufacturing employment index increased in june to 54 5 a historical correlation between the ism manufacturing employment index and the bls employment report for manufacturing suggests that private sector bls manufacturing payroll increased 5 000 in june the adp report indicated manufacturing jobs increased 7 000 in may the ism non manufacturing employment index decreased in june to 55 0 a historical correlation between the ism non manufacturing employment index and the bls employment report for non manufacturing suggests that private sector bls non manufacturing payroll increased 200 000 in june combined the ism surveys suggest employment gains above the consensus expectations initial weekly unemployment claims averaged 222 000 in june up from 213 000 in may for the bls reference week includes the 12th of the month initial claims were at 217 000 up from 211 000 during the reference week the previous month the increase during the reference week suggests employment growth below expectations the final may university of michigan consumer sentiment index decreased to 98 2 from the may reading of 100 0 sentiment is frequently coincident with changes in the labor market but there are other factors too like gasoline prices and politics conclusion the ism reports combined were strong however the adp was weak opposite readings once again also the increase in unemployment claims during the reference week suggests a report below the consensus usually i put a little more emphasis on the ism reports than the adp report but that was incorrect last month my guess is the report will be below the consensus but there could be some bounce back from the weak report last month
the g20 summit in japan reduced fears for the future of the world economy following an agreement reached between the us and china however differences remain on protectionism and climate change leaders of the group of 20 g20 major economies warned of growing risks to the global economy but stopped short of denouncing protectionism calling instead for a free and fair trade environment after talks some members described as difficult in a communique at the end of a two day meeting in japan s western city of osaka the leaders said global growth remained low and risks were tilted to the downside as trade and geopolitical tensions have grown we strive to realise a free fair nondiscriminatory transparent predictable and stable trade and investment environment and to keep our markets open they said in a second successive summit statement that refrained from urging the need to resist protectionism japanese prime minister shinzo abe put on a brave face stressing that g20 leaders had much in common such as a shared recognition of the need for the group to remain key drivers of global growth the g20 agreed on fundamental principles backing a free trade system abe said adding that the group had also pledged stronger action to improve the dispute settlement system of the world trade organisation wto in preparing the g20 statement japan the chair of the meetings has sought common ground between the united states which opposes language denouncing protectionism and other nations seeking a stronger warning against trade tensions there were no breakthrough decisions but all the participants have confirmed their aspiration to work further on improving the global trade system including the aspiration to work on wto reform russian president vladimir putin told a news conference on saturday the fact that all have confirmed the need for this process and their readiness to work towards this process is already positive he added widening fallout from the us china trade war has jolted markets and tested the resolve of g20 members to present a united front in averting a global recession following a meeting between us president donald trump and chinese leader xi jinping the us and china agreed to restart trade talks offering some hope that the world s two largest economies can resolve their bitter dispute global stocks rose and bonds retreated on monday after the agreement reached between the us and china leading investors to bet that a breakthrough between the world s two largest economies would jumpstart global economic growth trump reportedly offered concessions to his chinese counterpart including a pledge not to impose new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on chinese technology company huawei technologies china agreed to make unspecified new purchases of us farm products and return to the negotiating table it played out as well as possible said hans peterson consultancy seb investment management s global head of asset allocation it gives us time to digest and get a bit better activity in the global economy any step towards a trade resolution and it doesn t have to be a lot of progress just a step is viewed very positively by markets said scott brown chief economist at raymond james in florida and investors at this point are trying to focus on the positive in hopes that there will be some trade resolution down the line however christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund imf warned the global economy had hit a rough patch due to the trade conflicts and urged g20 policymakers to reduce tariffs and other trade obstacles while the resumption of trade talks between the united states and china is welcome tariffs already implemented are holding back the global economy and unresolved issues carry a great deal of uncertainty about the future she said in a statement last year s g20 summit in buenos aires was the first to drop language on the need to denounce protectionism deferring to a request by washington which is sensitive to criticism of the tariffs it has slapped on some g20 members however while negotiations on trade barriers proved to be tough among leaders of the world s richest economies bilateral talks held by trump with the leaders of china russia and turkey managed to calm tensions with the three nations another meeting trump held over breakfast with saudi crown prince mohamed bin salman whose country is scheduled to host the g20 s next summit in riyadh also managed to bring the young future ruler of the oil rich kingdom to centre stage after he was shunned in last year s meeting following the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi at his country s consulate in turkey by saudi agents amid allegations that he personally ordered the brutal killing trump lavished praise on the crown prince depicting him as a revolutionary figure who is modernising his country and fighting terrorism while ignoring allegations of his complicity in the murder of khashoggi trump portrayed the crown prince as a reformer opening up a long closed society specifically citing more freedom for women it s like a revolution in a very positive way trump told the crown prince i want to just thank you on behalf of a lot of people and i want to congratulate you you ve done a really spectacular job the president also credited the saudi royal family with cutting off aid to terrorist and extremist groups all of the money that was going for groups we don t like has ceased and i appreciate that very much trump said we ve carefully followed it we ve studied it very carefully and you have actually stopped putin also seemed satisfied with the outcome of his talks with trump he said on saturday that moscow would do all it could to improve relations with the united states that have been strained by years of diplomatic conflicts over ukraine and accusations of russian meddling in us elections putin s statements were made after meeting trump for more than an hour saying the two had discussed issues ranging from trade to disarmament he also invited trump to visit moscow in may next year trump confirmed that putin had invited him to a ceremony to mark 75 years since russia s world war ii defeat of the nazis he invited me and i said i would give it very serious consideration trump told a news conference after the summit putin described the talks in osaka as a good meeting business like pragmatic and said the leaders had agreed that two way economic ties required improvement putin said he and trump had discussed the election meddling allegations and the situation in venezuela but he gave no details however in remarks made by trump before starting closed talks with putin he gave the russian leader a blank cheque saying he had assured him that moscow would not interfere in the upcoming 2020 presidential elections meanwhile turkish president recep tayyip erdogan was all smiles in a news conference in osaka while declaring that he had heard from trump that there would be no sanctions over turkey s purchase of russian s 400 defence systems nato allies turkey and the united states have been at odds over the s 400s purchase with washington warning of us sanctions if the delivery took place the dispute has been a source of concern for investors putting pressure on the turkish lira the united states says the s 400s will compromise its f 35 fighter jets of which turkey is a producer and buyer washington has also formally started the process of expelling turkey from the f 35 programme halting the training of turkish pilots in the united states but on saturday erdogan said trump had told him there would be no sanctions over the russian deal after trump said turkey had been treated unfairly over the move broadcaster ntv on sunday reported erdogan as telling reporters that the first delivery of the s 400s would take place within 10 days and that he believed the dispute would be overcome without a problem however one major topic of concern to the europeans that trump remained unwilling to compromise on was climate change after much wrangling the g20 leaders said they agreed to disagree on fighting climate change with the united states dissenting from a commitment to carry out the 2015 paris climate change agreement in a communique at the end of a two day summit the grouping said signatories to the paris agreement had reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation referring to the 19 members aside from the us the united states withdrew from the paris pact because it disadvantages american workers and taxpayers the grouping added in a subsequent section adopting a two part approach used at last year s summit in buenos aires the division reflects tussles over global warming that have repeatedly stymied international forums since trump pulled the united states out of the landmark accord to limit the effects of climate change even before the summit started the differences over climate change became apparent when french president emmanuel macron said france would not accept a final text that omitted the paris pact in that accord 200 nations agreed to limit the global average rise from pre industrial temperatures to below two degrees c 3 6 degrees f current policies put the world on track for a rise of at least three degrees c by the end of the century the united nations said in a 2016 report however the g20 did manage to agree on tackling plastic trash in the oceans in the statement the grouping said it had adopted an osaka blue ocean vision that aims to stamp out additional pollution by marine plastic litter by 2050 there were no details of how the goal would be met except that members would adopt a comprehensive life cycle approach by improving waste management and

short term borrowing costs in china have fallen to their lowest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis the people s bank of china has been injecting liquidity into the financial system to support lending to banks in smaller cities and rural areas as a result the shanghai interbank offered rate shibor fell to 0 884 percent last week its lowest level since april 2009 and only slightly higher than the record low hit during the 2008 crisis when the central government rolled out an unprecedented stimulus package worth four trillion yuan hk 4 5 trillion the less volatile three month lending rate meanwhile has fallen about 0 3 percentage points over the past two weeks to 2 627 percent which is its lowest level since late 2010 although the pboc s recent actions are in line with pboc governor yi gang s comments last month that if the trade war between the united states and china worsened china has a lot of space to adjust interest rates the increase in liquidity was also the central bank s bid to soothe credit risk concerns in smaller banks following its seizure of baoshang bank which sent jitters through the local markets in addition there are signs that lower borrowing costs have failed to trickle down with an unusually large gap between the highest and the lowest rating bank credit spreads as a result the pboc is more likely to continue its targeted easing policy this year than to cut interest rates across the board the hardest question the pboc now faces is whether lower interest rates or broader reserve requirements can stimulate growth if the economy were to fall into a trap again an easing policy across the board will as good as crying over spilled milk we must remember that the shibor fell to record lows during the global financial crisis and though it brought transient stimulus to the financial markets china s 2009 rescue package eventually caused problems of excess production capacity a lot of which is yet to be resolved at the same time it also led to high debt among local governments and enterprises so the central government decided to actively deleverage in recent years but surprisingly downward pressures on economy appeared before the deleveraging process was complete but if the pboc were to increase leverage in the market again will that solve china s long term economic problems or will it just lead to another vicious circle the pboc does not seem to be the only central bank facing the problem of trying to undo what is already done after the us federal reserve started to unwind its balance sheet and raise interest rates the us economy instantly lost its momentum making the fed suspend its shrinkage policy the markets have now started to look forward to the fed cutting interest rates this year it is clear that both the pboc and the fed are facing the same problem but it also reflects the fact that the global economy in the past decade has not emerged from the shadows of the 2007 2008 financial crisis at the same time many economies and enterprises have grown to rely on credit which could push the global economy back in the maelstrom of another huge crisis in the foreseeable future and the next financial tsunami is likely to hit us harder than the one in 2008 andrew wong is chairman and ceo of anli securities

the incoming european central bank chief christine lagarde should shift monetary policy to make it comply with the bank s mandate the head of germany s ruling christian democratic party said in an interview annegret kramp karrenbauer who took over as cdu party chief from angela merkel last december said she expected lagarde to respect and uphold the ecb s mandate for independence and an inflation target of around 2 we currently have an inflation rate that is well below that kramp karrenbauer told bloomberg in aix en provence france on the sidelines of an economy conference this has a negative impact on wealth and savings and that is why i m very convinced that there needs to be a certain accommodation and that christine lagarde together with her colleagues she doesn t decide alone will set the right course a spokesman for akk as she is widely known in germany later clarified her remarks to say she expects lagarde to cautiously adjust policy as the ecb strives to achieve price stability so it can move away from ultra low interest rates lagarde who currently heads the international monetary fund was nominated earlier this week by the european council to lead the ecb in frankfurt eu governments are considering bank of england governor mark carney to replace lagarde at the imf bloomberg reported on friday while a canadian by birth carney holds british and irish passports so his selection would technically preserve the seven decade practice of a european running the washington based lender
for too long the radical left has framed debates about reform and revolution in terms bequeathed to us from an era very unlike our own at the expense of soberly and concretely analyzing the conditions socialists face today in advanced capitalist societies like the united states a great many marxists have stressed the importance of defending the revolutionary tradition and of attempting to emulate the success of the bolsheviks in 1917 it s important to note that such a backward looking posture would have been anathema to the bolsheviks themselves to their credit they insisted on concreteness and steadfastly refused to believe that abstract formulae could be clung to in dynamic moments of crisis and uncertainty with this said i want to deliberately turn away from history and focus on the present in particular by examining the conditions on the ground today i want to address the question of whether the idea of a revolutionary rupture with capitalism still has any merit i will defend the idea of a rupture but i want to make the case in a way that it is seldom made these days by eschewing historical experience and focusing solely on capitalism as we know it today the argument proceeds in three steps first i try to show why reformism is unworkable on its own terms this implies that capitalism cannot be fixed that it must be replaced root and branch second i present a case for a revolutionary rupture with the capitalist mode of production and defend this account from a series of criticisms leveled against it by vivek chibber 1 finally i try to draw some provisional ideas about organizational forms and strategy from the foregoing arguments i i ll begin by distinguishing revolutionary from reformist appraisals of capitalism to be a revolutionary as i understand it here is to believe that the capitalist mode of production cannot be fixed that it must be replaced with a qualitatively different socialist mode of production to be a reformist on the other hand is to hold that the capitalist mode of production can be fixed from within that reforms within the framework of capitalism can successfully mitigate its worst aspects 2 for the revolutionary the long run interests of workers and the planet are simply incompatible with the continued existence of capitalism for the reformist on the other hand the ideal system would combine progressive reforms such as redistributive tax and transfer schemes policies that strengthen trade unions decommodification of health and education and so forth with an economy based on private ownership of the means of production by profit seeking capitalists i believe there are at least two decisive arguments against the reformist position first reformism underestimates the scale and depth of injustice under capitalism insofar as relations of exploitation and domination are constitutive of capitalism as a mode of production no amount of reform can substitute for abolishing the social relations of exploitation and domination themselves 3 a potentially more damning argument against reformism however is that it is practically unworkable on its own terms reformism relies on the capitalist economy for the tax revenue it needs to fund the welfare state it also relies on capitalism to provide employment income goods and services and so forth but capitalism is an inherently crisis prone system it inevitably goes through boom and bust cycles that temporarily plunge the economy into crises wherein investment grinds to a halt unemployment soars and chaos ensues crises are endemic to the capitalist mode of production rather than the unfortunate result of poor business decisions or bad state policy and so there is no way to rely on capitalism without figuring out a way to cope with crises when they arise 4 when they do inevitably arise however reformists in control of the state will face an immensely difficult choice they will be under enormous pressure to do whatever it takes to restart the capitalist economic engine by reestablishing the conditions for profitable accumulation and this will mean weakening or repealing bread and butter social democratic reforms but if state officials refuse this option and fail to restore capitalist profitability then tax revenues will drop and there will be no money to fund the welfare state either way it seems progressive reforms will have to give way we must also stress here that economic crises also entail other forms of misery for workers when unemployment soars it becomes difficult for workers to support themselves and their dependents this too will put reformist leaders under enormous pressure to do whatever it takes to reignite capitalist profitability but reigniting capitalist profitability will require policies that are detrimental to the interests of workers and the oppressed 5 this is because reliance on capitalism as an engine of growth means reliance on private investment by the capitalist class capitalists however only invest on the condition that they can earn sufficient levels of profit on their investment if this is not forthcoming they re obliged to simply hoard their capital and wait so restoring growth under capitalism means restoring confidence to ruling class investors and this in turn requires creating a good business climate with favorable conditions for profitable investment this means social democrats will be obliged to impose austerity on workers here s why from the perspective of capitalists favorable investment conditions require that labor is plentiful cheap and easily exploitable that taxes are sufficiently low to permit accumulation and reinvestment of profits and that state regulations and controls on business activity are minimal so as to give capitalists the leeway to achieve optimal levels of profit if for example workers are organized into strong unions that can resist attempts to drive down wages capitalists will correctly regard this as an obstacle to restoring profitability they will therefore demand ways of driving down wages if capitalists are required to pay heavy tax bills to fund the welfare state this will also especially in the context of a crisis obstruct their willingness to invest in the context of an economic downturn capitalists will clamor for cheaper labor and lower tax burdens both of which will have to come at the expense of workers what s more capitalists will not be reduced to begging state officials for these austerity measures insofar as they own and control the commanding heights of the economy they will have the power to discipline state officials by threatening an investment strike this they already do capitalists regularly threaten that if they don t get their demands met they ll enact massive layoffs or close down production or otherwise make decisions that starve the state and squeeze workers succinctly put the existence of a capitalist class means they can always use their class power to sabotage the economy and make things worse for the masses of the population and this is only what will happen if the capitalists play nice which we should never expect them to do in addition to being economically dominant capitalists will have every incentive to invest some of their hoard of wealth in attempts to purchase political influence and sway elections in their favor if the reformists are associated with a labor or social democratic party for example the capitalists will fund this party s opponents and at the same time try to buy off and co opt officials within the reformist camp they will use their wealth to influence mass media popular culture religious institutions university scholarship and so forth they will do their best to produce an anti reformist common sense among the masses that can be used as a bulwark against the reformist program so too will they find it in their interest to try to curry favor with the repressive apparatus of the state the police and the military indeed because capitalism will have already been in effect for quite some time they won t have to try very hard to win over cops and military brass we can basically assume that these layers will be hostile to the left committed to existing social hierarchies and generally supportive of a harsh disciplinary law and order approach to social movements moreover capitalists will lobby hard for foreign policies and military adventures abroad that maximize their profits and protect their investments thus workers in any given country will rarely have the luxury of only needing to defeat their own national ruling class they ll be up against a capitalist class whose interests and sphere of influence traverse national borders so too will capitalists do their best to ensure that unruly workers and disruptive strike waves can be quickly repressed so that capitalist production can resume smoothly this they can accomplish through a combination of legislative action investment in the repressive apparatus judicial injunctions issued by anti labor judges and so forth and if the situation really heats up capitalists can be relied upon to sponsor invasions coups and military dictatorships to discipline workers and smash the left and the movements imagine it happens like this a reformist government wins in a landslide and comes to power promising to enact a series of welfare state reforms that benefit working people they enact these policies and things look relatively good for a time until a recession hits the government resists austerity as long as it can but at some point it caves and decides it must restore capitalist profitability or face economic collapse and defeat at the polls when the government betrays its working class base workers strike against the bosses and the reformists in an attempt to defend their living standards and the reforms they recently won what then strikes are economically disruptive and profoundly damage the material interests of the capitalist class that s the point of them in fact so long as the reformists remain committed to the capitalist mode of production they have only one choice here to use the repressive apparatus of the state to break the strike with violence and force workers to return to work this they must do both because of the disruption caused by the strike and because the aim of the strike was to block austerity which the reformists already judged was regrettably necessary to get the capitalist economy growing once again i note that the somewhat simplified portrait i paint above brackets questions of imperialism national chauvinism and racial oppression among other things 6 once we acknowledge that these toxic ingredients are already baked into the basic institutions of actually existing capitalism the problems of reformism become even more difficult to overcome from the perspective of revolutionaries the problems discussed above are central to their belief that capitalist social relations must be replaced entirely but there s more to the case for a revolutionary break with capitalism than the unworkability of reformism in practice capitalist property relations are inherently exploitative they empower a nonlaboring owning class to accumulate massive amounts of wealth on the backs of a nonowning laboring class capitalists also dominate workers in the workplace and in politics more generally to dominate another person is to lord over them command them and punish them when they fail to comply 7 insofar as we re committed to freedom democracy and equal rights these problems are intolerable ii so to be a revolutionary is to believe that capitalism must be replaced but how is this momentous task to be accomplished the classic marxist position is that a break with capitalism must occur via a rupture in which the masses of workers rise up smash the machinery of the existing state and found society anew this position has come under intense scrutiny recently in a widely discussed piece in jacobin vivek chibber makes the case that such a rupture is not what revolutionaries should fight for today 8 as he puts it today the state has infinitely greater legitimacy with the population than european states did a century ago further its coercive power its power of surveillance and the ruling class s internal cohesiveness give the social order a stability that is orders of magnitude greater than it had in 1917 what that means is while we can allow for and perhaps hope for the emergence of revolutionary conditions where state breakdown is really in the cards we can t build a political strategy around it as an expectation we can t take it as the left s fundamental strategic perspective today the political stability of the state is a reality that the left has to acknowledge if this is so then the lessons that the russian experience has to offer as a model of socialist transition are limited our strategic perspective has to downplay the centrality of a revolutionary rupture and navigate a more gradualist approach for the foreseeable future left strategy has to revolve around building a movement to pressure the state gain power within it change the institutional structure of capitalism and erode the structural power of capital rather than vaulting over it whatever else we say about chibber s argument in this passage it s clear that he favors a gradualist approach more rooted in the tradition of nordic social democracy over a revolutionary approach rooted in the tradition of luxemburg trotsky and lenin the details however are far less clear in particular it s unclear whether chibber is arguing that revolution is practically unrealistic undesirable as an end in itself or both it s also unclear whether chibber means to say revolution should be off the radical left s agenda in the short run next 4 years in the medium term 5 10 years on in the long run 10 15 years or more in the future or in all of the above these details matter if a goal is simply not worth pursuing then it s hardly worth debating which strategies might best enable us to achieve it likewise if a goal however desirable it might be in itself is impossible to achieve or at any rate so far fetched as to be totally unrealistic even in the long run it s unworthy of serious consideration now or in the future but on the other hand if a goal is desirable and feasible in the long run but impossible to achieve in the short run it seems extremely unwise to push it to the side and dismiss it as irrelevant to those organizing in the here and now i want to argue that the prospects for a revolutionary rupture with capitalism are desirable and feasible in the medium to long run thus i concede that chibber is correct to say that our tactics and strategy in the coming years should not be based on the expectation of a break in the short run indeed he is quite right to describe such a position as entirely hallucinatory nonetheless contra chibber our strategies in the short run still ought to be informed by the necessity of an eventual rupture i begin by showing that the medium to long run prospects for a revolutionary rupture are not as dim as chibber suggests as i say however chibber is correct that it is unrealistic to think that a revolutionary rupture in advanced capitalist states like the united states is likely in the next five years chibber bases his case for the practical infeasibility of rupture on observations about a number of institutional features of contemporary advanced capitalism that didn t obtain in earlier periods modern capitalist states enjoy more legitimacy among the population than they did at least in europe in the first half of the twentieth century modern states have a more highly developed self conscious coherent entrenched technologically sophisticated and stubbornly determined repressive apparatus than they did in the past the capitalist class today is more coherent and organized and is better able to respond quickly to thwart a revolution than were past ruling classes to these i would add a few other salient differences modern capitalist states also have more experience coping with working class revolt and have greater means at their disposal to co opt and demobilize rebellion from below the expansion of the welfare state however underfunded and incomplete it might be gives workers a safety net that they wouldn t have enjoyed in the early half of the twentieth century mass culture in capitalist society has created a pro capitalist common sense that is deeply entrenched partly constitutive of people s identities and intricately interwoven with consumption and everyday commercial activity these are formidable obstacles that earlier socialists never had to confront and chibber is correct to say that these facts must inform our tactical and strategic decisions in the short run chibber is wrong however to think that these facts entail that revolutionary rupture is no longer possible in the medium or long term for the sake of specificity i will limit my remarks in what follows to the situation in the united states iii let us begin with the legitimacy of the state chibber is right to point out that the current crisis is primarily one of neoliberal capitalism not of the capitalist system itself but it would be a grave mistake to assume that this crisis in its totality is simply and neatly confined to neoliberalism it is not though still a small minority of the population there are millions of people in the united states who are beginning to question not simply this or that version of capitalism but the system itself this is partly reflected in the polling data showing younger people to favor socialism over capitalism by a significant margin of course the majority of those who say they favor socialism probably have in mind something like classical social democracy free medical care education a robust safety net and so on but it s significant that people identify with the word socialism in a country that has relentlessly branded any alternative to capitalism as taboo at best and evil at worst this implies a serious breakdown in the legitimacy of the regime in place though that breakdown is fraught with fissures contradictions and unevenness to swiftly conclude that the unevenness implies that the profit system has lost nothing in fundamental legitimacy would be absurd and even for the much larger number of people who say they favor socialism because they favor social democratic reform there is still reason for anti capitalists to be very optimistic after all one of the key arguments for the revolutionary perspective proceeds by way of an internal critique of the social democratic reformist positions reformism doesn t work on its own terms and must be supplemented by a break with capitalism to safeguard its own stated objectives thus the social democrats of today could well turn out to be the revolutionaries of tomorrow moreover there is an anti capitalist logic to many of these social democratic reforms insofar as they propose decommodification removing certain basic features of social and economic life from the profit driven machinations of markets altogether so even the mere popularization of social democratic reforms to the system bodes well for the anti capitalist revolutionary what of the legitimacy of the state proper however chibber is correct to say that the u s state enjoys a basic legitimacy that is more deeply felt and more widely shared than was true of any capitalist state in europe in the early twentieth century but this basic legitimacy is hardly a ringing enthusiastic endorsement on the part of the masses it largely takes the form of an assumption that our existing state institutions are natural or inevitable because they are rarely challenged or even questioned to be sure there is a broad consensus among center left and center right figures in media politics universities and so on who happily drink the american exceptionalist kool aid and buy the hype about the united states being the greatest country on earth but there is also a massive layer of people overwhelmingly poor and working class who rarely vote or participate in the electoral system who are deeply alienated from formal politics who are deeply distrustful of the officials who administer the state and even among those who do vote regularly a variety of polls surveying support for congress or the two dominant parties register deep dissatisfaction now it s true that dissatisfaction and apathy aren t necessarily energies destined to buoy the radical left but all things considered the variety of factors surveyed hardly constitute an unbreachable firewall against revolution rooted in a deep widely shared belief in the legitimacy of the existing order what of the more highly developed repressive and surveillance apparatuses of modern states here chibber is on firmer ground the realities of modern military technology mean that the question of violence arises in a form quite unlike the way it confronted earlier generations of revolutionaries the classical position still strikes me as the correct starting point social revolutions from below are not necessarily violent that is their sine qua non is not the resort to armed struggle but mass resistance to the status quo on the part of the vast majority of the population the essence of revolution as trotsky once put it is the forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of rulership of their own destiny 9 a revolution is a mass uprising in which the vast majority of the working population shatters the illusion that the status quo is inescapable casts aside the institutions and representatives of the old order and intransigently demands new radically democratic ways of proceeding still the question of violence remains the classic position would have been that if violence should be required it largely will only be needed as a means of self defense from counter revolutionary forces this is a useful starting point but the real difficulty concerns what to do if the old ruling class attempts to use state violence to repress the revolutionary movement the assumption of earlier revolutionaries was that the police would cling tenaciously to the old order no matter what they simply could not be turned in favor of the revolution and must be delegitimized disarmed and disbanded but the hope remained that large sections of rank and file soldiers could be won over to the revolutionary movement in a revolutionary situation soldiers will at some point be forced to choose sides and determine whether they ll repress the mass movement or refuse their orders and oppose the old order thus the success or failure of the movement will depend to a large extent on which way the rank and file of the military breaks the prospect of a mass socialist current within the armed forces might strike many readers as unrealistic does this rule out a rupture in the long run here i d like to emphasize the dynamic educational force of mass struggles for reform under the current system from where we re sitting today the might of the military industrial complex seems so powerful as to be practically invincible but after significant reductions in military spending an end to war and occupation abroad and a profound shift in the political consciousness of ordinary working people toward a broadly socialist worldview the military machine looks a lot less daunting so too does it look less invincible once we consider the full history of self organization and resistance by rank and file soldiers in the u s military what s more i agree with chibber that the power of capital and the state must be loosened up and weakened in the short run by legislation and reform but it s worth noting that even relatively mild mannered reformist governments of the left have been met with armed right wing resistance or have faced coups so in this respect revolutionaries aren t alone in needing to cope with the problem of state coercion or paramilitary right wing violence the revolutionary wager however must be based on a mass movement with enough popular participation self confidence and disruptive potential to carry the struggle through to completion and so too must the movement transcend the framework of the nation state and frame its task in international terms an isolated uprising will be condemned to failure so long as it doesn t spread and draw on the solidarity of uprisings elsewhere the key question here however is not one of military strategy per se it is whether revolutionary movements can garner enough popular support and generate adequate levels of mass participation in strikes demonstrations spontaneous forms of bottom up democracy like workers councils and so on but the ruling class has many weapons at its disposal besides violence and coercion as chibber notes the ruling class is better organized and has a much more dynamic capacity to respond to threats from below than it did a century ago however although it is true that the ruling class s means of responding to threats is more sophisticated its capacity to quell revolt through co optation and pro worker concessions is also quite limited for two reasons first the world economy entered a period of profound crisis in 2007 that was fixed through massive state intervention to save ruling class financial institutions that exchanged toxic private debt for public debt though the freefall came to an end healthy and sustained economic growth has not returned 10 this means the next crisis will be one in which the previous solution of massive state spending to prop up profits will not be an option in the way it was last time around thus we can expect even more severe austerity in response to another recession second the long period of neoliberal dominance means that the theory and practice of austerity is deeply ingrained among those in the state and the ruling class thus even if reforms to quell revolt would be tactically useful for maintaining long run ruling class dominance the ruling class personnel we actually have are not likely to reach for that option they are more likely to give us more of the thin gruel of austerity and cutbacks what welfare state reform measures we re able to win in the coming years will be solely the result of militant struggles against capital indeed to the extent that there is any current ruling class support for extremely modest welfare state expansion it is because of the growing threat posed by the nascent socialist movement and the ongoing strike wave in the public sector because struggle against the employers will be needed to win any reforms in the near term we can expect any victories to be confidence building not demobilizing or co opting winning medicare for all for example wouldn t demobilize workers but would in all likelihood boost militancy and lay the groundwork for even more radical changes in the future the suffocating effect of pro capitalist common sense is more troublesome and less easily slayed but the fact that it is not even now so totalizing as to pre empt any anti capitalist consciousness is reason to be hopeful indeed if it were insurmountable we wouldn t be seeing the widespread and still growing radicalization that s underway today the theoretical basis for the incompleteness of pro capitalist common sense derives in the first instance from workers daily experience of exploitation and subordination on the job this in turn inevitably produces conflict and resistance between workers and capital which brushes against the grain of the platitudes we re fed about the virtues of free enterprise and market efficiency thus what capitalism produces is not seamless robotic defenders of the system but a legion marked by mixed and uneven consciousness that contains both pro capitalist and subversive elements all at once 11 a deeper problem however concerns the profound sense in which our identity our very sense of who we are under capitalism becomes tied up with consumption habits and market activity perry anderson in his new preface to the antinomies of antonio gramsci 2018 suggests that this obstacle is perhaps the most troublesome for those who wish to transcend capitalist social relations does this rule out a mass revolutionary movement aiming to break with capitalism not necessarily anderson overstates the magnitude of the obstacle posed by our love affair with consumption for starters the goal of socialism is not in the first instance to produce fewer goods and services but to change the social relations of power governing the production and distribution of those goods and services thus the idea that revolutionary socialists must persuade people to do with less is largely based on a false premise socialism is not opposed to abundance but aims to make abundance accessible to the masses instead of just the wealthy few as it is sometimes put no luxury is too good for the working class marx s vision of socialism was one of shared abundance democratic self governance increased leisure time and radically decreased toil 12 iv here another obstacle to revolution presents itself if the institutional structure of a post capitalist society cannot be shown to be both feasible and desirable in advance of a revolutionary rupture then how could it ever be rational to undertake the considerable burdens and sacrifices necessary to build a revolutionary movement and carry it forward to completion worse still if the institution typically held up as the foundation of post capitalist societies economic planning is fraught with problems or hasn t been sufficiently tried out in practice then this obstacle becomes all the more difficult to overcome according to chibber we have to start with the observation that the expectation of a centrally planned economy simply replacing the market has no empirical foundation we can want planning to work but we have no evidence that it can every attempt to put it in place for more than short durations has met with failure the russian experience is the most elaborate example of that he continues any discussion has to proceed with a close examination of the soviet experience to try to assess if its failure was due to the particular way planning was instituted or whether the lesson is that a modern industrial economy is just not amenable to planning for chibber this failure has to be acknowledged not sidestepped it won t do to say as many marxists do that that wasn t really socialism so it doesn t count a full defense of socialist planning is clearly beyond the purview of the present essay 13 and i fully agree with chibber that the burden of proof in debates about post capitalist economies falls on socialists who defend planning we need good reason to think that alternatives to the market are both feasible and desirable when compared with the real world experience we have of market based economies the desirability of some state of affairs is moot if it s simply not feasible to bring it about now or in the foreseeable future in lieu of trying to give a robust positive case for planning then i ll take issue with the way chibber interprets the failure of soviet planning first with deference to chibber i actually do think it s crucial to begin by stressing that the soviet version of planning wasn t really socialism provided of course that we specify exactly what that means robert brenner s take on this question is exemplary so i ll quote from it generously to make my case most observers in the west and ruling groups in the east blame the system s problems reliance on planning as opposed to the market believing that planning per se cannot work except in the most ineffective manner but these observers fail to see that the effectiveness of either plan or market can only be assessed in relation to the system of social relations in which each functions the failure of planning under the bureaucratic system must be understood in terms of its system of social relationships 14 for brenner the system of social relations in the soviet system was one in which a bureaucratic ruling class dominated and exploited a class of direct producers the working class as he puts it it is this particular form of antagonism of the working class by the bureaucracy in the workplace and vis a vis the state that constitutes the central barrier for the system in securing efficient allocation and increasing productivity to see that this is so we have only to examine the situation of workers under such a system because they control neither their output surplus nor their means of production working people have no incentive either to improve their labor or to provide the information on their own local production that the planners need to plan and coordinate in short because of the lack of liberty and democracy within the bureaucratic soviet system most workers as well as many bureaucrats and managers find it reasonable to adopt patterns of economic activity that work against the system s efforts to coordinate and develop the productive forces and it is precisely to the extent that this social system lacked liberty and democracy that it does not deserve to be called socialist thus even though there is much we can learn from the failures and limited successes of soviet planning it is a serious political error to classify the discontents of the soviet system as failures of socialism if this is correct the viability of planning as an alternative to the market is not simply a technical question but a political one that ultimately hangs on the feasibility of large scale democratic self governance if we are pessimistic about the feasibility of democratic decision making on social and economic priorities then democratic planning is not likely to be seen as a serious option but socialists base their political project on the idea that all else equal we should prefer democratic decision making over alternatives in every sphere of social life thus unless chibber would like to walk back the confidence socialists have in democratic decision making in general it s unclear to me why we should be so skeptical about its prospects with respect to democratic economic planning in particular v still the question remains how do we get from capitalism to something qualitatively different no one is in a position to decisively answer this question for certain right now but this much is clear we have to find ways to take advantage of every opportunity to increase working class confidence and organization no matter how small or partial it might be revolutionaries must be deeply involved in day to day struggles for reforms because they make the lives of workers better but also because they teach workers how to fight and we ve got to actually win some of these reforms in the here and now in order to convince people that it s worth it to engage in collective action and challenge the bosses the case for solidaristic strategies for change can only be won by example what s more we need to succeed in decommodifying basic social goods in order to prove that alternatives to the market are feasible and worth fighting for but though necessary for revolutionary change robust fights for reforms are not themselves sufficient another ingredient is needed layers of organized revolutionary workers who can act independently in a coordinated fashion to win the masses to the idea that going beyond capitalism is possible and worth fighting for this layer cannot be a small sect or party outside the class it must be a collection of respected working class fighters who ve spent a long time winning trust by engaging in the struggle against capital to win reforms and these fighters must be prepared for and expect that social democracy will reach a crossroads wherein the choice will be to maintain capitalism at all costs or to maintain pro worker reforms by going beyond capitalism this crossroads will arise because capitalism inevitably produces crises that as we ve seen undercut the capitalist profits that serve as the material basis for delivering social democratic reforms those unwilling to go beyond capitalism will then be obliged to impose austerity break strikes discipline rebellion and do whatever it takes to reestablish favorable conditions for capitalist profit making if nobody prepares for this crossroads it is highly unlikely that a revolutionary transformation can be achieved what is it possible to do however to prepare for such a state of affairs there s no easy answer here and history to the extent that it will prove useful at all for revolutionaries today is mostly a guide to what not to do rather than russia in 1917 socialists today would be better served to examine the failure to break with capitalism in chile in 1973 on the one hand and in sweden in 1976 on the other 15 in chile in 1973 a government sincerely committed to building socialism via the parliamentary road was violently repressed by an employer backed and u s sponsored coup many revolutionaries draw the conclusion that allende should have armed the workers but this is too facile an explanation for the defeat of the left in this case a deeper problem lay with a flawed conception of the state and a flawed strategy for achieving radical change that leaned too heavily on existing institutions to get the job done had workers been better able to act independently in a coordinated fashion to defeat the old ruling class without illusions that the parliamentary road would be open it might have been possible to achieve a break and lay the groundwork for building new genuinely democratic institutions to replace those of the old state machinery though very different of course the situation in sweden in the 1970s holds similar lessons during this period a leftist government with a serious commitment to going beyond capitalist control of the means of production attempted to move toward a break for reasons that all socialists should study closely however the effort was defeated in the end the resistance of the capitalist class was sufficient to defeat those who wished to break with private control of the means of production but this was hardly inevitable indeed the battle may have ended differently if there had been a bigger more powerful movement of militants and revolutionaries capable of acting independently of the social democratic party and the trade union federations what of the classic leninist argument that an additional ingredient a revolutionary party of working class militants forged in struggle and trained in marxist theory supplies the key leavening needed to activate the other elements 16 the case for some such entity must at this point be tentative and deliberately vague insofar as we cannot know in abstraction from experimentation and concrete experience exactly what sort of organizational forms might be best suited to facilitating a break with capitalism in moments of upheaval nonetheless a number of general propositions can be defended in light of what we ve said above first the failure to break with capitalism in the two cases above and in others cannot solely be attributed to strategic failures by actors making decisions in good faith there is a material basis for doubting that the trade union bureaucracy and the professional politicians who lead reformist parties will have the motivation and epistemic framework to grasp what will be necessary to break with capitalism these two social groups will given their location in the system tend all else equal to favor action that preserves their social standing and react skeptically toward more risky courses of action that open up the possibility of losing their position they will tend to have an undue faith in the effectiveness of the institutions of capitalist democracy for example the trade union bureaucracy will tend to favor stable bargaining relationships rather than risky actions that aim to abolish the capitalist property relations on which collective bargaining depends the professional politicos at the helm of social democratic political parties will tend all else equal to favor what produces short run electoral victories and what conduces to their capacity to govern effectively within the framework of capitalist democracy these aren t iron laws that bind every agent in these social locations against their will but these institutional contexts do place enormous pressure on these actors that will all else equal create a tendency for them to act in a particular way to the extent that these actors break with this tendency they will be swimming against the stream here is where the case for a revolutionary core of working class activists begins these activists cannot simply permeate the leadership of the unions and the workers parties and attempt to steer them from above since they would be subject to the very same pressures as the extant leadership they must on the contrary be rooted in the rank and file of the movements and engaged in the day to day struggle of the class for two reasons first this releases them from the conservatizing pressures of officialdom imposed on union bureaucrats and parliamentary politicians second and more importantly this core of revolutionaries a militant minority as charlie post puts it must be rooted in and respected by a broad layer of working class activists who are in a position to act independently when necessary to push reluctant union leaders and politicians to go further than they d like to go 17 this militant minority has to be able to successfully argue for and win broad layers of workers to fighting collectively in the workplaces and the streets to confront the ruling class and thereby force the official leadership of the working class movement to choose sides between the capitalists and the working masses if this crucial militant minority is absent a number of hurdles for the workers movement are harder to clear first the routines of capitalist democracy encourage a certain passivity and deference on the part of the working masses sit back and we the politicians and union leaders will fight and deliver reforms for you we can expect a certain unevenness and mixed consciousness among workers on this score on the one hand this passivity will be part of common sense but on the other hand there will also be a sense of urgency and militancy that is at odds with this perspective which tendency will win out only struggle can determine that and for this reason the radical left has to be persistent in building organic working class leaders who are rooted in the class and able to win the masses to independent action when necessary but and this is crucial to be effective this militant minority needs to be aware of the history of attempts to break with capitalism and needs to be freed from illusions about the effectiveness of capitalist democracy to deliver real lasting change vi if this defense of revolutionary rupture with capitalism is successful what are the strategic implications for socialists today i wouldn t presume to know what form of organization this militant minority ought to adhere to we have more examples of what does not work than we do of healthy democratic revolutionary groupings regardless of how they re organized this much is clear if the above is correct revolutionaries must be totally immersed in the socialist movement and in the trade union movement propagandizing from the sidelines is a non starter what s more revolutionaries must immerse themselves in struggles for reform in the here and now in this sense revolutionary strategy converges with chibber s defense of fighting for non reformist reforms this must be the priority both because reforms improve workers lives and also more importantly because they raise consciousness teach workers how to fight and lay the groundwork for more ambitious changes in the future so the divide here between revolutionaries committed to rupture and those like chibber who favor a more gradualist approach will not be one that pits those fighting for reforms against purists who favor revolution or bust there will be some divergence however when it comes to which strategies best advance the struggle for reforms for revolutionaries the precariousness of reforms under capitalism and the structural pressures on state officials means that a militant rank and file workers movement is key thus there might be a tendency for gradualists to overemphasize gaining state power in the short run and underemphasize the importance of building a militant minority within the workers movement that is capable of mobilizing masses of workers to engage in disruptive strike actions in order to impose their will on the employers on the flipside however revolutionaries might be prone to adopting an ultra left position that overemphasizes extraparliamentary organizing and leaves no space for electoral work to advance the class struggle or win reforms in my opinion the pro rupture position pushes us to avoid both of these mistaken positions on the one hand revolutionaries have every reason to participate in electoral political organizing where and when this can win greater numbers to socialism increase working class consciousness and combativity and build the socialist left this after all is the essential work that must be done to even get close to a context in which a genuine rupture might be possible nonetheless the case for rupture cautions us against being naive or over optimistic about the prospects of abolishing capitalism through parliamentary maneuvering so too does the case for rupture emphasize that electoral work must be seen as a vehicle for building mass workers movements capable of taking matters into their own hands it is not an end in itself nor is it a substitute for that work it would be ultra left and empirically baseless to say that political organizing within the capitalist state is in no way an effective tool for advancing this work it would be a different kind of mistake however to say that it is alone sufficient to move beyond capitalism notes 1 vivek chibber our road to power jacobin dec 2017 2 for more on this distinction see robert brenner the problem of reformism against the current march april

south korea taiwan malaysia and indonesia all suffered from japanese occupation during the second world war but in the decades of peace that followed south korea and taiwan revived grew their economies and became rich their gdp per capita what everyone in the country earns per year if income is equally distributed are now on par with developed western countries we are familiar with south korean products from cars and electronics to skincare taiwan exports refined oil electronics and computers such as acer and asus malaysia however plateaued once it reached upper middle income a term the world bank uses to define countries with a per capita gdp higher than us 1 045 but lower than us 12 736 in the meantime indonesia is still struggling in the lower middle income level with gdp per capita below us 4 125 why do some countries grow faster than others innovative local companies play a key role the tale of four economies around two decades after the second world war in 1967 malaysia led the four economies in gdp per capita at us 317 taiwan s was us 281 south korea s us 161 and indonesia s us 54 within two years taiwan overtook malaysia and a decade later in 1977 it was korea s turn in 2003 korea s gdp per capita was us 14 209 90 times what it was in 1967 taiwan s gdp per capita was close with us 14 120 in 2003 observers dubbed the growth of these four along with japan hong kong thailand and singapore in the 1980s and 1990s as the asian miracle their gdp per capita grew twice as fast between 1965 and 1990 compared to more developed western countries such as those europe and north america the gdp per capita increase in these countries was accompanied by poverty reduction and a narrowing of the gap between the rich and poor the 1997 asian financial crisis hit these economies hard korea saw its gdp per capita slump by 33 4 taiwan by 8 5 malaysia by 29 6 and indonesia by 56 4 bringing indonesia back to low income level but by 2017 the average income in korea had again grown to nearly us 30 000 taiwan s grew to us 24 000 malaysia and indonesia s were behind with us 9 952 and us 3 847 respectively why do some economies grow faster than others economists use gdp per capita as an indicator of a country s productivity rate the output it has produced over a certain period the higher the per capita gdp of an economy the higher the productivity of its citizens south korea and taiwan s high gdp reflects their high productivity rate compared to malaysia and indonesia three things determine a country s productivity labour capital and something known as total factor productivity tfp which represents efficiency and technology for example better management systems to reduce red tape could signal efficiency while the use of technology to automate tasks that would take up a lot of time if done manually technology according to the asian productivity organisation tfp contributed 14 to korea s economic growth between 1970 and 2016 and 24 for taiwan meanwhile tfp only contributed 5 to malaysia s growth and for indonesia the percentage is even lower 1 this means there s very little technological advancement in indonesia the small contribution of tfp to indonesia s economy closely ties to the country s low investment in research and development in 2017 indonesia spent less than 0 2 of its gdp on research and development meanwhile korea spent 4 55 of its gdp on research and development taiwan in 2016 spent 3 16 and malaysia around 1 3 how to increase total factor productivity a working paper for the international monetary fund showed that korea and taiwan s economic growth has relied on technological innovation by local companies in the 1960s south korea founded 35 state owned companies in the energy construction and banking sectors by the 1970s to improve the public enterprises performance south korea began privatising state owned companies providing loans and protection from market competition to family owned business groups called chaebol in korean meanwhile economist chen been lon argues the government and private enterprises have been instrumental in helping taiwan grow into today s economic powerhouse in 1964 taiwan built a semiconductor lab at the national chiao tung university this lab was the training ground for many engineers who became the backbone of taiwan s semiconductor industry in 1974 a state owned electronic research and services organization erso was established near national chiao tung university in 1980 erso created its first spin off company named united microelectronics umc with 40 capital investment coming from the government umc moved on to become taiwan s centre for acquiring chip technologies training local engineers and building the foundation of taiwan semiconductor industries support for domestic industries by the south korean and taiwanese government through cheap loans and market protections provided room for companies to increase the budget to develop technological innovation they also improved the quality of education providing high quality labour for companies that would need highly skilled workers in contrast to south korea and taiwan s strategy in which the government supported the development of domestic industries the imf paper noted malaysia relied on transfer technology from multinational companies multinational companies are reluctant to transfer their technologies to local companies leaving host countries stuck supplying raw materials multinational companies protect their intellectual property rights and product development they are also reluctant to train local hires lest they move to other companies this is the challenge indonesia and malaysia are facing as domestic industries are underdeveloped in both countries local companies have little to spare to fund research and development while south korea and taiwan have 15 and nine companies respectively listed in the fortune 500 list a ranking of the biggest companies in the world by revenue both indonesia and malaysia each have only one company in the list and they are the countries state oil and gas companies catching up strong evidence both from korea and taiwan shows that to increase a country s productivity domestic industries must invest in research and development the indonesian government is reportedly planning to introduce tax deductions for companies that support vocational training research and development along with incentives for companies both malaysia and indonesia must improve their higher education sectors to support research and development as well as increase investment in these areas they must also develop reliable domestic companies malaysia already allows foreign academics to teach and do research indonesia should follow this path as it needs to have world class universities the higher education sector should be given more autonomy to manage recruitment of lecturers and researchers and to attract the best students from all over the world south korea and taiwan s experience in supporting domestic industries and improving their research sector can be models for malaysia and indonesia
economists have dubbed it bad good news an unexpectedly high number of jobs added in june is likely to roil markets and hand federal reserve chairman jerome powell the biggest challenge of his career powell will have a harder time making the case for an interest rate cut when the central bank meets later this month after the government announced that the economy added 224 000 jobs in june compared with the 165 000 expected by economists it becomes harder for the fed to decide if it s appropriate for the fed to cut rates in july daniel zhao senior economist at glassdoor com said after powell obliquely suggested in his most recent remarks that the fed was open to an interest rate cut perhaps as soon as july markets might have relied too heavily on that assumption putri pascualy managing director for paamco prisma said our sense is that bad news is actually good news because that s what the market s anticipating pascualy said softening job numbers open up the door for rate cuts that s been baked in the market she said but today s strong report throws a curveball to that expectation it really complicates their narrative and it s no longer a sure thing that they cut rates this month they may want to wait and see a couple more job reports before they make a move mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the fed chairman will face an unpalatable choice at the central bank s meeting at the end of the month failing to deliver the rate cut that president donald trump has been clamoring for and the market is already expecting could have a seismic effect on wall street there s a very good probability that we ve got to unwind some of this said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute something s got to give to a certain extent in the aftermath of the great recession investors became conditioned to a cycle of dip and rescue with the federal reserve responding to market drops with more accommodative policy it s kind of the playbook that was fashioned out of the crisis every time stocks would go down the fed would step in samana said what the markets might be missing is even though the fed is willing to help out and step in they might not do it as quickly as the market hopes right now investors are treating the prospect of lower interest rates as a kind of cure all pascualy said the crux of all the positive tenor in the market is contingent on one thing which is fed rate cuts that s extremely risky she said the positive is one thing and it has been priced in versus a multitude of negatives that have not been priced in zandi said if it becomes evident that the fed doesn t have enough room to maneuver because rates are historically low to begin with or that rate cuts are unable to stem an exodus of jobs from the economy investor sentiment could plummet if that s the case then the market would turn very sharply he said at this point in the business cycle there s not a lot of room to maneuver so it makes it very difficult for the fed to thread the needle on the flip side if the fed trims interest rates in the absence of clear cut signs of an impending slowdown it risks overheating the economy particularly analysts said if the china trade war does reach a successful resolution the big worry is if china gets solved and the economy really picks up ryan detrick senior market strategist for lpl financial said that can bring back a lot of confidence and business investment although corporate america has been agitating for an end to the tariffs supply chain disruptions and negative sentiment that have inhibited growth since the trade war began a rapid reversal of fortune particularly one taking place in an overly accommodative economic climate could be just as dangerous if the economy starts to pick up and the fed is making cuts maybe inflation could spike quite quickly and business cycles tend to be choked off when you have too much inflation detrick said that s definitely a worry

the issue of humanitarian intervention has proven a vexing one of the political left during the post cold war era in light mass violence in rwanda bosnia herzegovina kosovo darfur libya and syria many leftists abandoned their traditional opposition to militarism and argued for robust military intervention by the united states and its allies to alleviate these crises critics argued in response that interventionism would end up worsening the very crises it was supposed to resolve these issues were recently debated at the oxford union society at oxford university on march 4 2019 the participants were michael chertoff former secretary of homeland security during the presidency of george w bush and coauthor of the usa patriot act who presented a qualified defense of humanitarian intervention and myself who argued against the practice in past years when i debated this issue i was struck by the sense of almost religious zeal that characterized advocacy for interventionism we have to do something was the standard refrain those who offered criticisms including myself were cast as amoral heretics however the repeated failures of interventionism that i note below have taken their toll and have served to moderate the tone during the oxford debate i noted a remarkable absence of emotionalism i came away from the event sensing that while some still defend humanitarian intervention their arguments lack the crusading tone that was so noteworthy in the past i sense that public support for interventionism is beginning to ebb what follows is a verbatim transcript of the full statements by myself and mr chertoff as well as our responses to questions posed by the moderator and a member of the audience for reasons of brevity i have omitted most of the audience questions as well as the responses interested readers can find the full debate at the oxford union s youtube site daniel wilkinson oxford union president so gentlemen the motion is this house believes humanitarian intervention is a contradiction in terms and professor gibbs your ten minute opening argument can begin when you re ready professor david gibbs thank you well i think that when one looks at humanitarian intervention one has to look at the record of what has actually happened and in particular the last three major interventions since 2000 the iraqi intervention of 2003 the afghanistan intervention of 2001 and the libya intervention of 2011 and what all three of these have in common is that all three were justified at least in part on humanitarian grounds i mean the first two partly the third almost exclusively were justified on humanitarian grounds and all three produced humanitarian disasters this is really quite clear i think to anybody who has been reading the newspaper that these interventions have not gone well at all and when evaluating the larger issue of humanitarian intervention one really has to first look at those basic facts which are not pleasant let me add that it s very surprising to me in a lot of ways that the whole concept humanitarian intervention wasn t just fully discredited by those experiences but it is not we still have calls for other interventions including in syria most notably also there are frequent calls for regime change essentially intervention in north korea i really don t know what is going to happen in the future with north korea but if the united states does undertake regime change in north korea i will hazard two predictions one it almost certainly will be justified at least in part as a humanitarian intervention designed to liberate the people of north korea from a very unwholesome dictator and two it ll produce probably the biggest humanitarian disaster since 1945 one of the questions is why are we not learning from our mistakes the scale of the failures in these three previous interventions is in a lot of ways quite impressive with regard to iraq it s perhaps the best documented failure i would say we have the 2006 lancet study epidemiologically looking at excess deaths in iraq which at that time were estimated at 560 000 excess deaths 1 this was published in 2006 so presumably it s much higher by now there have been other estimates mostly on par with that one and this is something that is problematic certainly things were terrible under saddam hussein that s indisputable as they were under the taliban as they were under muammar gaddafi as they currently are under kim jong un in north korea and so we went in and removed from power those three figures one by one or i should say with the taliban it was a larger regime with mullah omar leading a larger regime and things promptly got worse it didn t seem to have occurred to policymakers that things could actually get worse but they did another effect that s worth noting is what i would say is a kind of destabilization of regions this is particularly striking in the case of libya which destabilized much of north africa triggering a secondary civil war in mali in 2013 which was directly attributable to the destabilization of libya this required a secondary intervention by france this time to combat basically the instability arising in that country again justified at least in part on humanitarian grounds certainly one of the things one can say in terms the effects of humanitarian intervention is that if you have a vested interest in intervention and that is something you are seeking it s an excellent idea because it s the gift that just keeps on giving it keeps on destabilizing regions producing new humanitarian crises thus justifying new interventions that s certainly what happened in the case of libya and then mali now if you re interested in humanitarian effect however the situation does not look so good it does not look very positive at all the very striking thing here is the lack of loss of credibility i m very struck by the fact that the people who helped to argue for these three interventions and by that i don t just mean policymakers but also academics and intellectuals like myself i myself didn t argue for them but many of my colleagues did and it s rather remarkable to me that there s no expression of regret or acknowledgement they did anything wrong in arguing for these interventions nor is there effort to learn from our mistakes and to try and avoid interventions in the future there s something very dysfunctional about the character of discussion on this topic when we fail to learn from past mistakes a second problem with the issue of humanitarian intervention is what some have called the dirty hands problem we are relying on countries and agencies of those countries which do not have very good records of humanitarian activity let us look at the united states and its history of interventionism if one looks at that the history of us interventionism we find the united states as an intervening power was a major cause of humanitarian crises in the past if one looks for example at the overthrow of mossadegh in iran in 1953 the overthrow of allende in chile in 1973 and i think the most striking example a less known one is indonesia in 1965 where the cia helped engineer a coup and then helped orchestrate a massacre of people that led to about 500 000 deaths it s one of the really great massacres post 1945 yes indeed on the scale of what happened in rwanda at least approximately and that was something caused by intervention and one could also go into the issue of the vietnam war and look for example at the pentagon papers the secret pentagon study of the vietnam war and one does not get a sense of the united states as either a gentle power or a particularly humanitarian one and the effects certainly were not humanitarian in any of these cases there s a larger issue perhaps of human rights violations by the agencies of state that are involved in intervention in the united states we now know from declassified documents that both the uniformed military and the cia were responsible in the 50s and early 60s in conducting radiation experiments on unsuspecting individuals doing things like going around and having doctors working for the military injecting people with radioactive isotopes and then tracking their bodies over time to see what effects it had and what kinds of illnesses it caused them without telling them of course the cia had very disturbing mind control experiments testing new interrogation techniques on unsuspecting individuals with very damaging effects one of the scientists involved in the radiation studies commented in private again this is from a declassified document that some of what he was doing had what he called the buchenwald effect and we could see what he meant and the obvious question again is why on earth would we want to trust agencies that do things like this to do something humanitarian now this is a course long ago but the fact that we now use the term humanitarian intervention does not make it a magical phrase and does not magically erase this past history which is relevant and has to be taken into account i do not want to focus excessively on my own country after all other states have done other disturbing things one could look at the history of britain and france let us say with the colonial and postcolonial interventions one does not get a picture of humanitarian activity quite the contrary i would say either in intent or in effect now i think one of the issues that finally has to be noted is the cost of humanitarian intervention this is something that is rarely taken into account but perhaps should be taken into account especially since the record of results is so bad in terms of humanitarian effect well military action generally speaking is extremely expensive amassing division sized forces deploying them overseas for extended periods of time cannot be done except at extreme expense in the case of the iraq war what we have is what has been termed the three trillion dollar war joseph stiglitz of columbia and linda bilmes estimated in 2008 the long term cost of the iraq war at 3 trillion 2 those figures of course are obsolete because that s over ten years ago but 3 trillion is quite a lot when you think about it in fact it s greater than the combined gross domestic product of great britain at the present time and one wonders what kind of wonderful humanitarian projects we could have done with 3 trillion rather than wasting it in a war that did nothing but killed several hundred thousand people and destabilized a region and these wars are not over of course in either libya nor iraq nor afghanistan afghanistan is nearing the end of its second decade of war and the second decade of us intervention this may very well run into being the longest war in us history if it not already is it depends how you define longest war but it s certainly getting up there and one can think of all sorts of things that could have been done with some of this money for example vaccination of children who are under vaccinated two minutes is that right one minute one could think of people who don t have enough medicines including in my own country the united states where many people go without proper medicines as economists know you have opportunity costs if you spend money on one thing you may not have it available for another and i think what we ve been doing is overspending on intervention again with no significant humanitarian results or very few that i can discern i guess i m very impressed by the medical analogy here and the medical emphasis so that s of course why i titled my book first do no harm and the reason is that in medicine you don t just go and operate on the patient because the patient is suffering you have to do a proper analysis of whether or not the operation will be positive or negative an operation can of course hurt people and in medicine sometimes the best thing to do is nothing and perhaps here the first thing we should do with the humanitarian crises is not make them worse which is what we ve done thank you wilkinson thank you professor michael your ten minute argument can begin when you re ready michael chertoff the proposition here is whether humanitarian intervention is a contradiction in terms and i think the answer to that is no sometimes it s ill advised sometimes it s well advised sometimes it doesn t work sometimes it does work it rarely works perfectly but nothing in life does so let me first begin by talking about the three examples the professor gave afghanistan iraq and libya i m going to tell you afghanistan was not a humanitarian intervention afghanistan was the result of an attack launched on the united states that killed 3 000 people and it was quite openly and deliberately an effort to remove the person who launched the attack from the ability to do it again if you think it wasn t worth it i will tell you from personal experience when we went into afghanistan we found laboratories al qaeda was using to experiment with chemical and biological agents on animals so they could deploy those against people in the west had we not gone into afghanistan we might be inhaling those now as we speak this is not humanitarian in the sense of altruistic this is kind of basic core security that every country owes its citizens iraq is also i think in my view not principally a humanitarian intervention we can debate in a different debate what happened with the intelligence and whether it was totally wrong or only partially wrong regarding the possibility of weapons of mass destruction in iraq but at least that was the major assumption going in it may have been erroneous and there are all kinds of arguments that the way in which it was executed was poorly done but again it was not humanitarian libya was a humanitarian intervention and the problem with libya is i think the second part of what i want to say which is not all humanitarian interventions are good and in order to make a decision to intervene you have to take into account some very important elements of what you re facing what is your strategy and your objective do you have clarity about that what is your awareness of what the conditions in the place you re intervening in actually are what are your capabilities and your willingness to be committed to see things through to the end and then to what degree do you have support from the international community libya is an example of a case where while the impulse may have been humanitarian these things were not carefully thought out and if i can say so michael hayden and i made this point in an oped shortly after this process began 3 that the easy part was going to be removing gaddafi the hard part was going to be what happens after gaddafi is removed and so here i agree with the professor had someone looked at the four factors i mentioned they would have said well you know we don t really know we haven t really though through what happens without gaddafi what happens to all the extremists in prison what happens to all the mercenaries that he s paid for who now aren t getting paid anymore and that led to some of the negative results i also think there was a failure to understand that when you remove a dictator you have an unstable situation and as colin powell used to say if you broke it you bought it if you re going to remove a dictator you ve got to then be prepared to invest in stabilizing if you re not prepared to make that investment you have no business removing him by way of example on the other side if you look at for example the interventions in sierra leone and ivory coast sierra leone was 2000 there was the united front that was advancing on the capital the british came in they repelled them they drove them back and because of that sierra leone was able to stabilize and they ultimately wound up having elections or ivory coast you had an incumbent who refused to accept that he had lost an election he began to use violence against his people there was an intervention he was ultimately arrested and now ivory coast has a democracy so again there are ways to do humanitarian intervention that can be successful but not if you don t pay attention to the four characteristics i talked about now let me give you an example from something that we are literally facing today and that is what is going on in syria and let s ask the question whether a couple of years ago before the russians got deeply involved before the iranians got deeply involved whether an intervention would have made a difference in saving literally tens of thousands of people from being killed innocent civilians with bombs and chemical weapons as well as a huge mass migration crisis and i think the answer is had we done in syria what we did in northern iraq in 1991 established a no fly zone and a no go zone for assad and his people and if we had done it early we might have averted what we now see unfolding and continuing to unfold in the region so now i m going to now look at it from the other lens what happens when you don t intervene as i suggest that we might have done in syria well not only do you have a humanitarian crisis you have a security crisis because as the consequence of not really enforcing any of the rules i ve talked about and notwithstanding the fact that president obama said there was a red line about chemical weapons and then the line disappeared when the chemical weapons were used because of the fact that we didn t enforce these humanitarian measures we had not only many deaths but we literally had an upheaval that has now reached into the heart of europe the reason the eu is now having a crisis about migration is because and perhaps with some intent the russians as well as the syrians deliberately acted to drive civilians out of the country and force them to go elsewhere many of them are now in jordan and putting a strain on jordan but many of them are trying to get into europe and i have little doubt that putin understood or quickly recognized even if it was not his original intent that once you create a migration crisis you are creating a disorder and dissension within your principal adversary which is europe and that has a destabilizing effect the consequences of which we continue to see today and so one of the things i want to say to be honest is when we talk about humanitarian intervention there is often an altruistic dimension to it but frankly there is also a self interested dimension places of disorder are places where terrorists operate and you ve seen isis until quite recently had territory in parts of syria and parts of iraq that were not properly governed it creates migration crises and similar crises which then have an impact on the stability and the good order of the rest of the world and it also creates grievances and desires for payback that often result in cycles of violence that continue over and over again and you see that in rwanda so my bottom line is this not all humanitarian interventions are warranted not all humanitarian interventions are properly thought out and properly executed but by the same token not all of them are wrong or improperly executed and again i go back to 1991 and the no fly zone and no go zone in kurdistan as an example of one that worked the key is this be clear why you re going in don t underestimate the cost of what you re undertaking have the capabilities and the commitment to see that you can handle those costs and achieve the result that you set out for yourself make sure you are aware of the conditions on the ground so you make a rational assessment and finally get international support don t go it alone i think in those circumstances humanitarian intervention can not only be successful but it can save a lot of lives and make our world more secure thank you question wilkinson thank you michael thank you both for those introductory remarks i ll ask one question and then we ll move over to questions from the audience my question is this you both cited a number of historical examples but would you say it is a fair assessment that practically the problem is that there can never be a sufficient long term plan sufficient well intentions sufficient benevolent motivations or a sufficient harm analysis to counter the fact that individual organizations and international organizations are fallible and they will always make mistakes and the fallibility of those groups means that humanitarian intervention has to be a contradiction in terms so michael if you d like to respond answer chertoff my answer is this inaction is action some people think if you don t do something that s somehow abstaining but if you don t do something something is going to happen so if for example franklin roosevelt had decided not to help the british in 1940 with lend lease because i don t know if i m making a mistake or not that would have resulted in a different outcome with respect to world war ii i don t think we d be saying well but that was inaction so it didn t matter i think inaction is a form of action and every time you re presented with a choice you have to balance the consequences as far as you can project them from both doing something and abstaining from doing something answer gibbs well i think that of course inaction is a form of action but the onus should always be on person advocating intervention because let s be very clear on this intervention is an act of war humanitarian intervention is a mere euphemism when we advocate humanitarian intervention we are advocating war the movement for intervention is a movement for war and it seems to me those who advocate against war really have no burden on them of proof the burden of proof should be on those who advocate for the use of violence and really the standards should be very high for the use of violence and i think we can see it s been used quite frivolously in the past to an extraordinary degree and a basic problem you have in small interventions for example the 1991 no fly zone over iraq is these things take place in the real world not in a pretend world and in that real world the united states considers itself a great power and there ll always be the question of american credibility and if the u s undertakes half measures such as a no fly zone there will always be pressures on the united states from various factions in the foreign policy establishment to take a more maximalist effort and solve the problem once and for all hence the need for another war with iraq in 2003 producing an utter catastrophe i get very queasy when i hear people discussing let us just do a limited intervention it ll just stop at that because it usually doesn t stop at that there s the quagmire effect you step into the quagmire and you get deeper and deeper into the quagmire and there will always be those who advocate deeper and deeper intervention i guess one more point i did want to respond to the claim which is a frequent one that the iraq and afghanistan wars were not really humanitarian interventions it is true that this was to some extent both interventions were at least partly traditional national interest realpolitik and the like but if you look back at the record clearly both were justified in part as humanitarian interventions both by the bush administration as well as many academics i have here before me an edited volume published by the university of california press and i believe it s 2005 called a matter of principle humanitarian arguments for war in iraq 4 just do a google search on humanitarian arguments for war in iraq and this was very much part of the picture i think it s a bit of a rewriting of history to say that humanitarian intervention was not a significant factor in the arguments for war in iraq or afghanistan they were very much part of both those wars and i would say the results very much discredit the idea of humanitarian intervention question audience thanks so you ve both talked about some historical examples and i d like to hear both of your perspectives about the ongoing situation in venezuela and the trump administration and the plans and the reports have come out that they might have plans to use military force there and how you would evaluate that in light of both of the perspectives that you ve shared answer chertoff so i think what s happening in venezuela is first of all i mean there s obviously a political dictatorship and as i ve said i don t think political regime issues are a reason to intervene militarily there is also a humanitarian element here people are starving but i don t know we re at the level of humanitarian crisis that we ve seen in other cases so my short answer would be i don t think we ve met the threshold for having a real discussion about humanitarian intervention in a military sense that s not to say there aren t non military ways to intervene just to be clear so we round the picture out there are a lot of tools in the toolbox when you deal with intervention there are sanctions economic sanctions there is even potential use of cyber tools as a way of having some impact on what s going on there is the possibility in some instances of legal action for example international criminal court or something so all of these ought to be considered part of the toolbox if i was looking at venezuela assuming it did which i emphasize it has not reach the level of humanitarian intervention you would then have to balance issues like is there an endgame we see or a strategy we see to be successful do we have the capabilities to achieve it do we have international support i think all of those would probably militate against it that s not to say it couldn t change but the dimensions of this i don t think have reached the point where military action is reasonable or likely answer gibbs well the most important thing you need to know about venezuela is that it s an undiversified oil exporting economy and there s been a drop in oil price since 2014 i ll certainly grant that a lot of what is going on now is the fault of maduro and authoritarian actions he s been taking as well as mismanagement corruption and so on most of what has been going on by any reasonable reading by any informed reading is due to low oil prices it points to i think a larger issue which is the way humanitarian crises are often triggered by economic crises discussions of rwanda almost never discuss the fact that the genocide and i think it really was a genocide in the case of rwanda the genocide by the hutu against the tutsi took place in the context of a major economic crisis resulting from the collapse of coffee prices again a very undiversified economy that was reliant almost exclusively on coffee coffee prices collapse you get a political crisis yugoslavia had a major economic crisis just before the country broke up and descended into hell we know about the descent into hell most people don t know about the economic crisis for some reason people find economics boring and because it s boring and military intervention seems more exciting we think that the solution is to send in the 82nd airborne division whereas perhaps it would have been simpler and a lot cheaper and easier and better from a humanitarian standpoint to address the economic crisis the very heavy emphasis placed on austerity in the international economic system and the very damaging political effects austerity has in many countries historical context is necessary here for all the constant repetitious references to the third reich and to world war ii which we hear again and again and again and again people often forget that one of the things that brought us adolph hitler was the great depression any reasonable reading of weimar germany s history would be that without the depression you almost certainly would not have gotten the rise of nazism so i think a greater addressing of the economic issues in the case of venezuela even if the united states were to overthrow maduro by whatever means and replace them with someone else that someone else would still have to deal with the issue of low oil prices and the damaging effects on the economy which would remain unaddressed by humanitarian intervention whether we call it that or something else i guess another point about the united states and venezuela is that the united nations sent a representative down there and condemned the us sanctions as greatly intensifying the humanitarian crisis so the intervention the united states has been doing economic at this point mostly rather than military is making things worse and that clearly has to stop if we re interested in helping the people of venezuela surely the united states would not want to make it worse
washington ap u s employers sharply stepped up their hiring in june adding a robust 224 000 jobs an indication of the economy s durability after more than a decade of expansion the strength of the jobs report the government issued friday could complicate a decision for the federal reserve late this month on whether to cut interest rates to help support the economy most investors have anticipated a rate cut in july and perhaps one or two additional fed cuts later in the year that scenario may be less likely now stocks sold off early friday before paring their losses later the dow jones industrial average closed down a modest 43 points but the yield on the 10 year u s treasury note climbed to 2 04 from just under 2 before the jobs report was released reflecting a view that the fed might now be less inclined to cut rates multiple times june s solid job growth followed a tepid gain of 72 000 jobs in may a result that had fueled concerns about the economy s health but with june s pace of hiring employers have now added on average a solid 171 000 jobs for the past three months last month s burst of hiring suggests that many employers have shrugged off concerns about weaker growth president donald trump s trade wars and the waning benefits from u s tax cuts although there are drags on the economy in 2019 the expansion should continue through this year said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial services the doom and gloom was overblown the unemployment rate ticked up to 3 7 in june from 3 6 for the previous two months reflecting an influx of people

but the strong hiring gains have lessened the case at least for now for the fed to slash rates as trump has repeatedly and aggressively pressed the central bank to do if we had a fed that would lower interest rates we d be like a rocket ship the president asserted to reporters in an appearance friday but we re paying a lot of interest and it s unnecessary but we don t have a fed that knows what they re doing last year fed officials raised rates four times in part to stave off the risk of high inflation and in part to try to ensure that they would have room to cut rates if the economy stumbled on friday the fed reiterated that it would act as necessary sustain the economic expansion while noting that most fed officials have lowered their expectations for the course of rates the fed s statement came in its semiannual report on monetary policy in friday s jobs report for june the hiring gains were broad construction companies added 21 000 workers after having increased their payrolls by only 5 000 in may manufacturers hired 17 000 up from just 3 000 in may health care and social assistance added 50 500 jobs hiring by transportation and warehousing companies increased 23

of the u s job market has provided both an opportunity and a challenge with more americans earning steady paychecks demand for massages and facials has increased and the company plans to add 60

whose company has about 430 locations and is based in trevose pennsylvania investors have been turning their attention to the fed which has expressed concern about threats to the economy especially the uncertainties from trump s trade wars and about inflation remaining persistently below its 2 target level a fed rate cut whenever it happens would be its first in more than a decade joshua shapiro chief u s economist for the consultancy mfr said the likelihood of a fed rate cut late this month is now slightly lower though he still estimates that the federal funds rate what banks charge each other will be sharply lower by the end of next year ryan wang u s economist at hsbc bank suggested that the solid jobs report might create a communications challenge for fed chairman jerome powell when he testifies wednesday and thursday to congressional committees the financial markets still foresee a rate cut of 25 points this month wang said adding it will be important to see if chair powell lays out on a strong case for near term monetary easing in his testimony next week the sluggish pace of hiring in may had signaled that employers might have grown more cautious because of global economic weakness and perhaps some difficulty in finding enough qualified workers at the wages that companies are willing to pay the pace of the overall economy is widely thought to be slowing from annual growth that neared a healthy 3 last year consumer spending has solidified home sales are rebounding but america s manufacturing sector is weakening along with construction spending growth in

the issue of humanitarian intervention has proven a vexing one of the political left during the post cold war era in light mass violence in rwanda bosnia herzegovina kosovo darfur libya and syria many leftists abandoned their traditional opposition to militarism and argued for robust military intervention by the united states and its allies to alleviate these crises critics argued in response that interventionism would end up worsening the very crises it was supposed to resolve these issues were recently debated at the oxford union society at oxford university on march 4 2019 the participants were michael chertoff former secretary of homeland security during the presidency of george w bush and coauthor of the usa patriot act who presented a qualified defense of humanitarian intervention and myself who argued against the practice in past years when i debated this issue i was struck by the sense of almost religious zeal that characterized advocacy for interventionism we have to do something was the standard refrain those who offered criticisms including myself were cast as amoral heretics however the repeated failures of interventionism that i note below have taken their toll and have served to moderate the tone during the oxford debate i noted a remarkable absence of emotionalism i came away from the event sensing that while some still defend humanitarian intervention their arguments lack the crusading tone that was so noteworthy in the past i sense that public support for interventionism is beginning to ebb what follows is a verbatim transcript of the full statements by myself and mr chertoff as well as our responses to questions posed by the moderator and a member of the audience for reasons of brevity i have omitted most of the audience questions as well as the responses interested readers can find the full debate at the oxford union s youtube site daniel wilkinson oxford union president so gentlemen the motion is this house believes humanitarian intervention is a contradiction in terms and professor gibbs your ten minute opening argument can begin when you re ready professor david gibbs thank you well i think that when one looks at humanitarian intervention one has to look at the record of what has actually happened and in particular the last three major interventions since 2000 the iraqi intervention of 2003 the afghanistan intervention of 2001 and the libya intervention of 2011 and what all three of these have in common is that all three were justified at least in part on humanitarian grounds i mean the first two partly the third almost exclusively were justified on humanitarian grounds and all three produced humanitarian disasters this is really quite clear i think to anybody who has been reading the newspaper that these interventions have not gone well at all and when evaluating the larger issue of humanitarian intervention one really has to first look at those basic facts which are not pleasant let me add that it s very surprising to me in a lot of ways that the whole concept humanitarian intervention wasn t just fully discredited by those experiences but it is not we still have calls for other interventions including in syria most notably also there are frequent calls for regime change essentially intervention in north korea i really don t know what is going to happen in the future with north korea but if the united states does undertake regime change in north korea i will hazard two predictions one it almost certainly will be justified at least in part as a humanitarian intervention designed to liberate the people of north korea from a very unwholesome dictator and two it ll produce probably the biggest humanitarian disaster since 1945 one of the questions is why are we not learning from our mistakes the scale of the failures in these three previous interventions is in a lot of ways quite impressive with regard to iraq it s perhaps the best documented failure i would say we have the 2006 lancet study epidemiologically looking at excess deaths in iraq which at that time were estimated at 560 000 excess deaths 1 this was published in 2006 so presumably it s much higher by now there have been other estimates mostly on par with that one and this is something that is problematic certainly things were terrible under saddam hussein that s indisputable as they were under the taliban as they were under muammar gaddafi as they currently are under kim jong un in north korea and so we went in and removed from power those three figures one by one or i should say with the taliban it was a larger regime with mullah omar leading a larger regime and things promptly got worse it didn t seem to have occurred to policymakers that things could actually get worse but they did another effect that s worth noting is what i would say is a kind of destabilization of regions this is particularly striking in the case of libya which destabilized much of north africa triggering a secondary civil war in mali in 2013 which was directly attributable to the destabilization of libya this required a secondary intervention by france this time to combat basically the instability arising in that country again justified at least in part on humanitarian grounds certainly one of the things one can say in terms the effects of humanitarian intervention is that if you have a vested interest in intervention and that is something you are seeking it s an excellent idea because it s the gift that just keeps on giving it keeps on destabilizing regions producing new humanitarian crises thus justifying new interventions that s certainly what happened in the case of libya and then mali now if you re interested in humanitarian effect however the situation does not look so good it does not look very positive at all the very striking thing here is the lack of loss of credibility i m very struck by the fact that the people who helped to argue for these three interventions and by that i don t just mean policymakers but also academics and intellectuals like myself i myself didn t argue for them but many of my colleagues did and it s rather remarkable to me that there s no expression of regret or acknowledgement they did anything wrong in arguing for these interventions nor is there effort to learn from our mistakes and to try and avoid interventions in the future there s something very dysfunctional about the character of discussion on this topic when we fail to learn from past mistakes a second problem with the issue of humanitarian intervention is what some have called the dirty hands problem we are relying on countries and agencies of those countries which do not have very good records of humanitarian activity let us look at the united states and its history of interventionism if one looks at that the history of us interventionism we find the united states as an intervening power was a major cause of humanitarian crises in the past if one looks for example at the overthrow of mossadegh in iran in 1953 the overthrow of allende in chile in 1973 and i think the most striking example a less known one is indonesia in 1965 where the cia helped engineer a coup and then helped orchestrate a massacre of people that led to about 500 000 deaths it s one of the really great massacres post 1945 yes indeed on the scale of what happened in rwanda at least approximately and that was something caused by intervention and one could also go into the issue of the vietnam war and look for example at the pentagon papers the secret pentagon study of the vietnam war and one does not get a sense of the united states as either a gentle power or a particularly humanitarian one and the effects certainly were not humanitarian in any of these cases there s a larger issue perhaps of human rights violations by the agencies of state that are involved in intervention in the united states we now know from declassified documents that both the uniformed military and the cia were responsible in the 50s and early 60s in conducting radiation experiments on unsuspecting individuals doing things like going around and having doctors working for the military injecting people with radioactive isotopes and then tracking their bodies over time to see what effects it had and what kinds of illnesses it caused them without telling them of course the cia had very disturbing mind control experiments testing new interrogation techniques on unsuspecting individuals with very damaging effects one of the scientists involved in the radiation studies commented in private again this is from a declassified document that some of what he was doing had what he called the buchenwald effect and we could see what he meant and the obvious question again is why on earth would we want to trust agencies that do things like this to do something humanitarian now this is a course long ago but the fact that we now use the term humanitarian intervention does not make it a magical phrase and does not magically erase this past history which is relevant and has to be taken into account i do not want to focus excessively on my own country after all other states have done other disturbing things one could look at the history of britain and france let us say with the colonial and postcolonial interventions one does not get a picture of humanitarian activity quite the contrary i would say either in intent or in effect now i think one of the issues that finally has to be noted is the cost of humanitarian intervention this is something that is rarely taken into account but perhaps should be taken into account especially since the record of results is so bad in terms of humanitarian effect well military action generally speaking is extremely expensive amassing division sized forces deploying them overseas for extended periods of time cannot be done except at extreme expense in the case of the iraq war what we have is what has been termed the three trillion dollar war joseph stiglitz of columbia and linda bilmes estimated in 2008 the long term cost of the iraq war at 3 trillion 2 those figures of course are obsolete because that s over ten years ago but 3 trillion is quite a lot when you think about it in fact it s greater than the combined gross domestic product of great britain at the present time and one wonders what kind of wonderful humanitarian projects we could have done with 3 trillion rather than wasting it in a war that did nothing but killed several hundred thousand people and destabilized a region and these wars are not over of course in either libya nor iraq nor afghanistan afghanistan is nearing the end of its second decade of war and the second decade of us intervention this may very well run into being the longest war in us history if it not already is it depends how you define longest war but it s certainly getting up there and one can think of all sorts of things that could have been done with some of this money for example vaccination of children who are under vaccinated two minutes is that right one minute one could think of people who don t have enough medicines including in my own country the united states where many people go without proper medicines as economists know you have opportunity costs if you spend money on one thing you may not have it available for another and i think what we ve been doing is overspending on intervention again with no significant humanitarian results or very few that i can discern i guess i m very impressed by the medical analogy here and the medical emphasis so that s of course why i titled my book first do no harm and the reason is that in medicine you don t just go and operate on the patient because the patient is suffering you have to do a proper analysis of whether or not the operation will be positive or negative an operation can of course hurt people and in medicine sometimes the best thing to do is nothing and perhaps here the first thing we should do with the humanitarian crises is not make them worse which is what we ve done thank you wilkinson thank you professor michael your ten minute argument can begin when you re ready michael chertoff the proposition here is whether humanitarian intervention is a contradiction in terms and i think the answer to that is no sometimes it s ill advised sometimes it s well advised sometimes it doesn t work sometimes it does work it rarely works perfectly but nothing in life does so let me first begin by talking about the three examples the professor gave afghanistan iraq and libya i m going to tell you afghanistan was not a humanitarian intervention afghanistan was the result of an attack launched on the united states that killed 3 000 people and it was quite openly and deliberately an effort to remove the person who launched the attack from the ability to do it again if you think it wasn t worth it i will tell you from personal experience when we went into afghanistan we found laboratories al qaeda was using to experiment with chemical and biological agents on animals so they could deploy those against people in the west had we not gone into afghanistan we might be inhaling those now as we speak this is not humanitarian in the sense of altruistic this is kind of basic core security that every country owes its citizens iraq is also i think in my view not principally a humanitarian intervention we can debate in a different debate what happened with the intelligence and whether it was totally wrong or only partially wrong regarding the possibility of weapons of mass destruction in iraq but at least that was the major assumption going in it may have been erroneous and there are all kinds of arguments that the way in which it was executed was poorly done but again it was not humanitarian libya was a humanitarian intervention and the problem with libya is i think the second part of what i want to say which is not all humanitarian interventions are good and in order to make a decision to intervene you have to take into account some very important elements of what you re facing what is your strategy and your objective do you have clarity about that what is your awareness of what the conditions in the place you re intervening in actually are what are your capabilities and your willingness to be committed to see things through to the end and then to what degree do you have support from the international community libya is an example of a case where while the impulse may have been humanitarian these things were not carefully thought out and if i can say so michael hayden and i made this point in an oped shortly after this process began 3 that the easy part was going to be removing gaddafi the hard part was going to be what happens after gaddafi is removed and so here i agree with the professor had someone looked at the four factors i mentioned they would have said well you know we don t really know we haven t really though through what happens without gaddafi what happens to all the extremists in prison what happens to all the mercenaries that he s paid for who now aren t getting paid anymore and that led to some of the negative results i also think there was a failure to understand that when you remove a dictator you have an unstable situation and as colin powell used to say if you broke it you bought it if you re going to remove a dictator you ve got to then be prepared to invest in stabilizing if you re not prepared to make that investment you have no business removing him by way of example on the other side if you look at for example the interventions in sierra leone and ivory coast sierra leone was 2000 there was the united front that was advancing on the capital the british came in they repelled them they drove them back and because of that sierra leone was able to stabilize and they ultimately wound up having elections or ivory coast you had an incumbent who refused to accept that he had lost an election he began to use violence against his people there was an intervention he was ultimately arrested and now ivory coast has a democracy so again there are ways to do humanitarian intervention that can be successful but not if you don t pay attention to the four characteristics i talked about now let me give you an example from something that we are literally facing today and that is what is going on in syria and let s ask the question whether a couple of years ago before the russians got deeply involved before the iranians got deeply involved whether an intervention would have made a difference in saving literally tens of thousands of people from being killed innocent civilians with bombs and chemical weapons as well as a huge mass migration crisis and i think the answer is had we done in syria what we did in northern iraq in 1991 established a no fly zone and a no go zone for assad and his people and if we had done it early we might have averted what we now see unfolding and continuing to unfold in the region so now i m going to now look at it from the other lens what happens when you don t intervene as i suggest that we might have done in syria well not only do you have a humanitarian crisis you have a security crisis because as the consequence of not really enforcing any of the rules i ve talked about and notwithstanding the fact that president obama said there was a red line about chemical weapons and then the line disappeared when the chemical weapons were used because of the fact that we didn t enforce these humanitarian measures we had not only many deaths but we literally had an upheaval that has now reached into the heart of europe the reason the eu is now having a crisis about migration is because and perhaps with some intent the russians as well as the syrians deliberately acted to drive civilians out of the country and force them to go elsewhere many of them are now in jordan and putting a strain on jordan but many of them are trying to get into europe and i have little doubt that putin understood or quickly recognized even if it was not his original intent that once you create a migration crisis you are creating a disorder and dissension within your principal adversary which is europe and that has a destabilizing effect the consequences of which we continue to see today and so one of the things i want to say to be honest is when we talk about humanitarian intervention there is often an altruistic dimension to it but frankly there is also a self interested dimension places of disorder are places where terrorists operate and you ve seen isis until quite recently had territory in parts of syria and parts of iraq that were not properly governed it creates migration crises and similar crises which then have an impact on the stability and the good order of the rest of the world and it also creates grievances and desires for payback that often result in cycles of violence that continue over and over again and you see that in rwanda so my bottom line is this not all humanitarian interventions are warranted not all humanitarian interventions are properly thought out and properly executed but by the same token not all of them are wrong or improperly executed and again i go back to 1991 and the no fly zone and no go zone in kurdistan as an example of one that worked the key is this be clear why you re going in don t underestimate the cost of what you re undertaking have the capabilities and the commitment to see that you can handle those costs and achieve the result that you set out for yourself make sure you are aware of the conditions on the ground so you make a rational assessment and finally get international support don t go it alone i think in those circumstances humanitarian intervention can not only be successful but it can save a lot of lives and make our world more secure thank you question wilkinson thank you michael thank you both for those introductory remarks i ll ask one question and then we ll move over to questions from the audience my question is this you both cited a number of historical examples but would you say it is a fair assessment that practically the problem is that there can never be a sufficient long term plan sufficient well intentions sufficient benevolent motivations or a sufficient harm analysis to counter the fact that individual organizations and international organizations are fallible and they will always make mistakes and the fallibility of those groups means that humanitarian intervention has to be a contradiction in terms so michael if you d like to respond answer chertoff my answer is this inaction is action some people think if you don t do something that s somehow abstaining but if you don t do something something is going to happen so if for example franklin roosevelt had decided not to help the british in 1940 with lend lease because i don t know if i m making a mistake or not that would have resulted in a different outcome with respect to world war ii i don t think we d be saying well but that was inaction so it didn t matter i think inaction is a form of action and every time you re presented with a choice you have to balance the consequences as far as you can project them from both doing something and abstaining from doing something answer gibbs well i think that of course inaction is a form of action but the onus should always be on person advocating intervention because let s be very clear on this intervention is an act of war humanitarian intervention is a mere euphemism when we advocate humanitarian intervention we are advocating war the movement for intervention is a movement for war and it seems to me those who advocate against war really have no burden on them of proof the burden of proof should be on those who advocate for the use of violence and really the standards should be very high for the use of violence and i think we can see it s been used quite frivolously in the past to an extraordinary degree and a basic problem you have in small interventions for example the 1991 no fly zone over iraq is these things take place in the real world not in a pretend world and in that real world the united states considers itself a great power and there ll always be the question of american credibility and if the u s undertakes half measures such as a no fly zone there will always be pressures on the united states from various factions in the foreign policy establishment to take a more maximalist effort and solve the problem once and for all hence the need for another war with iraq in 2003 producing an utter catastrophe i get very queasy when i hear people discussing let us just do a limited intervention it ll just stop at that because it usually doesn t stop at that there s the quagmire effect you step into the quagmire and you get deeper and deeper into the quagmire and there will always be those who advocate deeper and deeper intervention i guess one more point i did want to respond to the claim which is a frequent one that the iraq and afghanistan wars were not really humanitarian interventions it is true that this was to some extent both interventions were at least partly traditional national interest realpolitik and the like but if you look back at the record clearly both were justified in part as humanitarian interventions both by the bush administration as well as many academics i have here before me an edited volume published by the university of california press and i believe it s 2005 called a matter of principle humanitarian arguments for war in iraq 4 just do a google search on humanitarian arguments for war in iraq and this was very much part of the picture i think it s a bit of a rewriting of history to say that humanitarian intervention was not a significant factor in the arguments for war in iraq or afghanistan they were very much part of both those wars and i would say the results very much discredit the idea of humanitarian intervention question audience thanks so you ve both talked about some historical examples and i d like to hear both of your perspectives about the ongoing situation in venezuela and the trump administration and the plans and the reports have come out that they might have plans to use military force there and how you would evaluate that in light of both of the perspectives that you ve shared answer chertoff so i think what s happening in venezuela is first of all i mean there s obviously a political dictatorship and as i ve said i don t think political regime issues are a reason to intervene militarily there is also a humanitarian element here people are starving but i don t know we re at the level of humanitarian crisis that we ve seen in other cases so my short answer would be i don t think we ve met the threshold for having a real discussion about humanitarian intervention in a military sense that s not to say there aren t non military ways to intervene just to be clear so we round the picture out there are a lot of tools in the toolbox when you deal with intervention there are sanctions economic sanctions there is even potential use of cyber tools as a way of having some impact on what s going on there is the possibility in some instances of legal action for example international criminal court or something so all of these ought to be considered part of the toolbox if i was looking at venezuela assuming it did which i emphasize it has not reach the level of humanitarian intervention you would then have to balance issues like is there an endgame we see or a strategy we see to be successful do we have the capabilities to achieve it do we have international support i think all of those would probably militate against it that s not to say it couldn t change but the dimensions of this i don t think have reached the point where military action is reasonable or likely answer gibbs well the most important thing you need to know about venezuela is that it s an undiversified oil exporting economy and there s been a drop in oil price since 2014 i ll certainly grant that a lot of what is going on now is the fault of maduro and authoritarian actions he s been taking as well as mismanagement corruption and so on most of what has been going on by any reasonable reading by any informed reading is due to low oil prices it points to i think a larger issue which is the way humanitarian crises are often triggered by economic crises discussions of rwanda almost never discuss the fact that the genocide and i think it really was a genocide in the case of rwanda the genocide by the hutu against the tutsi took place in the context of a major economic crisis resulting from the collapse of coffee prices again a very undiversified economy that was reliant almost exclusively on coffee coffee prices collapse you get a political crisis yugoslavia had a major economic crisis just before the country broke up and descended into hell we know about the descent into hell most people don t know about the economic crisis for some reason people find economics boring and because it s boring and military intervention seems more exciting we think that the solution is to send in the 82nd airborne division whereas perhaps it would have been simpler and a lot cheaper and easier and better from a humanitarian standpoint to address the economic crisis the very heavy emphasis placed on austerity in the international economic system and the very damaging political effects austerity has in many countries historical context is necessary here for all the constant repetitious references to the third reich and to world war ii which we hear again and again and again and again people often forget that one of the things that brought us adolph hitler was the great depression any reasonable reading of weimar germany s history would be that without the depression you almost certainly would not have gotten the rise of nazism so i think a greater addressing of the economic issues in the case of venezuela even if the united states were to overthrow maduro by whatever means and replace them with someone else that someone else would still have to deal with the issue of low oil prices and the damaging effects on the economy which would remain unaddressed by humanitarian intervention whether we call it that or something else i guess another point about the united states and venezuela is that the united nations sent a representative down there and condemned the us sanctions as greatly intensifying the humanitarian crisis so the intervention the united states has been doing economic at this point mostly rather than military is making things worse and that clearly has to stop if we re interested in helping the people of venezuela surely the united states would not want to make it worse

distressed downtown st george a republican boondoggle downtown st george is economically distressed so says the governor s office of economic development how can this be boutique hotels and luxury mixed use business and residential complexes are sprouting up the rapidly growing dixie state university is constructing new buildings yearly to accommodate a burgeoning student population new upscale student apartments ring the campus the city s goal to revitalize downtown is being realized in fact washington county tops the list of utah counties with the most incoming investment per capita chalk the economically distressed nonsense up to a new government boondoggle this time courtesy of republicans intending that a new opportunity zone provision in its 2017 tax law would revitalize rural and distressed urban areas the republican controlled congress added this turkey to its otherwise commendable tax overhaul democrats create anti poverty programs that throw money at those they see as disadvantaged creative citizens always find ways to scam the government so these programs do some good but inevitably fall well short and at great cost to taxpayers republicans create tax breaks for entrepreneurs and investors to encourage them to help the disadvantaged creative citizens find ways to scam the government so these programs do some good but inevitably fall well short with a lot of lost tax revenue see the difference neither do i taxpayers lose either way the rhetoric supporting these new opportunity zones hits all the right notes tax incentives draw upgraded residential housing and new businesses to distressed areas the new residents and employees spend money in nearby restaurants and services and the ripple effect magically improves life for all surrounding residents opportunity zone incentives to perform these miracles include deferring capital gains made on investments and the ability to sell a business tax free after ten years it s temptingly simple why didn t i think of that andrew looney director of the brookings institution s center on regulation and markets explains why republicans shouldn t have thought of it in his skeptical analysis of the law supporters say this will help revitalize distressed communities but there is a risk that instead of helping residents of poor neighborhoods the tax break will end up displacing them or simply provide benefits to developers investing in already gentrifying areas gentrification is the process of higher income folks moving into previously low rent urban neighborhoods looney continues the value of the tax subsidy is ultimately dependent on rising property values rising rents and higher business profitability that means a state s opportunity zones could also serve as a subsidy for displacing local residents in favor of higher income professionals and the businesses that cater to them a subsidy for gentrification gentrification is exactly what is happening in downtown st george s opportunity zone and it s been happening in spades without giving developers an unneeded tax break to paraphrase a common aphorism the generals in congress were fighting the last war when they used the 2010 census as the basis for determining opportunity zones southern utah is highly dependent on tourism and snowbirds taking a vacation or buying a second home was way down on the list for many during the great recession of 2009 10 when the census was taken as a result our unemployment rate was exceptionally high at that time add to that unfortunate but transitory circumstance the fact that college students are counted where they attend not at their family residences dixie state university is right in the middle of st george s opportunity zone and students either have very low incomes or none at all during the academic year when they are counted voilà downtown st george is a distressed area loaded with low income residents we re subsidizing local developers to do exactly what they were already doing in today s booming economy expect local officials to resume casting about for places to build subsidized low income housing for those displaced by downtown gentrification and expect the selected neighborhoods to object strenuously with pitifully few exceptions whenever government targets specific help for the economy it s a day late and a dollar short or more correctly a dollar over the hoped for benefits are rarely achieved and the cost is inevitably far greater than the original budget expect exposés in coming years as developers find ways to use and abuse opportunity zones and

loren holmes adn the alaska house chamber at the capitol building in juneau during the past week since the governor announced his reckless vetoes memories of my childhood have filled my thoughts i am a child of the 1980s when alaska faced an unprecedented economic crisis that deeply affected my life and every other alaskan after the wild pipeline days with the boundless optimism alaskans felt the price of oil dropped to 9 per barrel and dragged us into recession i was in high school at the height of the recession and remember watching friend after friend leave the state so their parents could find work my own parents divorced and we were left with an underwater mortgage almost overnight we went from being solidly middle class to living in a tiny apartment with cockroaches i got a job at wendy s working the drive through window to pay for school clothes and things that children should take for granted the impacts could be seen everywhere the fifth avenue mall had just been built but sat mostly empty for decades small businesses closed and people walked away from homes they could no longer afford between 1985 and 1987 alaska lost more than 20 000 jobs more than 40 of our banks failed the housing market collapsed leaving 14 000 homes empty in anchorage alone and by the end of the decade there was an out migration of 44 000 people but it wasn t just the drop in oil prices that put our economy in tailspin drastic cuts in government spending took the rug out from underneath the already shaky economy and it took our state more than a decade to fully recover it wasn t until the 2000s that fifth avenue mall was full again my actions today are informed by this history i want as many alaskans as possible to enjoy our beautiful state without the stress of seeing our home become a shell of what it should be i want my three children to be able to live and raise their children in alaska advertisement we must learn from past mistakes and act differently this time gov mike dunleavy likes to say alaska is open for business he sure has a funny way of showing it over the last few months governor dunleavy has single handedly shocked our economy and business climate in february he introduced a budget with 1 6 billion in cuts and attempts to suck revenue away from local communities that budget demonstrated a lack of business sense and a fundamental ignorance of basic economics businesses cannot thrive when shocked by sudden economic changes no economy grows when abruptly starved for resources businesses and economies grow when they have underlying stability the legislature took that into consideration when we worked across party lines to pass a budget that protects essential services and public assets like our university k 12 education public safety and our court system while also making significant carefully measured reductions the legislature cut the budget this year by about 200 million which follows 838 million in cuts over the past five years these were real cuts but they were made in a scalpel like and deliberate fashion now the governor has responded by vetoing so much from the university of alaska budget that programs will close and tuition could double his vetoes take millions from our court and justice systems reduce critical funding for domestic violence and homeless shelters and slash millions from the village public safety officer program just days after u s attorney general barr declared a public safety crisis in rural alaska he s vetoed the entire senior benefit program for our most financially vulnerable elders and cut school bond debt reimbursement increasing local taxes across alaska all of this is unnecessary we can have a strong economy healthy communities and a bright future for our state all it takes is lawmakers finding the courage to do the right thing for our seniors children young adults communities and businesses write your representative and senator to let them know you have their backs let them know we need leaders right now maybe more than ever let them know you need them to go to juneau and override these reckless vetoes we must stand up for the people like heather toland who testified through tears tuesday night at the anchorage legislative building that she is terrified to lose her senior benefits without any notice we must stand up for the young people who want to attend college in alaska but may be forced to go outside 80 of those who go to college outside never come home we must stand up for the families experiencing domestic violence and homelessness we must stand up for alaska rep ivy spohnholz d anchorage is a third generation alaskan who proudly represents east anchorage in the state house she hopes her children will be able to raise their children in
