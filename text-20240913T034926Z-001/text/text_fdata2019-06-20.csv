april 2018 at us 1 397 70 the driver for the surge is obviously the fed delivering the dovish tilt that the market was looking for it removed the patience approach to cutting rates said saxo bank commodity strategist ole hansen said lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies the main reason why we are seeing interest rate expectations being reduced so dramatically is because economic data is not moving up to previous strength and that has also raised questions of how much further stock markets could continue to benefit from these rate cuts hansen said the gold s move higher looks constructive for a further test toward us 1 400 as participants focus upon the fed s dovish skew with potential targets extending toward us 1 450 should near term support around us 1 375 remain intact mks pamp group said in a note currencies and bonds the canadian dollar was

on track for its biggest two day drop in a year after the u s federal reserve signalled it was ready to cut interest rates as early as next month the sharp fall in the dollar took currency markets by surprise and forced some hedge funds that had built up large long dollar bets before the rate decision to dump the greenback the fed joined global peers such as the european central bank and the australia s central bank this week in signalling that more policy stimulus is needed to boost growth that fuelled a rally in relatively higher yielding currencies such as the australian dollar and the korean won it seems to us as if the dovish fed and trump xi trade optimism narratives are both being rolled into a single ball of usd negativity said stephen gallo european head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets the dollar fell 0 5 per cent against a basket of its rivals to 96 64 putting it on course to posting its biggest two day losing streak since february 2018 it also retreated by 0 5 per

rates said neil mellor a senior currency strategist at bny mellon in london the greenback came under additional pressure after benchmark 10 year treasury yields slid to their lowest level in more than

economic and monetary developments overview based on a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook for the euro area also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections the governing council took a series of monetary policy decisions at its monetary policy meeting on 6 june to support the convergence of inflation towards levels of below but c lose to 2 despite the somewhat better than expected data for the first quarter the most recent information indicates that global headwinds continue to weigh on the euro area outlook the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets is leaving its mark on economic sentiment at the same time further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation against this overall background the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged and adjust its forward guidance on the key ecb rates to indicate its expectation that they will remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term it also reiterated its forward guidance on reinvestments and finally it decided upon the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii most notably their pricing parameters the governing council also assessed that at this point in time the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation is not undermined by possible side effects on bank based intermediation however the governing council will continue to monitor carefully the bank based transmission channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures economic and monetary assessment at the time of the governing council meeting of 6 june 2019 underlying global growth momentum continued to soften in early 2019 notwithstanding better than expected data in some key advanced economies survey based indicators signal continued weakness in global manufacturing activity despite some recent stabilisation at low levels and a recent deterioration in activity in the service sector following a period of relative resilience global growth is projected to decelerate this year amid high and rising policy and political uncertainty which is weighing on global investment and the renewed intensification of trade tensions between the united states and china while those headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on global activity and trade this year recent policy measures are expected to provide some support thereafter as a result global growth is projected to decrease in 2019 but to stabilise over the medium term global trade is expected to weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with economic activity in the medium term global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained while downside risks to global economic activity have intensified long term risk free rates have declined since the governing council s meeting in march 2019 amid market expectations of continued accommodative monetary policy and a resurgence of trade tensions non financial equity prices have increased slightly exhibiting some volatility supported by low risk free rates and improving earnings expectations however uncertainty related to resurgent trade tensions is weighing on the prices of risky assets in foreign exchange markets the euro has broadly appreciated in trade weighted terms euro area real gdp growth increased in the first quarter of 2019 to 0 4 quarter on quarter following the slowdown in the second half of last year against the background of a weaker trend in euro area external demand however incoming economic data and survey information point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year this reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties which are weighing in particular on the euro area manufacturing sector at the same time the euro area services and construction sectors are showing resilience and the labour market is continuing to improve looking ahead the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance further employment gains and rising wages and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower growth in global activity this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area these projections foresee annual real gdp increasing by 1 2 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 4 in 2021 compared with the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised up by 0 1 percentage points for 2019 and has been revised down by 0 2 percentage points for 2020 and by 0 1 percentage points for 2021 the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation was 1 2 in may 2019 after 1 7 in april reflecting mainly lower energy and services price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months before rising again towards the end of year measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted but labour cost pressures continue to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual hicp inflation at 1 3 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 compared with the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised up by 0 1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0 1 percentage points for 2020 annual hicp inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 1 1 in 2019 1 4 in 2020 and 1 6 in 2021 the annual growth of broad money and loans to the private sector increased in april 2019 broad money m3 growth stood at 4 7 in april 2019 after 4 6 in march sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 furthermore m3 growth remained resilient in the face of the fading out of the mechanical contribution of the net purchases under the asset purchase programme app at the same time lending conditions remained favourable the annual growth rate of loans to non financial corporations increased to 3 9 in april 2019 from 3 6 in march the monetary policy measures decided by the governing council including tltro iii will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing in particular for small and medium sized enterprises the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is projected to continue to be mildly expansionary thereby providing support to economic activity this profile is mainly driven by cuts in direct taxes and social security contributions in germany and france but also by relatively dynamic expenditure growth in several other countries monetary policy decisions based on the regular economic and monetary analyses the governing council made the following decisions first the key ecb interest rates were kept unchanged the governing council now expects them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term second the governing council intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation third regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii the governing council decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the eurosystem s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective tltro for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark the rate applied in tltro iii will be lower and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points these decisions were taken to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term in fact they ensure that financial conditions will remain very favourable supporting the euro area expansion the ongoing build up of domestic price pressures and thus headline inflation developments over the medium term at the same time looking ahead the governing council is determined to act in the event of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner external environment underlying global growth momentum continued to soften in early 2019 notwithstanding better than expected data in some key advanced economies this is in line with survey based indicators which signal continued weakness in global manufacturing activity following a period of relative resilience activity in the service sector has also deteriorated recently global growth is projected to decrease this year amid high and rising policy and political uncertainty which is weighing on global investment and the renewed intensification of trade tensions between the united states and china while those headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on global activity and trade this year recent policy measures are expected to provide some support thereafter as a result global growth is projected to decrease in 2019 but to stabilise over the medium term global trade is expected to weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with economic activity in the medium term global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained while downside risks to global economic activity have intensified global economic activity and trade underlying global growth momentum continued to soften in early 2019 notwithstanding better than expected data in some key advanced economies in the united states japan and the united kingdom growth was better than expected in the first quarter however this mostly reflected temporary factors in the united states and japan economic activity was supported by positive contributions from net trade which however conceal negative growth rates in real imports of goods and services inventory building also bolstered growth while domestic demand was subdued in the united states the latter was associated with the partial federal government shutdown a stronger than expected outturn in the united kingdom largely reflected strong government spending and significant stock building by businesses in the run up to the original deadline of 29 march for the country s withdrawal from membership of the european union brexit in china the economy remained on a path of gradual deceleration cushioned by expansionary policy measures survey based indicators confirm a gradual weakening in growth momentum the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi excluding the euro area softened in the first quarter of 2019 and weakened further in april and may this is mainly related to a weaker performance across advanced economies while emerging market economies have recorded a slightly smaller deterioration in activity global activity in the service sector which had been more resilient overall in recent months deteriorated in may alongside a further decline in global manufacturing activity see chart 1 chart 1 global composite output pmi diffusion indices sources markit and ecb calculations notes the latest observations are for may 2019 long term average refers to the period from january 1999 to may 2019 global financial conditions have been volatile in recent months in advanced economies they are broadly unchanged from the levels seen at the time of the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections this stability however masks two distinct developments financial conditions initially eased in response to monetary policy actions taken in the united states and other key advanced economies but have tightened since the announcements of new tariffs between the united states and china the latter development also contributed to a tightening of financial conditions in china and to a lesser extent in other emerging market economies financial conditions in turkey have also tightened considerably in recent weeks owing to a renewed sharp depreciation of the lira against the background of dwindling foreign currency reserves and rising political uncertainty in global stock markets similar developments have been observed until the news about new tariffs broke global equity prices had been rising since then global stock markets have declined amid increased volatility global growth is projected to decelerate this year amid increasing headwinds these headwinds include weak global manufacturing activity and trade in an environment of high and rising policy and political uncertainty the sizeable procyclical fiscal stimulus in the united states including lower taxes and increased expenditure continues to provide impetus to us growth this year in china the slowdown in domestic demand has been cushioned by policy measures especially those related to fiscal policy recent monetary policy actions across key advanced economies have supported the easing of global financial conditions and helped to contain the impact of policy uncertainties however the positive effect of these factors on demand seems to have been eroded by the recent escalation of the trade dispute between the united states and china looking further ahead global growth is projected to stabilise at relatively low levels over the medium term three key forces look set to shape the global economy over the projection horizon first cyclical momentum is expected to slow in key advanced economies as capacity constraints become increasingly binding and policy support may gradually diminish amid positive output gaps and low unemployment rates second china is expected to continue its orderly transition to a more balanced albeit weaker growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports finally growth is projected to recover in several key emerging market economies which are currently going through or have recently experienced deep recessions overall the pace of global expansion is expected to settle at rates below those seen prior to the 2007 08 financial crisis turning to developments in individual countries activity in the united states has remained strong notwithstanding the headwinds related to the trade dispute with china and the less favourable external environment the strong labour market accommodative financial conditions and current fiscal stimulus continue to support growth while the adverse impact of the partial federal government shutdown on domestic demand is assumed to be temporary overall real gdp expanded at an annualised rate of 3 1 in the first quarter of 2019 accelerating from 2 2 in the final quarter of last year however the surprisingly strong growth data in the first quarter also reflected temporary factors such as the positive contributions from inventories and falling imports at the same time domestic demand has declined suggesting subdued underlying growth annual headline consumer price inflation picked up to 2 0 in april from 1 9 in the previous month largely on account of increasing energy prices consumer price inflation excluding food and energy also increased slightly rising to 2 1 in april growth is projected to gradually return to the potential growth rate of just below 2 while consumer price inflation is expected to remain slightly above 2 over the medium term growth in china has recorded a gradual slowdown in the first quarter of 2019 annual gdp growth stabilised supported by a positive net trade contribution as imports decreased more than exports looking through their volatility the latest indicators point to stable growth momentum in the near term a number of fiscal and monetary policy measures announced and implemented by the chinese authorities recently are expected to cushion domestic demand and thus to deliver a smooth deceleration in activity this year the recent escalation of the trade dispute with the united states is expected to weigh on trade while its impact on growth is expected to be contained by policies looking further ahead progress with the implementation of structural reforms is projected to result in an orderly transition to a more moderate growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports in japan underlying growth momentum remains muted growth in the first quarter of 2019 was 0 5 quarter on quarter which was better than expected as a number of transitory factors were at play including a large positive contribution from net exports owing to a sharp contraction in imports which exceeded the weakness in exports looking ahead economic activity is expected to resume its path of moderate growth the strong labour market and still favourable financial conditions remain supportive although the economy is facing headwinds related to weak foreign demand especially from china and the rest of asia households are expected to frontload purchases ahead of the consumption tax hike scheduled for october 2019 which could in turn provide a temporary boost to activity over the summer months in addition fiscal measures aimed at counterbalancing the negative impact of the higher consumption tax are expected to support demand later in the year wage growth is still modest despite the very tight labour market and inflation expectations are stable at low levels suggesting that inflation will remain well below the bank of japan s 2 target over the medium term in the united kingdom growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2019 on the back of a fiscal boost and strong stock building against the background of a last minute extension to the long anticipated departure date of the united kingdom from the european union strong stockpiling together with fiscal support and better than expected data on both consumption and private investment resulted in quarterly uk real gdp growth of 0 5 in the first quarter after a modest 0 2 in the final quarter of 2018 net trade made a negative contribution to headline growth as imports surged at a rate rarely seen in the past 40 years partly owing to inventory building while exports remained flat however short term indicators at the start of the second quarter suggest a continuation of the broad underlying trend of slowing growth momentum seen since the referendum on eu membership annual cpi inflation declined to 1 8 in the first quarter of 2019 slightly below the bank of england s 2 0 target as sharp reductions in energy prices fed through to headline inflation stronger domestic cost pressures from higher unit labour costs amid higher wage growth at the start of 2019 have been largely offset by the decline in import prices as the impact of the past depreciation of the pound sterling following the referendum continues to wane cpi inflation rebounded slightly to 2 1 in april 2019 largely as a consequence of an increase in retail energy prices as well as marked rises in air fares for the easter period over the medium term growth is expected to remain below the level recorded prior to the referendum in central and eastern european countries growth is projected to moderate somewhat this year investment growth remains strong supported by eu funds and consumer spending also remains robust underpinned by the strong labour market performance however the slowdown in the euro area is weighing on the growth outlook for this region over the medium term the pace of economic expansion in these countries is expected to decelerate further towards potential the outlook for economic activity in large commodity exporting countries remains mixed the outlook for growth in russia is shaped by developments in global oil markets the execution of fiscal and structural policies and the international sanctions under which the economy is currently operating as a result growth is expected to decelerate somewhat in the medium term in contrast growth in brazil is projected to strengthen supported by accommodative financial conditions however the existing fiscal constraints and uncertainties about the implementation of the current reform agenda continue to weigh on investment in turkey economic activity contracted significantly in the fourth quarter of 2018 this contraction reflects the legacy of last summer s financial turmoil high inflation and procyclical monetary and fiscal policies the economy returned to growth in the first quarter of 2019 supported by fiscal spending and higher lending by state owned banks in the run up to local elections in march the expected disappearance of these supportive factors together with the recent tightening of financial conditions could undermine the projected gradual recovery in economic activity this year global trade momentum weakened significantly at the turn of the year it has decelerated considerably more than global activity this is explained by weaker global investment activity and a turn in the global tech cycle amid high and rising policy and geopolitical uncertainty which in turn weighed on manufacturing output and trade the volume of global merchandise imports excluding the euro area contracted by 0 6 in march in three month on three month terms confirming subdued trade momentum in the first quarter see chart 2 as survey indicators signal a further deterioration in global manufacturing activity the current weakness in global trade is likely to continue in the near term bilateral trade talks between the united states and china suffered a setback in early may the us administration announced that it would increase the tariff rate on usd 200 billion of chinese exports from 10 to 25 this increase was originally scheduled for 1 january 2019 but had been postponed twice initially for three months owing to the temporary truce agreed between the two countries in early december and again in late february amid tangible progress in the bilateral trade talks china retaliated by raising the tariff rate on usd 60 billion of us exports from between 5 and 10 to between 10 and 25 in addition the risk of a further escalation looms large as the us administration has threatened to impose additional 25 tariffs on all remaining us imports from china the prospect of a further intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries has raised global uncertainty and is weighing on investment moreover the possibility that the us administration may impose new tariffs on imports from other countries cannot be ruled out for instance in mid may it announced that new tariffs of 25 on imported automobiles and auto parts focusing primarily on imports from the eu and japan would be postponed for up to six months allowing time for bilateral trade negotiations between the united states and these trading partners chart 2 surveys and global trade in goods left hand scale three month on three month percentage changes right hand scale diffusion indices sources markit cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis and ecb calculations note the latest observations are for may 2019 for the pmis and march 2019 for global merchandise imports global economic growth is projected to weaken this year before stabilising over the medium term according to the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections global real gdp growth excluding the euro area is

medium term compared with the march 2019 ecb staff macroeconomic projections global gdp growth has been revised slightly downwards for this year at the same time growth in euro area foreign demand has been revised downwards more significantly over the projection horizon from a geographical perspective these revisions reflect weaker than expected trade prospects for china and the rest of asia as

intensified lately a further escalation of trade disputes may pose a risk to global trade and growth moreover a no deal brexit scenario could have more adverse spillover effects especially in europe a sharper slowdown of china s economy could be harder to counteract with efficient policy stimulus and might prove a challenge to the ongoing rebalancing process in china repricing in financial markets

oil prices have declined since april they have recently been volatile since april oil prices have declined by 13 however they have exhibited more pronounced volatility recently while potential disruptions to the global oil supply owing to geopolitical tensions particularly in the middle east have sent oil prices higher concerns over trade tensions between the united states and china and their impact on global demand have lately led to downward pressure on oil prices in the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections oil prices are expected to increase in the near term and to decline over the projection horizon amid short term volatility supply factors have continued to bolster oil prices in particular the agreement between opec and other major oil producers to curb production however weaker global oil demand and higher than expected shale oil production in the united states could also weigh on oil prices consequently the oil price assumptions underpinning the

pace the annual growth rate of overnight deposits remained unchanged at 7 8 in april reflecting the stable annual growth rate of overnight deposits held by households while the corresponding rate for nfcs declined moreover notwithstanding some short term volatility the growth in currency in circulation has followed its long established trend thus speaking against any material substitution of cash for deposits in an environment of very low or negative interest rates for the euro area as a whole the contribution of short term deposits other than overnight deposits i e m2 minus m1 became positive for the first time since late 2013 continuing the upward trend observed in recent quarters and supported by lower opportunity costs of holding m3 marketable instruments i e m3 minus m2 continued to contribute negatively to m3 growth as a result of the relatively low remuneration of these instruments the decreasing mechanical contribution of the app to m3 growth has been largely offset from the counterparts perspective by positive contributions from credit to the private sector and recently from external monetary inflows see chart 20 the positive contribution to m3 growth from general government securities held by the eurosystem which reflects the mechanical contribution of the app to m3 growth decreased further see the red parts of the bars in chart 20 while credit to the private sector remained the main source of money creation see the blue parts of the bars in chart 20 the lower contribution of the app has been replaced during recent months by external monetary flows see the

loan sales securitisation and notional cash pooling edged up to 3 4 in april from 3 2 in march see chart 19 this was mainly owing to the increase in the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs to 3 9 in april from 3 6 in march looking beyond short term volatility nfc loan growth has moderated somewhat but remained relatively close to its september 2018 peak of 4 3 this is in line with its lagging cyclical pattern with respect to real economic activity and the slowdown in aggregate demand observed over the course of 2018 the moderation was largely driven by diminished loan demand owing to firms lower financing needs by contrast bank lending and bond market conditions remained favourable see below suggesting that supply forces are not weighing on credit dynamics given the ample degree of

debt financing for euro area banks decreased further down from its recent peak in january 2019 and returning to its level in february 2018 see chart 23 this development was driven mainly by a considerable decline in bank bond yields still compared with deposits bank bonds remained the more expensive source of funding accounting for a limited share in banks overall debt funding in addition euro area banks deposit rates remained broadly stable in april the improvement in banks debt funding costs was widespread across the largest euro area countries while deposit rates remained broadly unchanged across these countries bank bond yields declined considerably in april in addition euro area banks reported improved access to funding in the first quarter of 2019 in their responses to the ecb s bank lending survey primarily on account of their access to debt securities funding at the same time the level of bank funding costs remained heterogeneous across the largest euro area countries in april euro area banks loan deposit margins decreased somewhat for new business simultaneously the compression of loan deposit margins is ongoing for the rates on outstanding loans in countries with a high reliance on fixed rate contracts indicating a gradual repricing of old loan contracts at new lower rates the compression of loan deposit margins as such exerts a dampening impact on bank profitability which is however compensated by the positive impact of the low or even negative interest rate environment on credit quality which reduces provisioning costs and lending volumes overall euro area banks funding conditions have remained favourable reflecting the ecb s accommodative monetary policy stance and the strengthening of banks balance sheets at the same time despite banks

moving averages source ecb notes the indicator for the total cost of bank borrowing is calculated by aggregating short and long term rates using a 24 month moving average of new business volumes the cross country standard deviation is calculated using a fixed sample of 12 euro area countries the latest observation is for april 2019 the annual flow of total external financing to euro area nfcs is estimated to have moderated in the first quarter of 2019 this reflected the moderation in bank lending as well as continued low issuance of listed shares whereas the net issuance of debt securities was relatively strong still compared with the previous growth slowdown episode in 2015 2016 nfc debt financing flows based on mfi loans debt securities issuance and non mfi loans were higher this is consistent with favourable debt financing conditions and stronger corporate balance sheets overall given the typically lagged reaction of nfc external financing to economic activity the recent moderation in nfc external financing is consistent with the weakening of economic activity in 2018 and the resultant lower financing needs of firms in the first quarter of 2019 the net issuance of debt securities by nfcs rebounded strongly from the negative level recorded in the last quarter of 2018 the main driver of the positive net flow of nfc debt securities issued in the first quarter of 2019 is most likely the postponed issuance in the last quarter of 2018 that was related to the deterioration in the economic outlook and the increase in the spreads of the bonds issued by nfcs in the context of broader risk aversion in the market the rapid decline of the cost of market based debt financing since the end of 2018 prompted a rebound in nfc net issuance of debt securities taking a somewhat longer perspective the annual net issuance flows for march 2019 were above those in december 2018 which was the lowest reading since may 2016 see chart 26 and in line with a gradual stabilisation that started at the beginning of 2019 market data suggest that the net issuance of debt securities by both investment grade and high yield issuers in april and may 2019 was much more muted than it was in the first quarter of 2019 the net issuance of listed shares continued to weaken in the first quarter of 2019 reflecting a series of negative net monthly flows that started in november 2018 chart 26 net issuance of debt securities and quoted shares by euro area nfcs annual flows in eur billions source ecb notes monthly figures based on a 12 month rolling period the latest observation is for march 2019 in april 2019 the cost of financing for nfcs declined further compared to its end 2018 level and reached its historical minimum in april the overall nominal cost of external financing for nfcs comprising bank lending debt issuance in the market and equity finance stood at 4 4 this is seven basis points lower than it was in march 2019 and a new historical low although the cost of financing is estimated to have increased slightly in may it remains substantially lower than the level seen in mid 2014 when market expectations regarding the introduction of the public sector purchase programme began to emerge according to the latest survey on the access to finance of enterprises smes in the euro area continued to signal support for accommodative financing conditions while indicating some concerns about past developments in their business environment fewer smes indicated increases in the availability of external sources of finance despite a positive willingness of banks to extend credit furthermore an increasing share of smes across most euro area countries perceived the macroeconomic outlook as an impediment to their access to external finance nevertheless as in the previous survey they ranked access to finance as their lowest concern although significant cross country differences still exist the percentage of distressed smes in the euro area has remained broadly unchanged at around 3 far from its historical peak of more than 14 in the second half of 2012 on balance a declining but still sizeable share of smes reported higher turnover in a context of unchanged profits competition difficulties in finding customers as well as growing labour and other costs for material energy and interest expenses may have all weighed on profits fiscal developments the euro area fiscal stance is projected to continue to be mildly expansionary thus providing support to economic activity at the same time countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers all countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances likewise the transparent and consistent implementation of the european union s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy following an improvement last year the euro area general government budget deficit is projected to deteriorate in 2019 and remain stable in the following two years the general government deficit ratio for the euro area stood at 0 5 of gdp in 2018 compared with 1 0 of gdp in 2017 the improvement in 2018 was mainly the result of favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments the improvement is likely to be reversed this year on account of a significantly lower cyclically adjusted primary balance the higher deficit is also expected to persist over the following two years see chart 27 the outlook for the euro area general government deficit ratio has improved marginally over the whole projection horizon compared with the march 2019 ecb staff projections the lower deficit mainly reflects a smaller deterioration in the cyclically adjusted primary balance chart 27 budget balance and its components percentage of gdp sources ecb and june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections notes the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to have been neutral in 2018 but is projected to be mildly expansionary from 2019 onwards this profile is mainly driven by cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions in both germany and france but it is also a result of relatively dynamic expenditure growth in several other countries the decline in the euro area aggregate public debt to gdp ratio is projected to continue at a slower pace according to the june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the aggregate general government debt to gdp ratio in the euro area is expected to decline from 85 1 of gdp in 2018 to 80 6 of gdp in 2021 the projected reduction in the government debt ratio is supported by both a negative interest rate growth rate differential and continued primary surpluses see chart 28 although deficit debt adjustments are expected to offset some of these effects over the projection horizon the debt ratio is projected to fall or increase only slowly in all euro area countries but it will continue to far exceed the reference value of 60 of gdp in a number of countries compared with the march 2019 projections the decline in the aggregate euro area debt to gdp ratio is expected to be somewhat more pronounced with the projected ratio for 2021 being revised down by 0 5 percentage points this is mainly due to slightly higher primary surplus projections coupled with small downward revisions to the deficit debt adjustment chart 28 drivers of change in public debt percentage points of gdp sources ecb and june 2019 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections notes the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area countries need to ensure that their fiscal policies fully comply with the stability and growth pact in particular countries where government debt is high need to set their debt ratio on a declining path at the same time all countries should increase efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances boxes the decrease in euro area net financial outflows in 2018 foreign direct investment retrenchment and portfolio investment slowdown prepared by michael fidora and martin schmitz in 2018 the financial account of the euro area balance of payments recorded net outflows of 2 7 of euro area gdp see chart a the decrease in net financial outflows from 3 4 of gdp in 2017 is in line with the narrowing of the euro area current account surplus recorded in 2018 and partly reflects the stepwise reduction in the net purchases of the eurosystem s asset purchase programme app the net outflows continued to be driven by portfolio investment in debt securities as well as to a lesser extent financial derivatives foreign direct investment fdi and reserve assets at the same time the euro area recorded net inflows of portfolio investment in equity and other investment largely comprising currency loans and deposits liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 30 january to 16 april 2019 prepared by iwona durka and annette kamps this box describes the ecb s monetary policy operations during the first and second reserve maintenance periods of 2019 which ran from 30 january to 12 march 2019 and from 13 march to 16 april 2019 respectively throughout this period the interest rates on the main refinancing operations mros the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility remained unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively in

and corporate sector securities definitions and characteristics of soft patches in the euro area prepared by mattia duma magnus forsells and neale kennedy following an exceptionally strong performance in 2017 growth slowed in 2018 raising the question of whether this was just a temporary soft patch or should have been seen as pointing to a more prolonged period of weakness the term soft patch is used widely in the media and elsewhere to describe a temporary period of slower growth during an expansionary phase characterised by higher trend growth rates however there appears to have been relatively little analysis of such periods particularly for the euro area confidence and investment prepared by malin andersson and benjamin mosk economic agents confidence and developments in the real economy are intrinsically linked periods of high confidence could per se spur activity while currently lower confidence could reinforce the magnitude and persistence of the ongoing economic slowdown in the euro area in terms of the expenditure components of gdp business investment is particularly affected by changes in confidence and uncertainty as firms may postpone their investment plans and choose to wait and see in times of high uncertainty this box looks at the potential propagation effects of lower confidence on investment in recent times rent inflation in the euro area since the crisis prepared by moreno roma rent inflation has recently strengthened rather than mitigated the still relatively subdued developments in services and underlying inflation in the euro area having been hovering around 1¼ since january 2018 rent inflation has on balance stayed below the inflation rate for services as a whole see chart a while this was the case for most of the pre crisis period it appears more striking now as rent inflation is typically considered to be a more resilient inflation component that is relatively higher in periods when other components of hicp inflation tend to be low these developments are also interesting in the context of public debates in many euro area countries about strong rent increases and against the background of the sustained increases in euro area house prices over recent years this box puts recent developments in euro area rent inflation into perspective as housing and rental markets have remained heterogeneous this box also looks at developments across euro area countries articles the euro area labour market through the lens of the beveridge curve prepared by agostino consolo and antónio dias da silva in this article we look at the euro area labour market using the framework underlying the beveridge curve which captures the negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate the beveridge curve shows that at a given moment in time there are jobs vacant and people unemployed while the shape and the position of the curve provide important information about the functioning of the labour market there are two key concepts associated with the beveridge curve labour market tightness and matching efficiency labour market tightness is the number of vacant posts per each unemployed person and matching efficiency reflects the market s ability to match individuals to jobs we analyse the importance of these two concepts for wage developments using a simple version of the search and matching model where unemployment wages and vacancies are jointly determined and the beveridge curve features prominently first we derive two aggregate measures that encapsulate the changes in the vacancy unemployment space labour market tightness and matching efficiency second we look at the information content behind market tightness and job matching efficiency to analyse the euro area labour market and its cyclical conditions third aggregate measures of labour market tightness and efficiency are used in a standard wage phillips curve equation to measure their marginal impact the results support the view that labour market tightness and labour market efficiency both play a role in explaining wage developments however the quantitative implications for wages differ only marginally from those of the standard phillips curve approach overall labour market efficiency provides an important qualitative margin of labour market functioning that is not captured in standard wage phillips curve specifications drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time a phillips curve perspective prepared by elena bobeica and andrej sokol in this article we review the evolution of euro area hicp inflation excluding energy and food since the great financial crisis through the lens of the phillips curve this period is particularly interesting as the euro area experienced two recessions in 2008 2009 and 2011 2014 and a protracted episode of low inflation from 2013 onwards we estimate a large set of phillips curve models for the euro area and review the interpretation of inflation developments that they provide over time we find that our models can account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation between 2013 and mid 2017 but that they cannot account for the weakness in underlying inflation towards the end of our sample statistics
20 06 2019 the heroes of finance despite the efforts of central banks the risk of a new global recession continues to rise argues michael roberts at last week s g20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in japan the world s finance leaders tried to put a brave face on the situation tension over the intensifying trade war between china and the us was the biggest talking point but officials also wrangled over the wording of the final communiqué on how to describe their concerns for world growth while they flagged that it appears to be stabilising they also warned that the risks were tilted to the downside most importantly trade and geopolitical tensions have intensified we will continue to address these risks and stand ready to take further action the communiqué said but where is this action to avoid a new global recession going to come from the world s central banks it seems central banks are heroes organisation for economic cooperation and development secretary general ángel gurria told bloomberg television in an interview during the meetings the question is how much armoury do they still have how many bullets particularly silver bullets in other words what monetary policy weapons do the major central banks have left after 10 years of keeping policy interest rates near or even below zero and after massive injections of money through quantitative easing buying up all the debt of governments and corporations from banks in order to encourage them to lend for investment well we are about to find out in the us the federal reserve led by jay powell having gradually raised its policy rate for the last four years is now indicating that it will reverse this policy and take its rate down again in order to boost the american and world economy powell told markets and the g20 ministers that the fed stood ready to cut interest rates saying it would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion a put is financial jargon for betting on a rise in financial assets in futures markets in the mid 1990s the then fed chair alan greenspan reduced interest rates to boost the stock and property markets the greenspan put took the stock market to a new peak in 2000 but it was followed by the huge dot com bust we are about to have the powell put to do the same financial markets are now betting that the fed will cut rates and keep the cost of borrowing really low in order to speculate further in financial markets jay powell is set to be the new hero thus the fantasy world of financial markets may be extended but will cutting interest rates avoid a recession in the real economy everywhere the hard data are showing a sharp slowdown in economic growth a collapse of the world car industry and outright slumps in many large so called emerging economies above all there is a significant contraction in world trade as the trade and technology war instigated by the us against china hots up us economic growth had accelerated from 2 to 3 a year in 2018 after the trump corporate tax cuts boosted profits and unemployment dropped to post war lows but last friday s may employment growth figures were the lowest in years and wage growth that had been accelerating also dropped off so there are signs that trumponomics has been exhausted now jay powell must step up to the proverbial baseball plate after being encouraged by trump elsewhere in the world two key g7 economies continue to show a significant slowdown in economic growth german industrial production plunged 1 9 from a month earlier in april that was the biggest drop in output since august 2015 year on year industrial production dropped 1 8 over april 2018 following a 0 9 fall in march manufacturing output dropped 3 4 over the year both german exports and imports fell german growth is now the slowest in five years as a result the bundesbank cut its gross domestic product growth forecast for this year to just 0 6 down from 1 6 at the beginning of 2019 at the same time the g20 s host japan announced that wages had fallen for the fourth consecutive month and overall household spending slowed sharply unemployment currently at record lows was now set to rise and most important china s economic growth rate is at its lowest level in over a decade even if the rate of 6 plus is around three times the average in the rest of the g20 economies hidden in its semi annual report on global economic prospects the world bank cuts it forecast for economic growth ie for all countries including china and india for this year by 0 3 percentage points to 2 6 there s been a tumble in business confidence a deepening slowdown in global trade and sluggish investment in emerging and developing economies said new trump appointed world bank president david malpass momentum remains fragile world trade growth is expected to fall to its lowest level since the global financial crash of 2008 the bank also warned that risks are skewed firmly to the downside citing reignited trade tensions between the us and china financial turbulence in emerging markets and sharper than expected weakness in advanced nations particularly europe hidden at the back of their report is this statement by world bank economists a sharper than expected deceleration of activity in systemically large economies such as china the euro area and the united states could also have broad ranging repercussions the probability of growth in 2020 being at least one percentage point below current projections is estimated at close to 20 such slowdown would be comparable to the 2001 global downturn another sign that the world capitalist economy is turning sour comes from the smaller g20 economies growth in the australian economy fell to its weakest rate in almost a decade in the first three months of this year the economy grew by just 1 8 year on year in the first quarter and down from 2 3 in the preceding fourth quarter this is australia s worst quarterly growth showing since the end of 2009 among the so called brics brazil china india russia and south africa it is looking even worse the south african economy is now suffering its worst slump in a decade output in africa s most industrialised nation dropped by an annualised 3 2 in the first quarter its largest quarterly fall since 2009 power intensive industries such as manufacturing and mining recorded the biggest drops in activity in the quarter mining activity fell by more than 10 while manufacturing dropped 8 8 turkey went into a recession earlier this year under its own donald trump president recep tayyip erdoğan argentina was already in a slump in 2018 under the governance of the rightwing administration of president mauricio macri the country is now experiencing vicious austerity measures at the behest of the international monetary fund which is bailing out the government with the biggest loans in its history but the likely trigger of a new recession is the ongoing and intensifying trade and technology war between the us and china neither side appears to be ready to back down and as a result world trade growth is diving and there is the prospect of increased tariffs and protectionist measures bloomberg economists reckon that if tariffs expand to cover all us china trade in the next few months then global gdp will take a 600 billion hit in 2021 with 25 tariffs on all bilateral trade gdp would be down 0 8 for china 0 5 for the us and 0 5 for the world economy compared to no trade war that spells global recession and trump seems bent on widening the trade war to other economies he has temporarily delayed introducing a range of tariffs on mexican imports including imports of car and car parts that american companies make inside the mexican border with the us the world car industry is already in major crisis driven by the end of diesel and slowing demand in china europe and japan now american car companies face new problems with trump s plans thus while financial markets may be set to boom with the powell put that is likely to have little effect on the struggling world economy the recovery since the great recession ended in mid 2009 has reached its 10th year making it the longest following a slump in 75 years but it is also the weakest recovery since 1945 real gdp growth and business investment remains well down from the rate before 2007 the trade and technology war is settling in for the long haul what makes it likely that things will not be resolved amicably in order to avoid a global recession is that the battle between the us and china is not just over unfair trade it is much more an attempt by the us to maintain its global technological superiority in the face of china s fast rise to compete the attack on huawei globally organised by the us is just the start us investment bank goldman sachs has noted that since 2010 the only place where corporate earnings have expanded is in the us and this according to goldmans is entirely down to the super tech companies however even global technology profits are only moderately higher than they were prior to the financial crisis despite having moved sharply upwards mainly reflecting the impact of large us technology companies and now it is just this sector that will suffer from the technology war the risk of a new recession as measured by various methods continues to rise then there is the supposedly reliable indicator of the inverted yield curve in bond markets normally the interest rate of long term bonds ie 10 years or more is much higher than the short term interest less than one year so the curve of interest rates from three months to 10 years is up or steep but when the 10 year rate drops below the three month rate this has invariably heralded a new recession within a year why because it implies that investors are so worried about the future that they want to hold safe assets like government bonds rather than invest to the point that the long term interest rate on these bonds falls below even the rate set by the federal reserve for short term loans the yield on benchmark us government bonds hit new 2019 lows near 2 before the g20 meeting while those on 10 year bonds in both germany and japan were below zero about 11 trillion of bonds around the world concentrated in europe and japan carry negative yields and now account for about 20 of all debt worldwide and us yield curve has now inverted the inversion has only just happened and it needs to continue for a few months to justify its reliability as a recession indicator so watch this space maybe the central bank heroes can save the day michael roberts blogs at
overview the prospect of lower for longer continues to fuel the bond and stock rally the initial us equity response to the fed was positive but not strong and closed about 0 3 higher asia pacific equities followed suit with mostly modest gains except for china and hong kong where gains of more than 1 were recorded hong kong s four day rally lifts the hang seng over 5 this week and set to advance for the third week it had lost nearly 9 5 in may europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is up around 0 6 in late morning dealings to bring this week s advance to a little more than 2 the s p 500 is poised to gap higher toward the record high set at the start of last month yields are tumbling with new record lows in australia and new zealand the minus 16 5 bp yield of the generic jgb is a fresh three year low italian and greek bond yields are off 8 9 bp today extending their impressive run while other peripheral european and uk yields are 3 4 bp lower and core yields are off 1 2 bp the us 10 year pushed below 2 but is slightly above there now the dollar is falling against nearly all the world s currencies today among the majors the japanese yen is the weakest with around a 0 35 gain while the norwegian krone has been lifted nearly 1 7 on the back of the rate hike and signal of another one likely this year the chinese yuan rose almost 0 8 against the dollar to cny6 85 which appears to be the largest gain of the year asia pacific the bank of japan left policy steady as widely expected boj kuroda recognized rising external risks the cautionary words are not likely sufficient to deter the abe government from lifting the sales tax in october government officials have indicated that only something on the magnitude of the fall of lehman or the great financial crisis would deter it that bar may be somewhat high and any dilution may be favorable for japanese stocks other regional central banks that met philippines indonesia and taiwan also left rates steady however policy is expected to ease in several countries in the coming months including south korea the philippines and china the reserve bank of new zealand meets next week the market appears to be pricing in around a one in four chance of cut but is more confident that a reduction which would bring the cash rate to 1 25 in august is more likely the reserve bank of australia meets on july 2 and the market has nearly 2 3 of a cut discounted after meeting persistent resistance around jpy108 65 the dollar turned decisively lower today and dipped below jpy107 50 for the first time since the january 3 flash crash we suspect the jpy108 area will now act as resistance there is a 1 8 bln option struck there that expires today the jpy107 area was the technical target we suggested but today and tomorrow there is are 1 bln options that roll off the australian dollar is rising for the third consecutive session after recording a five month low near 0 6830 two days ago the aussie is pushing back above 0 6900 it is nearing the lower end of a band of resistance seen in the 0 6930 0 6950 area the dollar eased against the chinese yuan for the third day it briefly traded below cny6 85 for the first time in over a month the price action reinforces the importance of cny7 0 as a potential inflection point should it be violated europe norway is marching to a beat of a different drummer the central bank hiked rates for the second time this year and by nudging up its anticipated rate path has signaled the likelihood of another rate increase later this year it noted the economy was a little stronger than previously projected norway s deposit rate now stands at 1 25 the divergence between the norges bank on the one hand and the fed and the ecb on the other is stark and has sent the greenback and euro down the most against the krone in several years three issues are the focus in the uk first uk households pared by consumption and retail sales fell for a second month in may excluding petrol sales were off 0 3 the same as in april recall that retail sales rose an average of 0 9 in q1 at the headline level retail sales fell 0 5 while the april series was revised to 0 1 from flat second the boe meets and this is little chance of a move despite the boe s warnings that rates will have to go up to ensure inflation remains near the target given some hawkish comments by the boe s saunders and haldane there are some thoughts that one may dissent the boe says that its economic forecasts are based on the idea that brexit will be smooth while it may be the politically correct position it does not seem like the most likely scenario and makes at least one wonder about its independence thirdly in two votes today the tories will narrow the leadership challenge to two candidates as has been the case throughout the process the real question is who will join johnson on the ballot that the rank and file members will choose between in the coming weeks after dipping below 1 12 earlier this week the euro is probing the 1 13 area now there may be some mild resistance near 1 1310 the highs seen earlier this month just shy of 1 350 is the real target and hurdle a move above there would lift the technical tone sterling tested 1 25 earlier this week and has now pushed through 1 27 there is a modest option gbp300 mln struck at 2720 that expires today on the downside there are about gbp800 mln in options between 1 2680 and 1 2690 that will also roll off today recall that high from earlier this month was near 1 2760 america the ecb s draghi and the federal reserve were dovish but in different ways draghi was clear in the absence of inflation moving toward the target further accommodation is necessary the fed s attitude seems to be if the economy were to weaken it would respond while the fomc statement dropped the reference to patience the dot plots did not pick up a material change in the economic outlook the median gdp forecast for this year was unchanged at 2 1 which is above their understanding of the sustainable long term pace of 1 9 the median dot shaved the unemployment forecast to 3 6 well below the 4 2 what they think is full employment without using the word cues that signal a july hike the extent of the shift of the dot plot without seeing a substantive change in the economic conditions is remarkable the previous fed argument that the softness of price pressures was transitory seemed less convincing and the median forecast now expected headline pce which is the official targeted rate was reduced to 1 5 from 1 8 their estimate for the core was cut to 1 8 from 2 0 the fed acknowledged that the uncertainties around the outlook had increased in contrast draghi argument that the uncertainty itself was the materialization of the risk there is good reason for the market to be uncertain the fed itself is quite divided chairman powell experienced his first dissent bullard was the only one that wanted an immediate cut the dots however showed a different picture eight anticipated no need to change rates this year while another eight thought at least one cut would be necessary of which seven saw the likelihood that two cuts would be appropriate one official thought a hike would be appropriate most think this was kc fed president george while the central banks of most high income countries worry about too low of inflation canada has a different experience may cpi rose 0 4 well above economists forecasts and lifted the year over year rate to 2 4 from 2 0 the underlying measures on average were also firmer the canadian dollar rallied on the news and nearly 0 75 gain on the day was the most in almost four months initially the market pushed short term canadian rates higher but after the fed they softened and the implied yield of the december ba futures closed less than a basis point higher on the day the us premium on two year money fell 11 basis points to 35 bp which is the smallest since february 2018 interpolating from the ois the collective wisdom of the market is that there is around a 35 chance that the bank of canada cuts rates this year at the end of last week there was about a 40 chance priced in and at the end of last month it was closer to 50 the fed s declaratory policy is that is it data dependent but operationally it does not appear to be the case as we noted the fed s macro view has not changed but uncertainty has today s data includes q1 current account weekly jobless claims and the philadelphia fed survey more importantly over the coming days starting tomorrow fed officials will return to the public spotlight and their comments will be closely watched for clues into where the bar is for a potential july move that has been fully discounted the greenback pushed above cad1 34 earlier this

collapse of belarusian ruble is coming uladzimir tarasau 20 06 2019 20 49 7 041 russia does not give money this year the events in the foreign exchange market of the country are developing according to the scenario of last year which causes some concerns since then the dollar exchange rate declined until mid summer after which it quickly grew by about 10 will it happen now so far in belarus itself nothing foreshadows such a development and the situation in some segments of the currency market of the republic of belarus has even improved businesses and people sell currency true individuals this may sold currencies for 131 8 million dollars more than they bought which is significantly lower than in may 2018 when they sold 207 3 million dollars in pure form in general in january may of the current year the population of the republic of belarus sold foreign currency to the banks in net terms for 271 9 million for five months of last year 657 8 million dollars in january may of this year business entities residents of the republic of belarus sold currencies for 79 9 million dollars more than they bought that is they like individuals are net sellers of currency and in the five months of last year they bought more currency than they sold by 425 8 million dollars business entities the non residents of the republic of belarus in the first five months of the current year sold currencies of 275 4 million against 191 8 million a year ago to the banks thus the population this year began to sell less currency but enterprises have compensated for this reduction foreign trade in goods goes into minus at the same time the state of belarus s foreign trade has somewhat deteriorated the balance of foreign trade of belarus in goods and services for january april of the current year amounted according to the national bank to 52 4 million which is significantly lower than in the same period last year when it was equal to 304 6 million compared to the same period last year the balance of foreign trade in services grew by 11 and reached 1 246 billion while the negative balance of foreign trade in goods increased by almost 50 in absolute value and amounted to 1 193 billion a sharp deterioration in foreign trade in goods was observed in april when exports amounted to 2 625 billion dollars which was significantly less than a year ago this was caused in particular by a decrease in revenues from the export of petroleum products due to a reduction in their production at the belarusian refineries due to the supply of low quality oil from russia at the same time imports of goods in belarus in april in fob prices amounted to 3 318 billion dollars which significantly exceeded imports in april 2018 equal to 2 999 billion dollars individuals love currency deposits the reduction in the volume of sales of currency by individuals in the current year is accompanied by an increase in the value of their savings in banks since the beginning of the year foreign currency deposits of the population increased by 179 6 million dollars and reached 7 31 billion dollars as of june 1 in particular fixed term currency deposits of the population in may 2019 increased by 11 million dollars compared with april although in may last year they decreased by 97 1 million dollars that is a rather radical change in the attitude of people to foreign currency deposits occurred over the year perhaps this is due to a significant increase in the average interest rate on new currency deposits of the population for a period exceeding 1 year up to 2 12 in may of this year from 1 48 in may of last year thus the currency of individuals remains in the banking system which is positive for the ruble deposits of legal entities also increased over january may by 239 million dollars to 4 22 billion dollars true foreign currency still remains in the eyes of the majority of belarusians more attractive than belarusian rubles according to the national bank s inflation expectations of the population study for may 2019 64 5 of residents in our country consider the currency to be the preferred means of savings but in february these were 67 1 that is there is progress true this does not lead to a special increase in the rate of increase in term ruble deposits of the population they grow but slowly thus fixed term ruble deposits of individuals in may of the current year increased by 62 5 million rubles in comparison with april up to 4 35 billion rubles this is higher than the growth in may last year equal to 45 million rubles but the situation has not changed fundamentally and this is despite a significant increase in the incomes of the population russia does not give money significant risks for the currency market of the republic of belarus are associated with russia reducing financial support from it seems inevitable since the chances that the two countries will manage to agree on deep integration are small and without such integration russian president vladimir putin does not want to refinance even old debts and give the last tranche of a loan to the eurasian development bank true head of the ministry of economic development and trade of the russian federation maxim oreshkin on june 15 reported that the joint group for the preparation of the program for in depth integration had agreed on about 90 of the provisions of this program but the remaining 10 can be a stumbling block anyway the prime ministers of the two countries should meet on june 21 who by the way do not decide anything and then the decisive meeting between putin and lukashenka will probably follow however russia seems unwilling to give in which is indicated by the appointment of former russian ambassador to belarus mikhail babich to the post of deputy minister of economic development of the russian federation who oversees cooperation between russia and the cis as well as issues relating to the union state of russia and belarus that is mikhail babich will now engage in the deepening of integration within the union state thus vladimir putin showed aliaksandr lukashenka that he fully agrees with the ex ambassador however in the near future the reduction of the russian assistance to our country will not cause any particular problems since the ministry of finance and state owned banks of the republic of belarus primarily the development bank are ready to increase borrowing volumes in other markets in particular in britain china and even in the russian bond market therefore at least this year there is nothing to fear the inflow of foreign direct investment into the country is also maintained according to the national bank as of april 1 2019 their value amounted to 22 08 billion dollars an increase of 1 3 billion dollars over the year reserves instead of economic growth thus in general the state of the belarusian finance is not of particular concern this is indicated by the growth of the country s foreign exchange reserves to 8 1 billion dollars as of june 1 2019 but there is another problem this prosperity is explained by the tight monetary policy pursued by the national bank and the ministry of finance and this leads to low rates of economic growth in the country in january may the belarusian gdp increased by only 1 and this despite the fact that lukashenka is demanding 4 growth for the whole year lukashenka and the government of belarus are still trying to implement it through the development of exports and not the domestic market god forbid of course although these plans in the conditions of trade and currency wars are unlikely to be realized when the leaders of the country realize this they can decide that the country does not need to accumulate reserves but to develop the economy but in the coming months this is unlikely since the government is still full of enthusiasm and is strenuously promoting exports thus the internal reasons for the collapse of the belarusian ruble are not visible but the import of financial instability from abroad is quite possible there is now a currency war and the real war is brewing if the crisis deepens the belarusian ruble will not be able to remain strong even in the case of failure of the negotiations between belarus and russia regarding further integration trouble may occur on the currency market of the republic of belarus these are the two main factors that could lead to the collapse of our ruble in the coming months and the likelihood that both will work is great in the latest review of the global energy market made by the bank of america s merrill lynch there is an increase in the probability of a decline in oil prices to 40 per barrel unless china and the united states agree and in morgan stanley they calculated that the exchange rate of the russian ruble would fall to 72 5 rubles per dollar in this case the scenario of the last year can be repeated in the belarusian currency market uladzimir

each instance of human trafficking takes a common toll each crime is an affront to the basic ideals of human dignity inflicting grievous harm on individuals as well as on their families and communities yet if it were possible to hold human trafficking up to a light like a prism each facet would reflect a different version of the crime distinct in context but the same in essence together they would show the vast and varied array of methods traffickers use to compel adults and children of all genders education levels nationalities and immigration statuses into service in both licit and illicit sectors traffickers may be family members recruiters employers or strangers who exploit vulnerability and circumstance to coerce victims to engage in commercial sex or deceive them into forced labor they commit these crimes through schemes that take victims hundreds of miles away from their homes or in the same neighborhoods where they were born this multifaceted crime can challenge policy makers the foundational elements of human trafficking are difficult to grasp and the real world instances of this exploitation are even harder to identify importantly how governments address human trafficking depends heavily on the way authorities perceive the crime when officials view trafficking as a crime and have a precise understanding of its core elements they are better equipped to identify and combat it regardless of the particular scheme the trafficker uses over the last two decades the international community has benefited from an improved understanding of and response to human trafficking working together governments ngos international organizations academics communities and survivors of human trafficking have built a more complete picture of human trafficking a picture that rejects a narrow understanding of traffickers and victims in favor of one that encompasses the full range of ways traffickers exploit their victims despite major progress a number of countries still struggle with gaps in their domestic legal responses often because they do not recognize and address human trafficking using the wider view described above in practice this may mean that governments overlook certain forms of human trafficking when the conditions do not meet their narrower presumptions for example authorities may not consider men and boys as victims of sex trafficking due to a common misperception that sex traffickers only exploit women and girls this may also result in governments arresting and prosecuting trafficking victims for the unlawful acts their traffickers compelled them to engage in instead of offering them the support of protective services where this happens anti trafficking interventions are inadequate and the potential for productive criminal justice protection and prevention efforts is threatened this year the tip report introduction takes a deeper dive into one such gap common in many countries around the world whereby governments concentrate on transnational human trafficking cases at the expense of cases taking place within their borders this spotlight is not intended to suggest that transnational human trafficking is not also important or that the many other forms of trafficking that may go unaddressed due to similar oversight are of lesser consequence but rather to call on governments to ensure they are addressing all forms of human trafficking and finding a balanced approach in that vein and in the interest of de emphasizing movement this year s report no longer refers to countries by the nomenclature source transit and destination country the united states considers trafficking in persons human trafficking and modern slavery to be interchangeable umbrella terms that refer to both sex and labor trafficking the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 as amended and the protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons especially women and children supplementing the united nations convention against transnational organized crime describe this compelled service using a number of different terms including involuntary servitude slavery or practices similar to slavery debt bondage and forced labor the national nature of human trafficking prevalence of human trafficking is difficult to measure however a number of international organizations have estimated that traffickers exploit a majority of human trafficking victims without moving them from one country to another for example the ilo estimated that traffickers exploit 77 percent of all victims in the victims countries of residence likewise unodc reported in 2018 that for the first time ever a majority of victims had been identified in their countries of citizenship stating while transnational trafficking networks are still prevalent and must be responded to through international cooperation national justice measures strategies and priorities should acknowledge the increasingly national nature of the trafficking problem the same unodc report also found that the clear majority of traffickers were citizens of the countries where they were convicted it should be noted that these numbers are not uniform across regions or even types of human trafficking for example unodc found that the number of victims identified domestically was high compared to foreign victims in most areas of the world except for western and central europe the middle east and some countries in east asia in addition the ilo found that victims of sex trafficking more likely faced transnational human trafficking while victims of forced labor typically experienced exploitation in their country of residence frequently human trafficking within a country is found in sectors that are common nearly everywhere such as the commercial sex industry and others like farming construction manufacturing and mining the latter are also often referred to as dirty dangerous and difficult and rely on low skilled and vulnerable local labor forces at the same time instances of human trafficking within a country may be more characteristic of that specific country or region such as child domestic work or exploitative sham marriages indeed examples vary greatly traffickers in brazil under the guise of religious mandates exploit brazilian victims in forced labor including on farms and in factories and restaurants after the victims join certain churches or religious cults under the guise of religious mandates exploit brazilian victims in forced labor including on farms and in factories and restaurants after the victims join certain churches or religious cults in cambodia a lack of jobs leads some women and girls to leave their homes in rural areas to try to find work in tourist destination cities in many cases traffickers exploit them in sex trafficking including in massage parlors karaoke bars and beer gardens a lack of jobs leads some women and girls to leave their homes in rural areas to try to find work in tourist destination cities in many cases traffickers exploit them in sex trafficking including in massage parlors karaoke bars and beer gardens in ethiopia traffickers often deceive parents of children living in rural areas into sending their children to major cities to work as domestic workers the traffickers promise families that the children will go to school and receive wages for their work thereby enabling them to send money home traffickers often deceive parents of children living in rural areas into sending their children to major cities to work as domestic workers the traffickers promise families that the children will go to school and receive wages for their work thereby enabling them to send money home in india the government officially abolished bonded labor in 1976 but the system of forced labor still exists for example under one scheme prevalent in granite quarries in india quarry owners offer wage advances or loans with exorbitant interest rates trapping workers in debt bondage in some cases for their entire lives the government officially abolished bonded labor in 1976 but the system of forced labor still exists for example under one scheme prevalent

gangs force british children to carry drugs according to the uk national crime agency data in 2017 the largest group of potential victims referred to the national referral mechanism was uk nationals gangs force british children to carry drugs according to the uk national crime agency data in 2017 the largest group of potential victims referred to the national referral mechanism was uk nationals in the united states traffickers prey upon children in the foster care system recent reports have consistently indicated that a large number of victims of child sex trafficking were at one time in the foster care system traffickers prey upon children in the foster care system recent reports have consistently indicated that a large number of victims of child sex trafficking were at one time in the foster care system in yemen the ongoing conflict has led to many human rights violations with many parties using child soldiers according to a un report there have been 842 verified cases of the recruitment and use of boys as young as 11 years old given the recent global estimates related to the national nature of human trafficking and the various forms it can take all governments must acknowledge and take targeted steps to address human trafficking that takes place within one country without any movement across an international border there may be complicated reasons why a government would fail to address this form of human trafficking it is easier to look outward and call on other governments to act it takes much more resolution and political will for governments to look inward and stop traffickers including their own citizens from exploiting victims who have not crossed an international border governments should also examine the varying political and economic systems that make it easier for traffickers to commit the crime what is clear is that governments have an obligation to address all forms of human trafficking those both with and without a transnational element when governments overlook this reality and ignore human trafficking at home they risk being blinded to and neglecting an often significant crime within their own borders human trafficking defined the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 as amended tvpa defines severe forms of trafficking in persons as sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force fraud or coercion or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age or the recruitment harboring transportation provision or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the use of force fraud or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude peonage debt bondage or slavery a victim need not be physically transported from one location to another for the crime to fall within this definition the palermo protocol and transnationality in 2000 the protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons especially women and children the palermo protocol supplementing the un convention against transnational organized crime untoc marked an important transition into the modern movement against human trafficking over the years the palermo protocol has been the source of much clarification but also some confusion about human trafficking particularly regarding the issue of transnationality it was the first international instrument to define trafficking in persons and provide insight into the many different ways traffickers commit this crime the palermo protocol uses trafficking in persons as an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of offenses such as maintaining someone in forced labor or recruiting someone for compelled commercial sexual exploitation it also provided a much needed foundation on which governments could build policies that criminalize human trafficking and stop traffickers protect victims and prevent victimization and promote cooperation among countries thus three elements are needed to establish the crime of human trafficking under palermo the trafficker s action the means of force fraud or coercion and the purpose of exploitation as of march 31 2019 173 parties ratified the palermo protocol and 168 countries have passed domestic legislation criminalizing human trafficking according to this framework in addition a number of best practices in protection for victims have emerged including the importance of a victim centered and trauma informed approach in both law enforcement and service provision according to the unodc s 2018 global report on trafficking in persons there has been an upward trend in the last decade in the number of victims identified and traffickers convicted globally these data are not uniform across regions and types of human trafficking yet the report suggests an overall positive correlation between the implementation of anti trafficking strategies and increased identification of victims and conviction of traffickers similarly the tip report s data on prosecutions convictions and victim identification are significantly higher now than they were ten years ago when the tip report first began to note an upward global trend it is clear that government efforts stemming from the adoption of the palermo protocol are working many governments deserve credit for their serious efforts to address modern slavery yet much work remains persistent gaps in governments understanding of the issue continue to impede global progress as do stubborn misperceptions about human trafficking and inconsistencies in the implementation of domestic legislation one common misperception generates ongoing confusion that human trafficking requires movement across borders and cannot occur solely within a country s borders a possible explanation for this confusion may stem from the use of the word trafficking in the term trafficking in persons which connotes movement and the fact that the palermo protocol and its parent convention the untoc are intended to foster international cooperation in combating organized crime networks which typically operate transnationally the palermo protocol also calls on parties to meet its objectives through interstate cooperation this context could imply that human trafficking is exclusively transnational requires movement and necessarily is tied to organized crime yet the untoc itself and a number of unodc publications interpreting the palermo protocol make it clear that when drafting domestic legislation governments should consider human trafficking independently of both transnationality and the involvement of an organized criminal group each state party must establish in its domestic law the crime of human trafficking both within and between countries it is important for drafters of legislation to note that the provisions relating to the involvement of transnationality and organized crime do not always apply the trafficking in persons protocol also applies to protection of victims regardless of transnationality or involvement of an organized group the legislative guide for implementation of the palermo protocol another related misunderstanding about human trafficking is that a trafficker must move or transport a victim even though the term trafficking in persons connotes movement no language in the definition requires movement to constitute a trafficking crime indeed the palermo protocol s definition specifically refers to actions by traffickers that do not entail or require any movement such as recruitment which quite often takes place locally harboring in particular has been frequently interpreted to mean the maintenance of an individual in compelled service including by a united nations and council of europe publication that defined harboring as accommodating or housing persons including at their place of exploitation in such cases the three elements clearly are met by the actions of housing or keeping an individual by coercive means for the purpose of exploitation without the trafficker ever moving the person as reflected in their laws most governments recognize this view of human trafficking this is a major success that in just two decades 168 governments have implemented domestic legislation criminalizing all forms of human trafficking whether the crime happens transnationally or nationally that said even upon the adoption of the protocol supporters emphasized that the true challenge would lie in the implementation of the laws in each country under the palermo protocol trafficking in persons is defined as the recruitment transportation transfer harbouring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion of abduction of fraud of deception of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation exploitation shall include at a minimum the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation forced labor or services slavery or practices similar to slavery servitude or the removal of organs fundamentals of implementing the palermo protocol in creating and implementing legislation governments have the power to shape reality legislation that protects all victims and criminalizes all forms of human trafficking including those that take place exclusively within a country s borders gives governments the platform and opportunity to embrace fully their responsibilities under the palermo protocol as noted above the majority of governments around the world already have in place comprehensive laws to address trafficking in persons yet law alone can do little to end human trafficking translating legislation into meaningful action demands dedication focus and resources and requires that those implementing it truly understand both the underlying letter and the spirit of the law governments can and should adopt and implement the promising practices below their value lies in their power not only to help governments better address human trafficking within their borders but also to help combat all manner of misconceptions biases and misunderstandings about what constitutes human trafficking institutionalizing a clear understanding of human trafficking a clear understanding of the underlying exploitative nature of human trafficking and the unique ways it affects a country is a critical foundation on which governments can build a truly comprehensive strategy as noted above the palermo protocol defines human trafficking by its three elements a trafficker s action taken through the means of force fraud or coercion for the purpose of exploitation understanding it as such leaves little room for interpretation based on the incidental attributes of the victim or the trafficker such as gender age nationality legal status or occupation or on other circumstances surrounding the crime such as movement or connection to organized crime messaging from the highest levels of government should be clear and consistent and preclude overly restrictive interpretations of human trafficking or perceptions of its victims governments should make every effort to ensure that those addressing human trafficking both in policy and practice frame the issue correctly to avoid limiting the applicability of anti trafficking laws and protection efforts for example governments should prosecute human trafficking crimes as such and not under other criminal provisions or worse civil laws that may come with weaker or no criminal penalties characterizing an offense as less severe such as penalizing human traffickers for labor violations under employment law instead of charging them for labor trafficking may mean that traffickers are given penalties substantially lower than those prescribed under anti trafficking law limiting their potential deterrent effects in addition governments should encourage or mandate comprehensive training for victim identification especially for those most likely to come into contact with trafficking victims this includes law enforcement officers prosecutors and judicial officials healthcare providers educators child welfare officials labor inspectorates and many others training should be designed to help such stakeholders identify all forms of human trafficking without such an education those best positioned to spot the signs of human trafficking may not be able to identify victims when they encounter them or know the appropriate way to respond institutionalizing a clear understanding of human trafficking may also require governments to invest in research and data collection over the years data collection by national governments has improved substantially but gaps still exist and evidence suggests that anti trafficking efforts lag where less is known about trafficking an evidence driven and unbiased understanding of human trafficking in a country is imperative to the creation of a well balanced and tailored anti trafficking response for example in the netherlands in 2017 the dutch national rapporteur on trafficking in human beings worked with unodc to develop the first reliable estimate of actual number of victims in the netherlands using multiple systems estimation a methodology that helped to find hidden populations of trafficking victims the netherlands found the estimated number of trafficking victims is four to five times higher than the average number of those identified it also found that the most common form of human trafficking in the netherlands 46 is sex trafficking of dutch nationals in the netherlands while the least visible victims in the netherlands are dutch girls the national rapporteur further acknowledged the findings exposed gaps and blind spots in the dutch approach to combating human trafficking and the need to pursue evidence driven policies developing a robust anti trafficking coordination process due to its complexity combating human trafficking requires a multidisciplinary effort for governments this means incorporating the expertise of stakeholders from a range of agencies or ministries that may have a nexus to human trafficking to facilitate an approach that addresses human trafficking regardless of where or how it takes place governments can take steps to ensure that all appropriate authorities understand human trafficking the various ways they may come into contact with victims or perpetrators and the appropriate response when they do cambodia funds an interagency committee the national committee for counter trafficking to coordinate anti trafficking activities and implement its national action plan subsidiary provincial anti trafficking committees coordinate efforts at the local level to mirror the activities of the national action plan with modest central government funds and assistance from ngos with the help of international donors six out of nine of these committees created their own provincial level action plans a working group monitors the efforts of both the interagency committee and its provincial subsidiary committees establishing ongoing coordination can also help to ensure that the appropriate agencies or ministries have the authority to investigate cases of human trafficking for example serbia is consolidating jurisdiction to investigate human trafficking under the criminal police directorate serbia s domestic law enforcement agency previously the border police and foreigners office police split this responsibility which complicated investigations and implied that a human trafficking crime needed a transnational element in addition intra governmental partnerships can be incredibly effective for information sharing and helping governments to expand the number and types of trafficking schemes found in their country for example when considering trafficking crimes in country labor ministries must collaborate and learn from law enforcement to be fully engaged in inspecting local economies and knowing how to alert the appropriate authorities when they identify instances of human trafficking in an effort to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children in japan the tokyo metropolitan assembly passed an ordinance in july 2017 prohibiting girls younger than 18 from working in compensated dating or jk services and requiring such businesses to register their employee rosters with the city authorities identified 114 of these operations nationwide in 2017 and closed 14 for violating the terms of the ordinance courts then initiated prosecution under the labor standards act against the owner of one such establishment for child sex trafficking in greece the anti trafficking unit of the hellenic police unit maintains several teams of officers across greece that investigate human trafficking and other crimes and also conduct joint inspections with labor inspectors and social workers confronting harmful cultural norms and local practices cultural norms and practices play an important role in defining a country or society but human traffickers have also used them to support hide or attempt to justify human trafficking the palermo protocol specifically notes that exceptions cannot be made to the criminalization requirement based on cultural variations it is important that governments examine how traffickers may exploit cultural practices to conduct criminal activity in some cases traffickers may take advantage of religious beliefs to coerce victims into servitude and it is important that governments seek help from and offer support to cultural and religious leaders taking strides to protect their communities from human traffickers for example in nigeria traffickers use fraud to recruit women and girls for jobs in europe and force them into commercial sex when they get there many traffickers force victims to take a juju oath to ensure compliance and threaten death resulting from the juju curse if they break their oath disobey their traffickers and try to leave their exploitative situations in early 2018 the national agency for the prohibition of trafficking in persons and the governor of edo state partnered with the oba of benin the traditional religious leader of the benin kingdom in nigeria to publicize a ceremony where the oba performed a ritual dissolving all previous juju curses performed by traffickers in other cases deeply ingrained practices may make it difficult for governments to see and address human trafficking in their own backyards for example many countries in south asia face the practice of debt bondage a form of human trafficking in which traffickers use debt to force an individual into forced labor pakistan s largest human trafficking problem is bonded labor in which employers use an initial debt to force people to work and trap them and often their family members sometimes for generations although pakistani laws criminalize this form of forced labor enforcement of these laws remains inadequate and many landowners continue to exploit bonded laborers with impunity in addition officials across government should work to challenge stereotypes of a typical victim of human trafficking for example in many cases traffickers force their victims to commit crimes forced criminality takes the form of begging prostitution cannabis cultivation and theft among others an untrained law enforcement officer or benefits adjudicator may not realize an individual is a victim of human trafficking before making an arrest or a decision on available benefits these assumptions can also make victims more reluctant to seek help proactive efforts to recognize and mitigate these assumptions are therefore critical for example in finland the non discrimination ombudsman is the national rapporteur on human trafficking she began a new research project assessing trafficking cases in finland to evaluate how victims access the assistance system the findings of this type of study could serve as an important barometer for how national assumptions and blind spots among law enforcement service providers and society shape a country s response to human trafficking empowering communities to recognize and address human trafficking when the public views trafficking crimes as common local or cultural practices that do not warrant criminal investigation or prosecution it is critically important for governments to raise awareness and foster initiatives for communities to help address it the 2018 tip report covered the issue of supporting community efforts to find local solutions it is worth noting again the value in reinforcing and empowering communities as full partners in the fight against human trafficking public perceptions about human trafficking have a major impact on the way governments address it if well informed about the various forms of human trafficking the public can be the eyes and ears of their communities and can put pressure on law enforcement to make it a priority for example in ghana where forced child labor is prevalent in the fishing industry on lake volta ngos have worked to change community perceptions so that many now view the use of children in fishing as an illegal activity many communities have formed local watchdog groups that know how to identify human trafficking go door to door raising awareness about its harmful effects and report cases to authorities community members are also essential in providing follow on support and reintegration services in addition governments can design public awareness campaigns to target a particular issue and motivate communities to get involved in design these types of campaigns should have clear objectives that promote sound anti trafficking policies for example in benin some traffickers subject children to forced labor in street and market vending recently the beninese government led a public awareness campaign focused on potential exploitation in benin s large open air markers in cotonou porto novo and parakou this community oriented campaign also incorporated an inspection program conducted at the markets and along roads connecting major cities which resulted in the identification of more than 800 potential child trafficking victims in addition governments can design community based approaches to enhance their law enforcement efforts for example across moldova teams of local officials and ngos coordinate victim identification and assistance efforts resulting in an increased number of shelter referrals
finance and philosophy why we re always surprised is a short brilliant book it is meant to be an easy read and it is except that footnotes and actual citations would have been useful instead of naked quotes author alex j pollock is a former major in philosophy banker and ceo of a federal home loan bank congress created cooperatives of local banks and is currently a distinguished senior fellow at the r street institute he knows what he is talking about philosophy of finance and he asks good questions for example what is real in the bubble preceding the great recession of late 2007 to 2009 much of the profit and wealth turned out to be illusory pollock observes the collateral for a mortgage loan is not really the house itself a real thing in a sense but the price of the house which has no objective existence the same goes for liquidity what is it it disappears when a financial bubble such as the increase in house prices that preceded the great recession bursts liquidity is about group behavior and group belief in the solvency of counterparties and the reliability of prices the entities that accounting deals with are not facts but opinions accounting figures are based on subjective estimates of unknowable future events theories about these events and even political influences when accounting standards are decided pollock quotes an expert in accounting theory professor baruch lev despite widely held beliefs that corporate financial statements convey historical objective facts practically every material item on the balance sheet and income statement with the exception of cash is based on subjective estimates about future events one might add that even cash is not a tangible thing it consists of short term liquid financial instruments from currency to bank deposits to treasury bonds whose value can crash because in people s opinions these instruments are worth less than previously thought these are good reasons to distinguish economics from a science like physics which can predict events writes pollock the motions of heavenly bodies and the bubbles and shrivels of financial markets are two different types of reality his emphasis economists or at least macroeconomists are victim to what f a hayek called the pretense of knowledge yet pollock notes even astronomy cannot predict millions of years ahead if as he says economics will never be able to rise to the scientific level of dentistry it is mainly in the realm of control a planner cannot control the economy like a dentist repairs teeth in the mouth of his patient philosopher and historian pollock should squarely admit that at least microeconomics tell us a lot about what will happen given certain circumstances say what will happen to the price of a good if its consumers preferences change this would keep him consistent with hayek and improve his demonstrations crises are unavoidable as pollock explains the main reason why economic and financial crises happen is the same as why economics does not predict as well as physics fundamental uncertainty in the sense of frank knight this is due to the infinite regress of interacting beliefs and actions among individuals everybody s behavior is based on predicting everybody else s prediction of everybody else s behavior a crucial fact emphasized by pollock is that this uncertainty applies to government regulators and central banks too your model works until it doesn t mistakes are thus inevitable they show up in recurring booms and busts as an economic boom persists we forget murphy s law which tells us that whatever can go wrong will go wrong given enough time so all financial systems will crash given enough time the problem is not mainly incentives although they play a role including when government intervention creates moral hazard the far bigger problem is uncertainty lots of banking crises usually the worst form or stage of a financial crisis happen in the 20th century 130 countries experienced one or more banking crises on average 2 6 banking crises happened somewhere in the world every year when a financial crisis strikes the government s dilemma is between doing nothing or creating moral hazard for the future it nearly always does the latter as a result of the great recession and the squeeze of interest rates by the fed pollock estimates that american savers lost 2 4 trillion between 2008 and mid 2017 something similar happened in europe these events were just a repeat of history the value destroyed in a crash must be lost by somebody and interventionist governments decide by whom it is usually taxpayers or savers although equity investors as opposed to lenders and bond holders typically lose something too governments make them worse a crucial point illuminated by finance and philosophy is that regulators and central banks don t know the unknowable future better than do other market participants when a crisis hits their own interventions usually if not typically create the conditions for future crises paul volker the fed chairman under jimmy carter and ronald reagan finally broke the inflation of the 1970s but pollock reminds us this was the inflation the federal reserve itself had created he calls the fed the most dangerous financial institution in the world the most systematically dangerous institution it has a terrible record going back to its foundation because of the slow but regular inflation the central bank generated or accommodated the u s dollar s purchasing power is down to about 10 percent of what it was in 1947 the fed arguably shoulders part of the blame for the increase in the money supply that preceded the housing bubble of the 2000s after its intervention in the crisis that followed the fed now owns 1 7 trillion of mortgage securities and 2 5 trillion of long term treasury bonds the fed s activities constitute an ongoing attempt at central planning and price fixing by committee it is an independent governmental fiefdom of alleged platonic economic guardians pollock persuasively argues that this philosopher king institution should not be independent the fed s independence is a relatively new doctrine born after the inflation of the 1970s was generated by political pressures this inflation in turn generated the savings and loans debacle of the 1980s pollock doesn t squarely deal with the unattractive alternative of a monetary policy run by politicians governments often generate financial crises by defaulting on their debt as pollock notes the problem with a sovereign power is that it may simply decide not to pay as it has agreed the world has known an average of one sovereign debt default every year since 1800 the greek government s default in 2012 was the latest major one several american states defaulted in the 19th century inflation is an indirect way for governments to default on their debt other ways exist in the 4th century bc the tyrant dionysius of syracuse forced his subjects under penalty of death to bring him all their silver coins which he reminted for twice their nominal value for the same silver content he was thus able to keep half their value which he used to repay loans from his subjects in short he did not repay the loans the u s government did something similar in 1933 by reneging on its explicit contractual promise to repay its gold bonds in gold it repaid them in devalued dollars moreover the u s government forced all americans to turn in their gold under threat of criminal punishment just as dionysius did in his day while the government was actively defrauding its lenders its spokesmen lied through their teeth not to say our collective teeth as pollock vividly documents in 1971 the nixon administration abandoned the gold peg on the dollar repudiating the international bretton woods agreement the result of all this was that the fed gained the power to create money ex nihilo which led to permanent government deficits and to the 1970s inflation and contributed to recurring financial crises pollock s demonstration is eloquent don t count on governments including the u s government to foresee or prevent financial crisis growth and cycles recurring crises are also partly due to the fact that individuals die history is forgotten and the new financiers and governmental actors just repeat the errors of their forebears is it possible to keep continuing economic growth which requires entrepreneurship and mistakes without the business cycle pollock thinks the answer is no fundamental uncertainty means that mistakes will be made including by governments but economic growth is worth this cost what should government do pollock argues that it should follow adam smith s non interventionism 90 percent of the time and john maynard keynes s interventionism 10 percent of the time that is during crises the trick pollock recognizes is to discontinue the intervention after the crisis has subsided like cincinnatus who went back to his farm after saving rome this problem the cincinnatian problem is not easy to solve and indeed has shown up once again after the great recession ended in 2009 the government and the fed have still not retreated the current administration even argues for more stimulus anticlimax alas pollock s instructive book ends on an anticlimax first it proposes the creation of a governmental body of systemic risk advisors philosophers non kings as it were who would be schooled in financial history and would be tasked with warning the government and financial actors about systemic risks including risks from government these advisors must never no matter how serious the situation is lie for the greater good pollock partly redeems himself by saying he is not too optimistic that his solution would work but it is worth a try it would however generate more misplaced confidence strangely the author of philosophy and finance does not consider the solution of removing the government from finance and macroeconomic management and letting crises run their course so as to generate the right incentives for future prudence if we cannot avoid uncertainty why compound it with the government s own coercive and fraudulent sort of uncertainty the second aspect of the anti climactic conclusion of philosophy and finance is that beyond the proposal of a body of advisors it offers only moral and philosophical advice bankers and financiers should cultivate the virtues of loyalty integrity and prudence in the last paragraph of his book pollock writes that those of us in any kind of financial responsibility constrained by limits to our knowledge fundamental uncertainty and inevitable mistakes should strive at all times to practice these virtues which demand constant effort by precept and by example i have emphasized the word should assuming that pollock is not proposing a government mandate which would be worse than an anti climax john kay a well known economist and financial times columnist who defends the same virtues and is praised by pollock obviously wants to go further pollock quotes kay the guiding purpose of the legal and regulatory framework should be to impose and enforce the obligations of loyalty and prudence personal and institutional that go with the management of other people s money to have government enforce virtue lol hopefully the more philosophical and prudent pollock does not share kay s political naïveté
home ownership has been called the quintessential american dream yet today less than 65 of american homes are owner occupied and more than 50 of the equity in those homes is owned by the banks compare china where despite facing one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world a whopping 90 of families can afford to own their homes over the last decade american wages have stagnated and u s productivity has consistently been outpaced by china s the u s government has responded by engaging in a trade war and imposing stiff tariffs in order to penalize china for what the white house deems unfair trade practices china s industries are said to be propped up by the state and to have significantly lower labor costs allowing them to dump cheap products on the u s market causing prices to fall and forcing u s companies out of business the message to middle america is that chinese labor costs are low because their workers are being exploited in slave like conditions at poverty level wages but if that s true how is it that the great majority of chinese families own homes according to a march 2016 article in forbes 90 of families in the country own their home giving china one of the highest home ownership rates in the world what s more is that 80 of these homes are owned outright without mortgages or any other liens on top of this north of 20 of urban households own more than one home due to their communist legacy what chinese buyers get for their money is not actually ownership in perpetuity but a long term leasehold and the quality of the construction may be poor but the question posed here is how can chinese families afford the price tag for these homes in a country where the average income is only one seventh that in the united states the misleading disparity between u s and chinese incomes some commentators explain the phenomenon by pointing to cultural differences the chinese are inveterate savers with household savings rates that are more than double those in the u s and they devote as much as 74 of their money to housing under china s earlier one child policy many families had only one heir who tended to be male and home ownership was a requirement to score a wife families would therefore pool their resources to make sure their sole heir was equipped for the competition homes would be purchased either with large down payments or without financing at all financing through banks at compound interest rates doubles the cost of a typical mortgage so sidestepping the banks cuts the cost of housing in half those factors alone however cannot explain the difference in home ownership rates between the two countries the average middle class u s family could not afford to buy a home outright for their oldest heir even if they did pool their money americans would be savers if they could but they have other bills to pay and therein lies a major difference between chinese and american family wealth in china the cost of living is significantly lower the chinese government subsidizes not only its industries but its families with educational medical and transportation subsidies according to a 2017 hsbc fact sheet 70 of chinese millennials ages 19 to 36 already own their own homes american young people cannot afford to buy homes because they are saddled with student debt a millstone that now averages 37 000 per student and will be carried an average of 20 years before it is paid off a recent survey found that 80 of american workers are living paycheck to paycheck another found that 60 of u s millennials could not come up with 500 to cover their tax bills in china by contrast student debt is virtually nonexistent heavy government subsidies have made higher education cheap enough that students can work their way through college with a part time job health care is also subsidized by the government with a state run health insurance program similar to canada s the program doesn t cover everything but medical costs are still substantially lower than in the u s public transportation too is quite affordable in china and it is fast efficient and ubiquitous the disparity in incomes between american and chinese workers is misleading for other reasons the average income includes the very rich along with the poor in the u s the gap between those two classes is greater than in china the oversize incomes at the top pull the average up even worse however is the disparity in debt levels which pulls disposable income down a survey after the 2008 09 credit crisis found that household debt in the u s was 136 of household income compared with only 17 for the chinese another notable difference is that 70 of chinese family wealth comes not from salaries but from home ownership itself under communism all real property was owned by the state when deng xiaoping opened the market to private ownership families had an opportunity to get a home on reasonable terms and as new homes were built they traded up building the family asset base deng s market liberalization also gave families an income boost by allowing them to become entrepreneurs new family owned businesses sprang up aided by affordable loans cheap credit from state owned banks subsidized state affiliated industries as well quantitative easing with chinese characteristics all this was done with the help of china s federal government which in recent decades has pumped massive amounts of economic stimulus into the economy unlike the u s federal reserve s quantitative easing which went straight into big bank reserve accounts the chinese stimulus has generated new money for productive purposes including local business development and infrastructure sometimes called qualitative easing this quantitative easing with chinese characteristics has meant more jobs more gdp and more money available to spend which in turn improves quality of life the chinese government has done this without amassing a crippling federal debt or triggering runaway inflation in the last 20 years its m2 money supply has grown from just over 10 trillion yuan to 80 trillion yuan 11 6t a nearly 800 increase yet the inflation rate of its consumer price index cpi has remained low in february of this year it was just 1 5 in may it rose to 2 7 due to an outbreak of swine fever which drove pork prices up but this was a response to shortages not to an increase in the money supply radically increasing the money supply has not driven consumer prices up because gdp has increased at an even faster rate supply and demand have risen together keeping consumer prices low real estate prices on the other hand have skyrocketed 325 in the last two decades fueled by a chinese shadow banking system that is largely beyond regulatory control pundits warn that china s housing is in an unsustainable bubble that will pop but the chinese housing market is still more stable than the u s subprime market before 2008 with its no doc no down loans chinese buyers typically put 40 to 50 down on their homes and the demand for houses remains high the central bank is also taking steps to cool the market by targeting credit so that it is steered away from real estate and other existing assets and toward newly produced goods and services that central bank intervention illustrates another difference between chinese style qualitative easing and western style qe the people s bank of china is not trying to improve banking sector liquidity so that banks can make more loans chinese economists say they don t need that form of qe china s banks are already lending and the central bank has plenty of room to manipulate interest rates and control the money supply china s central bank is directing credit into the local economy because it doesn t trust the private financial market to allocate credit where local markets need it true to its name the people s bank of china seems actually to be a people s bank geared to serving the economy and the public rather than just the banks themselves time for more qe in early april president trump said in one of his many criticisms of the u s central bank that he thought the fed should be doing more quantitative easing expanding the money supply rather than quantitative tightening shrinking the money supply commentators were left scratching their heads because the official u s unemployment rate is considered to be low but more qe could be a good idea if it were done as chinese style qualitative easing a form of monetary expansion that would allow congress to relieve medical and educational costs grant cheap credit to states to upgrade their roads and mass transit and support local businesses could go a long way toward making american workers competitive with chinese workers unlike the u s government the chinese government supports its workers and its industries rather than penalizing china for that unfair trade practice perhaps the u s government should try doing the same china s legacy is socialist and after opening to international trade it has continued to serve the collective good particularly of its workers meanwhile the u s model has been regressing into feudalism with workers driven into slave like conditions through debt in the 21st century it is time to upgrade our economic model from one of feudal exploitation to a cooperative democracy that recognizes the needs

year to recap the three main differences include removal of all additional tariffs with the agreement the among of additional chinese purchases of us goods have to be realistic and text of the

while the economy contracted by 3 2 in the first three months of 2019 the biggest quarterly slump in a decade on top of that some politicians now want to tinker with the central bank s remit while south africa s largest trading partner china is being dragged deeper into a trade war with the united states there has been a confluence of negative news for south africa recently said bank of america merrill lynch strategist david hauner who reckons the rand is now the most shorted bet against emerging market currency that is largely because it is used as a liquid proxy for the chinese yuan it makes a lot of sense because china is the country s biggest trading partner hauner said noting that south africa s time zone also means the currency is tradable in asia europe and the americas this

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com as alerted in our previous advisories libor the world s most important number is being phased out created almost 50 years ago on august 15 1969 opening day of the woodstock music festival libor began as a floating market determined interest rate for syndicated loans but over time has become the benchmark interest rate for an estimated 350 trillion in outstanding financial arrangements around the world these contracts include public and private loans and bonds consumer financial products such as credit cards mortgages and student loans and some 200 trillion in interest rate derivatives due in large part to concern that the determination of libor formally known as ice libor is based on fewer and fewer interbank transactions and therefore is an increasingly unreliable benchmark for the global financial markets regulators worldwide have been working to develop alternative benchmarks over the past few years the us federal reserve the uk s financial conduct authority fca and other regulators have convened industry led working groups to develop risk free rates rfrs as an alternative to libor with the goal of replacing libor by the end of 2021 in the us the alternative reference rates committee arrc a private industry group convened by the federal reserve board and the new york federal reserve bank to plan the market s transition away from us dollar libor has selected sofr the secured overnight financing rate as the new interest rate benchmark for us dollar denominated transactions in bond and loan markets in the uk sonia the sterling overnight index average has been chosen as the new interest rate benchmark for pound sterling transactions other financial markets including for transactions denominated in euro swiss franc and japanese yen have developed their own risk free rates eonia saron and tonar respectively differences between libor and sofr the transition away from libor by 2021 presents a series of significant challenges to the financial markets for numerous reasons many of the challenges stem from the basic differences between libor and the proposed replacement rates for example sofr first libor is an inter bank unsecured lending rate whereas sofr is based on overnight transactions secured by us treasury securities a rate considered risk free as a result libor is generally higher than sofr often by 20 basis points or more which difference often widens at times of stress in the credit markets therefore a simple switch from libor to sofr without more would mean a lower interest rate so in an existing transaction a transition from libor to sofr would require an upward adjustment referred to as a replacement benchmark spread to ensure that the pre and post amendment rate levels are compatible the negotiation between creditors and borrowers of the amount of the replacement benchmark spread may present a challenge because sofr which is tied to the securities repurchase repo market is at times subject to significant volatility particularly at month quarter and year ends in the us the arrc is expected to recommend a specific methodology for determining the replacement benchmark spread but when amending existing contracts creditors and borrowers will be under no obligation to accept it second while libor is available for various tenors e g one month three month six month etc sofr is currently only available as an overnight rate on the website of the sofr benchmark administrator the federal reserve bank of new york for now the lack of forward looking term sofr makes corporate treasurers reluctant to agree to use sofr in their loan agreements as they cannot predict how the new benchmark will perform while private parties are developing forward sofr curves for different periods the cme group for example currently publishes one month and three month sofr futures it will take time for curves to be developed and then gain widespread market adoption finally given the absence so far of a published forward looking term sofr other methods of calculating sofr are under consideration each with its own challenges for example should sofr be accrued from the beginning of an interest period on a daily overnight basis with the final interest rate for the period only determined at the end of each interest period or should sofr instead be determined for a given interest period by compounding daily sofr for the previous one three or six month period while the first option would better reflect market interest rates during the interest period neither the creditor nor the borrower would have predictability in terms of future interest income expense many corporate treasurers would be informed immediately preceding the payment date how much interest would need to be paid raising operational back and middle office issues both for creditors and borrowers a problem compounded for those non us borrowers required to close a foreign exchange transaction in advance to effect us dollar payments amending existing contracts perhaps the greatest challenge to the transition from libor to sofr will be to amend the contractual terms of existing financings that are due to mature after the libor transition date an estimated 35 trillion of currently outstanding libor linked financial transactions expire after 2021 in comparison the us national debt is 22 trillion the problem is particularly acute if prior to the parties successfully amending the contracts libor itself is no longer published or is otherwise no longer considered a reliable measure of inter bank lending rates concern has been raised about so called zombie libor where libor remains in legacy contracts after the point when it is no longer supported or reported loan documents for libor based loans generally provide a definition of libor with that definition providing certain fallbacks in case libor is no longer determinable based on the method provided in the document generally a designated display page on a reuters or bloomberg rate screen however these fallbacks are particularly for many older agreements generally triggered only when libor is unavailable for example if for some reason libor is not displayed on the designated rate screen on the interest rate determination date but do not consider a scenario where libor no longer exists loan agreements also typically contain provisions that apply an alternate base rate in the event that either a libor cannot be determined b dollar deposits are not being offered in the london interbank market or c libor no longer reflects the lender s cost of funding a loan those alternate base rates are often based on the prime rate the fed funds rate plus a margin or some other agreed upon rate but these alternate rates were added as a short term solution for a temporary disruption not as long term replacements for libor in particular as those rates are often significantly more expensive than libor more recent libor definitions will generally provide a different fallback already contemplating a time when libor no longer exists and industry groups have been working to develop a consistent approach in 2018 the arrc released market consultations on potential fallback language for syndicated loans floating rate notes bilateral loans and securitizations in april 2019 the arrc published its recommendations of fallback language for syndicated loans and floating rate notes based on feedback it received from market participants even so while at least one major bank has adopted the arrc recommendations in whole fallback language is still being developed and it will be difficult for the market to develop adequate language until the uncertainties surrounding sofr are resolved loan modification itself will be a challenge even after market standard fallback language has become more fully developed loan modification negotiations for bilateral loans between lenders and sophisticated borrowers should be relatively straightforward though any discussion of a benchmark spread adjustment may be a challenge especially if negotiated at a time of market stress when libor and sofr diverge more significantly syndicated loans the documentation of which often require the approval of lenders holding 100 of the outstanding loan for any proposed modification of the method for calculating interest will be a greater challenge particularly if there are numerous members of the lending syndicate with different levels of sophistication regarding the market shift from libor to sofr in addition to the obvious libor provisions amendments may also need to be made to provisions regarding break funding make whole and increased costs among other clauses the coordination role of administrative agents will be critical but the greatest challenge will likely be to modify floating rate notes frns that have been widely distributed as generally the approval of noteholders holding 100 of the outstanding notes is required to amend existing terms and conditions affecting interest rates to the extent a libor based frn is held by a significant number of retail investors and the terms of the frn require 100 approval for amendments and have an old style libor definition then liability management exercises such as debt for debt exchange offers should be considered to help mitigate the risk if at least in part new loan agreements prior to libor cessation for new loan agreements being entered into now and using libor as the interest rate benchmark the arrc has proposed two different approaches for making future amendments when libor ceases the amendment approach and the hardwired approach each of these approaches has slight variations when applied to syndicated loans as opposed to bilateral loans generally the amendment approach provides that upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger certain cessation or pre cessation events the lender in the case of a bilateral loan or the borrower and the administrative agent in the case of a syndicated loan will have agreed to amend the loan agreement to replace libor with an alternate benchmark rate which may include term sofr unless the other party or parties to the loan agreement for example a certain percentage of required lenders object in writing within a specified timeframe under the hardwired approach upon the occurrence of a defined libor replacement trigger libor is automatically replaced with term sofr compounded sofr or another alternate benchmark rate determined in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement using an agreed waterfall each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages generally speaking the amendment approach provides the parties with greater flexibility in establishing a rate to replace libor upon the occurrence of a libor replacement trigger however a disadvantage to the amendment approach is that the parties may not be able to agree on a replacement rate when libor replacement is triggered and in that case the existing and inadequate fallbacks will remain in the loan agreement depending on the specific wording of these fallbacks and the then current market the result will either be inadequate unduly expensive or unworkable particularly for loans having longer tenors and will inevitably in some cases lead to litigation at the same time while the hardwired approach has the advantage of not depending upon the parties reaching agreement to a replacement rate in the future at the time a libor replacement trigger occurs the parties do risk agreeing in advance to a replacement rate e g term sofr or compounded sofr that does not currently exist and may never fully develop the arrc s hardwired approach includes a required benchmark spread adjustment based on spread adjustments or adjustment methodologies published by relevant governmental bodies or isda while the amendment approach contemplates that the parties will select a benchmark spread adjustment at the time of the amendment the parties would still need to agree on the amount or the methodology for determining the amount of the adjustment though giving due consideration to certain defined factors given that libor is generally higher than sofr these spread adjustment provisions are important without such provisions borrowers and the lenders will have different incentives in determining whether a libor replacement was actually triggered with borrowers likely preferring an early switch to sofr and lenders preferring a later switch all other things being equal for this reason the arrc spent considerable effort to develop objective and knowable triggers as part of its consultations our recent experience suggests that parties are more comfortable with the amendment approach than with the hardwired approach until more information regarding replacement rates becomes available other considerations the migration away from libor presents other risks to both creditors and borrowers hedging isda is undertaking separate consultations for the derivatives markets and consulted with the market in july 2018 announcing final recommendations at the end of 2018 while isda undertook its consultations before the arrc took its own there is concern that the isda fallbacks and arrc fallbacks may not align generating worries of fallback misalignment between loans notes and their respective interest rate hedges for example unlike the arrc proposal which includes a pre cessation trigger e g a public statement by the regulator for the administrator of libor that libor is no longer representative the current isda proposal does not include pre cessation triggers accordingly loan agreements that include the arrc s pre cessation trigger may result in the replacement of libor before it has ceased to be published while any associated hedges using isda s fallback language would continue to be based on libor until it is officially discontinued another example of potential divergence between the libor replacement proposals applicable to the cash loan and derivatives markets relates to the method of determining replacement benchmark itself isda has announced that it will utilize a compounded replacement rate calculated in arrears as its fallback for derivatives to the extent the loan market adopts a forward looking term sofr or some other methodology for determining the replacement benchmark instead of a compounded sofr in arrears there will be a mismatch between loans and their associated hedges regulation for financial institutions in particular there is increased regulatory focus on ensuring that banks are prepared the fsb financial stability board and iosco the international organisation of securities commissions have been coordinating international efforts for interest rate benchmark reform in recent months the us s federal deposit insurance corporation fdic focused its winter 2018 issue of supervisory insights to the end of libor while the us securities and exchange commission sec has identified it as a disclosure and operational concern for both reporting companies and securities industry participants taxation in the us a number of issues have been raised about the tax impacts of converting existing loans and other financial instruments from libor to a replacement rate for example there is concern that the conversion could result in a determination that there was a material modification of the indebtedness potentially resulting in a taxable exchange a similar concern is raised under fatca where a material modification to an existing financial instrument can cause the issue to be deemed a new issuance jeopardizing the grandfathering exemption from fatca withholding for instruments issued before july 1 2014 this would be a particular concern in the context of an older existing securitization where the documentation establishing the issue likely contains no provisions contemplating fatca withholding on april 8 2019 the arrc sent a letter to the us treasury and the us internal revenue service requesting formal guidance on these and similar us tax issues potential for disputes for many of the reasons discussed above there may be instances where it will be a challenge to incorporate fallback provisions into an existing financial instrument prior to the cessation of libor because of the inability to obtain requisite consent from the relevant constituents absent a statutory or other fix that applies across the different market segments the potential for disputes in these cases is a real concern that should be considered as firms analyze their needs and objectives recommendations both creditors and borrowers should already be preparing for the transition from libor to sofr we would recommend the following first parties should take stock of their libor exposure under existing loans notes and derivatives focusing on transactions maturing after 2021 the definition of libor should be reviewed as well as the provisions for amending the terms and conditions of the regarding modification discussions with counterparties should begin as soon as possible to ensure that counterparties are also aware of the conversion from libor to sofr second parties should review standard documents that are likely to be used for future transactions such as under medium term note mtn commercial paper cp or certificate of deposit cd programs to check whether amendments should be made in contemplation of future issues for example consideration should be given to changing existing program documentation to permit less than 100 approval for amending libor related interest rate provisions reducing the ability of small groups of holdout creditors to block necessary amendments parties should monitor developments in standard libor replacement language and the developments involving potential term sofr and replacement benchmark spread in addition given the concern that both sofr and libor fallbacks may develop in different directions between standard lending securities documentation and standard isda documentation companies should review credit and hedging documents carefully to avoid potentially costly gaps third parties particularly lenders and agents should review their internal systems to understand what adjustments may be required for loan accrual in sofr whichever sofr calculation method is ultimately used by the market back and middle office systems and procedures such as client invoicing will also need to be adapted finally parties again particularly lenders and agents should already begin advising borrowers and issuers that libor is coming to an end preparing them for the changes to come less sophisticated counterparties may need additional time to educate themselves on the upcoming changes to libor and the adoption of sofr final thoughts while 2021 may still seem well in the future the adjustments that market participants will need to make are significant and these adjustments will be undertaken while replacement rates and fallback provisions remain unresolved the time to take stock of your company s exposures and to map a path forward is now one of the last bands to perform at woodstock was blood sweat and tears if the issues raised by the transition to risk free rates remain unresolved by the end of 2021 libor may well end on a similar note the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about

us sanctions against iran mean india is losing out on a key source of cheap oil likely hurting government finances mumbai india across the water from mumbai s main peninsula in an office building that houses the city s transport hub vilas kadam flicks through a thick binder containing the week s fuel bills his fleet of trucks moves steel from the nearby jawaharlal nehru port to sites around the country and the prospect of rising fuel prices is giving him a headache diesel makes up over half of my costs so even a slight increase means i suffer kadam told al jazeera after paying for his drivers accommodation food and truck maintenance there is not much left over competition is fierce among the hundreds of nearby haulage firms and there is no union to collectively set prices says kadam if his fuel costs rise he has to pass some of the increase on to his customers and absorb the rest himself my insurance bill has also been rising so margins are already tight he said no one is getting rich here business owners like kadam are likely to face higher fuel bills following india s decision to stop importing iranian oil a source of cheap crude india s ambassador to the united states harsh shringla confirmed last month that oil imports from iran stopped on may 2 to comply with us sanctions as a waiver exempting india and seven other countries including china and brazil expired the us government has said it wants to bring iranian oil exports down to zero in a move designed to hurt the revolutionary guard the state security agency which the us has designated a terrorist organisation as the world s third largest oil consumer and with 80 percent of its demand met by foreign imports india could be one of the countries hit hardest in the diplomatic crossfire between the us and iran as it is forced to try and find cheaper sources of crude up to 10 percent of india s oil imports came from iran in 2018 valued at 129bn according to data from the centre for monitoring indian economy cmie compiled by care ratings and a spike in oil prices following recent attacks on tankers in the gulf and the shooting down of a us military drone by iranian forces on thursday could also bump up india s energy import bill trade talks are likely to take centre stage during us secretary of state mike pompeo s visit to india next week amid signs of growing tensions between the two countries india recently imposed punitive tariffs on 28 us products including almonds apples and walnuts in retaliation for the trump administration s imposition of tariffs on indian steel and aluminium last year analysts say india should be able to find alternative supplies of oil reasonably easily as the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec could increase production to compensate for a drop in iranian supplies but plugging the gap left by iranian oil will be expensive they say state owned refineries which make up 18 of india s 23 refineries will suffer the most lydia powell head of the centre for resources management at the observer research foundation told al jazeera they will lose the favourable terms that came with iranian oil such as extended credit lines of up to 60 days double the standard 30 day period offered by other suppliers as well as the ability to pay iran in indian rupees following an agreement signed between the two countries in late 2018 rupee payments help strengthen india s currency by reducing the demands on its us dollar reserves rising import bill two leading economists at the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi warn that a larger crude import bill will widen india s current account deficit while government finances are already stretched this could reduce foreign currency reserves and potentially lead to the rupee s depreciation if higher fuel prices ripple through the economy inflation could also rise bringing down consumer spending and hurting economic growth indian consumers have previously been cushioned from market fluctuations new delhi intervened in late 2018 as fuel prices rose the federal government reduced excise duty ordered states to cut taxes and mandated oil marketing companies to absorb higher prices the government could intervene again although this would hurt its finances karthik ganesan a research fellow at the council on energy environment and water ceew told al jazeera at around 28 7bn taxes collected from the sale of petroleum products are among the highest sources of indirect tax revenue for the government he said adding that it will not want to forego this income for too long ganesan says india s new government now has a difficult choice of either keeping the populace on side post elections and steadying fuel prices or allowing them to rise along with market forces many analysts expect it to do the latter estimating a three to five rupee 0 04 to 0 07 increase at petrol pumps in the coming months as the government is forced to find expensive alternatives to iranian oil this could lead to a rise in the price of goods and hit household wallets as heavy fuel consuming businesses like kadam s transport firm pass on higher costs for rajesh lokhande 50 a coconut trader in mumbai s main wholesale vegetable market such increases are part and parcel of his business we re all used to such price hikes and a sudden increase happens all the time after state elections too he said we have to preserve our margins so if it costs us more to transport our goods we automatically price that in lokhande added tara laan an associate at the international institute for sustainable development a think tank told al jazeera that rising oil prices will also escalate the government s substantial liquid petroleum gas lpg subsidy bill valued at 3 2bn in 2018 or four percent of india s trade deficit subsidies may be aimed at helping the poor through a nationwide campaign to distribute cooking gas but currently they are also enjoyed by many better off middle class families keeping consumption levels high the clean energy solution one solution to india s reliance on imported fossil fuels could be renewable energy geopolitical events frequently underscore india s exposure to expensive oil and gas from abroad says the ceew s ganesan each of these shocks set us back he says adding that such events should help galvanise public support for alternatives to fossil fuels india has said it aims to build 175 gigawatts gw of renewable energy capacity by 2022 up from 75gw at the end of last year and its plan is attracting significant support from foreign investors among developing economies india receives the second highest level of investment into renewable energy according to the ceew a lot of pension funds are looking for ethical investment channels and assured returns the observer research foundation s powell said she also says government guarantees add to the allure for foreign investors in the sector but while india s renewable energy capacity is growing registering a 50 percent increase over the past year according to consultancy firm bridge to india analysts say more needs to be done this includes integrating the additional power supply into the existing national grid building large scale battery storage facilities and making rates competitive for businesses gurpreet chugh managing director at icf india a global consulting firm told al jazeera that while relatively cleaner fuel options are available the infrastructure required to deliver them to where they re needed is simply missing though the price of solar and wind generated electricity has fallen significantly as key components like solar panels have become cheaper these benefits have not been translated into greener industries one reason is that electricity distribution companies have been reluctant to implement systems that allow consumers to sell excess power they generate back to the grid which could help expand the adoption of solar rooftop panels chugh explained even if india misses its 2022 renewable energy targets analysts remain optimistic for the future the modi led government has previously signalled that clean energy is a core policy focus recognising its potential for job creation and technology transfer but as india looks to promote greater usage of renewable energy and electric vehicles ganesan warns that it must not let battery imports cripple its finances the way oil imports have over the last few decades

the black comedy of arthur laffer the black comedy of arthur laffer the idea behind the laffer curve is a great satire of the hardworking self image of the american managerial class president donald trump presents the presidential medal of freedom to arthur laffer in the oval office photo by oliver contreras for the washington post via getty images is there a clown of the imperial court more deserving of the accolades of this dark carnival phase of our national history than arthur laffer this week president trump awarded the economist the nation s highest civilian honor the presidential medal of freedom for his reputation as the father of supply side economics the prize is well deserved for a man whose career symbolizes the aspirational anti empirical turn in american macroeconomic management since the reagan administration he successfully peddled an intellectual dodge at the heart of the lay conservative businessman s economics in the united states the idea that left to their own devices employers and the wealthy will invest in good jobs for all as an economist laffer made his name padding the memos of his superiors amid the intra bureaucratic scrambles of the nixon and ford administrations a central debate among economists during the three decades after the second world war was whether government could reduce both unemployment and inflation without federal control of the pricing production and investment decisions of core industrial oligopolies decisions which were jealously guarded by corporate executives as the essence of american freedom by the beginning of the 1970s many leading conservative economists herbert stein chairman of nixon s council of economic advisers cea and arthur burns the chairman of the federal reserve had come to agree with their liberal keynesian counterparts that reducing inflation and maximizing employment could not be reconciled to private discretionary power over pricing by large corporate producers federal deficit spending could produce private sector jobs but it would empower workers to demand higher wages and to raise their consumption spending a redistribution large employers and the wealthy would fight through raising prices and interest rates to protect their incomes this created a political problem since conservatives could not consider bringing corporate executives under public oversight they were confronted with the necessity of defending greater unemployment an implacable taboo in a country with an organized working class enter arthur laffer he was initially brought into government during the nixon administration by george p shultz the first director of the newly established office of management and budget as the agency s chief economist there he defended shultz s unpopular and widely discredited policy position that holding back government expenditures in 1971 while expanding the money supply through lower interest rates could reverse the recession then underway without sparking inflation against the projections of the cea and the federal reserve laffer showed how easy credit would lead to a 1 065 trillion gross national product and reduce the unemployment rate to 4 1 percent without the rampant price increases that had occurred since the economic boom began with the johnson tax cut of 1964 it was a vulgar monetarism that even milton friedman disclaimed herbert stein bemoaned laffer s memo for promulgating the best known gnp number in history pundits described the argument that increases in the money supply could reliably predict increases in gnp as laffer s magical money machine shultz got his way but when unemployment and inflation continued to rise with a presidential election on the way the nixon administration turned in panic to a last ditch unplanned intervention to secure its legitimacy on august 15 1971 nixon declared a national emergency announced a ninety day price freeze and signed an executive order establishing price and wage controls to prevent inflation as it accelerated government spending the controls were widely celebrated even without the rationing that had facilitated controls during the second world war and with a scandalously inadequate administrative bureaucracy they served their purpose unemployment fell while inflation was restrained in 1972 they also put the administration and shultz in particular in the awkward and undesired position of openly planning the national economy so it was not as a technician that laffer made his career but rather in the aftermath of the great inflation that followed the expiration of the controls regime that his style as a movement man worked best his reputation has always been that of the rough visualizer the idea guy for the laity of a broadly defined businessman s movement an organic intellectual for the class of neoconservative washington bureaucrats who took power amid the collapse during the middle 1970s of both the new left in the streets and the new deal order at the ballot box it was over dinner with donald rumsfeld and dick cheney in 1974 that he articulated the idea that would launch his name into the history books the laffer curve as nixon was pardoned for the watergate burglary as cheney and rumsfeld were released from their roles directing the cost of living council rumsfeld to white house chief of staff to president ford and cheney to deputy chief of staff to rumsfeld the problem of growing unemployment and accelerating inflation did not abate how could the republican administration help businessmen to employ people without raising prices without regulating the private fiefdoms of corporate power and without issuing new government debt ford s answer unsatisfactory to all was a one year 5 percent tax increase on corporate and personal incomes raising taxes would reduce spending more important it would raise revenue and close the budget deficit that was so widely understood by both popular monetarists and academic keynesians to be the root cause of inflation laffer responded to ford s tax increase from the right with a simple idea that resolved the long standing intellectual puzzle what if they began to argue cutting taxes actually raised tax revenue if that was the case then taxes on businessmen could be lowered without contributing to the federal budget deficit he sketched a graph on a cocktail napkin for rumsfeld and cheney in that washington restaurant economic activity or spending on one axis and the tax rate on the other revenue increased as taxes were increased but only to a certain point eventually he argued the burden of paying taxes surpassed the benefit of working or investing after that point revenues would fall no matter how much the government raised taxes the liberals wanted growth through greater consumption laffer said it would come through increasing productivity which current taxes were supposedly holding back the problems that had irritated conservatives since the new deal could be forgotten if only enough of them could be persuaded to pretend and to promise against all expertise few renowned civil servants have finessed the art of hand waving as consummately as this as the laffer curve gestated within the developing businessmen s movement of the second half of the 1970s it found incipient expression in congressman jack kemp s arguments that reducing income taxes would produce full employment the idea behind the laffer curve is no doubt as old as civilization wall street journal opinion editor jude wanninski wrote in 1978 it began to seep into the mainstream with the carter administration s cut on capital gains taxes that year before establishing itself as the basis under reagan for the new post social democratic american political economy it also replaced the puzzle of reconciling full employment to private enterprise and price stability with a new political problematic managing the national debt without raising taxes many of laffer s more professionally serious conservative colleagues foresaw this future with anxiety laffer is no longer a very serious scholar university of chicago antitrust economist george stigler told businessweek in 1978 he is playing the role of a propagandist and as such he is performing some service alan greenspan who had served as chairman of president ford s council of economic advisers said he didn t know anyone who seriously believes his argument nevertheless the routine worked under reagan congress reduced the top marginal income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent to 28 percent federal deficit spending more than doubled between 1981 and 1983 the value of the federal debt rose from a third to over half of gdp by the end of reagan s two terms in office unemployment above 5 percent politically intolerable between the 1950s and 1970s became a new normal to assuage bondholders who may have feared the impending collapse of the value of their assets should the federal government prove unable to pay off its debts george h w bush and bill clinton raised top tax rates back to around 39 percent but bondholders are a fickle class as promises to cut taxes continued to win elections congress has repeatedly lowered the top rate and run up the federal deficit under george w bush and donald trump treasury bond prices have continued to rise the result has been a repeat pattern of keynesian deficit spending on bare essentials of the welfare state social security medicaid and medicare for the most part combined with the stimulus of military spending for constant armament and imperial interventions abroad for freeing up corporate budgets from tax obligations to be spent however businesspeople see fit ostensibly altering incentives to work and invest this form of top heavy keynesianism has been justified as a supply side reform but a demand side stimulus of the upper class in the form of freeing up funds for greater speculative purchasing would be a more accurate description inequality is the byproduct business revenues spent on upper management and stock and real estate speculation rather than on working class incomes in the words of historian michael bernstein laffer and the interpretation of the economy he helped to pioneer served to provide a rationale for what became one of the most highly politicized and transparently unfair transformations in national policy in modern memory but laffer s great contribution to american history is as dramatic as it is political his quality as a court jester to nixon and reagan differs from shakespearean theater only in his own obliviousness to the way his ideas skewer the kings he serves the intellectual justification of the laffer curve exposes a contradiction at the heart of the civic minded defense of inequality today that the power and wealth of the ruling class exists to benefit us all to the contrary the laffer curve tells us the wealthy won t contribute to society unless it benefits them privately the idea behind the laffer curve is a great satire of the hardworking self image of the american managerial class the self image of all of those for whom time is ostensibly so valuable that they can refuse to sell it as an explanation for macroeconomic outcomes it offers the timeless and deep seated laziness of wealth stirred from inactivity only by the assurance of its own self aggrandizement those who own wealth rule society we know but laffer tells us they do so only in their own interest for bringing that calvin coolidge catechism of the businessman s government into the mainstream and for persuading the wealthy to say it with a straight face laffer has performed one of the blackest comedies of twentieth century andrew elrod is writing a dissertation about wage and price controls as a form of corporatism

rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a higher opening on thursday with stocks likely to add to the modest gains posted in the previous session the markets may continue to benefit from a positive reaction to the federal reserve s monetary policy announcement on wednesday the fed left interest rates unchanged as widely expected but signaled that the next change in interest rates is likely to be a rate cut while the fed did not provide a specific time frame for lowering rates cme group s fedwatch tool shows the markets are pricing in a rate cut at the next monetary policy meeting in late july the fedwatch tool currently indicates a 63 6 percent chance for a 25 basis point rate cut and a 36 4 percent chance for a 50 basis point rate cut traders are likely to closely watch incoming economic data in the weeks leading up to the meeting for clues about the potential for lower rates stocks showed typical volatility on the heels of the federal reserve s monetary policy

points or 0 3 percent to 2 926 46 the higher close on wall street came after the fed suggested the next move for rates is likely to be lower although buying interest was somewhat subdued amid signs the rate cut could be delayed until next year the fed announced its widely expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged on wednesday with the focus largely on the wording of the accompanying statement the statement said the fed continues to see a sustained economic expansion a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent target as the most likely outcomes but noted uncertainties about this outlook have increased in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures the committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion the fed said the line in the statement mirrors the pledge fed chairman jerome powell made in a speech earlier this month which helped spark expectations of a near term interest rate cut notably the fed also omitted its reference to remaining patient when determining future changes to interest rates the central bank also revealed that its decision to leave rates unchanged was not unanimous with st louis fed president james bullard preferring to lower rates by 25 basis points powell acknowledged in his post meeting press conference that many participants believe that some cut to the fed funds rate would be appropriate in the scenario they see as most likely the fed s dot plot projections show eight members expect rates to be unchanged by the end of the year although a matching number expect at least one rate cut one member expects a rate hike by the end of 2020 nine members expect a rate cut five expect rates to remain

local industries in africa free trade zone decision naija247 business day will africa s free trade area live up to the hype nigeria will consider the interests of its industries in deciding whether to sign up to a 3 trillion africa free trade agreement president muhammadu buhari said in a meeting with local manufacturers on wednesday buhari told leaders of the manufacturers association of nigeria trade body that he was awaiting the findings of a committee set up in october to assess the potential cost and impact if nigeria signed up to the agreement nigeria will be guided by national interest in taking any decision on the agreement establishing the african continental free trade area buhari said in a statement he did not say when a decision would be taken i don t think nigeria has the capacity to effectively supervise and to ensure that our colleagues in au don t allow their countries to be used to dump goods on us to the detriment of our young industries and our capacity to utilise foreign exchange for imported goods double edged tax measures to grow eac local industries east african finance ministers converged on tough taxation measures aimed at protecting local manufacturers from unfair imports competition in their spending plans for the coming year most of the tax measures contained in the budget statements for the 2019 2020 fiscal year were approved during the ministers pre budget consultations in arusha in may higher taxation of imports is aimed at driving consumption of cheaper locally produced goods spurring the growth of manufacturing and creating jobs that ultimately improve living standards proponents of the proposed measures are in line with the eac industrialisation plan that seeks to transform the region into a globally competitive environment friendly and sustainable industrial sector that is capable of significantly improving the living standards of the people by 2032 despite the good intentions experts have warned that these tax measures which are also applicable to goods coming from eac member states could stand in the way of integration as each country becomes inward looking in a bid to build its industrial capacity

address the increasing fiscal deficit currently at 5 6 of the gdp the national treasury has tried to suggest measures that will reduce recurrent expenditures like reducing the increasing government wage bill domestic and foreign travel expenditures but this is unlikely to work the wage bill has increased by an average of ksh 46 billion about 450m over the last six years due to an increase in the number of employees and salaries the government must increase human resource planning and management and implement other recommendations proposed in the comprehensive public expenditure review report like implementing a robust payroll system to prevent leakages and ensure better forecasting in addition to this measures to improve fiscal responsibility should be cascaded to county governments where there s a lack of fiscal discipline and wasteful expenditure is high kenyan manufacturer calls for tax cuts for fair ea competition manufacturing is one of president uhuru kenyatta big four agenda but imposition of excise duty on kenyan products in other east african countries goes against the common external tariffs which make it costly to operate local manufacturers have on several occasions called for tax cuts to ensure a level playing ground with other companies in other eastern african countries rajul malde commercial director of pwani oil company which is one of the biggest manufacturers of edible vegetable oils and fats laundry and toilet soaps in the african continent says cost of production is high in kenya than in tanzania rwanda and uganda we are charged 2 on the

crude edible oil imports the confederation of tanzania industries has lauded the 2019 2020 budget estimates but proposed for zero import duty on crude edible oil and increased import duty of 35 on iron and steel products to protect local industries cti said that maintaining 25 import duty on crude edible oil increases production costs to industries which use the product as raw material hence affecting their competitiveness at internal and external markets cti executive director leodegar tenga said the government should consider zero rating the products to protect local manufacturers crude

democrats including members of congress and the two dozen running for president are struggling to figure out how to effectively run against president trump on trade the president is highly vulnerable on the issue and there is a simple and compelling framework that explains where he has gone wrong and how democrats can repair the damage the way to beat trump on trade is twofold first put workers not multinational profits at the core of the trade debate for decades both parties have written trade deals and tax laws that have benefited international investors and corporate interests rather than workers second forget walls tariffs trade barriers and tweets and explain in concrete granular terms an alternative program that will allow american workers to benefit from globalization of course with his antipathy toward one terrible trade deal after another his inveighing against our trading partners mexico china europe and his pledges to bring back jobs trump pretended to put workers at the heart of his trade agenda and in doing so garnered the support of geographically key voters with an anti globalization message that did not come naturally to most mainstream politicians including virtually all of his republican challengers and his prime opponent hillary clinton advertisement trump s actions show where his true priorities lie his tax bill reveals that corporate profitability remains at the heart of the republican agenda and the notion that any of that largesse will trickle down to people and places hurt by trade has predictably proven false by offering a special global minimum tax rate to u s companies that outsource production a rate that s half that of the new lower corporate rate the tax cut incentivizes more outsourcing of u s production that puts domestic firms and workers at a disadvantage one that has been deepened by the erratic nature of trump s trade policy the tariff threat against mexico being the most recent example and the existing tariffs workers in industries that use imports steel and aluminum have been hurt by the tax on those goods workers in exporting industries such as farmers are hurt by retaliatory tariffs consumers especially lower income consumers who disproportionately buy imports are hurt by tariff induced price increases taxpayers who are also consumers are tapped to bail out farmers in other words so far trump s trade agenda is all pain for no gain advertisement surely all this pain is a political vulnerability for the president his argument of course is that eventually the benefits will outweigh these costs but as the trump tariff policy expands without any clear strategic goal democrats can explain why no one should believe him share this article share one line of attack is that trump s actions have had no impact on the trade deficit which has not changed as a share of gdp in part because trade wars reduce imports and exports another is that location decisions for production are unlikely to be based on short term tariffs especially with such an unpredictable chaotic leader in charge the other key to beating trump on trade is an aggressive economic agenda that most democrats have so far failed to propose or enact as presidential hopeful sen elizabeth warren d mass recently pointed out a forward looking industrial policy wherein the government identifies and supports potentially promising innovations and investments that the private sector tends to underfund offers challengers the chance to distinguish themselves from trump s insular agenda politicians and economists often disparage this idea as the government picking winners advertisement we re already knee deep in winner picking but of a particularly corrupt form through tax breaks doled out to the firms and sectors with the most connected lobbyists and the most generous campaign contributions the finance and pharmaceutical industries are egregious examples instead policymakers need to look around corners to identify areas where the united states can compete globally in emerging areas such as green technology such as energy storage artificial intelligence quantum computing additive manufacturing 3 d printing robotics autonomous vehicles and more instead of erecting random trade barriers the government should help smaller manufacturers link up to global supply chains something china japan germany and canada all do much more than we do next it s pointless to negotiate new trade deals such as nafta 2 0 if we re not enforcing existing rules on traditional trade measures such as subsidies market access fair pricing internationally recognized workers rights consumer protections and environmental standards if the united states devotes adequate resources to enforcement and monitoring ignorance and neglect will not be excuses for inaction advertisement finally although trump complains about the problem of the dollar s value in international markets he has taken no action on it for decades other countries have sought to boost their net exports by intervening in currency markets to keep the dollar overvalued making our exports expensive relative to our imports this is a great deal for outsourcers but a bad deal for both domestic businesses and for american workers there are a variety of ways to push back on such currency practices through negotiation federal intervention to purchase foreign currency assets or by taxing the foreign purchase of assets intended to manipulate exchange rates beating trump on trade requires a totally new mind set workers consumers and the environment must replace multinational profits at the core of our trade strategy the current model invent here outsource production there export back here which still flourishes under trump can be reversed by investing in innovation workers and new linkages to trade flows

vulture hedge funds attack california quick profits for wall street versus safe sustainable affordable energy dozens of hedge funds are now speculating in shares of pg e the huge california utility with several high profile vulture funds demanding seats on the board and fighting for control of the company pg e was plunged into bankruptcy after decades of irresponsible corporate practices led to massive wildfires and billions in new liabilities now hedge funds are circling the company seeking to plunder and profit regardless of the impact on workers and communities the same way they ve attacked schools and students in puerto rico and the same way they ve attacked autoworkers from gm and their families in lordstown ohio and hamtramck michigan hedge funds don t have the best interests of everyday californians in mind they want huge short term profits like they do in every deal some of the most notorious vulture fund billionaires are circling around pg e including dan loeb paul singer and seth klarman this report will provide information showing that hedge fund control of pg e is likely to increase the danger of more fires and more climate crises for california communities hedge fund control of pg e almost certainly will drive up utility rates hitting homeowners renters and small businesses in the pocketbook and hedge fund control of pg e will harm california s efforts to move towards environmental sustainability and a clean energy future due to their predatory profit driven business model it s the latest example of hedge funds using their economic power to force short term payouts that make billionaires richer but hurt regular american workers and communities california should be able to deal with safety affordability and a green energy future without attacks from hedge funds pg e shareholders should block hedge fund control of the company and washington lawmakers should pass legislation to outlaw hedge funds once and for all so they can t attack our communities ever again irresponsibility on wildfires leads to massive liabilities pacific gas electric is california s largest utility with 16 million customers in northern and central california the company has been implicated in a set of a set of wildfires of increasing frequency and severity over the last several years that have razed hundreds of thousands of acres and caused numerous fatalities according to reporting in the new york times five of the 10 most destructive fires in california since 2015 have been linked to pg e s electrical network regulators have found that in many fires pg e violated state law or could have done more to make its equipment safer in 2015 a 70 000 acre fire in the sacramento area was caused by pg e s failure to maintain a tree which fell into its power lines the fire resulted in two deaths over the next three years pg e s lack of attention to maintaining equipment contributed to other fires much larger in scope wildfires in northern california in 2017 that covered 245 000 acres destroyed 8 900 structures and caused 44 deaths the largest wildfire in california s history known as the camp fire caused by a loose live wire that was 25 years past what the company deemed its useful life the camp fire resulted in 86 deaths and nearly 14 000 houses and 4 850 buildings destroyed facing liability for these 2017 and 2018 fires estimated in excess of 30 billion pg e announced in january 2019 that it would file for chapter 11 bankruptcy claiming over 50 billion in debts chapter 11 bankruptcy allows the company to continue operating while it works with creditors to devise a plan to pay its debts a plan that ultimately must be approved by the bankruptcy court bankruptcy as a weapon against consumers and the environment the bankruptcy filing by the largest utility in the most populous state has raised criticism by some shareholders analysts and public advocates who point to pg e s steady flow of income from ratepayers 1 5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand its stated ability to raise significant capital and the long horizon over which wildfire liabilities will come due other critics suggest that pg e is going into bankruptcy to get permission from a bankruptcy court to do things like raise rates for consumers that the california general assembly and the california public utilities commission wouldn t allow loretta lynch who was president of the public utilities commission in 2001 when pg e last filed for bankruptcy told the los angeles times that the latest bankruptcy echoes the last one pg e was sitting in dough the ratepayers were paying and paying all the creditors were happy everybody was a pig at the trough and who paid the california ratepayer why wouldn t you want to try that again they ve created this crisis as part of their corporate strategy predatory hedge funds make everything worse however pg e s 2019 bankruptcy filing could end up far worse for ratepayers and the people of california than the previous one because this time dozens of predatory hedge funds are involved using their billions and status as creditors to push for an outcome that puts the most money in their pockets at the expense of consumers wildfire victims public safety and the environment these hedge funds are using the same playbook they ve used in argentina detroit puerto rico to take advantage of a perceived crisis to extract as much wealth as possible from pg e with little interest in making changes at the company to benefit citizens and shareholders in the long term hedge funds are designed to be complex and opaque and are also lightly regulated meaning that the vulture funds preying on california s largest public utility have been able to do so largely out of sight of the public however this report outlines several ways in which hedge funds are seeking to influence bankruptcy proceedings and the direction of pg e so that creditors can profit as shareholders hedge funds make up fourteen of the top twenty shareholders in pg e and many more own a significant number of shares for a more complete list of hedge fund shareholders see table 1 on page __ as debt investors while ownership of publicly traded debt and other claims against a company are not made public news reports suggest that a group of twenty four investors in pg e s debt called the committee of senior unsecured noteholders includes a number of hedge funds including paul singer s elliott management corp and jay wintrob s oaktree capital management other news reports identify andrew feldstein s bluemountain group and dan loeb s third point as owning significant portions of the utility s debt through insurance claims purchases billionaire hedge fund manager seth klarman of baupost group purchased 1 billion of legal claims in november that an insurer held against pg e this allows his hedge fund to recover wildfire losses against the company as board nominees a number of hedge funds used hostile takeover tactics to get three hedge fund representatives named to the new board of directors slate which will be voted on by shareholders at the pg e annual meeting on june 21 2019 in march 2019 hedge fund investor bluemountain which owns about 11 million shares in pg e announced a 13 member slate to the pg e board bluemountain has publicly criticized the company s bankruptcy filing as unneeded stating that the move would be ultimately harmful to investors in april pg e announced its own slate composed in consultation with and approved by three hedge fund investors abrams capital management knighthead capital management and redwood capital management the proposed slate includes three hedge fund managers with dubious experience in improving safety and compliance at publicly traded companies calling into question their ability to make changes at the company that take into account public safety consumers and the environment governor newsom sounded the alarm regarding potential hedge fund leadership at pg e stating in a letter to pg e ceo i am troubled to learn that pg e is primed to reconstitute its board with hedge fund financiers out of state executives and others with little or no experience in california and inadequate expertise in utility operations regulation and safety with this move pg e would send a clear message that it is prioritizing quick profits for wall street over public safety and reliable and affordable energy service the three hedge fund managers named to the current pg e board slate to be voted on at the annual shareholder meeting on june 21 2019 are dominique mielle a former partner and senior portfolio manager at canyon capital advisors a former partner and senior portfolio manager at kenneth liang senior managing director and head of restructurings at oaktree capital senior managing director and head of restructurings at richard barrera co founder and ceo roystone capital management and former partner redwood capital management it s not a coincidence that a long list of hedge funds have set their sights on pg e according to reporting in the wall street journal iscussions about pg e became a fixture of idea dinners where hedge fund managers discuss companies and markets at these dinners the journal reported any of the funds were betting on possible legislative and regulatory action that could limit pg e s wildfire liability among the tactics that hedge funds are promoting to minimize costs for pg e to maximize the flow of dollars into their own pockets downplaying the costs associated with wildfire liabilities hedge fund bluemountain capital is pressing pg e to appeal judgments for the 2017 2018 wildfire claims dragging their feet on the firm s responsibility for the wildfires according to bluemountain capital partner omar vaishnavi ven when a decision happens against the company in the future the company could appeal that decision which means that these cases could go on for four or five even up to 10 years in some cases also noting that there are multiple avenues to reduce those liabilities from that 30 billion figure to something much lower than that vaishnavi s view likely reflects the hedge fund consensus on pg e hedge fund bluemountain capital is pressing pg e to appeal judgments for the 2017 2018 wildfire claims dragging their feet on the firm s responsibility for the wildfires according to bluemountain capital partner omar vaishnavi ven when a decision happens against the company in the future the company could appeal that decision which means that these cases could go on for four or five even up to 10 years in some cases also noting that there are multiple avenues to reduce those liabilities from that 30 billion figure to something much lower than that vaishnavi s view likely reflects the hedge fund consensus on pg e issuing long term debt to pay off wildfire liabilities in their communications to shareholders bluemountain capital suggested that pg e consider securitization for stranded costs i e spinning out some of the utility s profitable portions and loading up pg e with debt which hardly seem like a good fix as far as ratepayers are concerned this option is the result of recent legal changes allowing utilities to issue such debt starting in 2019 which also created a loophole that failed to protect californians from private equity and hedge fund profiteering while the newly enacted law prevents executive compensation including bonuses from being paid for by ratepayers it fails to prevent share buybacks dividends and recapitalizations from being paid for by ratepayers all of which the hedge funds are likely to push for at pg e to increase their profits pg e has a history of irresponsible corporate behavior and this will only be exacerbated by hedge funds using their status as shareholders creditors and board members to exert control over the company ratepayers elected officials consumer and environmental advocates and investors have all expressed deep concerns about the various ways that hedge funds are attempting to profit from pg e s legal and financial woes predicting that wall street s influence will only make the company more focused on putting money in investors pockets this report will expose the hedge fund actors who are poised to profit handsomely from pg e s bankruptcy and the disastrous consequences hedge fund control of pg e will have for safety ratepayers wildfire victims and survivors and the environment meet the billionaires preying on pg e some of the most notorious hedge fund vultures are using their role as investors to make sure pg e s bankruptcy leads to big profits for their firms at the expense of ratepayers public safety and the environment meet some of the hedge funds putting their billions to work in ways that harm the people of california and communities across the globe andrew feldstein ceo bluemountain capital hedge fund bluemountain capital is one of the top ten institutional shareholders of pg e with over 11 million shares ceo andrew feldstein has a long career in the hedge fund world but is perhaps most famous for betting against jp morgan chase s 6 billion london whale trading loss in 2011 the loss tied to the same type of recklessness and speculation that caused the 2008 financial crisis put consumers and the public at risk but feldstein made an estimated 300 million on his bet bluemountain has publicly criticized the company s bankruptcy filing as unnecessary and detrimental to investors in march 2019 bluemountain announced a 13 member slate of nominees for the pg e board and has laid out several possible avenues for increasing pg e profitability including selling some of the company s profitable portions and loading it up with debt valueact capital whose ceo jeff ubben was vying for nomination to the pg e board under the bluemountain slate was a member of a group named coalition to preserve california business which sought to oppose a seventeen percent tax hike on hedge funds and private equity managers the proposed tax increase on the wealthiest individuals and enterprises in california

distressed debt playbook in the economic crises of detroit greece and argentina paul singer elliott management some hedge funds have built up major positions in pg e s debt and are hoping to coordinate actions as an unofficial creditors committee leading the charge is elliott management a hedge fund run by billionaire republican financier paul singer this archetypal vulture fund has extracted profits from the argentine fiscal crisis the poverty stricken democratic republic of congo and the 2005 bankruptcy of auto parts maker delphi essentially elliott purchases debt of troubled companies or nations at a deep discount and uses the legal system to extract a handsome profit describing elliott management s debt investing strategy in a 2018 profile the new yorker noted that elliott s strategy required a methodical use of the legal system filing suits to obtain payments or a long journey through bankruptcy court where creditors fight over who gets paid back first in their fights with sovereign nations paul singer s activities have been criticized for prioritizing payouts to hedge funds above the human rights of citizens according to a february 2019 report prepared for the human rights council and advisory committee of the united nations high commissioner for human rights singer s actions in argentina where he demanded billions in payouts on defaulted argentine bonds he purchased for 48 7mn argentina s settlement with elliott management may hinder the state in complying with its obligations in the area of economic and social rights thereby also exacerbating

policy prerogatives since trump s election loeb has donated 2 4mn to congressional republicans and republican supporting pacs congressional republicans have frustrated nearly every attempt to address global warming blocking both the formation of a climate change committee and the green new deal jay wintrob oaktree capital management oaktree capital management is one of several investors in pg e s debt technically oaktree is playing both sides of the balance sheet with a reported 1 2mn in pg e stock and 128 8mn in bonds a publicly traded private equity firm oaktree is no stranger to profiting from the public good according to an analysis by good jobs first oaktree subsidiaries have received subsidies worth 22 5mn since 1992 in los angeles oaktree executives have been major supporters of charter school expansion so much so that the alliance to reclaim our schools held a teach in at their los angeles offices during the utla strike oaktree capital whose senior managing director kenneth liang was nominated to the pg e board gave 15 000 to coalition to preserve california business which sought to oppose a seventeen percent tax hike on hedge funds and private equity managers oaktree capital is a puerto rican debt holder and pushed for the island to prioritize paying its hedge fund investors at the expense of residents oaktree capital also profited greatly from the u s foreclosure crisis by buying residential properties and renting them out a 2017 piece in the baltimore sun illustrated how oaktree capital used tactics like aggressive evictions and other tactics to profit from the foreclosure crisis oaktree ceo jay wintrob is on the board of the charter school promoting broad foundation whose 2016 plan to increase the number of los angeles charter schools by 260 was unanimously opposed by the la school board on the grounds that it would significantly harm the school district s finances seth klarman baupost group baupost group run by billionaire seth klarman purchased 1 billion of legal claims in november that an insurer held against pg e the hedge fund also purchased 873 million worth of pg e stock in 2018 as a hedge against the share value klarman is accustomed to being on both sides of a deal in 2014 he made the naming donation to harvard university s conference center while also managing funds for the university s endowment his donation was tax exempt yet his hedge fund collected fees on harvard s invested dollars constituting a conflict of interest at best baupost is also one of the main owners of puerto rico s cofina bond debt investing nearly 1 billion and using shell companies to disguise its involvement recent bankruptcy proceedings suggest that baupost could profit 170 million while puerto ricans must endure higher sales tax and other austerity measures richard barrera roystone capital management barrera ceo and co founder of roystone capital management and former partner redwood capital management is one of three hedge fund managers named to the pg e board barrera s over two decades in the finance industry do not appear to include any experience in improving safety and compliance for troubled companies requisite qualifications for any proposed board member barrera is however a board member of success academy charter schools a nyc based charter school chain that has been criticized for weeding out difficult students and enforcing harsh disciplinary policies on its largely low income black and hispanic student population how californians will get hurt impact on public safety pg e s lack of attention to safety has already been implicated in california wildfires in 2015 2017 and 2018 that caused 132 deaths and destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres yet pg e s excruciatingly poor safety record goes back decades in 1996 the company paid a then record 333 million to settle a suit brought by residents of hinkley california whose groundwater was contaminated with cancer causing chemicals stored by pg e in nearby unlined pits in the 1960s this case made famous in the academy award winning 2000 film erin brockovich did not appear to lead to safer practices by pg e by 2013 the toxic water had reportedly spread to more wells than before the original suit opening pg e to more lawsuits and rendering hinkley a ghost town in 2015 pg e paid a record 1 6 billion fine to the public utilities commission for failing to ensure the safety of its gas transmission lines two years later pg e was convicted on six felony charges and fined 3 million for not complying with gas transmission safety laws and in 2018 the public utilities commission accused pg e of falsifying safety records over a recent five year period stating a cpuc alleges that pg e falsified locate and mark records from 2012 to 2017 specifically the report finds that pg e lacked sufficient staffing to locate and mark natural gas pipelines in compliance with law pressured supervisors and locators to complete the work resulting in pg e staff falsifying data so requests for pipeline locating and marking would not appear as late had common knowledge among its supervisors that locators falsified data and received input from external parties that there were discrepancies in its late locate and mark reporting clearly much of pg e s financial troubles stem from the company s failure to adequately invest in safety measures that would keep its equipment and infrastructure from causing harm and the impact on the people of california has been profound wall street investors in pg e are largely short term focused raising serious concerns that the company will pay even less attention to safety under the helm of hedge fund managers as california governor gavin newsom wrote in a recent public letter to pg e interim cceo john simon the addition of hedge fund managers and others with little safety expertise to the pg e board would send a clear message that it is prioritizing quick profits for wall street over public safety and reliable and affordable energy service impact on ratepayers one very probable outcome of the hedge fund takeover of pg e is that ratepayers will see large increases to their utility bills this was the case with pg e s 2001 bankruptcy which saw the utility placed under bankruptcy court protection for three years with 7bn in costs passed to ratepayers in the 2001 bankruptcy pg e was only 9bn in debt in 2019 the utility company is staring down an estimated 30bn in wildfire related losses and a gaggle of hedge funds is seeking to extract significant profits by taking the company into bankruptcy pg e has created a situation where the bankruptcy court will be obligated to prioritize the interest of pg e s creditors several of whom are hedge funds rather than ratepayers or fire victims thus one very plausible outcome of the pg e bankruptcy is rate increases for consumers the company s 2001 chapter 11 bankruptcy filing left the company under u s bankruptcy court protection for three years according to mindy spatt of the utility reform network basically what ended up happening is that our rates went up to cover pg e s debt with pg e s 7 billion in debt being passed on to ratepayers costing the average consumer 1 300 to 1 700 before filing for bankruptcy pg e asked the public utilities commission for permission to raise rates 6 4 percent the bankruptcy process may make similar or larger rate increases a reality when hedge funds attack lessons from puerto rico a more recent example that should serve as a warning to california is the puerto rico electric power authority prepa which in april reached a deal to settle more than 8 billion in debt like with pg e hedge funds swooped into puerto rico during the island s economic crisis and bought large amounts of debt with the intention of using their wealth and power to extract settlement terms that favored creditors in fact pg e vultures elliott management canyon capital baupost group and oaktree capital management among others are also puerto rican debt holders that pushed for austerity measures on the island where over half of all children live in poverty in order to increase their profits the deal between the financial oversight and management board for puerto rico and prepa bondholders including bluemountain capital and knighthead capital management calls for customers to pay an annual per kilowatt hour charge through 2067 which amounts to puerto ricans paying more than 23 billion over this period effectively rates will increase 13 over the next twelve months with the average residential household paying an extra 130 per year by 2021 and an extra 220 per year by 2043 prepa bondholders however were granted a favorable lien position in the deal ensuring that every ratepayer dollar goes to paying off the debt in addition to astronomical rate increases designed to flow into the pockets of hedge fund vultures the prepa deal is also troubling because it undermines puerto rico s new energy policy crafted in response to power failures resulting from hurricane maria which seeks to create a more decentralized power supply under the prepa agreement even residents and businesses that generate their own electricity for example through environmentally friendly solar panels will have to pay the debt charge in the case of puerto rico s financially troubled utility wall street bondholders literally went so far as to tax the sun in order to maximize their return on investment increased hedge fund control of pg e may also impact ratepayers through tax base erosion pg e is a major franchise fee payer paying municipalities for the right to use publicly owned gas and electric distribution infrastructure it s not unforeseeable that the bankruptcy and subsequent hedge fund takeover could result in the renegotiation of franchise fees as well as more aggressive tax reduction strategies should this happen municipalities will experience a drop in revenues and may have to increase taxes on residents and or cut services to make up for the shortfall sustainability climate pg e has blamed its wildfire costs in part on climate change which scientists say is contributing to bigger and hotter fires in california and across the western united states the company s bankruptcy filing however means that it will be more likely to focus on returning cash to investors than on doing necessary maintenance and taking preventative measures to prevent future wildfires it will also make it less likely that pg e will be able to increase its share of renewable energy sourcing which currently comprises one third of the company s electricity mix this in turn could impact california s goal of being 100 carbon free by 2045 even more troubling many of the hedge fund managers aiming to profit from pg e s bankruptcy proceedings have deep ties to the fossil fuel industry with billions of dollars invested in oil natural gas and coal companies that have had serious safety and environmental violations and prominent positions with dirty energy funded think tanks paul singer of elliott management has about 10 of his fund s holdings invested in the energy sector his dirty energy holdings include hess corporation a fortune 100 crude oil and natural gas company elliott management also owns over 11 million shares in sempra energy a california based energy infrastructure firm in 2015 the largest natural gas leak in u s history took place at a sempra owned natural gas storage field near los angeles causing thousands to evacuate the area for months and costing the company an estimated 1 billion the public utilities commission issued a report finding that sempra had not taken enough measures to prevent leaks causing at least 60 leaks over the last few decades previous reporting by hedge clippers revealed that in 2013 singer s gave 200 000 to the copenhagen consensus center ccc a think tank run by one of the world s most prominent climate change skeptics and fossil fuel advocates between 1998 and 2015 singer and his employees gave over 1 1 million to climate change denying politicians 95 000 came from singer alone paul singer is also a gop megadonor who originally opposed trump s candidacy for president then shortly after his election donated 1 million to the president elect s naugural committee trump who famously denied the role of climate change in the california camp fire suggesting that it was caused by insufficient raking is also attempting to block california s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in march 2019 it was revealed that the conservative manhattan institute chaired by singer was behind trump s unsupported claim that the green new deal would cost 100 trillion dan loeb of third point currently owns over 200 million worth of shares of marathon petroleum corporation which has settled numerous violations with the environmental protection agency over the years residents of the zip code where its southwest detroit facility is located have asthma and cancer rates much higher than the rest of the u s yet marathon petroleum corporation is seeking exemption from a city ordinance that would limit emissions at the plant according to a previous hedge clippers report in 2006 loeb led an activist investor push in 2006 targeting massey energy the largest coal producer in central appalachia led by ceo and infamous coal baron don blankenship who in 2015 was sentenced to a year in prison for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards related to a 2010 mine explosion that killed 29 mineworkers loeb later joined the massey board a position he held for about a year loeb is associated with the american enterprise institute an exxonmobil funded think tank that supports research undermining climate change and a former trustee of the manhattan institute a conservative think tank that often advocates for the fossil fuel industry protect californians and all americans from predatory hedge fund attacks pg e should be run by california environmental energy consumer leaders not wall street hedge funds hedge clippers supports california governor gavin newsom s call for pg e to assure that its directors who have experience as regulators safety experts and clean energy leaders california should impose a carried interest fairness fee on hedge fund and private equity managers to invest in schools jobs and communities the carried interest loophole is among the most costly and wasteful tax loopholes out there it s a massive giveaway to hedge fund and private equity firms that costs federal taxpayers 18 billion each year here s how it works these firms charge their investors fees for managing their money but rather than classifying this as income they deem it carried interest allowing them to pay lower tax rates despite agreement from economists and tax experts across the political system that the carried interest loophole should be closed trump and republicans have refused to touch it instead in the new federal tax law trump and republicans chose to increase the trillions of dollars going to billionaires and corporations while threatening vital investments in housing education and healthcare while the gop controlled washington has failed to act california can reclaim some of that lost revenue it s time for a renewed push on legislation introduced last year to fairly tax carried interest in california it could raise over 1 2 billion a year for schools jobs and community needs across the state hedge funds should be illegal this r eport lays out the amazing amount of damage that hedge fund speculators have done to the environment and the climate through investments in fossil fuels and to workers and communities through deman ds for short term payoffs at the expense of others the hedge clippers campaign has previously issued 66 separate reports that explain how hedge funds have destroyed the economy rigged the political system hurt families and communities exploded inequality and supported the politics of hate and division senator tammy baldwin and other leading progressives have introduced legislation to limit hedge fund wolf packs like those that attacked gm and to crack down on hedge fund abuses but there s a good case to outlaw hedge funds altogether according to journalist and author david dayen hedge funds are an artifact of history an accident created by loophole in the 1940 investment company act it was massively expanded in the 1996 national securities market improvement act when hedge funds got their hands on institutional money from pension funds and endowments they grew 20 fold in the next seven years the entire point of the new deal reforms was to reverse giant pools of money in unregulated vehicles that don t comply with a staggering amount of securities rules legislation that amends the 1940 investment company act to push super speculative hedge fund managers back into limited business lines and the 1996 national securities market improvement act to limit investment from pension funds endowments and other institutional investors could end the hedge funds reign of

had a great jobs report and came out of the last meeting feeling that the economy and our policy was in a good place however news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the interim

to be asking ourselves is are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook here are suggested readings on fomc china media xi trump meeting just the start of new negotiation phase the official china daily newspaper tried to talk down expectations on the upcoming xi trump meeting at g20 an editorial said both parties are in the mood for serious dialogue however the two parties expectations are too divergent to allow conclusion of an agreement it added more likely than not the one on one meeting will end up being the start of a new phase in the negotiations with the two leaders personally setting out their country s respective bottom lines separately chinese premier li keqiang reiterated the promises to open its market for foreign investors and businesses he said

reaffirmed that the central bank is on track for further rate cuts again he said that would be unrealistic to expect that lowering interest rates by ¼ of a percentage point will materially shift the path we look to be on and the most recent data including the gdp and labour market data do not suggest we are making any inroads into the economy s spare capacity therefore it is not unrealistic to expect a further reduction in the cash rate as the board seeks to wind back spare capacity in the economy and deliver inflation outcomes in line with the medium term target though he also emphasized

scrubbed from the pages of glossy coffeetable books the history of u s imperialism can be found in the archives of wall street s oldest largest and most powerful institutions a deep dive into the vaults and ledgers of banking houses such as citigroup inc and j p morgan chase and co reveals a story of capitalism and empire whose narrative is not of morally pure and inspiring economic growth technological innovation market expansion and shareholder accumulation but rather of blood and labor stolen sovereignty and pilfered resources military occupation and monetary control sugar comingles with blood chain gangs cross spur lines and the magical abstractions of finance are found vulgarized in the base manifestations of racial capitalism the caribbean archipelago was ground zero for u s imperial banking this history of bankers and empire is also a caribbean history the caribbean archipelago was ground zero for u s imperial banking wall street s first experiments in internationalism occurred in cuba haiti panama puerto rico the dominican republic and nicaragua often with disastrous results for those countries and colonies and often for the imperial banks themselves yet where there was expansion there was also pushback the internationalization of wall street was met with local resistance refusal and revolt and just as the history of imperialism has been excised from popular narratives so too has this history of caribbean anti imperialism and autonomy the history of imperial banking and racial capitalism begins at the end of the nineteenth century at the historical horizon where the project of u s settler colonialism that spurred the financing of the west became the enterprise of u s territorial colonialism in the caribbean and asia buoyed by unprecedented wealth and boosted by the expansionist jingoism following the victory over spain in the caribbean and the pacific new york city s bankers and merchants believed that the organization of an imperial banking system one that could compete with europe s long established institutions was critical to the global rise of the city and to the consolidation of wall street s position in international ﬁnance trade and commerce with these ambitions bankers and business people set their sights on asserting control over the trade and ﬁnance of the americas they sought to control local central banks establish u s branch banks take over commodity financing reorganize monetary systems on a dollar basis and refinance european funded sovereign debt this project of internationalization was explicitly encouraged and supported by the u s government the war and state departments required ﬁscal agencies to support the infrastructure of u s colonialism and ﬁnancial institutions were an important conduit of colonial policy and ﬁnancial and commercial diplomacy bankers however needed little prodding to move overseas extending their inﬂuence into the sugar plantations railroads and financial systems of haiti cuba santo domingo and nicaragua the u s state made both implicit and explicit assurances that it would intervene should local conditions turn against u s business interests or disrupt the payments of interest or customs revenue founded in 1812 city bank the precursor to today s citigroup emerged as the largest and most important imperial ﬁnancier in the united states at the center of this story was the national city bank of new york the precursor to today s citigroup inc founded in 1812 it emerged as the largest and most important imperial ﬁnancier in the united states through most of the nineteenth century it was a powerful but staid merchant bank whose cautious lending and massive cash reserves helped it ride the nation s economic roils it took on a more aggressive entrepreneurial and activist strategy for expansion and growth under james stillman and frank a vanderlip who carried it into the twentieth century stillman and vanderlip transformed city bank from a merchant bank into a modern financial department store creating a new managerial structure expanding into new financial markets and exploring the possibilities of foreign expansion and international banking the most important theater of internationalization was the american mediterranean as one city banker described the countries and colonies ringing the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico there the bank experimented with the issuance of sovereign debt the ﬁnancing of international trade the funding of industrial infrastructure and the organization of regional state banks and currency systems beginning in 1914 it also made the caribbean the centerpiece of the largest foreign branch bank system of any u s banking house with cuba the jewel in its crown law was critical to city bank s internationalization and expansion as part of its efforts city bank hammered away at the banking regulations shackling its activities and pushed for regulatory reform while creating new subsidiary organizations that could navigate the complex regulatory geographies of international finance or simply evade existing legal constraint wall street lawyer john sterling of shearman and sterling worked closely with stillman and vanderlip while other firms worked to devise the colonial methods by which the imperial banks operated race was central to city bank s work too in its encounters with the nations and colonies of the caribbean and latin america wall street helped reorder those economies along racial lines exporting the u s racist imaginaries in which wall street was embedded and through which it functioned when conducting business in the caribbean u s bankers understood people of color whether africans or indigenous peoples through the same racist lenses they viewed them through at home white representations of african americans in particular were exported to the west indies and inscribed in a vast and diffuse archive of pamphlets reports circulars press releases prospectuses and journal articles produced by wall street about the caribbean and latin america at the same time in their dispatches back to the united states bankers translated the caribbean to u s businesspeople investors and the general public in some cases they debunked stereotypes as a means to encourage investment in others they replicated and reconstituted racial stereotypes in order to further the expansion of white supremacist control of the region with returns to investment found not in the extraction of capital values but in the ledger of white racial dominance wall street helped reorder the economies of the caribbean and latin america along racial lines one example of this practice can be found in city bank vice president john h allen one of the new slate of managers and vice presidents appointed by vanderlip as part of the bank s modernization of its bureaucracy allen aided the bank s expansion into cuba and argentina and was the manager of the city bank controlled banque nationale de la république d haiti in the 1910s in the city bank s foreign trade journal the americas allen evoked a picture of haiti that would have been recognizable to white u s audiences but for its tropical setting cock ﬁghting and card playing allen asserted are the national pastimes and these together with a supply of haitian rum are all that is necessary for a haitian citizen s perfect day he claimed that during his visits to haiti he found that humorous incidents were of almost daily occurrences for allen such incidents showed the naivete and also the restricted mentality of the people which latter was plainly noticeable even among the more highly educated these anecdotes did not exist in a vacuum they were not an incidental cultural membrane stretched over the inner workings of banking racial capitalism and imperialism instead they contributed to the fundamental ideological and cultural rationales that made the caribbean the target of wall street s imperial aims and at the same time helped fashion the terms through which the caribbean was encountered these representations were underwritten by both direct and indirect forms of violence by coercive diplomacy military force and labor impressment as well as by the terms and conditions of credit and debt the imbalanced application of law and legal regulation and the imposition of modern forms of post emancipation ﬁnancial governance indeed allen himself was deeply involved with the decision to send u s marines to haiti in 1915 in what would become a nineteen year military occupation city bank had been interested in haitian investments since about 1910 and vanderlip sought to use some initial railway and dock investments as a springboard to control the republic s financial system haiti s internal political conflicts fueled in part by outside agitation and interference from both u s and european speculators created disastrous terms for business in response city bank s roger l farnham who viewed the haitian people as nothing but grown up children who required the paternalistic guidance of a stronger power drafted a document arguing for u s military intervention to stabilize the country and protect u s financial and commercial interests the farnham plan as it was dubbed was realized in 1915 when marines landed to restore order following the assassination of haitian president vilbrun guillaume sam the occupation provided the platform for city bank s takeover of the banque nationale while making city bank s imposition of a 30 million loan to the haitian government almost risk free vanderlip described haiti as a small but profitable piece of business for city bank but such profits came at a cost the suppression of a series of peasant insurgencies that left thousands of haitians dead and dozens of villages burned hundreds of haitians were jailed or forced to work on chain gangs serving as a reminder to many haitians of the days of slavery city bank was not the only u s ﬁnancial institution charting an imperial turn it was joined by its neighbors on wall street sometimes as collaborators involved in a collective project to consolidate the ﬁnancial realms of the u s imperium sometimes as rivals embroiled in bitter competition chase manhattan bank for instance made an aggressive push to displace city bank in panama while fighting city bank for pride of place in the financing of the dictatorship of gerardo machado y morales in cuba meanwhile wall street s unincorporated and private investment banks including j p morgan and co speyer and co and kuhn loeb and co began ﬂoating the public debt of caribbean latin american and asian countries states and municipalities and ﬁnancing railroad and port projects these private bankers had initially grown in prominence by using their strong european networks and their close family ties as the conduit to market u s government bonds and corporate securities across the atlantic now increasingly they sold caribbean and latin american debt in the united states the domestic crisis of ﬁnance capitalism in the united states became a crisis of racial capitalism in the caribbean private bankers came to play an important role in the policy of dollar diplomacy initiated by president william howard taft and his secretary of state philander knox in the 1910s in the attempt to displace european inﬂuence and extend u s capitalism in the caribbean which purported to replace military intervention with ﬁnancial diplomacy private bankers worked with ﬁnancial experts and local governments to refund sovereign debt reorganize customs collection and currency systems and organize nominally national government banks the disordered global ﬁnancial and economic conditions unleashed by world war i accelerated the internationalization of wall street and intensiﬁed the relationship between banking bankers and imperialism but the expansion and this initial experiment in imperial banking was short lived the sharp economic crisis following the postwar commodity boom forced a brief retreat from internationalization prompting many wall street institutions including city bank to rethink their strategies for expansion meanwhile the local banking sector in cuba was completely destroyed of course by the end of the 1920s another crisis had occurred the concussions of the october 1929 stock market crash were felt not only domestically but throughout the international branch and subsidiary networks of wall street perhaps most acutely in the caribbean the domestic crisis of ﬁnance capitalism in the united states became a crisis of racial capitalism in the caribbean as wall street s financial edifice imploded so too did the racial bolsters on which it was constructed a wave of anti imperialist and anti wall street sentiment rose across the caribbean manifested in the withdrawal of funds from foreign banks editorials in local newspapers attacking the monopoly presence worker takeover of foreign controlled sugar mills bombings of bank buildings calls for the nationalization or indigenization of foreign owned banks and in the case of cuba calls for the renunciation of foreign debt these assertions of sovereignty were not only a claim for economic independence they were also a rejection of the governing tropes of racial paternalism moreover the rejection of ﬁnance capitalism and imperial banking served as a rejection of white supremacy and the obliteration of the circular logic associating whites with wealth and wealth with whites the desire to break the hold and allure of city bank and other u s banking and investment firms meant a challenge to the divine laws of racial capitalism in these calls for the nationalization or indigenization of state banking and in the cries to default on sovereign debt was a refusal to be governed through the implicitly hierarchal and implicitly racialized international orders that had subordinated these countries to the united states it was also an effort to critique the registers of proﬁtmaking and accumulation through which the caribbean labor that produced products especially sugar was obscured shrouded and hidden in the commodity form itself the radical journalist carleton beals captured this process in the crime of cuba 1933 his account of u s ﬁnance capital of chase bank and city bank and the machado dictatorship early in the book in his discussion of the racialized political economy of sugar beals evokes karl marx s description of the commodity as a social hieroglyphic whose meaning is only revealed through exegetical means for most americans cuba is but the hieroglyphic of a ticker beals writes amer sugar 26 5 8 cub amer sugar 17 1 7 cub am pfd 18 1 5 he goes further unpacking or deciphering the meaning of sugar as the story of the capture of black labor power but for me beals writes all this inner mystery is forever imprisoned in each cube of white sugar i drop into my morning coffee black cuba and black sweat and black song and dance crystallized into a snow cube held in silver prongs the caribbean s rejection of ﬁnance capitalism and imperial banking served as a rejection of white supremacy often such critiques occurred under the guises of the communist party and the comintern especially through their efforts to build a global movement of radical black labor the literature and propaganda of black communists at this time linked racial or what was called national oppression of black workers to ﬁnance capital and imperialism the pages of the negro worker for instance contained denunciations of city bank s involvement in haiti alongside accounts of black labor exploitation and colonial oppression across the african diaspora the magazine was published under the auspices of the international trade union s committee of negro workers a branch of the red international labour union and an appendage of the comintern tasked with mobilizing black labor in worldwide class struggle against global capitalism the paper s one time editor george padmore also cataloged global conditions of black exploitation in his life and struggles of negro toilers published in 1931 padmore was a young black trinidadian functionary for the communist party s negro wing and a proliﬁc writer life and struggles of negro toilers presents a sweeping comparative account of the conditions suffered by black people in africa and the african diaspora and includes attacks on early twentieth century u s expansionism overseas and with it the transformation of haiti and the dominican republic and liberia and abyssinia into colonies of u s ﬁnance capital padmore assails city bank s imposition of debt on the dominican republic and the transformation of haiti into an american slave colony during the u s occupation he lambasts the black ivory trade the conscription of haitian workers to the cuban plantations of the general sugar company and the united fruit company he argues that haitians were brought to the country in the same ways as chattel slaves of former days haitians were underpaid indebted to their contractors and housed in segregated and unsanitary barracoons in padmore s writing ﬁnance capitalism was racial capitalism similar critiques were implicit in jacques roumain s novel masters of the dew 1941 the founder of the haitian communist party roumain was jailed during the waning days of the u s occupation masters of the dew centers on a haitian bracero who returns to his country from cuba and attempts to rebuild haiti through collective labor and a call for black autonomy for roumain the collective pull of the coumbite farmers cooperative replaces the coercive push of the corvée forced labor gang at the same time u s banking and corporate interests became the subject of a radical anti imperialist caribbean literature a literature that can be viewed as a counterpoint to the rhetoric of city bank and attempts by wall street to visualize the caribbean to borrow allen s term for the purposes of exploitation and accumulation cuban poet nicolás guillén s west indies ltd 1934 for instance satirically attacks the corporate transformation of the caribbean into the grotesque headquarters of companies and trusts in nicaraguan novelist s hernán robleto s los estrangulados 1933 the brown brothers and j w seligman controlled banco nacional de nicaragua and the mercantile bank of the americas compañía mercantil de ultramar feature as dominant and domineering institutions undermining the economic independence of the nicaraguan elite through its loaning practices langston hughes wrote of the role of city bank not only in haiti but also in cuba he evokes the transitions from mercantilism to imperialism and colonialism to neocolonialism in cuba s history and offers a glum assessment of the ability of the little fort of san lazaro standing sentinel at the entrance to havana s harbor facing the caribbean sea and the united states to repel the pillaging of ﬁnance capitalism but now writes hughes against a pirate called the national city bank what can you do alone pushback against racial capitalism did not occur only under the auspices of the communist party caribbean intellectuals also turned inward to seek out an autochthonous anti imperial critique that was the precursor to the philosophy of négritude this phenomenon was perhaps most pronounced in haiti for the haitian elite the utter humiliation of the u s occupation forced them to rethink their identities their longstanding identiﬁcations with france and european enlightenment thought and culture proved an absurdity in the face of the brutal racism of the u s occupation many among them realized they were suffering from what jean price mars called a collective bovarism a deluded and misrecognized sense of self the haitian elite slowly realized that europe was not their home africa was price mars s ainsi parla l oncle an ethnological exploration of the culture and folklore of the haitian peasantry and its african origins published in port au prince in 1927 helped spur the development of insurgent literary and national cultures in the caribbean and throughout the african diaspora cuba turned to blackness as an alternative to racial capitalism in cuba this turn to blackness as an alternative to racial capitalism took on multiple and contradictory forms in the early 1920s writers such as jesús masdeu in la raza triste 1924 depicted the black workers in the cuban sugar mills in sentimental romantic and often paternal tones the racial paternalism began to slip away in la danza de los millones 1923 venezuelan expatriate rafael antonio cisneros s experimental novel with its efforts at narrating the effects of the banking crisis of 1920 21 on his black characters in la zafra 1926 a collection of combat poems cuba s agustín acosta recounted the effects of the sugar boom and bust on the country linking ﬁnance capital to racial capitalism and sugar to blackness money and the poison of u s empire acosta made this explicit in the poem la danza de los millones it evokes the incursion of the instruments and techniques of u s ﬁnance capital into the cuban economy portraying it as a turbulent sea threatening to capsize the ship of cuba s sovereignty acosta warned of wall street with its usurious bankers in the novel écue yamba ó written by a young alejo carpentier while in machado s prison in 1927 blackness was rendered as the soul of cuban culture and an african alterity became the terms of a critique of imperialism and white ﬁnance el bongo carpentier wrote antídoto de wall street the antidote to wall street did not prove to be a cure certainly changes occurred and the crises of the 1930s forced wall street to rethink the organization of ﬁnance capital and the project of internationalization in a new era of governance regulation and sovereignty in haiti city bank sold the banque nationale to the haitian government but kept its management structure and its ties to wall street in place in the dominican republic city bank s branches became the basis for a national banking system but u s capital still dominated the country in cuba attempts to renounce chase bank s debts and default on amortization payments were stalled by the cuban courts and it would take another three decades before wall street was finally expelled from the country meanwhile city bank and chase bank would spend the next decades struggling to return to the heady days of unregulated expansion and unbounded freedom that characterized the early twentieth century history of imperial banking writing anew the caribbean ledger of finance and racial capitalism note this essay is adapted and reprinted

mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others he tweeted later he added german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states how currency wars are like real wars for wealth quicktake it was not the first time trump has blamed currency manipulation overseas for a strong dollar that raises the cost of u s exports he has already become unique among recent american presidents in a shift away from the strong dollar policy of his predecessors by targeting draghi directly and responding in real time to an overseas central bankers policy pronouncement trump was dialing up the heat just as his own federal reserve was gathering in washington to decide on rates in a decision expected wednesday coming just days ahead of a summit with other group of 20 leaders in japan the salvo served to highlight his administration s increasingly aggressive currency policies and the place he sees for them in his trade arsenal they are preparing the ground they are laying out the potential tools they may have at their disposal said cesar rojas global economist at citigroup global markets inc though he added we re not at a currency war just yet german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 18 2019 finance ministers and central bankers this month agreed that a currency war a tit for tat push at times of slow economic growth to actively weaken foreign exchange rates in order to boost exports is in no one s interest they reaffirmed commitments made in march 2018 to refrain from competitive devaluations fed seen signaling cut by losing patience decision day guide last month the u s treasury increased the number of economies it scrutinizes to 21 from 12 and expanded its watch list from four to nine adding countries such as ireland italy and singapore under new tougher criteria it again refrained from labeling china a manipulator the commerce department on may 23 proposed allowing u s companies to seek trade sanctionsagainst goods from countries with undervalued currencies though it said it did not intend to target independent central banks or their monetary policy decisions the administration has also been pushing to include currency provisions carrying the threat of sanctions in new u s trade agreements there are plenty of economists who argue the u s should take a more forceful approach to addressing currency manipulation by trading partners some have even called for a 21st century plaza accord the 1980s agreement that saw countries including japan agree to engineer a devaluation of the dollar under pressure from the reagan administration top priority in a paper released this week brad setser a former u s treasury official now at the council on foreign relations argued that countering currency intervention by foreign governments should be a top priority of u s international economic policy if nothing else other countries manipulation hurts the u s s ability to use exports to recover following economic downturns he wrote why weaker yuan risks inflaming u s china trade war quicktake in an interview on tuesday however setser said that trump s ecb intervention was misplaced largely because draghi s comments were aimed at domestic conditions donald trump on june 18 photographer marco bello bloomberg most of the world recognizes that the ecb has failed to meet its inflation target and that with a slowing european economy there is pressure on the ecb to ease policy he said worse trump s intervention could be seen as its own form of market manipulation setser said and feeds into a building narrative in europe that the u s is a rogue actor under a rogue president trump has defied convention in a number of other ways including his repeated criticisms of federal reserve chairman jerome powell for raising interest rates he asked white house lawyers earlier this year to explore his options for removing powell as chairman trump asked white house lawyers for options on removing powell joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and another advocate of stronger u s currency policy said the world was in an uneasy peace over currencies with china and other g 20 countries having in recent years accepted a u s push to refrain from competitive devaluations in a june 6 note gagnon and a co author said interventions by countries to weaken their currencies to affect their trade balance fell in 2018 to the lowest level since 2001 but the g 20 commitments are weak and if there s a global downturn a global recession countries would be very tempted to violate these terms and try to claim special circumstances he said there s really no regime in place to sanction them or hit them except the u s might do something trump may have some legitimate reasons to grumble the big mac approach to gauging currency valuations shows the euro is about 15 too cheap since trump launched his trade wars china s yuan has also fallen against the dollar prompting the president to complain that it was undermining the impact of his tariffs and his efforts to raise pressure on beijing those currency moves are widely seen as related to the weakening of the european and chinese economies and a global economy that is looking increasingly fragile thanks in part to trump s trade wars the fear however is that trump s anger over the currency shifts could also help fuel further trade actions including tariffs he has threatened to impose on imported cars and parts from the eu but put on hold for 180 days a drop below 1 10 for the euro dollar rate could inflame trump s temper and make him more likely to impose those auto tariffs according to jens nordvig the founder of exante data llc the rate fell as low as 1 1181 on tuesday after draghi said additional stimulus may be needed and trump levied his latest twitter missive

the new zealand dollar is facing steep losses against pound sterling and u s dollar major bank says image adobe stock nzd lifted by fed interest rate retreat gdp data but lags other g10 s retreat occurs as the nzd become less sensitive to rate differentials but hsbc sees nzd usd falling to four year lows before 2019 is over forecasts pound to kiwi rate will rise a staggering 14 5 by december the new zealand dollar rose sharply against the u s dollar pound sterling and japanese yen thursday after the federal reserve admitted it might cut american interest rates before the year is out but analysts at hsbc say steep losses are lurking just around the corner for the kiwi currency america s dollar slumped across the board thursday in response to the latest monetary policy guidance from the federal reserve which strongly suggested the central bank could cut its interest rate over the coming months vindicating some analysts for having bet against the u s greenback this enabled the kiwi dollar to rise against its u s counterpart during morning trading although the antipodean unit also advanced against a pound sterling that lagged all of its developed world rivals other than the once mighty greenback during the session above new zealand dollar performance vs g10 rivals thursday source pound sterling live nzd usd has risen about 45 pips to 0 6574 since the dovish fomc statement and nz q1 19 gdp lifted 0 6 qtr 2 5 yr on face value nz gdp growth was stronger than the rbnz s 0 4 qtr forecast as a result the 0 6 outturn reduces the risk of a rbnz cash rate cut as soon as 26 june however the details were muted says kim mundy at commonwealth bank of australia new zealand s dollar was aided in its upward climb by gdp growth data that showed the economy continuing to expand during the first quarter at the same pace it did in the final months of 2018 gdp grew by 0 6 in both quarters in line with market expectations construction and mining activity were the main drivers of growth in the new year while growth in the all important services industry softened to just 0 2 and output from the primary production industries continued to fall declining 0 7 last quarter above new zealand gdp growth at quarterly and annual intervals source statistics new zealand the details suggest activity is softening in new zealand s most important industries and this is after the headline number showed the economy growing at the same reduced quarterly pace seen in late 2018 when other advanced economies like that of the u s uk and even the eurozone all saw a pickup in the three months to end of march given the soft nz q1 gdp details ongoing subdued nz business confidence and the deterioration in global economic conditions another rate cut by the rbnz is likely our asb colleagues expect the rbnz to cut the cash rate by 25bp to 1 25 in august mundy warns the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz cut its cash rate to a record low of 1 5 in may citing below target inflation and a souring economic outlook that dashed hopes of seeing inflation rise above the midpoint of the 1 to 3 target above pound to new zealand dollar rate shown at weekly intervals the nzd usd rate was quoted 0 56 higher at 0 6590 thursday but is down 1 7 for 2019 while the pound to new zealand dollar rate was down 0 26 at 1 9255 on the day but is up 1 6 this year however those performances could soon go into reverse if forecasts from some analysts are anything to go by new zealand s dollar is forecast by hsbc one of the world s largest banks and a significant foreign exchange dealer to fall to a four year low against its u s rival before the year is out while the pound to kiwi rate is expected to rise a staggering 14 5 before the curtain closes on 2019 above nzd usd rate shown at weekly intervals aud usd and nzd usd were dragged lower by relative interest rates for most of 2018 as a strong us economy allowed the fed to deliver tightening while antipodean central banks watched on says dominic bunning a strategist at hsbc wednesday s gdp growth figure was above the 0 4 forecast of the reserve bank for the opening quarter but this has done little to improve the outlook for the kiwi because financial markets still see the rbnz being forced to cut its interest rate again over the coming months pricing in the overnight index swap market implied on thursday that a further two rbnz cuts to the cash rate are likely before the year is out the market implied cash rate for november 13 the date of the rbnz s final meeting of the year was just 1 07 that s nearly two 25 basis point rate cuts below the new record low of 1 5 the recent outsized declines in us interest rates have not been mirrored by a rise in the aud or nzd with the sensitivity to interest rate differentials seemingly breaking down we see good reasons why this can persist and why it does not signal that either currency is cheap bunning adds above difference between nz and u s forward rates correlation with nzd usd source hsbc changes in rates are only normally made in response to movements in inflation which is sensitive to economic growth but impact currencies because of the influence they have on capital flows and their allure for short term speculators capital flows tend to move in the direction of the most advantageous or improving returns with a threat of lower rates normally seeing investors driven out of and deterred away from a currency rising rates have the opposite effect new zealand s currency was hurt last year as the u s federal reserve raised its interest rate four times while investors bet the rbnz would eventually reduce borrowing costs for kiwis u s interest rates went from being 0 25 lower than those in new zealand to 0 75 higher last year but even though the fed is on the verge of cutting its own cash rate and yield differentials in the bond market are less disadvantageous the kiwi currency is yet to meaningfully recover hsbc s bunning has an explanation for this interest rate differentials tend to be useful for fx as a proxy for the relative cyclical performance of each economy and their ability to capture capital inflows however the global experience suggests that this behaviour changes as we approach the lower bound of effective interest rates bunning writes in a note to hsbc clients the recent movement in rate differentials simply reflects that there is now much less room to price in further rate cuts locally relative to the us rather than relative economic performance which still appears to strongly favour the usd above difference between nz and u s growth correlation with exchange rates source hsbc bunning says that bond yields which represent real time borrowing costs of sovereign governments cannot fall much further from where they are in places like new zealand and australia this is a problem for the rbnz because those yields influence borrowing costs in the real economy and its real economy rates that rbnz policy seeks to push lower in order to stimulate faster economic growth and higher inflation we have discussed before how with rates close to exhaustion weaker currencies are likely to be required to provide more of the adjustment in the face of a global downturn a year later this seems even more relevant for australia and new zealand and helps explain why aud usd and nzd usd have not rallied in line with the recent outsized fall in usd rates without a meaningful ability to stimulate growth by forcing borrowing costs lower bunning says the market would likely force the new zealand dollar to do the heavy lifting a lower kiwi dollar would make new zealand exports more attractive and could help the economy by discouraging imports which are a subtraction in the calculation of gdp it would also help lift inflation toward the rbnz s elusive target by raising the price of any consumer goods that are still imported we think that the apparent disconnect between relative rates and fx is likely to persist and does not signal that either currency is cheap we continue to look for further downside in these currencies into year end bunning says our year end forecasts remain at 0 66 for aud usd and 0 62 for nzd usd bunning also forecasts the pound to new zealand dollar rate will rise from 1 92 thursday to 2 20 by year end which is due largely to an expectation that a no deal brexit will be avoided this year that represents a staggering 14 5 increase from thursday s level

conservancy and wwf what used to be known as the world wildlife fund all working together to formulate a policy that both republicans and democrats can get behind that coalition continues to grow month by month its goal is to put a price on carbon mr martin so there is growing support from the business community for action on climate change mr bertelsen absolutely we have never seen this level of support among the corporate community for action on climate change and that will only increase mr martin let me challenge you you left the national association of manufacturers to join this group the nam has 14 000 members and they could not come to a consensus are things any better today at the nam mr bertelsen without question yes first 14 000 companies across the country are never going to come to a consensus position on climate policy it is not going to happen but the scales are tipping every day more toward action rather than inaction for the last three congresses before the current one steve scalise the house republican whip introduced a resolution that it is the sense of congress that a carbon tax should not be adopted every republican until the last congress voted for it the national association of manufacturers the first two times sent a letter to all members of congress encouraging members to vote for the resolution on grounds that it is a critical manufacturing issue in the last congress the nam was notably silent it is a minor data point but you can see a big organization like that starting to turn the nam no longer opposes a carbon tax it has moved to neutral mr martin bob inglis you were a conservative republican member of the house do you see the same shift among republicans on climate change mr inglis yes i think that things are turning dramatically probably the best evidence is the headline in a press release from the energy and commerce committee republicans on february 6 republicans are focused on pragmatic solutions to climate change the next day three senior members of that committee on the republican side followed up with an op ed piece whose lead sentence read climate change is real and we the leaders on the republican side of the energy and commerce committee are here to do something about it mr martin so we are starting to see a shift among republican members of congress in the last year mr inglis since the november elections actually november was quite a wake up call green new deal mr martin the democrats seem to be veering to the left they have a green new deal they hope to make climate change a key issue in the 2020 election it is too early of course to know what the key issues will be but do you think climate change will be a winning issue for the democrats mr inglis i think not i think it will split the democratic party the democrats are getting ready to have a tea party led by alexandria ocasio cortez i don t think nancy pelosi was tongue tied when she said the green dream or whatever they call it i think that was actually intentional on nancy s part to say hush up frank pallone the energy and commerce committee chairman is going to handle this his committee is where the action should be not with you aoc i think that is what nancy was doing and nancy is a pretty shrewd politician she knows that she has to keep the democrats from forming a tea party that ends up with something that further polarizes america mr martin travis kavulla why is the green new deal polarizing mr kavulla i think it is intended to be polarizing the intention is to lay down a marker of swift radical transition it has been characterized by its sponsors as a kind of national mobilization and interestingly the fire coming from the green new deal is not trained on republicans it is trained on democrats who are labeled insufficiently pro action we saw this in that cringy video of green new deal activists confronting senator diane feinstein the green new deal is becoming a source of division within the democratic party words like the green new deal conjure up government led industrial policy as opposed to liberalization ironically if you look at the electric power sector it has been transformed by a series of liberalizing policies like direct consumer access and restructured competitive markets that have actually led to decarbonization at least to people who know the electric power sector the green new deal seems awkward in the sense that it purports to be a kind of government hand which is exactly the thing that led to many of the inefficiencies and a lot of the carbon intensity that the liberalizing policies have been helping to undo mr pinchbeck the labour party in the uk has now adopted the green new deal idea because they are desperate to win back the young voters they have lost my first reaction after reading the green new deal was it is fundamentally undeliverable a lot of energy analysts did the same smug thing for about 48 hours it is just a bucket list of things that are impractical why is all this social stuff in it too when it is supposed to be an energy policy however on reflection no policy is perfect the ambition is in line with the science we can dislike how radical the action is and dislike the type of action that is recommended but the speed is bang on in line with what science suggests we will need to do if it creates an urgency in policy and forces everyone to come together on the details then that is a good thing mr martin let me go back to the two republicans on our panel set aside the green new deal does either of you think that climate change is a winning issue for the democrats mr kavulla yes i do democrats have managed to capture the issue from a previous if not bipartisan consensus in an era when polling suggested it ranked about level with both parties now you see iowa democrats listing it as their number two issue going into the coming election season and you do not see it ranked anywhere among the top concerns of republicans it should concern everyone that it has become a politicized issue i think bob inglis is correct that you hear a new message coming from the republican political leadership it remains to be seen whether the kind of pleasing bromides that emerge in press releases will translate into any kind of meaningful policy endorsements but the business community has opened the door one of the positive externalities of the green new deal is that by pulling the democratic party so far to the left on these issues it creates space where republicans can advocate for free market based policies that have been successful in the us at decarbonizing parts of the power sector mr martin bob inglis if you were running again for your old seat in greenville spartanburg would climate change get any traction with that constituency mr inglis not yet not in the reddest district of the reddest state of the nation anybody from idaho here i might want to pull that punch if there is anyone from idaho or texas maybe this is not the reddest but we are pretty red support for action on climate change is still a ways away in those kind of districts but not in the suburban districts that republicans must win in order to win back a majority in the house mr mr martin explain florida which is on the front line of climate change rising sea levels are expected to leave a third of the state underwater by the end of the century and yet the republican leaders in that state not only are not for action but they have also scraped references to climate change from the websites of state government agencies how do you explain that mr inglis that s changing too governor desantis is signaling some things about environmental protection that do not go to climate change but they get mighty close the challenge we face in american politics today is to survive as a republican you have to slam yourself up on the right hand wall and see that there is no daylight between you and the wall in your rhetoric if you are a democrat you want to be on the left hand wall jerry nadler who is now chairman of house judiciary committee once told me it is exhausting to represent my district he represents one of the most liberal districts in the country i have to wake up every morning trying to out liberal my district it is exhausting the safest place for jerry to be is slammed on that wall with no daylight between him and the wall because you let daylight in you will get somebody on talk radio who runs against you florida governor rick desantis is trying to figure out a way to speak about climate change without creating too much daylight between himself and the wall our goal at republicen org is to speak in high octane conservative terms about climate to create a safe space next to the wall we had an event at the university of chicago titled what would milton friedman do about climate change he would internalize the negative externalities you speak in that language you keep the daylight from coming between desantis and his right shifting politics mr martin let s move to another topic which is if there is a fault line in this panel it should be over the role of government in addressing climate change greg bertelsen you were so taken with a proposed carbon tax that george schultz jim baker and other republican luminaries pitched to the trump administration barely two weeks after trump took office that you left the national association of manufacturers and joined the climate leadership council to promote such a tax why is it appropriate for the government to lead the charge on this mr bertelsen thank you for pointing out that i have a history of bad career moves i joined the national association of manufacturers in the second term of the obama administration essentially to oppose regulations and then two weeks into the trump administration i jumped ship to join a carbon tax organization it is an interesting way to frame the question it also informs my answer which is i happen to believe that climate is both the biggest environmental threat facing mankind and also the greatest economic threat there never has been a clearer policy solution to that type of challenge than a direct price on carbon as the primary mechanism for both lowering emissions and stimulating economic growth mr martin do you think a carbon tax is the only effective way to get there mr bertelsen it is the most effective way to get there it is also the most surefire way to give certainty to the marketplace to allow innovators the certainty they need to make the investments necessary to drive lower carbon decisions in january the largest group of economists ever assembled on a single statement essentially endorsed the four pillars of the council s policy a direct price on carbon being the primary one the leading economists across the country republicans democrats young old are in agreement that a price on carbon is the best way to go about this mr martin do you favor other government actions as well subsidies for renewables for example cap and trade mr bertelsen there is absolutely space for complementary policies but if the objective is rapid decarbonization of the economy do it in an economically beneficial way do it in a way that allows all sectors of the economy to realize potential opportunities for emissions reductions the starting place for any comprehensive climate policy should be a direct price on carbon mr martin travis kavulla you told the senate energy committee in february that the states are being ham fisted in how they are trying to deal with climate change some states for example have renewable portfolio standards to encourage renewables but at the same time they give subsidies through zero emissions credits to keep nuclear power plants operating we end up with more electricity than we need and at an increased cost do you think there is any role for federal or state governments to play mr kavulla a lot of the action is in the states at the moment rather than the federal government as we do not have a system like the uk where energy policy is made nationally in any meaningful way instead policy is vulcanized on the part of states or even on the part of individual utilities subject to public utility commission regulation if you were going to rank the efficiency of policies that can reduce carbon you would begin with a carbon tax the second most efficient would probably be cap and trade a third would be some sort of technology neutral subsidy for technologies that are carbon free but the last policy gets into a sphere of something like 17th best in terms of efficiency when you look at certain state policies i will pick on illinois in particular because your question leads me there which literally subsidize renewable entry and then subsidize other plants to hang around that are threatened by renewable entry that is bananas it is easy to put this in the context of a false dichotomy of do you or do you not favor government action the reality is we are living in a sphere where government is already heavily involved and where people are paying a carbon tax but it simply happens to be hidden and inefficient i am a new ratepayer in the district of columbia the district directs a percentage of its renewable energy target specifically at solar if you take the cost of that set aside program and divide it by the tons of carbon that are abated as a result the pjm independent market monitor estimates a carbon reduction cost of 861 per ton mr martin so we pay extra for poorly designed state programs mr kavulla that is what i am paying on my electricity bills and it is not a line item and it is not a tax so it does not have that level of transparency we see state level activities all over the united states that adopt hidden carbon taxes that are wildly inefficient in trying to achieve their goals mr pinchbeck it goes further than that you are spot on i am so bored of pointless ideological arguments that do not get anyone anywhere of should government intervene versus should the market do it it is such a reductive way of thinking about the challenge when most of us work in regulated markets of one kind or other climate change calls for a mix of incentives you mentioned the uk the uk has a carbon floor price as well as a cap and trade regime with the european union to tackle the energy intensive bits of the economy we chose to do a carbon price for that but the government also introduced research and development funding for some of the technologies that the market would never invest in because they are never going to be something that is particularly valuable commercially yet they are very valuable for climate change action i think a carbon price would make a massive difference in the us but when it gets down to telling people how efficient they have to make their homes i suspect we have to regulate original construction because there is no way to make my mom happy about someone coming in and messing with her house of necessity we end up with a mix of policies you are absolutely right that we have no transparency about where costs and benefits stick in the system and so we have this conversation as if the playing field is level to start which it is not for example the uk treasury does not take into account climate externalities when doing impact assessments hurricane katrina cost the us economy 11 6 billion none of that cost from climate change is ever factored into how much do renewables cost or how much does this green policy cost gdp assessments do not cover it nor do we think about what are the risks to economic growth in a world of scarce resources carbon pricing addresses some of that but not all of it it is a much more complicated picture than whether to intervene or not mr martin you are a good advocate for action and your point is that the government is already heavily involved so we just need to find the right mix of policies travis i could not tell whether that is also your position mr kavulla largely so to the degree that a price on carbon does not get us there then should we add other policies for market transformation and new technologies it is important to have some kind of market mechanism the uk in some respects has been successful where it has pots of r d funding as emma says but this funding is put out for competition the big utilities have to compete in order to get that sum of money if you are going to do some kind of state level policy that might be an nth best option then at least make it a competitive solicitation mr pinchbeck it was a 2008 labour government that signed the climate change act the act represented a consensus view it has been right wing governments that have delivered the policy beneath it mr kavulla offshore wind is an example of this you have the vineyard project off massachusetts that had to win a competitive solicitation and is coming in relatively low cost but compare that to a log rolling exercise in virginia where environmentalists teamed up with dominion to get a state legislative package passed that gave dominion a no bid rate based option for offshore wind that came in at 300 million for a 12 megawatt project resulting in 80 per kilowatt hour of electricity or more than 10 times the result of a competitive solicitation in massachusetts so there are clearly two paths that you can take on these types of policies one is a form of log rolling rate based entitlement that brings out the worst of the capital bias of the regulated utility industry and the other tries to draw on aspects of liberalization in order to get you lesser cost carbon reductions best policy option mr martin let me bring bob inglis back in here your website republicen org says that the group favors conservative and free enterprise solutions to climate change what does that mean mr inglis the government being just the honest cop on the beat it says all costs in and all subsidies out now compete of course all subsidies out is hard to get to for example is the oil depletion allowance a subsidy or is it not there is a libertarian strand in republicanism that basically says just level the playing field internalize the negative externalities and get the government out of the business of favoring one technology over the other i spoke at an american wind energy association event and i said you know i m going to be the skunk at the garden party because i am going to say when i get there let s eliminate the production tax credit for wind they said go ahead if you are really talking about internalizing the cost of burning fossil fuels if you are we don t need the production tax credit in fact we don t like the near death experience every time the tax credit comes up for renewal just level the playing field and we will fend for ourselves mr martin do you favor the government putting a price on carbon mr inglis yes we think that is the most efficient way of pricing in the negative externalities mr martin travis kavulla you complained about hidden carbon taxes would you favor an overt carbon tax mr kavulla yes i think it is superior to the alternatives one of the talking points that i use with my republican friends is that it is an opportunity to get rid of some of the inefficient policies like the clean air act s purported regulation of carbon dioxide which would be unnecessary if you transparently priced it or sub optimal things like the cafe standards for transportation some of the regulatory clutter could be repealed i hope in exchange for a carbon tax a lot of people are pushing a kind of tax and dividend i think that is the optimal strategy the reality is we are going to get to a place where people are looking for revenue to run the government and rather than raise general taxes increasingly carbon may be viewed as an attractive source of that revenue it might become a kind of political sweet spot there are regions in the united states that already put a modest price on carbon mostly through a cap and trade regime it will be interesting to see how a plan unfolds that the new york iso is formulating to put a price on carbon in its market and whether the plan gets approved by the federal energy regulatory commission some of the early modeling suggests that the wholesale cost of energy would increase by 50 to 75 but then the money collected would be rebated back to consumers if that happens it could be a really interesting on the ground experiment in how carbon is transparently and robustly priced in the electric power sector mr martin emma pinchbeck the uk puts a price on carbon currently is there a way to explain simply how it works mr pinchbeck no we have a carbon floor price which the uk government has always kept even when scaling back green policies because it is a source of revenue for the uk treasury it is a market based solution to the problem of climate change there is no top down decarbonization target for the uk power sector it is all done through a mix of carbon pricing and a collective sense of where we need to move as a country our carbon floor price is higher than europe s it forces the power sector to address hard questions like is it worth keeping this coal fired power station open for another five years given the current price of renewables mr martin before you go further is it simply a fuel charge or is it also a cap and trade regime within the european community mr pinchbeck the part of it that relates to the european scheme is cap and trade the carbon floor price in the uk is a price so we have an internal carbon price in the uk but it has a relationship with the eu trading scheme please don t ask me what brexit does to this because i have no idea mr martin you were forewarned mr pinchbeck the uk will be completely off coal by 2025 the carbon price is now fundamental to our energy market design and will remain so going forward as renewables become the incumbent power source mr martin bob inglis you are a great admirer of a speech that president kennedy gave in 1962 at rice university where he called for putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade we did not have the technology to do it at the time but we had a sputnik moment the russians had succeeded in launching the first earth orbiting satellite we mobilized our scientists to catch up you call climate change a slow moving sputnik moment do you think there is a role for agencies like nasa darpa and arpa e to promote new technology to deal with climate change mr inglis yes in fact i hope that contrary to president trump s budget congress dramatically increases arpa e funding i think that plus constructive hearings are the only two things we should ask of the current congress the reason to increase arpa e funding is we all live figuratively in missouri the show me state if you can show me that new technology can help then you increase my sense of efficacy and i can engage on the climate change issue if you tell me that there is nothing i can do about this and i am just hosed then i give up here is where a schism appears between republicans and libertarians my libertarian friends would not like that but my republican thought is that only the government can do basic research effectively and it should do it in a big way as john kasich wrote in usa today earlier this week we are not talking a little money either we should be talking big money mr pinchbeck can i tell you a story i thought that the most inspiring thing about visiting svalbard the northernmost inhabited area near the north pole would be feeling moved by the rugged wilderness but just outside svalbard there is a mountain of ice and it is 23 on a good day the environment is trying to kill you as soon as you go out the door about 150 years ago at the dawn of the last industrial revolution a group of victorians wearing nothing but oilskins arrived in svalbard looked at a mountain of ice in 23 discovered there was coal in it and said let s mine it in those conditions they could see the potential to harness technology in a changing global economy and they were willing to put the resources of the british government and the empire to work to do it we talked about the problem of climate change but we are in the midst of another period of transformative economic and technological change and humanity has made these transitions before the moon shot analogy is really good for what we are trying to do mr martin the industrial revolution took hold in the uk starting in the 1840s due to private enterprise mr pinchbeck yes i work in the private sector i left ngos and came back to the private sector because the market is moving and i find that inspiring but i think we face an existential challenge as a society the problem does not really suit incrementalism it doesn t really suit left or right it is going to have to be an all of the above solution i am both pro market and pro intervention for when there will be market failures mr martin so there is no time to rely solely on the private sector mr pinchbeck that too so we have to do this fast it is about setting ambition and it is about scale that is where central governments have an advantage because they can invest for scale they can also take risk carbon tax mr martin greg bertelsen we seem to have a consensus here that putting a price on carbon is an effective policy the carbon tax you are promoting would collect about 200 billion a year it would turn it back to the public as a dividend check in an effort to create political support for the program tell us more about how it works mr bertelsen a number of you told me this morning that gina mccarthy the obama epa administrator spoke here yesterday and suggested that perhaps mr martin she threw shade on your organization mr bertelsen that s what i hear if you dig deep enough in google you can find a statement from her after the launch of her new organization that if she were still running the us environmental protection agency she would take in a second a deal to put a direct price on carbon in place of a more complicated regulatory approach those of you who were here yesterday correct me if i am wrong but i believe her comment yesterday was that we need a policy that can be explained easily to the american public that is why we are so intrigued by the concept of putting a price on carbon by taxing fossil fuel companies i think everyone is still with us up to this point we are for putting a tax on fossil fuel companies and then taking all of that money and returning it directly to the american public in the form of either monthly or quarterly dividend checks mr martin from whom would you collect the tax mr bertelsen from the petroleum industry at the exit point of the refinery from coal companies at the mine mouth from natural gas companies perhaps at the gathering station the goal is to put the tax as far upstream as possible so that the tax is collected from the fewest number of taxpayers at a point where it is administrable it will send a price signal through the entire economy mr martin would the tax be collected from power companies mr bertelsen under our proposal no it would be assessed on fossil fuel companies presumably some or all of those costs would pass through to utilities when they buy fuel mr martin how much would the charge be on carbon mr bertelsen we proposed a price starting at 40 a ton escalating a few percentage points per year above inflation to give you a sense of what the modeling shows in terms of emission reductions if the program starts by 2021 by 2025 we would be about 32 below 2005 levels or well below the us paris target but that is just the first part of the equation the second part is what do you do with 200 billion in revenue there are plenty of worthy causes in the climate space and elsewhere for the 200 billion a year but if this is to be a climate policy first it must first pass and then the tax must stay in place and increase with time you can imagine what might happen with opportunistic politicians challenging incumbents who voted for the gasoline tax or the energy tax bob inglis might be able to speak to this from experience we believe it will be a lot harder to challenge supporters if to repeal the energy tax or the gas tax you must also take away the dividend check that people have been getting in the mail every quarter the case study for this is the alaska permanent fund this is a program that has been in place for four decades in alaska part of the cost for oil and gas companies to do business in alaska is they must share some of the revenue from oil and gas production with the citizens of alaska alaska residents get a check every year it is a hugely popular program it is politically untouchable in fact every now and again a politician tries to touch that pot of money and every time he or she is beaten back mr martin there is another piece of it a border adjustment to ensure that us manufacturers who had to pay more for fuel will not be disadvantaged how does that work mr bertelsen it is complex but simple to explain goods that the us exports to countries that do not put a price on carbon would be rebated the carbon tax at the us border goods coming into the country would be assessed a fee equivalent to what they would have had to bear had a carbon price been in place abroad the goal is not to design a protectionist program but the advantage of this for a lot of us industries is the us economy happens to be a lot more carbon efficient than that of china or india a border adjustment encourages production to take place in countries where carbon emissions are less such as the united states i think this is another key lever for encouraging republicans who are more business minded to come on board mr martin but who generally are not protectionists bob inglis you have good political antennae does this sound saleable to you imr nglis i think it is the dividend creates a political constituency as he was just describing it also helps address regressivity because a carbon tax by itself is regressive at republicen org we support the proposal but we are also a little more ecumenical in terms of the revenue recycling if you want to cut individual or corporate income taxes we are for that if you want to recycle the revenue through a cut in payroll taxes we are very much for that the congressional budget office says that if you cut payroll taxes and put on a carbon tax the bottom 70 percentile income earners do better under that system than they do today if you are truly concerned about regressivity that is the place to go backlash mr martin carbon and fuel taxes have had to be rolled back in australia there is pressure to do so in canada emmanuel macron in france had to roll back a fuel tax do you know enough about those schemes to be able to distinguish them from what is proposed here mr inglis i spent some time two years ago traveling around australia speaking at the invitation of the australian institute to australian conservatives australia did a carbon tax undid it did it undid it that is a problem for the business community australia does not have the ability to do a border adjustment which is the key aspect of america s ability to lead if you want access to this american market fine you are going to have to pay our carbon tax on entry unless you have the same level carbon tax at home say that china challenges the border adjustment in the world trade organization we think it loses if we are right china 24 hours after losing in the wto will have the same price on carbon dioxide because otherwise its exporters will pay a tax on entry into the united states that goes to washington and that could have been collected at home and been retained in beijing then you have the whole world following no international agreement is needed to the people on right wing talk radio did you hear that no international agreement no bowing and scraping at the united nations just a bold move by the united states that says we are going to lead and now rest of the countries in the world decide what you want to do in your interest mr pinchbeck i have spent the last seven years having an argument with a government that is right wing about climate policy and mr martin your right wing is our center to left mr pinchbeck well i don t know we are doing brexit and that s pretty right wing for the moment this is about why i am skeptical about carbon pricing on its own as a solution from experience with both markets and people we do not always do the economically efficient thing like ever take me for example i work in energy policy my husband is always hectoring me to turn the lights off we are humans and we behave in strange ways there is no such thing as a subsidy for renewables currently in the uk renewables are winning on a pure price point they are the cheapest form of generation to build that said we cannot build onshore wind or storage very easily on just merchant models alone for various reasons including that we do not price things transparently in our economy financiers in the city also require a long term guaranteed return on their investments they want to see a floor price even a subsidy free one mr martin so we don t need the government involved mr pinchbeck not so fast we need the government to correct market failures the reason that people are hostile in france for example to carbon pricing is that it was sold as a climate change policy at a time when macron is hated and it was tied to a whole load of other populist sentiment against things like eu intervention it is seen as a kind of globalist interventionist policy in an era of rising nationalist sentiment macron did not bother to communicate it effectively he just thought he could say climate change government policies need to be more effectively communicated markets do not always follow economic efficiency they do things for other reasons too that is where you get market failures and sometimes where you need policy utility business model mr martin we are winding down i have two more questions starting with pg e travis kavulla you are a former utility regulator you have said the pg e bankruptcy raises in the minds of regulators whether utilities should act as insurance companies regulators must decide whether the cost of rare events like wildfires and hurricanes should be socialized by passing through the costs to ratepayers or should be borne by utility creditors and shareholders what do you think the pg e bankruptcy will mean for the basic utility business model going forward mr kavulla it is hard to draw generic lessons from california but there is one lesson that i think can be drawn which is how vulnerable big central station networks are to black swan events like wildfires in the west and hurricanes in the coastal areas i would usually say to most people that the 9 and 10 returns on equity that regulators dole out to largely risk free companies are supernormal and excessive but here you have found once in a blue moon a regulated firm whose return on equity actually understates evidently its level of risk which is kind of surprising i had always been under the assumption that we were overcompensating these people for their risk if you actually expect them to bear climate risk then their roe is going to have to be substantially higher in a sector where california law puts much of the liability on california utilities and where utilities have no meaningful recovery opportunity from their ratepayers you are going to have to nearly double their returns on equity it raises questions about the optimality of that form of regulation versus creating something like a state backed loss fund or trying to get the insurance community involved and reinsuring some of this risk it is something that anyone who operates a large utility network should be paying attention to notwithstanding the weirdness of california public policy having contributed to the problem mr martin are there any questions from the audience mr haymaker tom haymaker with clark public utilities in the state of washington i listened to the suggestion that carbon taxes might be the most efficient or best way to get greenhouse gas reductions washington state is one of the most environmentally conscious states in the union we had two public referenda on a carbon tax and both times the tax lost in fact the proposal lost in all but two counties in the state so i am having a cognitive dissonance moment here where i hear you guys and i believe you are right say a carbon tax that is the best way to do it but the voters even in the state of washington are saying we don t want such a tax how do we put those things together mr martin let me ask before our panel answers did you vote for it mr haymaker that s none of your business mr martin cognitive dissonance go ahead greg bertelsen mr bertelsen two quick thoughts first not all carbon tax proposals are created equal without getting into the details i would argue there were serious flaws with the design of the washington state carbon tax second the vote underlines the importance of national policy being consensus based in washington state you had big oil against big environment and it got super ugly and super expensive which is why we are starting with the opposite approach we are starting with big oil and big environment working together to avoid that very collision mr kavulla keith can i add quickly the fatal flaw in state initiatives on carbon taxation is that you cannot do a border adjustment if the governor of illinois wants to solve his budget problems he could try to have the state impose a carbon tax billboards would spring up immediately around chicago that say illinoised yet move to indiana if you put on a carbon tax within a state the leakage to the neighboring states is massive that is why it only works as a federal policy mr martin another question this time from kevin lynch with avangrid renewables mr lynch thanks keith along those lines i don t have a lot of confidence that the american voter can wait a year for the dividend after the tax is imposed so i am wondering if the proposal is backwards should we do the dividend and then the tax mr bertelsen the climate leadership council agrees with you what we propose doing is to pay the first dividend before the tax hits so that the first thing you see as part of the program is a check in the mail mr kavulla and to reiterate notwithstanding that it is insane to regulate locally a globally diffuse gas most action on carbon pricing in the united states is on a regional and state level the new york iso is in all likelihood going to make a filing with ferc to impose a carbon price with a retail side emanation in the form of a rebate on people s bills of the incremental revenue to the degree that we believe in the laboratory of democracy kind of approach in america it is good to vet some of these policy ideas on the ground like that it is a much fairer system not to pile in on washington state but one of the biggest objections to the carbon tax on the voter ballot was that the proceeds would go into a governor controlled slush fund i think the uk term for it is a quango there was not a lot of political confidence in that it did not pass for all sorts of reasons but if you really wanted to be critical it looked like a crass power play rather than a bona fide good spirited carbon price and hilariously a tax promoted by a libertarian academic was opposed by the sierra club because it didn t do enough for social justice and all the kind of rent seeking that usually attaches to green energy policies so hilariously you had a kind of libertarian purist thing that was opposed by the environmental left mr pinchbeck do you think it is because people fundamentally do not like to feel that things are being done to them and we need to do much better at explaining that the impacts of climate change are coming for you whether you like it or not it will intervene in your life and here are the solutions can be done for you for example the green energy jobs that we are seeing created in the uk the wealth creation the regional investment and other community benefits that come off the backs of our wind farms the polling on climate change is consistent in the uk roughly 80 of the public thinks we should do more 65 think we should do more to encourage in renewables our electorate remains fractured politically but what has shifted is the economic case people understand that this industry and this change produce benefits for them mr martin a signal moment in the us was the super bowl commercial for budweiser mr pinchbeck i saw that with the dog mr martin you had an american beer company touting how it uses green energy in order to sell beer consumer change is a leading indicator in government policy there is time for only one more audience question mr johnson jessica johnson from avangrid renewables i m interested in the idea of a carbon tax i wonder whether someone can talk about its relation to the existing subsidies that the oil and gas industry receives from the federal government mr kavulla i think you are looking at a chorus of people who oppose maybe not all types of subsidies but probably that subsidy at the very least subsidies create hidden costs the one you mentioned is a real problem if any kind of carbon tax is adopted it would also require attendant regulatory reforms that clear out some of the clutter that directs money to different sectors some to renewables and some to oil and gas producers the opportunity is ripe for a reform mr inglis while a carbon tax and clearing out all energy subsidies are the ideal policy the best climate policy is the one that can pass for every existing subsidy renewable or fossil there is a member of congress who is a constituent for that tax provision and that leads to complications it gets ugly quickly the ideal and the feasible do not always overlap perfectly mr martin short comment we have to close mr collado pablo callado with iberdrola my comment is that it does not help renewables to keep talking about subsidies we need to banish that word from our speech we are talking about the cheapest technology all we need is long term visibility into the revenues to make sure our projects are bankable mr pinchbeck it is rare at the moment as a uk citizen that i get to feel smug about anything because you have all read the brexit news however the power sector transition in the uk means that we are a bit further ahead on the decarbonization curve than others with respect to the gentlemen on stage i rarely think about climate change or any kind of top down policy any more i think about how best to accelerate and support a market that is moving by itself i have not had a conversation about whether we need to subsidize renewables in about three years because when i walk into a government department now with the nuclear industry and the oil and gas lobby i am the cheapest form of energy generation the only issue is whether to accelerate a change that is already occurring and is being driven by the private sector all of my work at the moment is on the demand side it is on smart technology homes transport integration with the wider energy system and the tricky stuff we have won a lot of these arguments it might not feel like it but the policy debate is over mr kavulla and from a us power market perspective there are plenty of situations where the going forward costs of existing resources exceed the cost of new renewable entry and yet the existing power plants stay operational why is that it is not because government intervention is there to promote renewables it is because regulation and policy retain capital inefficiencies that is the paradox of all this talk about the green new deal if you had a customer empowerment act something that promoted liberalization in the power sector and competitive entry you would actually discipline it a lot it is regulation and policy that maintain some of the inefficiencies in the power sector left alone customers would gravitate more quickly to renewables us divisions mr martin i want to wrap up with this bob inglis you gave a fascinating ted talk last year in boston you had a refrain you kept repeating suppose you are a conservative member of the house and you followed it each time with an observation for example you said you worried while in the house about the fire of populist nationalism those who play with fire cannot control it pitchforks and torches are not great building tools you said you would go to county meetings in your congressional district when you were running for reelection and the voters would want to hear you say that there is a closet muslim socialist in the white house you were unwilling to say it you lost your seat and yet you came away from it all with your american optimism intact what makes you think this country is going to be able to pull itself together again we are so divided politically mr inglis well here we are in arizona and to quote my very dear friend former arizona senator jeff flake the fever will break tom friedman described the american dna in the world is flat this is a country young enough and brash enough to believe that every problem has a solution every once in a while we get down on our luck and we feel put upon and we will listen to somebody telling us a down in the mouth tale but eventually we get tired of it i think we are in the process now of tiring of it we will return to our basic selves sir winston churchill never lost hope in us during the early days of world war ii when britain battled alone against the nazis and night after night the german bombers pounded london and other cities he assured the british people you can always count on the americans to do the right thing after they ve exhausted every other option we are in the process now having had our pity party the great recession and feeling really bad about ourselves we are going to come out of it the fever will break
bloomberg president donald trump has already given the global economy trade wars now there are signs he may be gearing up for a currency war too with a series of tweets on tuesday aimed at the european central bank and an announcement by mario draghi its president that he was prepared to cut interest rates further below zero in response to europe s slowing growth trump made a rare american presidential intervention into another economy s monetary policy mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others he tweeted later he added german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states it was not the first time trump has blamed currency manipulation overseas for a strong dollar that raises the cost of u s exports he has already become unique among recent american presidents in a shift away from the strong dollar policy of his predecessors by targeting draghi directly and responding in real time to an overseas central bankers policy pronouncement trump was dialing up the heat just as his own federal reserve was gathering in washington to decide on rates in a decision expected wednesday coming just days ahead of a summit with other group of 20 leaders in japan the salvo served to highlight his administration s increasingly aggressive currency policies and the place he sees for them in his trade arsenal they are preparing the ground they are laying out the potential tools they may have at their disposal said cesar rojas global economist at citigroup global markets inc though he added we re not at a currency war just yet finance ministers and central bankers this month agreed that a currency war a tit for tat push at times of slow economic growth to actively weaken foreign exchange rates in order to boost exports is in no one s interest they reaffirmed commitments made in march 2018 to refrain from competitive devaluations last month the u s treasury increased the number of economies it scrutinizes to 21 from 12 and expanded its watch list from four to nine adding countries such as ireland italy and singapore under new tougher criteria it again refrained from labeling china a manipulator the commerce department on may 23 proposed allowing u s companies to seek trade sanctions against goods from countries with undervalued currencies though it said it did not intend to target independent central banks or their monetary policy decisions the administration has also been pushing to include currency provisions carrying the threat of sanctions in new u s trade agreements there are plenty of economists who argue the u s should take a more forceful approach to addressing currency manipulation by trading partners some have even called for a 21st century plaza accord the 1980s agreement that saw countries including japan agree to engineer a devaluation of the dollar under pressure from the reagan administration top priority in a paper released this week brad setser a former u s treasury official now at the council on foreign relations argued that countering currency intervention by foreign governments should be a top priority of u s international economic policy if nothing else other countries manipulation hurts the u s s ability to use exports to recover following economic downturns he wrote in an interview on tuesday however setser said that trump s ecb intervention was misplaced largely because draghi s comments were aimed at domestic conditions most of the world recognizes that the ecb has failed to meet its inflation target and that with a slowing european economy there is pressure on the ecb to ease policy he said worse trump s intervention could be seen as its own form of market manipulation setser said and feeds into a building narrative in europe that the u s is a rogue actor under a rogue president trump has defied convention in a number of other ways including his repeated criticisms of federal reserve chairman jerome powell for raising interest rates he asked white house lawyers earlier this year to explore his options for removing powell as chairman joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and another advocate of stronger u s currency policy said the world was in an uneasy peace over currencies with china and other g 20 countries having in recent years accepted a u s push to refrain from competitive devaluations in a june 6 note gagnon and a co author said interventions by countries to weaken their currencies to affect their trade balance fell in 2018 to the lowest level since 2001 but the g 20 commitments are weak and if there s a global downturn a global recession countries would be very tempted to violate these terms and try to claim special circumstances he said there s really no regime in place to sanction them or hit them except the u s might do something trump may have some legitimate reasons to grumble the big mac approach to gauging currency valuations shows the euro is about 15 too cheap since trump launched his trade wars china s yuan has also fallen against the dollar prompting the president to complain that it was undermining the impact of his tariffs and his efforts to raise pressure on beijing those currency moves are widely seen as related to the weakening of the european and chinese economies and a global economy that is looking increasingly fragile thanks in part to trump s trade wars the fear however is that trump s anger over the currency shifts could also help fuel further trade actions including tariffs he has threatened to impose on imported cars and parts from the eu but put on hold for 180 days a drop below 1 10 for the euro dollar rate could inflame trump s temper and make him more likely to impose those auto tariffs according to jens nordvig the founder of exante data llc the rate fell as low as 1 1181 on tuesday after draghi said additional stimulus may be needed and trump levied his latest twitter missive
the caribbean s long term outlook hinges on diversifying out of tourism and commodities and turning climate change challenges into growth opportunities sargassum seaweed being removed from a yucatan beach when the first ever wave of sargassum seaweed washed up on the coasts of the caribbean in 2011 people took it in stride but the sargassum returned in larger volumes and affected more beaches year after year it is almost definitely a combination of climate change and ocean enrichment with nutrients says hazel oxenford a professor in fisheries biology and management at the university of the west indies we are talking about nutrients from deforestation urbanization general continued land use and destruction of natural vegetation the foul smelling decomposing piles of seaweed do not appeal to tourists pictures of fetid beaches have appeared on social media tamping down demand for flights hotels and restaurants johanan dujon of st lucia saw an opportunity outside the tourist industry he began harvesting the seaweed and turned it into an organic fertilizer founding algas organics in 2014 i started this company with a vision to convert what many people saw as an environmental and economic threat into the world s most innovative fertilizer company he explains algas organics has processed more than 3 million pounds of sargassum since starting production in 2015 simultaneously cleaning beaches and supporting local agriculture with an organic fertilizer the nations of the caribbean have widely different sizes histories languages and levels of economic development but they all share the same ocean and thus are suffering similar dramatic impacts from climate change creeping problems such as gassy seaweed are the least of it as the 2017 hurricane season illustrated powerful hurricanes which will become more likely given warmer ocean water can have a substantial impact on regional growth prospects particularly given the generally volatile nature of tourism flows in addition to risks such as greater flooding and changes in precipitation patterns says andrew trahan country risk analyst at fitch solutions these downside risks will likely far outweigh the cost of adaptation over the long term since hurricane maria wiped out puerto rico s power grid for example public private and philanthropic funds have invested in renewable energy batteries and so called microgrid infrastructure to build the island s resilience the efficacy of those measures was not fully tested by the milder 2018 hurricane season trahan notes and it is not just the unpredictable weather but also the economic and political impact of larger neighbors such as the us that make the caribbean economies volatile and generally underperforming and with volatile economies caribbean countries are highly susceptible to shocks they can have a drought or a hurricane and the forecast can change by 0 5 percentage points which is more relevant when growth is weak to start with says juan pedro schmid a lead economist at the inter american development bank idb world bank ceo kristalina georgieva in a blog post late in 2018 estimated the impact of hurricanes on small island economies at 1 6 of gdp add in other types of disasters and the losses come to roughly 2 5 of gdp the region s long term economic destiny is based on these countries ability to prepare for more severe weather challenges and perhaps even turn these extremes into growth opportunities idb lab the innovation laboratory of the idb group last year launched its blue tech challenge to address these issues by identifying companies with business models that the bank says use cutting edge technologies to contribute to the sustainable management of oceans marine ecosystems and coastal resources in march algas organics seeking to develop export capacity was one of five companies chosen to receive funding out of 50 applicants we recognize that invasive sargassum seaweed is posing a real problem for the tourism sector and we received several applications through the blue tech challenge addressing this issue says dora moscoso from idb lab we selected algas organics because its technology had already been tested and it was seeking resources to expand and scale up its model other winning proposals aim to help clean the oceans or improve fishing practices the blue tech challenge is just one example of attempts to free the region s economy from its two traditional mainstay industries tourism and commodities tourism is not the most dynamic industry says the idb s schmid and there is a lot of all inclusive tourism that has little spillover to the general economy for the bahamas jamaica and barbados it s almost a puzzle says schmid all three countries had the weakest growth for a long time they suffer frequent external shocks including in terms of weather and they depend strongly on the us and canadian economies yet jamaica can be called a success story debt to gdp has fallen macroeconomic stability is entrenched costs of borrowing are down inflation is down employment and job creation are at historical peaks foreign exchange reserves are rising quickly the business environment is improving and the economy has had 15 consecutive quarters of growth says marla dukharan chief economist at barbados based fintech bitt she also offers praise for grenada which reduced its debt to gdp ratio from 108 in 2013 to 63 by the end of 2018 grenada just finished its sixth year of consistent and robust growth she says the cayman islands too are demonstrating resilience in the first three quarters of 2018 the economy grew 3 6 ahead of same period the prior year and is delivering fiscal surpluses their offshore economic zone cayman enterprise city has made significant advances towards becoming a hub for technology aviation maritime commodities and derivatives businesses says dukharan health city cayman islands offers a myriad of medical specialties many of which are not available anywhere else within the region at the same time she notes tourism as measured by cruise ship arrivals and stayovers grew 11 over the prior year the caymans also have a robust business as a friendly tax jurisdiction the number of new company registrations grew 34 5 year over year in the first nine months of 2018 dukharan adds fitch solutions sees economic growth in the caribbean recovering to 3 9 in 2019 and 4 in 2020 up from 0 7 growth in 2018 the last an aberrant figure trahan points out due to the fiscal year reporting of puerto rico the region s largest economy because 2018 figures include part of 2017 with its hurricane aftereffects the imf has been focusing on the caribbean following debt reduction in several countries and suggesting financial tools aimed at reducing the risk of weather related events alejandro werner and krishna srinivasan director and deputy director respectively of the western hemisphere department at the imf have supported the introduction of climate resilient debt instruments as well as the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility a multicountry risk pool for government intervention during natural disasters they suggest that debt contracts include hurricane linked clauses to allow an extension of maturity in the event of a natural disaster as well as the introduction of insurance to cover specific amounts of debt service payments following catastrophic disasters
