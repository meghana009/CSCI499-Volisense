overview global equity markets have resumed their climb after a wobble at the end of last week and earlier this week a strong recovery in the s p 500 on tuesday signaled yesterday s strong advance that left a bullish one day island low in its wake msci asia pacific index snapped a two day decline today with nearly all the market with the notable exception of south korea advanced europe s dow jones stoxx 600 jumped 1 2 yesterday its largest gain in a month and a half and is extending the gains marginally today despite an unexpected decline in german factory goods orders us shares are trading firmer in europe benchmark bond yields are mostly a little higher india surprised investors by leaving policy on hold and although it was seen as temporary 10 year bond yields jumped around 13 bp to almost 6 6 the us dollar is slightly lower against most of the major currencies optimism over next week s uk election is continuing to lift sterling australia which reported disappointing retail sales and a smaller trade surplus is the weakest of the majors 0 2 around 0 6835 the yen and swiss franc are also nursing small losses although the turkish lira and south african rand are trading heavily most of the other emerging market currencies are firm gold is consolidating this week s roughly 20 advance after surging more than 4 yesterday after us oil inventories fell three times more than expected almost five mln barrels the most since early september and offsetting near three weeks of builds wti for january delivery is little changed 58 20 asia pacific more details of japan s fiscal stimulus have been reported the headline figure is around jpy25 trillion but what japan calls real water is about jpy13 trillion 119 bln the main aim is to support the economy in the face of the unpopular sales tax increase the typhoon and anticipation of a post 2020 olympic slump despite negative interest rates and still large asset purchases by the bank of japan the economy is thought to be contracting sharply now many are projecting that the world s third largest economy will shrink by about 2 7 at an annualized rate here is q4 bloomberg surveyed 43 economists they all expected the reserve bank of india to cut rates earlier today it did not the central bank cited rising inflation expectations despite weakened growth prospects it has cut rates five times this year officials made it clear however this was not the end of the easing cycle but a temporary pause october inflation was above the 4 target while growth slowed to its weakest pace in six years indian bond yields among the highest in asia and surged about 13 bp the rupee edged higher the reserve bank of australia left the cash rate at 75 bp when it met earlier in the week while it claimed to be prepared to cut rates again it seemed in no hurry today s disappointing retail sales report and smaller trade surplus strengthen the market s confidence that the rba will have to deliver early next year a reuters survey showed economists expected a 0 3 increase in october retail sales in fact they were flat which matches the worst since april separately australia reported an october trade surplus of a 4 5 bln which was almost a third smaller than expected and adding insult to injury the september surplus was revised a little lower the dollar is trading in a narrow band at the upper end of yesterday s range against the yen knocking again on jpy109 there are about 1 1 bln in options in the jpy109 00 jpy109 15 area that expire today we suspect that the dollar will not get much above there in north america today the australian dollar recovered smartly yesterday from the pmi induced weakness but today s disappointing data have deterred follow through buying support is seen around 0 6810 the us dollar was bid to about cny7 0735 yesterday before reversing lower and today the dollar was pushed below slightly below cny7 04 the lower end of the range is seen near cny7 02 europe german factory orders disappointed instead of rising by 0 3 0 4 as the newswire survey suggested orders fell by 0 4 this confirms for many observers that the german economy and by extension europe remains mired in weakness the world s fourth largest economy is likely to still near stagnant here in q4 and is projected to grow less than 1 next year domestic orders fell 3 2 and non european orders fell 4 1 which is where china s data would be embedded orders from the emu jumped by a little more than 11 which likely reflects bulk orders germany reports industrial output figures tomorrow a small gain was expected before today s data after a 0 6 decline in september s figures separately germany did report a stronger than expected construction pmi which at 52 5 is at a seven month high however the sector is not big enough to support the economy the yellow vest protests in france spurred the macron government to give a 17 bln euro tax break however macron faces a new challenge his attempt to dramatically reform the pension system in a direction that appears to cut benefits and boost retirement ages is triggering a general strike la greve such action has bedeviled previous french governments and could cripple the economy macron needs social stability to have a strong voice on the international stage and negotiate with germany the euro briefly poked through 1 11 yesterday but it failed to close above there it is trading quietly in about a 15 tick range through the late morning in europe support is seen near 1 1065 there are nearly 2 2 bln euros in options between 1 1110 and 1 1120 that expire today these look sufficient to cap the euro though the technical indicators still show more upside room short term participants may be reluctant to extend positions ahead of tomorrow s us jobs data sterling had been comfortably trading in a 1 28 1 30 range since mid october participants are feeling more confident that of next week s election outcome and a fueling a sterling breakout it traded up to almost 1 3150 today it finished last week near 1 2925 many are looking for sterling to trade toward 1 35 as the expected electoral results are discounted america the bank of canada softened its neutral stance in october and noted a weakening growth assessment yesterday it seemed to almost say never mind and fueled the largest gain in the canadian dollar in three months the central bank noted the waning recession concerns and that the economy was operating near capacity it continued to identify trade as the biggest risk the key to the change of heart may lie with fiscal policy and prime minister trudeau begins his push for tax cuts the bank of canada said it would incorporate the implications in next month s economic outlook we had thought there was a chance for the bank of canada to cut rates earlier this year while the fed was cutting and the ecb when it did not materialize we accepted looser ties in the monetary cycle however if we are right and the federal reserve cuts rates next year due to the same trade offs that were made this year low inflation gives scope for efforts to extend the already record long expansion cycle the bank of canada will again be challenged note that like in october canada is once again offering a premium to the us on two year rates the adp estimate of private sector employment does a good job over the medium term of tracking the official estimate still it often readjusts its calculations curve fitting and in any event can be markedly different from the non farm payroll report yesterday s 67k increase the weakest in six months was half of what was expected continuing the deterioration of data surprise models the non manufacturing ism shows a rise in employment with the sub index reaching its best level since july the pmi on the other hand pointed to slower service sector job growth after gains in september and october it creates more uncertainty around the jobs report which are expected to be flattered by the end of the strike against gm the implied yield of the june fed funds futures contract has risen 1 5 bp this week to 1 425 the current effective average is 1 55 the us reports trade and factory goods orders data today in addition to the weekly jobless claims given the importance of tomorrow s data ahead of next week s fomc meeting the impact of the news is likely to be limited canada reports its trade figures and the ivey survey but given the central s bank s stance they are unlikely to have much impact either canada also reports its jobs data tomorrow the us dollar slumped against the canadian dollar yesterday losing 0 7 the most since early september there has been follow selling today and the greenback has approached cad1 3175 it began the week straddling cad1 33 the near term risk extends to around cad1 3150 which corresponds to a 61 8 retracement of the rally from the last october low on the upside the cad1 3200 cad1 3220 should offer resistance the dollar fell by about 0 6 against the mexican peso yesterday the market is trying to extend the losses today initial support is seen in the mxn19 38 mxn19 40 area a break could see a push today mxn19 30 the underlying technical tone of the peso appears to be improving lastly we note that the central bank of chile which has begun intervening in the foreign exchange and forwards market to stabilize the peso did not cut the overnight rate 1 75 yesterday as many had expected the dollar has fallen around 5 75 since the intervention plan was announced the charts warn of scope for another couple of percent pullback that would take the us dollar toward clp773
president trump has brazil all wrong and the market seems to think so as well because the country s stock market is beating the s p 500 and the rest of the emerging markets index again on wednesday the self described tariff man reinstated tariffs on brazilian steel on tuesday he blamed a weak brazilian real for his decision saying the weakened currency makes brazilian steel more attractive to world markets a weaker currency definitely makes brazilian goods more price competitive but despite the currency weakening significantly since late july going from r 3 72 on july 18 to a five year low of r 4 23 on november 29 brazil s revenue from steel exports is in decline brazil s economic minister paulo guedes a market fave said today that trump was making a very serious mistake in accusing brazil of deliberately pushing down the value of its currency the brazil steelers depending on the product line and product code set by the brazilian foreign trade ministry export value of semi manufactured steel products fell 21 67 in november worldwide steel laminate exports fell even more by 51 year to date exports of steel products have not been helped by the foreign exchange rate semi manufactured steel exports fell 15 9 steel laminate exports are down 18 the brazilian real is down roughly 8 against the dollar year to date so these values are not all due to a weaker currency eating up export profits the u s is the no 2 destination for brazilian goods after china steel products are second only to crude oil but like crude oil steel shipment values are also down from january to november the u s imported 12 7 less worth of brazilian steel over an 11 month period than a year ago totaling 2 5 billion all told brazil exports to the u s for the year are up 2 7 to 26 9 billion helped along primarily by a surge in gasoline ethanol and coffee bean exports not steel china is not a a major steel importer it produces its own steel and instead buys the iron ore pellets used to make steel china imported 21 more iron ore from brazil so far this year according to the foreign trade ministry brazil s other top trading partners are not importing ship loads of steel either holland brazil s no 3 export market saw a 0 5 increase in certain steel products such as steel rebar for a total of 1 02 billion perhaps trump is looking at mexico imports of semi manufactured steel that s a top 10 export market for brazil and steel sales rose 26 7 to 157 million spain increased its purchase of brazilian steel this year too rising 21 4 to 54 million it is unclear if any of these buyers sourced from brazil instead of the u s but even if they did this happens worldwide every day in market economies what should worry trump if anything is more brazilian steel coming into the united states at the expense of local producers according to gerdau a brazilian multinational steel producer with steel mills in the u s volume of brazilian steel shipments in the third quarter fell 17 volumes of steel shipments over the last 9 months compared to the same period a year ago fell 20 1 the weaker real is not helping brazilian steel trump said the weaker real makes brazilian soy more competitive to the detriment to american farmers brazilian soybeans are priced in dollars the only price differential is due to brazil s logistical cost which sometimes makes brazilian soy more expensive in dollar terms brazil s weaker currency does not give it a pricing power beyond what brazil has always had in comparison to the u s the brazilian real averages at least two times cheaper than the dollar like in the u s china is brazil s largest soy buyer china is basically boycotting u s soy and buying more brazilian soy taking the u s out of the top spot as world s leading soybean exporter that s not brazil s fault unless trump thinks brazilian agribusiness firms should tell the chinese to buy from their american friends instead brazil s soy export boom of last year is because china turned away from the u s in revenge for trump s trade war this year is not turning out as well in terms of revenue soy exports to china in dollar terms are down 23 8 year to date to 19 5 billion agroconsult a brazilian agribusiness market intelligence firm estimates that china imports of brazilian soybeans will decline in this next harvest by around 10 brazil s currency not the renminbi this year the u s treasury went against its long standing tradition of refraining from calling china a currency manipulator this week trump hinted that brazil was practicing competitive devaluations in order to make its currency weaker so now brazil is a currency manipulator of sorts no one in the market believes for a second that brazil manipulates their forex market in 2008 months before the collapse of lehman brothers and bear stearns brazil s finance minister at the time guido mantega lamented the brazilian real trading at a strong r 1 60 to the dollar mantega famously said the u s was engaging in a currency war with the weak dollar then the market collapsed the great recession hit and all emerging market currencies tumbled the currency war was forgotten until around 2011 when quantitative easing was in full effect the real strengthened again to around r 1 55 in intraday trading in june of that year it was the strongest the brazilian real has ever been the real weakened over the next several years for a number of factors including more money flowing into the advanced economies thanks to the fed and european central bank and a growing political crisis in brazil that led to an economic crisis brazil is only now clawing its way out of its own great recession the brazilian central bank intervened twice in the forex market last week selling between 2 billion to 3 billion to avoid an even weaker currency it was the first intervention in the spot market since 2009 but it clearly triggered trump the real has weakened this year for good reasons says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group a 95 billion asset manager primarily invested in emerging market debt local interest rates have declined to the lowest level ever thanks to declining inflation rates and a full restoration of central bank credibility under the new government low rates have in turn allowed companies to repay dollar denominated debt and borrow in local currency at similar levels of interest rates instead this has led to an increase in the demand for dollars to repay debt more demand for dollars means less demand for reals as companies sell reals to buy dollars to pay back loans that s pushing the currency lower in the short term dehn says the brazilian real also weakened recently for pure technical reasons investors went long the real in anticipation of large foreign direct investment into the oil and gas sector in the recent concessions the auction was a success for petrobras which secured the right to operate very productive assets however foreign participation was slim only 10 of one field which left currency speculators frustrated he notes as expectations for dollar inflows into brazil s oil and gas market fell flat the unwinding of the bullish real bet coincided with well known year end seasonal dividend remittances and then the currency took another hit from a data release which showed brazil s trade deficit was growing when it really was not last week november export numbers were corrected showing the trade balance is in surplus to the tune of 37 6 billion year to date that surplus is not to the detriment of u s steel manufacturers or the u s farmer as trump believes the u s has an 8 1 billion trade surplus with brazil according to census data the problem is china tariffs on u s soy leading to what amounts to bans on chinese companies buying american soy they ve turned to brazil american steel may have its own issues that have little to do with brazil trump and his commerce department have provided no words on brazil flooding the u s with cheap steel products how long before trump rescinds these tariffs on brazilian steel is anybody s guess brazil was exempted from steel and aluminum tariffs in may 2018 and never really put in place to begin with quotas were put in place instead to change the quotas to tariffs would require new presidential proclamations as tariffs can t be reimposed by a tweet at this writing we are still awaiting these proclamations says paul nathanson executive director of the coalition of american metal manufacturers and users if the president does move forward with these tariffs it would likely lead to an immediate legal challenge he says a current u s court of international trade case on steel tariffs involves an earlier decision by president trump to raise the so called section 232 steel tariff on turkey to 50 the court ruled against the president s actions against turkey because he did not give a reason for raising the tariff only on turkish steel and he did not follow proper procedures in issuing the proclamation on the matter nathanson says it might be for this reason that wall street doesn t seem too worried about brazilian steel being roadblocked at the ports by trump

a solution to triffin s dilemma has the united states dollar conquered triffin s dilemma that is is the dollar safely and securely perched atop the global monetary system today we turn away from the bright sunlit world of appearance and seek our answer in the shadows for the eye is always caught by light as author gregory maguire styles it but shadows have more to say to these shadows we shall listen belgian economist robert triffin argued decades ago that if a nation s currency is to put in double duty as a global reserve currency the issuing nation must print drowning amounts far beyond its national needs why to keep global trade going along the burden of a global currency a failure of its printing press would deprive the world of required funds and the gears of global commerce would grind down that is the issuing nation must issue heroic amounts of currency to hold global trade together an argentina for example may wish to purchase oil from a saudi arabia but saudi arabia understandably may not accept argentine pesos in exchange but if argentina dangles out united states dollars instead these saudi arabia can use multiply this example in countless directions and you have the flavor of it why then the dilemma because the nation ladling out the reserve currency must run chronic current account deficits triffin argued these chronic deficits would eventually bring down tremendous weights upon the currency that is the currency s vastly excessive supply would fatally undermine its value this currency would plunge toward nothingness interest rates would go skyshooting as the world emptied overboard the increasingly worthless paper hence triffin s dilemma but come pull up to the facts why hasn t the dollar collapsed the united states has piled up record current account deficits lo these many years twinned with a 23 trillion national debt and trillion dollar annual budget deficits run out to the distant horizon yet yet the dollar has rarely been mightier and interest rates have rarely sunk lower 10 year treasury yields scrape along under 2 and 30 year treasury yields they run scarcely higher at 2 24 that is debt has never scaled such dizzied and obscene heights yet the dollar remains king as deeply enthroned as ever and interest rates wallow near record lows where then is the long lamented death of the dollar where is the mass exodus from the greenback shrieks about its looming demise have gone out for decades yet here it stands it is true this central bank or that central bank may reduce its dollar holdings it may heave part of its treasury holdings out the door but it makes no nevermind argues jeffrey snider of alhambra partners central banks aren t central that is because central banks are no longer central as mr snider has previously argued in these pages the dins clamors and carrying ons of the central banks signify nothing the central bank is not central the thing people have the most trouble with is the idea that central banks are not central it flies in the face of everything you have been taught and told your whole life there is no money in monetary policy it is entirely psychology monetary policy contains no money it runs entirely on expectations therefore according to this view what ultimately matters is how you perceive monetary policy how we perceive monetary policy then you might act in anticipating all that money printing was going to have stimulative and even sharp inflationary effects you might then pull forward purchasing activity or if a business hiring and production before the expected higher costs arrived just so but it has clearly failed if central banks are no longer central what then is central as snider has also argued in these pages here is the answer the shadow banking system the shadow banking system casts its shadow across the world the shadow banking system is the deeply interconnected network of banking institutions that operate outside direct control of central banks they include the large wall street banks and their offshore units this shadow banking system extends its shade across europe the caribbean and asia the world over it first took shape in the 1950s and 60s that is after bretton woods hoisted the dollar up to global dominance it expanded through the 1980s 90s and beyond entirely beneath notice the shadow banking system shouldered the central banks out of the international monetary system the dollar did not replace gold in 1971 the did long before 1971 snider the global money system moved on without central banks bothering to notice more the dollar did not replace gold in 1971 the did long before 1971 especially from the 1960s forward and particularly in the 1990s forward was that as the replaced other forms of mediation in global trade what actually happened was it became a parallel banking system unto itself with no backing by gold or by physical cash issued by the u s treasury that balance clearly shifted and changed throughout the 80s when the pound crisis hit in 1992 central bankers were astounded by the massive offshore liquidity that easily dwarfed what they could answer with the balance of money had shifted dramatically yet economists and policymakers did not shift with it and the shadows are so opaque so impenetrable they escaped regulation so what we re describing here is almost an entire massive complete system that existed offshore and wholesale in the shadows because there was no regulatory authority no government authority over the conduct of this system it was essentially a self contained system that operated beyond the reach of everybody the real action transpires in the shadows this shadow banking system runs on dollars as the respiration runs on oxygen as autos run on gasoline as politics runs on lies as much as 80 of international trade is invoiced in the dollar and this dollar participates in nearly 90 of all foreign exchange trades meantime nearly 40 of the world s debt is issued in dollars and offshore banks sit upon perhaps 18 trillion in dollar denominated international liabilities yes the real action transpires in the shadows snider the world needs dollars for the purposes of a global reserve currency it gets them from this system you want to swap yen for u s treasuries credit based dollars you want to swap yen for singapore bonds credit based dollars a company in brazil wants to ship china raw material credit based dollars a firm in europe is trying to build capacity in thailand credit based dollars the dollar is the world s true reserve currency therefore problems in it are going to be problems shared by the whole interconnected global economy a way out of triffin s dilemma can we conclude the shadow banking system offers the way out of triffin s dilemma after all its thirst for dollars is seemingly infinite and the dollar packs a wallop despite record debts and infinitely mushroomed deficits so turn your focus away from the central banks argues snider is the russian central bank hoarding gold in conspiracy against the dollar is the people s bank of china shoveling dollars overboard is the bank of japan losing its yen for dollars be not deceived as long as the shadow banking system runs on dollars so does the world unless and until the banking system moves away from dollars diversifying national reserve holdings means absolutely nothing nothing despite a decade s worth of noise fury and quite often heartache there is simply no realistic alternative we are stuck with this arrangement largely because the media politicians central bankers etc don t know a thing about it but perhaps each american should fall upon both knees and thank fortune for this shadow banking system it may be the central pillar holding the dollar up high regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning

s market has tightened very quickly so the price appreciation is no surprise if the market stays this tight we could see further acceleration he added jason mercer the real estate board s chief market analyst agreed strong population growth in the gta coupled with declining negotiated mortgage rates resulted in sales accounting for a greater share of listings in november and throughout the second

with brent d griffiths the ticker there s little chance that impeachment will remove president trump from office but one wall street strategist notes that it could complicate his reelection path economic forecasters have predicted that trump should cruise to a second term next year given the strength of the economy but a new analysis from jpmorgan asset management suggests that the onslaught of coverage of impeachment and trump s efforts to pressure ukraine to investigate his political rivals is drowning out the positive economic news he needs to win the dynamic highlights the challenge facing the white house as it pursues a split screen strategy depicting trump as focused on his agenda while congressional democrats press ahead with impeachment michael cembalest jpmorgan asset management s chairman of market and investment strategy lays out the quandary facing trump in a pair of charts first cembalest crunched a raft of data to conclude trump is heading into the 2020 campaign with the strongest economic tail winds going back to 1896 the measures blended more than a century of readings on consumer price inflation the jobless rate the change in that rate per capita economic growth how that growth compares to that of other leading economies stock market returns and home price appreciation among others but viewers tuning into primetime cnn and msnbc from 8 to 10 p m over a year long period ending in september saw barely a blip about positive economic developments instead the mueller investigation and russian interference in the 2016 election overwhelmingly dominated those airwaves followed by coverage of trump s personal conduct in office then immigration issues then administration corruption trump critics will contend the president has earned that coverage through his behavior while he merely inherited an economic expansion that has mostly continued apace cembalest mostly agrees trump deserves the coverage he s getting from those news outlets he tells me advertisement but he wrote the note to illustrate something he observed in his own home his wife a devoted msnbc watcher hears a version of the news that bears little resemblance to what he sees all day studying market and economic indicators the divide both fuels and is fueled by a broader balkanization of the electorate that suggests the traditional relationship between the economy s performance and the president s political fortunes may be breaking down by matching historical economic data to presidential election outcomes economists at moody s analytics oxford economics and trend macrolytics have all projected trump will secure reelection more easily than his first win barring a serious economic downturn but the more relevant point of comparison may be 2018 an analysis cembalest conducted after the election found that measured against the strength of the economy republicans suffered the worst midterm losses by a president s party in at least a century the finding could reframe trump s political incentives in waging his trade war conventional wisdom has held the president keeps up the fight at his own peril since it remains arguably the greatest menace to continued economic growth advertisement but if he can galvanize his base by stoking confrontation with the chinese and that outweighs whatever economic costs it brings it may be in trump s interest to keep putting off a deal i think that s true up to a point cembalest says arguing if the president goes forward with december 15 tariffs heavily targeting consumer goods i think he d lose them because the global recession that could result would offset the benefits from the base he has to figure out how to conduct the trade war with lower stakes some support for the theory comes from across the atlantic italo colantone and piero stanig both of bocconi university in milan study election results in 15 european countries per the economist they find that areas facing greater competition from chinese imports were more likely to vote for nationalist parties more from that piece titled does the economy affect elections anymore the old straightforward relationship between the economic cycle and elections could yet return but the implication of the new research is that support for populism is a deeper rooted feature of western economies voters care less than they used to about the economy

released a plan to raise 3 2 trillion in taxes over 10 years to pay for his domestic spending proposals including on health care and climate as he seeks to cast himself as the fiscal moderate in the democratic presidential primary amid pressure from his liberal rivals my colleague jeff stein reports biden s plan calls for raising the tax rate paid by corporations from 21 percent to 28 percent still below the 35 percent level in place before the 2017 gop tax cut law he also plans to raise 800 billion from new taxes on capital gains primarily paid by investors as well as 400 billion from imposing a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that aims to ensure big firms pay at least some taxes among other measures the federal government is projected to bring in 3 8 trillion in revenue in 2021 so biden s plan would aim to boost tax revenue by less than 10 percent in the first year how it compares the plan first reported by bloomberg news highlights the fissures in the democratic primary by stopping short of many more aggressive tax measures pitched by sens elizabeth warren mass and bernie sanders i vt for example warren and sanders have proposed more than 20 trillion in new taxes over 10 years at least six times as much as biden s biden for instance rejects the liberals calls for levying new wealth taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires that would vastly reduce their fortunes and clout less aggressive than it could have been biden also opts not to adopt more aggressive measures that had been under consideration by some advisers to his campaign including a

politicians like to call it the texas miracle since 2000 total output of goods and services in the state expanded by nearly 65 percent outpacing the rest of the country by a large margin texas even weathered the great recession without suffering much of a downturn the dallas fort worth economy has been on the same upward trajectory it wobbled a bit in the early 2000s but roared ahead of and after the recession overall it has done just about as well as the state increasing output by 62 percent since 2000 and opening a large gap between it and the rest of the nation s metropolitan statistical areas texas and dfw stand out on job creation too both have increased employment by well above 40 percent in the past couple of decades doubling the pace of the rest of the country can north texas and the state continue to outpace the nation next year and into the rest of the 2020s peering into a crystal ball we see that risks to future prosperity emerge in large part from what may happen outside the state events and trends over which texans have little say inside the state it s hard to find many signs of trouble ahead particularly for the next year or so labor shortages vex some industries and housing prices are way up in dfw and other energized msas but the highly touted texas model still offers a clear path to continuing prosperity what got us here should help keep us going at least for 2020 but texas and dfw can t sail on sublimely ignoring what dangers lurk outside the state warning signs of impending recession have already flashed elsewhere in the world economic growth has slowed in asia and europe the brexit time bomb continues to tick toward a disorderly conclusion president trump s wide ranging trade wars could block texas manufacturers overseas sales and raise prices for key foreign inputs as for texas mexico connection it faces its greatest challenge in four decades with the erosion of support for freer trade in both the united states and mexico the oil and gas industry illustrates the inside outside dichotomy within texas producers have seen spectacular success in recent years sending texas output to new heights and pushing the nation to the brink of energy independence from outside the state however the oil industry faces three challenges unlikely to go away anytime soon the low global oil and gas prices brought on by newfound abundance the declining prices for solar wind and other competitive sources of alternative energy and the growing political clout of anti fossil fuel forces in the rest of the country and overseas the texas economy is probably strong enough to shake off some potential shocks just as it did with the 2014 plunge in oil prices it s not hard though to envision scenarios that would set texas economy reeling here s just one trade wars intensify with tit for tat retaliation throwing the world into recession if all that happens texas probably won t continue to grow while the rest of the nation suffers not this time not with the state s economy more like the rest of the united states in terms of production and employment right now the probabilities of these kinds of scenarios are low but they could rise as stresses build beyond 2020 if recession comes the recent past suggests the state will probably have a less severe one than the nation as whole inner economic strength explaining the state s enviable two decade record of growth and job creation starts with the texas model of low taxes and small government the idea is to keep burdens on the economy light giving markets the fullest possible sway and leaving most decisions on production investment work and innovation to the private sector just about every state crows about its business climate but the economic freedom of north america report compiled by smu s o neil center colleague dean stansel shows where states really stand in the 2018 report texas ranked third among u s states in economic freedom its score a healthy 25 percent above the average for the other states the gap between texas and other states has been consistent for nearly four decades stansel also tracks economic freedom for msas and the results are as positive for north texas as they are for the state as a whole dfw ranks among the leading msas in economic freedom and it has maintained the same decades long gap of about 25 percent over other urban areas a high degree of economic freedom spurs growth and faster job creation that has been well documented by economic studies of states and msas for texas it was also crucial to an epochal transformation from an oil economy to a more diversified one when oil ruled texas economy the state boomed when prices were high and went bust when they were low the 1980s oil price collapse led to a withering downturn and oil prices didn t recover for two decades in relatively short order however something extraordinary happened economic growth returned to texas and strongly why economic freedom an economy in the doldrums recovers by transferring resources from troubled sectors to more promising ones low taxes and small government allowed the private sector to find new opportunities and reap the rewards at the same time economic freedom attracted new resources from outside the state with a steady in migration of employers and workers the result was a rapid diversification of the regional and texas economies graeme montgomery graeme montgomery in the last two decades texas and dfw have raced ahead of the pack diverse economies draw strength from a variety of sectors some will usually be on the upswing reducing the drag of those not doing well overall booms may be tamer but the destructive busts become less likely the upshot is greater stability and steadier growth texas still has a large oil sector and it s healthy right now but education professional and business services healthcare wholesale trade construction and recreational services have also been growing at above average rates with finance a hair behind they aren t overly dependent on the oil business and can continue growing even when prices are low for both texas and dfw today s inner economic strength comes from these two concepts a tradition of economic freedom and four decades of increasing diversity neither is in jeopardy so texans can expect these advantages to endure chaotic foreign relations what s going on inside the state makes the best case for long term optimism about texas and dallas fort worth it should be tempered by clouds on the horizon the most immediate concern centers on a national recession that would bring an end a 10 year plus growth spurt the longest in u s history going into 2020 national indicators appear largely positive including modest growth still solid job creation and low inflation but few expansions die of old age they re more likely to end because of some policy blunder and right now the most likely potential shock might emerge from president trump s ongoing trade disputes with china and other countries overseas sales have been growing faster for texas than the nation as a whole for at least the past two decades the state is the nation s no 1 exporter selling 237 billion overseas in 2018 trade troubles have already started pinching texas economy a trade war spiraling out of control could topple the u s into recession and take texas down with it texas has been expanding business ties with its neighbor to the south since mexico opened its economy to foreign trade and investment in the 1980s about 35 percent of the state s exports now end up in mexico just one sign of the country s importance to texas secure since the north american free trade agreement in 1994 the state s mexico connection now looks iffy mexico s new president andrés manuel lópez obrador doesn t share his predecessors enthusiasm for keeping mexico open to foreign business trump s hostility to nafta has abated in recent months but the proposed united states mexico canada agreement could face a tough ratification fight in a washington driven by partisan divisions any interruption in business with mexico the wall would be bad news for texas but that s likely an issue beyond 2020 ongoing labor pressures the local and texas economies need an expanding labor force to feed growth and for the past two decades migrants domestic and foreign have arrived to fill the jobs will they continue to come in sufficient numbers construction hospitality and other industries are already facing difficulties finding the workers they need to expand their operations two reasons to worry that the situation might get worse rather than better the rising cost of texas housing and the possibility of more restrictive immigration policies in addition to a vibrant economy one of the msa s advantages over the past two decades has been an affordable cost of living with housing prices a major factor in the u s expansion before the great recession housing prices rose sharply across most of the country but not in dfw this time around local housing prices are rising at a slightly faster pace than the top 12 msas the top 100 msas and even all other msas if housing costs continues to grow workers will become less willing to relocate to dfw without an expanding labor supply companies already here will expand more slowly and fewer new ones will arrive labor shortages could also worsen because of tightening immigration policies texas depends on foreign born workers for 22 percent of its labor force compared with 17 percent for the nation in dfw the professionals born overseas made up about 20 percent of workers with bachelor s degrees or higher also above the national average texas needs more of these workers especially the highly skilled and trump s across the board hostility to immigrants threatens to weaken the state s economy the bottom line some of the threats to texas economy may not amount to much as events move forward and others might prove more ominous than they appear today the election of 2020 might resolve issues like the trade wars but it might escalate others such as the likelihood for anti fossil fuel legislation none of the risks are immediate and the texas and dfw economies are likely to continue growing in 2020 perhaps at a slightly slower pace the greater risks await in the later years of the decade it may help to remember that texas bounced back from the oil debacle of the 1980s and emerged stronger than ever as long as the state maintains its high economic freedom it will adapt and find the next opportunity w michael cox

allocation operational excellence and leveraging our competitive advantages drives economic asset development significant margin growth and a strong balance sheet canadian natural s president tim mckay added the company is unique sustainable and robust driven by our large long life low decline asset base effective and efficient operations disciplined capital allocation and a strong balance sheet our 2020 capital budget of 4 05 billion delivers targeted production of approximately 1 172 000 boe d at mid point of guidance resulting in approximately 9 production per share growth in a curtailed environment as we allocate capital to the highest return projects and progress projects that add production and value in 2020 and beyond these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program we will continue to manage within our curtailment optimization strategy and target to maintain capital flexibility by aligning production growth with improved market access we are hopeful that the curtailment levels will be reduced or eliminated as we progress through 2020 safe reliable and low cost operations continue to be a focus for the company as we capture synergies increase margins and maximize value for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond due to the alberta government s recently announced elimination of curtailment for certain conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has increased its 2020 capital budget by approximately 250 million over 2019 levels adding approximately 60 drilling locations across alberta

result the company s year end debt metrics are targeted to strengthen further throughout 2020 to approximately 1 6x debt to adjusted ebitda and approximately 35 debt to book capitalization at year end our financial strength gives us the flexibility to deliver on our plan and continue to drive long term shareholder value highlights of the 2020 budget the company s large balanced and diverse asset base is complemented by an extensive network of owned and operated infrastructure and is supported by a deep inventory of long life low decline assets and conventional and unconventional assets the company is focused on enhanced margin growth and high return on capital projects that can deliver leading free cash flow with production and value growth opportunities canadian natural s 2020 capital

natural gas these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program overall 2020 crude oil sco and ngl production is targeted to grow approximately 9 from 2019 levels and approximately 13 on a per share basis ranging from 910 000 bbl d to 970 000 bbl d long life low decline production is targeted to be approximately 77 of liquids production production is targeted to ramp up at the company s kirby north steam assisted gravity drainage sagd project throughout 2020 reaching targeted production capability of 40 000 bbl d in early 2021 at jackfish sagd production from pad additions with targeted production capability of approximately 21 000 bbl d will ramp up within curtailment levels with peak production targeted to be reached in 2022 at the company s oil sands mining upgrading assets canadian natural is targeting continued strong reliability which combined with continuous improvement will drive margin growth in 2020 natural gas production guidance is targeted to range between 1 360 mmcf d to 1 420 mmcf d as the company s natural gas capital investment in 2020 focuses on strategic land retention for future value generation due to the alberta government s recently announced elimination of curtailment for certain conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has increased its 2020 capital budget by approximately 250 million over 2019 levels adding approximately 60 drilling locations across alberta and putting 3 additional drilling rigs to work creating an additional approximate 1 000 full time

the 21st century is increasingly being defined by the need to respond to major social environmental and economic challenges these grand challenges include climate change demographic challenges and promotion of health and well being the challenge of generating sustainable and inclusive growth like other major policy challenges is complex systemic interconnected and urgent requiring insights from many perspectives for example poverty cannot be tackled without attention to the interconnections between nutrition health infrastructure and education as well as more traditional approaches such as redistributive tax and transfer policy grand challenge thinking is being applied across the world with some of the most interesting experiments around sustainability being driven by the needs of emerging economies both the rate and direction of investment and innovation are critical to all these challenges innovation and the finance that supports it are not neutral the role and characteristics of finance in innovation influence the shape and success of investments a green directed transition thus requires lining up policies to fuel radical changes in production distribution and consumption this cannot be achieved through initiatives in separate silos and discrete approaches but rather requires a new lens for economy wide green growth this has to be underpinned by long term patient finance which is willing to take risks and able to mobilize and crowd in other investors business investment reacts to the perception of where future opportunities lie the climate crisis can be both carrot and stick to create new economic possibilities at home and globally an economy wide reorientation harnessing industrial strategy a green transition will not happen on its own reliance on pure market pricing has led to a catastrophic overinvestment in carbon and an underinvestment in needed public systems and renewable energy sources the conventional view of what the state should do to foster innovation is simple it has to fix different types of market failures taking care of positive and negative externalities due to pricing failures and then get out of the way at best supposedly governments merely facilitate the economic dynamism of the private sector at worst their lumbering heavy handed and bureaucratic institutions actively inhibit it the fast moving risk loving and pioneering private sector by contrast is what really drives the type of innovation that creates economic growth yet a patchy approach did not get us the it revolution nor will it get us a green one in fact as i argued in the entrepreneurial state in silicon valley the state did not just fix private markets rather it took active risks investing in all the radical technologies that fuel our smart products today the internet gps touch screen and even siri the interaction with the private sector was dynamic and directed help us solve a problem whether to get the satellites to communicate internet was the answer or to aim missiles better gps was the solution today we have the opportunity to use this same level of strategic investment and dynamic partnering for social not only technological problems and this is harder but just as urgent a key lesson is that government often needs to take risks precisely because business is risk averse and reacts to opportunities this means investments across the entire innovation chain from basic research e g national science foundation to areas that fuel science industry linkages national nanotechnology initiative to the provision of long term finance e g through the small business innovation research program but also through the cia s public venture capital fund in q tel and further downstream through the ambitious use of procurement and demand side policies including those related to suburbanization back a century ago which is what allowed mass produced products to get fully deployed why not think about green today as a demand side pull for the it revolution this kind of public spending has proved transformative creating entirely new markets and sectors including the internet nanotechnology biotechnology and clean energy it strikes at the heart of the neoclassical economic theory taught in most economic classes which takes the view that the goal of government policy is simply to correct market failures green growth is more than just a carbon transition climate change impacts are felt from the financial sector to the creative economy and from conservation to health care industrial strategies are having a revival around the world increasingly developed by governments at the national and local level they are one antidote to the market failure approach that keeps the public sector insulated from the private sector and from the role of market creation today s industrial strategies must be about directing economies toward green growth through innovation and investment toward new techno economic paradigms as innovation economist carlota perez describes it rather than ending up as a static list of sectors to support industrial strategy must be about outlining the key problems a country is facing those related to clean growth health and mobility and steering investment led growth across many different sectors this means changing the way that procurement grants and loans work to be less about handouts to those that ask to be helped or bailed out it means picking not the winners but the willing those companies willing to transform toward a green form of growth this was recently seen in germany where the energiewende mission saw the steel sector receive support only if it lowered its material content which it did direct help to companies ready to commit to green growth needs to be coupled with taxation and regulatory strategies to deter carbon based energy vital infrastructure systems energy transport digital communications water and waste which generate interdependent long term high investment and high employment projects must be designed to direct economic activity toward green growth and must be aligned with a cross sectoral sustainable industrial strategy and taxation can be used to tax material more than labor and reward long term investors rather than those making billions from millisecond trades green growth goes well beyond a carbon transition climate change is felt from the creative economy to the financial sector it affects public health and health care and of course conservation is central nor can a green transition happen in one isolated economy it requires coordinated shifts in global value chains with global production chains even products that are greener at point of use such as electric cars require nonrenewable elements such as cobalt and lithium often extracted in countries with weak or nonexistent child labor and human rights laws private sector owners of these supply chains and public regulators must co design the new system policies aimed at big societal challenges require confronting the direction of growth to become more inclusive and sustainable but this is very hard to do within the traditional framework that sees policy as simply fixing market failures or simply de risking and facilitating value creation challenge led growth requires a new tool kit one that is more based on market shaping and market co creating industrial policies have always been composed of both a horizontal and a vertical element horizontal policies have historically been focused on skills infrastructure and education while vertical policies have focused on sectors like transport health or energy or technologies these two traditional approaches roughly embody differing schools of economics neoclassical economics inspired horizontal policies focusing on supply side factors and inputs and evolutionary economics inspired policies putting emphasis on demand side factors and systemic interactions although certain sectors might be more suited for sector specific vertical strategies the grand challenges expressed in societal goals like the sustainable development goals are cross sectoral by nature hence we cannot simply apply sectoral or vertical approaches to such challenges the idea of structural renewal through directing innovation found an original expression in albert hirschman s idea of development through unbalanced growth hirschman argued that consciously keeping development unbalanced meaning letting some economic activities develop faster than others keeps development momentum going as it enforces cross sectoral learning and experimentation given that firms often base their investments on the perception of future growth opportunities vertical or unbalanced growth policies can help to drive future business investment and as hirschman argued induce cross sectoral positive feedback loops in this view innovations are economy wide learning and self discovery processes that help companies hedge their balance sheets and provide analytical linkages between macroeconomic financial stability and microeconomic firm behavior if firms are confident about future technological and market opportunities they will invest and seek to innovate if they are not confident or see few market opportunities they will not invest or innovate this requires both direct investments such as those provided by arpa e in the department of energy fueling new innovations in areas like battery storage and then the certainty provided by government led energy pricing strategies such as feed in tariffs guaranteed prices paid to green energy producers which then give private companies the confidence to expand renewable energy capacity therefore any industrial strategy should not only seek to improve the conditions under which firms invest but also aim to stimulate demand and increase business expectations about where future growth opportunities might lie it is interesting that a company like tesla has benefited from supply side strategies of the u s government receiving a 500 million guaranteed loan from the department of energy and demand side policies in scandinavia where a large percentage of the cars are sold due to taxation regimes that favor the use of electric cars climate innovation approaches need to be cross sectoral harnessing supply and demand innovation and procurement and public and private actors a green new deal cannot operate only within sectors like renewable energy through focusing purely on decarbonizing automobiles or with any other sector specific initiatives in a vacuum instead we require innovative transformations across all sectors one of the largest shifts ever attempted by humans markets will not find the green direction on their own only when there is a stable and consistent direction for investment will regulation and innovation converge along a green trajectory business does not invest unless it sees an opportunity for growth so turning mitigation into opportunities for investment and innovation is key this requires more than tax incentives or public subsidies it requires bold investments like those witnessed in roosevelt s new deal in the wake of the great depression policy and people centered approaches in the united states when president obama bemoaned in 2011 that we live and do business in the information age but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black and white tv he was pointing out a lack of bold institutional innovations over the last half century it is not a coincidence that the information age was heralded and funded by the u s government more specifically what makes our modern devices smart was bold government investment into missions specific urgent problems that need to be solved in democracy in america 1835 alexis de tocqueville famously admired american townships whose budgets are neither methodical nor uniform de tocqueville valorized then innovative governance institutions such as elected officials for their power to constantly rejuvenate communities one of humankind s greatest feats occurred when imagination common purpose and a systematic approach to problem solving won out over siloed thinking and anxiety about where the money would come from at the heart of green growth is the role of citizens the questions of who who will benefit from the green growth outputs who takes on the transition risk are key the cross sectoral systemic supply and demand side change needed means that we have an opportunity for inclusive sustainable economic growth that brings everyone along with it including traditionally overlooked groups working in poor quality jobs those working in the old carbon economy should not simply be displaced but be re skilled as part of the transition unions should be at the negotiating table thinking in forward looking ways to make sure the green economy is co created and co shaped rather than handed down from above inclusive growth requires understanding the deeply embedded nature of markets both at the national level and in a place based manner markets are embedded in institutions and norms and incumbent policy processes help shape the kind of outcomes that result to strengthen and reform the institutions and the rules at play requires ambitious innovation in the policies themselves in the institutional configuration in the instruments that are used on the ground and in new metrics that capture the dynamic effects of policies there is a need to address all four dimensions ambitious moon shot policy frameworks for inclusive growth new institutional configurations needed for such policies dynamic organizational capabilities and new metrics to understand and monitor the dynamic effects of missions this does not only happen at a national level or through international direction and agreements states and cities are catalysts of green growth helped by civil society support in the u s where the trump administration has defaulted 3 629 leaders including governors tribal leaders faith leaders and business executives signed the we are still in pledge to support climate action the institute i founded and direct at university college london the institute for innovation and public purpose iipp has been working with national industrial strategies and local officials in different cities including manchester u k which is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2038 one of the most rapid timelines in europe to develop a mission road map with a cross sector model that delivers a citizen centric bottom up approach this has become part of the city region s local industrial strategy one of the first trailblazing strategies of this type in the u k sharing risks and rewards for the green transition we need entirely new flexible agile and open minded institutions and structures to take on uncertain innovation challenges there are several examples of these institutions in the u s successful mission oriented organizations include darpa in the department of defense and arpa e in the department of energy darpa is an excellent example of public funding bringing about innovation the progenitor of the internet was arpanet a program funded by darpa in the 1960s it was an absurdly high powered team of brainiacs that started at the advanced research projects agency energy arpa e in the mid 2000s that agency was specifically designed as a darpa clone bringing mission oriented investment to the energy sector the intelligence advanced research projects activity iarpa was launched with an intelligence tech mandate in 2006 expand ap images president kennedy takes a close look at the nation s moon program during a visit to cape canaveral florida november 16 1963 arpa e takes on the same organizational mindset of darpa both expecting and tolerating failure like darpa arpa e does not set its own research agenda at top down level instead it draws on the priorities set by industry experts and academics who are working on high risk cutting edge technical solutions if the public sector takes risks it will of course also make mistakes any venture capitalist will have to accept failures for every success to naysayers the failure of public funding for any reason is often considered indicative of an inability to pick winners or distortion of otherwise optimal markets yet many of the successes go unnoticed and even result in public rewards being privatized the department of energy attracted criticism for providing a guaranteed loan of 535 million to the solar power startup solyndra which went bankrupt once the price of silicon chips fell dramatically leaving taxpayers to pick up the bill however few critics acknowledged that a similar guaranteed loan 465 million supported tesla for the development of the model s electric car which led to success even fewer have ever questioned why the government accepted early payment of the underlying loan earning 12 million back instead of negotiating stock options that could have been worth almost 1 4 billion according to some estimates had the energy department chosen the stock options the royalties retained could have covered the solyndra losses many times over and continued to fund promising ventures this shows the importance of government s high risk funding for achieving renewable energy technologies this example also sheds light on the set of strategic decisions that policymakers face regarding the selection of profit sharing mechanisms suitable for each context profit sharing mechanisms may include repayable grants with profit sharing via royalties on sales or equity stakes public venture capital funds enabling royalties on equity debt financing convertible into equity and other sorts of funding mixing elements of equity and debt hence besides the timing for the public sector to reap any rewards a critical distinction concerns the revenue basis upon which public and private actors agree to share ranging from low end intellectual property to high value capital gains as the solyndra versus tesla case illustrates the state of california is developing a regional level mechanism for sharing the profits of the tech sector in 2016 an investment fund was created to be owned by all citizens with or without pensions and with the potential over time to invest into housing infrastructure and other state priorities the need for a climate moon shot last july was the 50th anniversary of the first lunar landing the moon shot one of humankind s greatest feats was a triumph of imagination common purpose and a systemic approach to problem solving president john f kennedy s resolve won out over anxiety about where the money would come from and siloed thinking greening the economy is not a question of picking a series of outcomes that are worthwhile only for some market participants to the disadvantage of others climate orientation must be a win win strategic approach for all participants public private and civil actors alike need to take on the mindset of long run outcomes and profits rather than short term gains particularly against the background of financial stability and transition risks that make up the landscape of climate change industrial strategies don t just need grand challenges we require moon shots imagine having leaders who would proudly declare in the spirit of john kennedy we choose to fight climate change in this decade not because it is easy but because it is hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win

from uberization to enhanced public mobility for all public goods december 5 2019 sean sweeney and john treat we have shown that the defense improvement and expansion of public transport is essential if we are to help control and then reduce transport related emissions we have also shown how the current neoliberal policy framework must be rejected in order for public transport is to fulfill its true potential this applies to both transport policy specifically and the obvious shortcomings of the public private partnership approach alongside pressures to privatize part or all of public transport systems and it applies at the level of macroeconomic management the neoliberal framework has failed to impede the rise of emissions and will continue to do so until it is completely rescinded we have also shown how the rapid proliferation of small individually owned evs is by no means guaranteed to take place at the speed and scale necessary to make a major contribution toward decarbonization the disproportionate attention given by policy makers reflects a car centered approach to transport policy and this approach is seldom influenced by the lived reality of enormous numbers of people around the world who face increasingly burdensome travel in order simply to get to work often involving long stressful and energy sapping commutes or to carry out other daily tasks shopping accessing healthcare or education etc here it is important to keep in mind that the vast majority of these workers are statistically more likely to be killed or injured by a car than they are likely to own one and the lack of accessible public mobility has made car ownership a necessity for millions of others the yellow vest protests in france that broke out in late 2018 reported to involve large numbers of people from outside urban areas who have been pushed ever further from city centers was described in the new york times as revealing a crisis of mobility in all its forms the real lives of billions of ordinary people are often rendered invisible by the me focused narrative promoted by large car corporations who cater almost exclusively to the world s more affluent people and emerging markets meanwhile the idea of healthy and vibrant communities connected by modern and comfortable public transport networks has no place in this profoundly anti social discourse regarding climate change the evidence suggests that modern public transport systems remain the best option in terms of advancing transport related decarbonization goals but the case for the expansion of public transport does not rest on climate concerns alone as noted above the policy mainstream understands the need to provide safe secure high quality and accessible mobility and the unique role public transport can play in meeting those needs there is no need to repeat those arguments here the international transport workers federation itf s work is outstanding in this respect and it also shows how worker concerns can be addressed in ways that also serve the broader public good in this section we consider how public transport systems are being challenged by the proliferation of ride hailing and ride sharing companies like uber for present purposes ride sharing or trip sharing or shared mobility refers to rides or trips that are actually shared between different individuals or different parties and paid separately whereas ride hailing refers to any app based system to secure a ride from a taxi or other on demand ride service from a transport network company tnc these rides may or may not be shared the implications of this challenge are yet to be fully assessed but public transport advocates are already issuing dire warnings with regard to the disruptive impact that tncs are having on existing public transport systems and the threat these impacts pose to the future of public transport although not always central to the discussion the climate related implications of this threat are likely to be extremely serious on current trends there is a real risk that public transport s contribution to addressing climate change could dramatically decrease precisely at a time when it needs to increase by orders of magnitude union responses to the growing presence of tncs have understandably focused on worker related issues but future responses could be made more compelling if climate related arguments were also included this would also allow unions to make a case for both strengthening the presence and extending the reach of public transport while at the same time reducing vehicle miles traveled vmts and emissions in urban areas there is reason to believe that recently developed app based or platform technologies can be harnessed in ways that could make a significant contribution to improving and expanding public transport but the struggle to harness these technologies for the public good must be viewed as part of the struggle to protect improve and qualitatively expand traditional modes of public transport we call this enhanced public mobility because it seeks to improve public transport in ways that can take full advantage of some of recent technological changes and innovations public transport authorities are already making some progress in this respect but the incorporation of these technologies risks being obstructed by political attacks on public transport systems as well as the loss of revenue that has in many cases resulted from the rise of unregulated predatory mobility as noted elsewhere in this report traditional modes still have an extremely important role to play in achieving sustainable mobility for all finding the right balance between traditional modes trains buses etc and the need for low carbon first and last mile mobility will require consistent input from drivers riders and the communities they serve it will also require making sure ridership data is used to improve public transport and generally serve the public good and not as data are used today to the detriment of public systems therefore the fight for public transport and the fight against climate change will involve a struggle for ownership and control over these technologies so that they can be used to complement and improve the public transport services of the future rather than displace or undermine them in this respect the future of urban mobility stands at a crossroads if current trends in new mobility or uberization continue the challenge to decarbonize road transport will become even more formidable than it already is waiting on the platform urban transport systems are currently undergoing dramatic changes mobile phones have enabled web and app based platforms and these have led to a dramatic growth in ride hailing and ride sharing services these and similar app based innovations have spurred an explosion of both scheduled and on demand transport options and services the use of these options has grown dramatically for example uber reached 1 billion trips worldwide by the end of 2015 and 2 billion by mid 2016 by may 2017 uber had clocked up 5 billion trips the number of uber like companies has also proliferated hiring perhaps millions of drivers in total uber claims to have employed 3 million drivers worldwide and lyft 1 4 million drivers tncs are also growing in the global south in 2017 didi reportedly carried out up to 25 million daily trips across 400 cities in china for a total of 7 3 billion rides for the year in southeast asia a tnc company called grab outcompeted uber buying the latter s business in key countries and driving the ride hailing giant out of several fast growing markets such as indonesia and thailand aside from ride sharing there has been a boom in new startup companies providing new mobility services these include route planning applications like google maps and citymapper that compete for users by integrating data for a wide variety of transport modes and options to provide a range of alternatives and real time journey duration estimates as well as making visible options for ride hailing and ride sharing services citymapper s smart ride relies on a fleet of minivans operating on a fixed network coordinating passenger pick ups and drop offs in what has been called essentially a cross between a taxi and a bus other startups are launching ride sharing apps dockless bike hires and responsive bus networks in cities around the world transport policy makers and urban planners are today looking at ways to respond to these new forms of mostly unregulated mobility some studies have suggested that public transport systems were improved as a result of applications run by third party operators that make it easy for people to buy tickets and plan their journeys and this can lead to an increase in ridership they see the potential to integrate these new services into public transport systems on a p3 basis where the public transport authorities contract with private companies a 2017 working paper claimed that companies that harness and use data and technology to streamline the dispatching and tracking of trips monitor user experience arrange services and handle payments can make public transport more attractive and also more competitive by providing dynamic trip planning and ticketing services private companies can encourage city dwellers to take multimodal journeys by enhancing access to information and simplifying ticket purchases this may be so but ride sharing and ride hailing companies like uber and lyft are qualitatively different from platforms that offer these planning and ticketing services in that ride sharing and ride hailing companies offer for some an alternative to using public transport and this could pull passengers away from using mass public transport systems the impact on public transport the case of the united states many public transport advocates have already concluded that the impact of companies like uber and lyft on public transport systems will be mostly disruptive and perhaps catastrophically so one commentator has stated my fear is that uber is going to lead to a cycle of cataclysmic disinvestment they will try to siphon off the most profitable customers and leave public transport a rump service in terms of the us there is some evidence to suggest that ride sharing is indeed eating into public transport ridership levels and some local authorities are looking to companies like uber and lyft to provide mobility as an alternative to maintaining low ridership public transport routes and they are willing to subsidize users a 2016 survey of seven us cities found a 6 per cent reduction in the use of public buses following the introduction of ride hailing services and a 3 per cent reduction in the use of light rail the researchers concluded current evidence suggests that ride hailing is pulling more people away from public transit in cities rather than adding riders a 2017 paper by the institute of transportation studies at the university california davis found that the activities of uber and similar companies contributed to a 6 per cent drop in public transit use according to that same study ridership on public mass transit is down in nearly every major us city and these declines have been associated with the increase in ride sharing for example ridership has declined significantly on san francisco s new bart train line to the airport as uber and lyft saw their ridership to the airport rise almost six fold the ridership decline led to bart bay area rapid transit the regional mass transit system revenue falling under budget for the year by 3 6 million it took san francisco a decade to secure the billions in state and federal funding to extend this line to the airport and now its usage is being undermined by ridesharing the study also cites irregular or unreliable public transport as one of the primary reasons for using a tnc like uber or lyft finding that users were disproportionately young better educated and earned above 35 000 per year roughly the median annual income for this age group nearly half of respondents said that if a ridesharing service had not been available they would have taken a bus train bike or simply walked it also found that if rideshare users did not have that option up to 61 per cent of their trips either would not have been made at all or would have been done via public transport bike or on foot looking at global trends the institute for transportation and development policy itdp has concluded that the negative impacts go beyond reducing the number of passengers using public transport the expansion of new mobility services could lead to worsening traffic congestion more vehicle accidents added air pollution and other unwelcome effects which some cities have attempted to forestall with regulation a 2015 study by the international transport forum itf not to be confused with itf the global union federation found that a shift from walking and cycling to shared vehicle travel could result in a significant increase in vehicle miles traveled thus increasing congestion and travel times even as vehicle occupancies increase in new york utilization rates the time drivers spend driving billable trips divided by the total time they spend in their cars with the app running were about 58 per cent for uber and lyft in the second half of 2017 with juno s utilization about 50 per cent in london both taxis and tncs were exempt from congestion charges although revenues from london s congestion charge were used by the city to support bus network improvements and other projects however the exemption was removed in april 2019 and uber announced it would raise its fares in order to offset the impact of the charge the availability of uber and similar companies has already led to decisions by city authorities to reject making improvements to public transport systems and to subsidize riders to use uber and similar companies instead some authorities have offered incentives to low income people to use car sharing services like car2go as an alternative to providing and maintaining public transport systems however in california less than 1 per cent of households earning under 35 000 hold a car share membership compared to 2 4 per cent of households earning over 100 000 even where car share vehicles are physically available barriers such as a lack of credit card lower computer or internet access or language barriers may inhibit low income carless residents from participating in car sharing going for broke predatory mobility there are clear signs that tncs and their backers in silicon valley see urban transport as a lucrative future market and view traditional public transport as competing for the same potential market share the idea that public transport should make way for private ride hailing companies is aggressively promoted by the industry uber ceo dara khosrowshahi s declaration i want to run the bus systems for a city sends a clear privatization message tesla s elon musk has called public transport a pain in the ass which he hopes to replace with his hyperloop alternative a futuristic model of transport based on tubes with reduced air pressure through which passenger or freight capsules would be whisked at high speed and a model widely seen as highly impractical new mobility entrepreneurs would therefore oppose the expansion of public transport and happy to celebrate the demise of existing public transport systems whether or not they are aware of it these new mobility entrepreneurs are echoing the anti public diatribes of far right voices that see public spending on public transport as a waste taxpayer money on unpopular outdated technology like trains and buses just as the world is moving toward cleaner driverless vehicles but major questions remain about the financial viability of uber and other tncs a 2016 analysis of uber s financial performance by transport sector expert hubert horan found that despite being the most highly valued private company in the world the company was also losing more money than any startup in history in the form of 2 billion annually of investor funds which were effectively subsidizing rider fares in order to capture the urban mobility market as horan put it at the time uber has been aggressively pursuing global industry dominance in the belief that the industry has been radically transformed into a winner take all market for 2017 the company posted losses of 2 2 billion and then 1 8 billion for 2018 with concerns over slowing growth of revenues in other words the company continues to hemorrhage cash with no clear end game to achieving durable profitability in essence uber s strategy has been to gamble that it could retain sufficient investor backing to drive out all competitors and then recapitalize through a public stock listing initial public offering or ipo and use its monopoly position to dramatically increase ride prices recoup losses reward its venture investors and begin operating at a profit based on far higher ride prices for consumers according to horan s 2016 analysis riders were paying on average just 41 per cent of the costs of each ride at that time in the words of one commentator after burning through 10 7 billion in nine years uber still hasn t found a way to turn a profit horan has also reported how in march 2019 lyft s public filing documents provided a picture of a company with negative cash flow growing annual losses that have reached nearly a billion dollars and declining rates of revenue growth essentially the same picture he had previously found for uber according to horan lyft s prospectus provides absolute no data demonstrating that it has the ability to profitably raise prices over time increase operational efficiency or win significantly greater market share lyft makes no attempt to lay out a possible path to future profitability or even a timeline as to when breakeven might be achieved policy makers who are being swayed by the idea that partnering with tncs offers a cheap alternative to traditional public transport may soon have to confront the fact that the financial social and ecological costs associated with tncs far outweigh their benefits according to one commentator uber s business model is to subsidize fares and flood streets with taxi like cars in order to grab market share and eventually market pricing power most customers who love uber don t realize that the company actually subsidizes about 50 per cent of the cost of every ride so every time a passenger gets into the car they are only paying half of the actual cost the other half is paid by uber s wealthy venture capital funders it is worth noting that car hailing tncs like uber and lyft have also been buying other shared mobility service companies like lime that provide electric scooters or jump and motivate bikes etc while these actions are typically presented in terms of providing one stop convenience to users it is not difficult to see how they also fit well with a business model aimed at establishing a monopoly over mobility options with the aim of reaping the potential future rewards of such a dominant position unions vs uber for unions changes in urban transport have unfolded so rapidly that it has been hard for them to keep up and the speed of change appears to be accelerating for example when the itf the union federation was preparing its report on transport workers and climate change in 2009 uber had just been formed so far unions have rightly been concerned about the impacts of app based ride hailing companies like uber lyft juno and others on the wages and conditions of the drivers working for such services drivers typically use their own vehicles to provide the service with a fixed portion of the fee paid as a commission to the driver but unions have also been concerned about the impacts of such new services on drivers for traditional taxi services in new york city drivers for tncs such as uber and lyft and other tncs outnumber traditional yellow cab drivers by a ratio of 4 to 1 and their rapid proliferation has been identified as a contributing factor in the suicides of several yellow cab taxi drivers in late 2017 the new york taxi workers alliance nytwa joined with allies to get the city to raise the hourly wages of the 80 000 drivers working for tncs the union stated with more than 80 000 uber cars on our roads no driver can get enough fares to feed our families uber created this crisis of congestion on our streets uber caused this crisis of plummeting incomes for all drivers and uber is worsening the mta crisis siphoning income away from public transit by subsidizing its passenger fares more recently a june 2018 study found ninety per cent of new york city s app based drivers are immigrants and only one out of every six has a four year college degree driving is their only job for two thirds of the drivers eighty per cent acquired their vehicle to enter the industry and would risk losing their investment if they switched to working in another industry there are also wider equity concerns about the impacts of such systems as they become increasingly enmeshed in urban mobility while other inequalities still exist because such services generally require users to have a smartphone and credit card substantial numbers of people are currently unable to use them even in the us roughly one sixth 17 of adults do not have a smartphone and an even higher proportion of households have no credit card these figures are almost certainly significantly higher in the developing world which is precisely where motorization and urbanization are growing the fastest unions in major cities around the world have rallied to the defense of both the workers who drive the buses and subways in major cities and the public transport systems that employ them and serve communities unions in italy spain the uk and elsewhere have also been involved in legal battles to regulate companies like uber or to ban them altogether in some of these battles unions have formed alliances with taxi companies for example in may 2015 unions in the taxi sector in italy were successful in persuading a court to give uber fifteen days to take its smartphone platform offline the court determined that uber resembled a taxi service but its pricing system was not subject to the laws governing the traditional taxi services uber fares are lower because its drivers do not have to bear the expenses incurred by taxi license holders such as the cost of installing meters insurance and maintenance checks unions were concerned about the prospects for employment in the sector in terms of job quality security and remuneration as uber and similar companies have grown so have the legal efforts to have tncs comply with the kind of regulations that traditional taxi companies have been subjected to for decades in a growing number of instances cities and countries among them bulgaria denmark hungary and italy have banned uber altogether some drivers have even formed their own cooperatives as the international transport workers federation itf notes in austin texas taxi drivers digital and off line drivers organized together for better wages and working conditions they managed to set up their own taxi cooperative and uber and lyft even temporarily left the city the itf notes how other examples of cooperative taxis that were formed as an alternative to the exploitative practices of the likes of uber and lyft include union cab in madison wisconsin coop taxi in montreal canada and coop taxi in seoul south korea how do tncs and new mobility services impact emissions levels but what do the proliferation of tncs and new mobility services more broadly mean in terms of altering emissions levels and trajectories do these new forms of mostly urban mobility pose yet another obstacle in the way of reaching decarbonization goals or can they perhaps help in terms of reducing emissions by for example reducing individual car ownership uber and other tncs claim that ride hailing and ride sharing will reduce vehicle ownership and this in turn will produce environmental benefits at the global level 15 of the largest tncs came together in 2017 to launch the shared mobility principles for livable cities at the ecomobility world festival in taiwan claiming to lead the transition toward a zero emission future and renewable energy the group stated our goal is to align cities the private sector and civil society around a shared vision to ensure we harness the good and avoid the bad of new business models and technologies e share common goals like a commitment to zero emission vehicles and efficient use of urban roads researchers have only begun to assess the impact tncs have had or might have on emissions levels most of the studies that have explored this and similar questions have focused on individual cities and therefore it is difficult and perhaps unwise to draw any firm conclusions until more studies have been done but a more comprehensive 2017 study by the university of california uc suggests that if anything ride hailers in the us are not getting rid of their private cars as a result of the availability of tncs the report states contrary to recent research on the topic with this more representative sample of people in major cities we find that ride hailing users on average do not possess significantly fewer vehicles than their non ride hailing counterparts and have more vehicles than those who only use transit as the uc study notes from an environmental benefits perspective the reduction of vehicle ownership is primarily of value insomuch as it reduces vmts the conclusion of the study while conditional is this based on mode substitution and ride hailing frequency of use data we conclude that ride hailing is currently likely to contribute to growth in vmts a recent study by schaller consulting group is however less conditional in its conclusions the study reported that in the us at least ride hailing companies added 5 7 billion additional driving miles to city streets with 70 per cent of all trips taking place in nine large cities among those who use services like uber 60 per cent would have otherwise taken public transportation biked or walked further contradicting claims that city dwellers would eventually abandoning individual cars en masse furthermore in order to provide on demand mobility there have to be a enough vehicles ready to get to the rider or riders at very short notice according to one source the current business model for tncs relies upon very short wait times for passengers requesting rides which in turn depends on a large supply of available but idle drivers and vehicles both trends more riders and rising numbers of vehicle available to move those riders around runs contrary to the claims made by the tnc companies shared mobility principles for livable cities stated commitment to the efficient use of urban roads the study noted that even ride sharing options such as uberpool and lyft shared rides add to traffic congested roads in total those car pooling options added 2 6 new miles on the road for every mile of individual driving in total increasing traffic on the road by 160 per cent according to the study according to the study they ve added billions of miles of driving in the nation s largest metro areas at the same time car ownership grew more rapidly than the population although perhaps difficult to quantify with any degree of precision there is normally a positive cor relation between traffic congestion and emissions levels as there is between vehicle miles traveled and emissions levels in an october 2018 draft report the state of california transportation authority reported that in san francisco tncs accounted for approximately 50 of the change in congestion in san francisco between 2010 and 2016 as indicated by three congestion measures vehicle hours of delay vehicle miles travelled and average speeds in an attempt to address tncs growing contribution to ghgs california passed legislation in september 2018 to create a baseline for ghgs per passenger mile generated from tncs beginning in 2020 by 2021 annual targets for emissions reductions will be adopted and tncs will be required to develop emissions reduction plans to meet those targets by 2022 the new law states that plans developed by the tncs must be consistent with the zero emission vehicle action plan and be technically and economically feasible and based upon data reported by the transportation network companies to the commission partners not predators redefining the relationship between tncs and public transport some analysts have promoted the idea that tncs can partner with public transport authorities rather than prey upon public transport and its ridership levels base these analysts envisage a win win situation wherein tncs can supplement public transport services while reducing the costs associated with sustaining and improving the current public transport system one example of this approach is captured in the new climate economy working paper cited above which imagines a well designed public private partnership between tncs and public transport authorities that could produce positive social and environmental outcomes a p3 approach this report argues could deliver tailored mobility packages to the user in which on demand services play an important role as complement to public transport due to their flexibility the report claims that private sector tncs and service providers can better match services with demand for example the presence of fleets of on demand electric minibuses could improve access to public transport lower operating costs no need to provide underused buses late at night and reduce environmental impacts private sector ride hailing companies could also provide first and last mile ride sharing to underserved city areas expanding access and use still further the working paper suggests that subsidies could be paid to passengers for on demand shared rides from areas with poor transit access to transit hubs the working paper also suggests that replacing fixed route diesel buses with on demand electric minibuses could yield improvements as well and that deploying ride sharing services for first and last mile trips to and from public transportation stops which enables more people to use mass transit instead of their cars could reduce per journey emissions of ghgs and local air pollutants by 55 80 there is nothing in the report to suggest that the selective use of on demand minibuses or other forms of ride sharing must be the exclusive domain of the private sector similarly any gains in terms of avoiding transport related emissions could it seems just as easily be accomplished by public fleets of smaller electric vehicles that could fill the kind of gaps in public transport systems that currently exist a point we return to below but it is clearly necessary to distinguish between gaps in public transport that may be intrinsic to systems for technical reasons for instance not everyone can have a bus stop at their doorstep and gaps that are the result of service cuts underfunding etc gaps of the latter type simply confirm the devastating impact that years of neoliberal policies have had on public services they reveal nothing about public transport per se indeed concerns regarding the need to control and even reduce costs have been magnified by the neoliberal discourse and its concerns to redistribute wealth in an up ward direction a comprehensive us study found that according to tnc users as many as one third of rides were due to poor or infrequent public transport services had these public transport services been maintained expanded and improved over the years instead of being starved of resources in the name of austerity the rise of tncs could have been significantly curtailed a report recently released jointly by uc davis institute of transportation studies and the institute for transport and development policy develops the p3 approach still further and with an eye on the future titled three revolutions in urban transport the report states the world is on the cusp of three revolutions in transportation vehicle electrification automation and widespread shared mobility sharing of vehicle trips separately or together these revolutions will fundamentally change urban transportation around the world over the next three decades but without strong policy interventions the report suggests these changes could produce a hell scenario involving an out of control growth in private vehicle use the report offers projections based on the rapid growth of automated and electric vehicles alongside ride sharing with the right policies the mobility revolution can it suggests be steered in a way that can reduce urban transport emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 the report states tncs will never substitute for a robust transit network or compact pedestrian friendly development however they can provide safe reliable affordable connections to transit as well as flexibility for more complex trips that require carrying goods traveling with a companion who has limited mobility and so on in other words the authors assume that tncs should continue to operate as private entities on a for profit basis presumably under contract with public transport authorities and that this partnership could produce positive social and ecological outcomes the problems with this approach should be fairly obvious given that in any given city there is likely to be several tncs operating at any given time a public transport authority will need to deal with any number of private tnc partners if through a bidding process the number of partner tncs was reduced to one or two and these contracts contained what might be termed mobility service provision agreements then the public authority would effectively be subsidizing private providers by paying costs incurred by public use of the likes of uber and lyft the very same tncs that pulled passengers away from public transport in the first place the report also urges that priority be given to policies such as norway style subsidies purchase incentives for evs public investment in charging stations etc here again the costs of these investments will be come from the public purse but at least some of the gains will ultimately accrue to the private manufacturers of the evs who will benefit not the public transport system if evs become less expensive as a result of purchase incentives and other policy supports it is likely to lead to an increase in individual vehicle ownership ride sharing and enhanced public mobility as noted above unions have waged a spirited war of resistance against the predatory practices of tncs like uber in many large cities unions have defended taxi drivers informal sector workers and done their best to protect public transport systems but there appears to be no compelling reason why unions cannot lead a political effort that goes beyond regulating tncs although campaigns of this nature are important and as we have seen some have been successful such an effort could be built around the need for social as well as eco logical reasons to incorporate ride sharing and other new mobility services into public transport systems the app based or platform technologies that have made ride hailing and rise sharing possible can be harnessed in ways that could make a contribution to improving and expanding public transport and reducing emissions traditional public transport modes buses trains etc still offer the best returns in terms of social and ecological gains and these should remain at the heart of public mobility in the decades to come but the struggle to harness app based and other technologies for the public good can be viewed as an integral part of the struggle to protect improve and qualitatively expand traditional modes of public transport and the need to reduce emissions and protect the climate can be situated at the center of such an effort finding the right balance between traditional modes and the need for low carbon first and last mile mobility will require consistent input from drivers riders and the communities they serve but for transport democracy to work effectively there will probably need to be some recognition of the fact that enhanced public mobility can not become synonymous with personalized on demand mobility however it is configured without restrictions of some kind this type of mobility risks resulting in an increase in total transport related energy consumption the three revolutions report is helpful in this respect as are others that have been written as part of the policy discourse around sustainable mobility the report speaks to the need to match service providers with demand and it notes that one of the key regulatory challenges in the coming years will be to ensure that a much larger share of travel provided by more efficient modes bus and rail systems as well as smaller right sized vehicles whose size better matches travel demand also needed is a higher average load factor people per trip more intense vehicle use requiring far fewer vehicles to meet passenger travel needs since personal vehicles currently remain idle 90 of the time although constrained by a p3 approach that sees a role for private tncs the proposals offered are aimed at incorporating shared mobility and automation into public transport systems shared mobility which includes shared vehicle trips as well as public transport modes can lead to more efficient use of urban space reduce traffic congestion enable more walking and cycling cut energy use and emissions and generally improve urban livability it draws on data from simulations that suggest fully occupied shared vehicles of between 4 and 10 passengers could provide an alternative to both personal vehicles and traditional taxis that are often under occupied car sharing too can make a significant contribution to positive social and ecological outcomes in that it offers a transportation solution for users who don t own a car but would like occasional access to a car for more than a single short trip car sharing offers the benefit of serving more people per vehicle than if those people were to use private vehicles resulting in less need for parking and user cost savings through more efficient vehicle utilization importantly the report suggests that major travel corridors continue to be served by efficient bus systems such as bus rapid transit and major cities continue to build rail systems for the busiest travel routes furthermore smaller buses with 8 16 seats grow in number as these are almost capable of providing point to point services and can be summoned at least to locations nearby specific residences if not to the door even with a driver on demand small bus and van services provide a very low cost convenient travel option for many types of intermediate trips in dense areas as vehicles become automated the cost of small bus travel drops further to become the cheapest per passenger kilometer on demand travel option in the world according to three revolutions what emerges is an ecosystem of public transport and ride hailing services that are harmonious and complementary small vehicle ride hailing does not displace trips from larger public transport services except where currently large vehicle public transport is poorly utilized and inappropriate given corridor demand one result of this ecosystem is significantly higher load factors average passengers per trip in all vehicular modes sidewalks and bike lanes are add ed to create continuous networks and ensure maximum safety for these travelers unions especially those representing public transport workers would welcome proposals that might improve public mobility in ways that are equitable and less carbon mobility as noted above the report s weakness lies in the fact that it assumes that private vehicles can be replaced with ride hailing of tnc vehicles shared vehicle trips leading to much higher average vehicle occupancy and all this coupled with a strong role for public transport and active travel but there is no reason that a public transport authority cannot incorporate publicly owned ride sharing into services a wider system of public transport aimed squarely at the shared public good not only would such a system be easier to coordinate but it would allow public vehicle fleets to be standardized fully electrified and charged in public spaces using public charging stations or at a central depot with over time the power coming from a modern grid transmitting and distributing electricity generated by renewable sources of power the full report is available at tued working paper 12 the road less travelled
complete survey results can be found here introduction and summary the 2020 presidential election cycle will be one of the most consequential in u s history although electoral outcomes often turn on candidate evaluations or social and cultural choices unrelated to public policy voters in the upcoming year will likely confront a choice between two competing visions of domestic policy that could shape america s economy and society for a generation will voters opt to continue president donald trump s and congressional republicans approach of large tax cuts deregulation tariffs and increased restrictions on health care and other assistance programs or will voters choose to go in a different direction backing the eventual democratic nominee s and congressional democrats plans for increased taxation on the wealthy greater scrutiny and regulation of corporations and expanded health care access and income assistance efforts alternatively will a potential split decision by voters lead to ongoing divided government and continued haphazard approaches to domestic and economic policy by leaders built less on clear ideological choices and more on institutional and partisan bargaining this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply answers to these big political questions first require a deeper sense of what voters actually believe about the current state of the nation s economy their own personal economic situations and their views on a range of complex issues related to the government and governing social policy and anti poverty efforts in order to better understand the landscape for policymaking the center for american progress and health care for america now in partnership with the public opinion firm gbao designed a comprehensive national survey to provide analysts activists journalists and practitioners with concrete empirical data about the views of the american electorate ahead of the 2020 election overall despite low unemployment and other positive macroeconomic indicators the study finds voters are conflicted in their evaluations of the national economic situation president trump s economic stewardship and in terms of their own personal economic situations and exposure to hardship with large partisan and demographic divides emerging on many key questions when it comes to basic attitudes about the economy and public policy disconnected from the president himself the study finds wider consensus around the need for active governmental policies to reduce poverty and expand economic opportunity address health care access and costs improve education and infrastructure curb corporate power and tax the super wealthy voters split more over theoretical debates about fighting inequality the relative role of the private and public sectors in job creation regulation and the effectiveness of government action in addressing social problems likewise democratic and republican voters express divergent opinions about the proper level of federal taxation and in terms of their personal willingness to pay more in taxes to expand health care in addition the study finds strong support across party lines for economic narratives focused on taking back our government from wealthy special interests making sure government works for all people and finding political leadership committed to uniting people around simple goals we all share to gather the data highlighted in this report the authors designed and conducted an online survey from october 10 15 2019 with a national sample of 2 000 registered voters survey results are weighted to reflect national census data on the demographic composition of the electorate the survey follows a companion qualitative project exploring voters attitudes on the economy and poverty related issues conducted in 2018 with a range of voters in focus groups in milwaukee and through an online discussion panel of voters conducted over several days 1 complete survey results are on file with the authors the remainder of this report will explore the major findings from the survey across a number of topics related to the national political landscape views about government and the economy and specific policy proposals currently in the public debate ahead of the 2020 election american voters are deeply divided in their evaluations of key national and personal economic indicators asked over the past few years do you feel the economy in our country has gotten better gotten worse or stayed about the same 4 in 10 voters say that the economy has gotten better one third believe it has gotten worse and one quarter of voters feel it has stayed the same however these overall figures mask serious partisan and demographic differences in perception about the state of the national economy as well as on personal or family economic well being national economic indicators show a low unemployment economy with growth that began under president obama continuing under president trump albeit at a somewhat slower pace however these positive macroeconomic trends under both obama and trump have not produced uniform shifts in public opinion voter opinion about the economy is increasingly shaped by partisanship and views of who is in power rather than on particular economic indicators republicans largely did not see a positive national economy under obama while democrats did now democrats largely do not see an improving national economy under trump while republicans do for example as seen in figure 1 71 percent of self identified republicans and 72 percent of trump voters in 2016 say the economy has gotten better compared with only 16 percent of self identified democrats and 15 percent of people who voted for hillary clinton in 2016 conversely more than half of democrats and clinton voters say the economy has gotten worse versus less than 1 in 10 republicans and trump voters independents break out more evenly with 29 percent saying the national economy has gotten better 36 percent saying it has gotten worse and 30 percent saying it has stayed about the same beyond partisan divisions the study reveals significant generational gender class and racial and ethnic cleavages on views of the national economy partially reflecting the differences in the underlying composition of each party as highlighted in figure 1 a plurality of generation z born 1997 2012 millennial voters born 1981 1996 43 percent believe the country s economy has gotten worse while half of baby boomer born 1946 1964 silent generation born before 1945 voters feel it has gotten better generation x 1965 1980 voters split more evenly in their opinions with 36 percent saying the economy has gotten better and one third saying it has gotten worse beyond the generational gaps the groups with at least a plurality believing the economy has gotten better rather than worse or stayed the same include white voters 46 percent men overall 45 percent including half of both white noncollege educated men and white college educated men middle income voters 42 percent and those with 100 000 or more in annual household income 48 percent those groups with at least a plurality saying the national economy has gotten worse rather than gotten better or stayed the same include african americans 54 percent hispanics 45 percent women overall 38 percent and those earning less than 50 000 in annual household income 38 percent as seen in figure 2 personal economic evaluations are less divided with roughly one third of voters saying their own personal economic situation has gotten better over the past few years about one quarter saying their own situation has gotten worse and 4 in 10 saying their own situation has stayed the same there are some similar but less muted partisan and demographic divisions on this measure with republicans and older voters more likely to say that their own economic situation has gotten better and democrats and younger voters more likely to report that their own economic situation has gotten worse racial ethnic and educational divisions are less noticeable on this personal economic dimension more than half of american voters especially younger voters and voters of color report having experienced a serious economic problem in the past year the survey presented voters with a series of economic hardship measures and asked them whether they or any member of their immediate family had a serious problem with this issue in the past year as seen in figure 3 39 percent of voters overall report that they or someone in their family has faced a serious problem finding a decent job with good wages in the past year the most critical challenge to emerge roughly 3 in 10 voters also report that they or someone in their family has faced serious challenges in the past year with having too little money to buy enough food falling behind on gas electric or phone bills or being unable to get medical care because of the cost about one quarter of voters say they or someone in their immediate family has faced serious problems in the past year with falling behind on rent or mortgage payments these new findings are consistent with other research documenting significant economic challenges for many americans including the federal reserve board s latest study of u s households showing the nearly 4 in 10 americans report having less than 400 available to pay for an unexpected expense 2 similarly the united way asset limited income constrained employed alice project finds that 43 percent of american households don t have enough money each month to cover their budgets for housing food child care health care and transportation 3 overall 52 percent of voters report having faced a serious problem in the past year with one or more of the aforementioned scenarios compared with 48 percent who say that they have experienced none of these challenges about 30 percent of voters report having had serious problems with three or more of these challenges and 13 percent report having had serious problems with all five of these economic hardship measures examining partisan and demographic patterns on these questions the survey finds a majority of republicans 60 percent reporting none of these economic challenges in the past year versus 40 percent of democrats and 44 percent of independents similarly a majority of white voters 55 percent reported none of these problems in the past year compared with large majorities of african american 72 percent and hispanic 67 percent voters who experienced one or more of these economic problems one quarter of african americans and about one fifth of hispanics say that they or someone in their immediate family has experienced all five of these issues in the past year about twice the rate of white voters generational divides are also stark on these indicators three quarters of gen z millennial voters and more than half of gen x voters report serious problems with one or more of these issues compared with less than one third of baby boomer silent generation voters consistent with these findings 40 percent of voters overall report that they or a close relative of theirs are currently receiving government assistance for housing health care food disability or unemployment many of which are programs that the trump administration has sought to slash after congress rejected these cuts one third of white voters report a personal or family connection to government assistance programs compared with more than half of african americans and hispanics among white voters however nearly half of noncollege educated women and one third of noncollege educated men report a connection to government programs compared with less than 3 in 10 of their college educated cohorts likewise 56 percent of gen z millennial voters report a personal or family connection to government assistance programs versus 27 percent of baby boomer silent generation voters president trump receives his lowest job approval ratings on issues of health care and poverty approximately 4 in 10 voters overall approve of the job trump is doing as president with nearly 6 in 10 disapproving of his tenure a job approval disapproval net margin of 16 points as seen in figure 4 president trump s job approval margins range from a low of 21 on fighting poverty and 20 on health care to 11 on helping working class families and 7 on making sure wages keep up with expenses for american workers consistent with other data on the economy president trump receives slight majority job approval overall from voters on the issue of creating quality jobs for american workers reflecting very high republican margins 76 but still net negative approval among independents 5 and democrats 53 4 as expected huge partisan divides emerge on president trump s overall job performance and on specific economic indicators republican voters report net positive margins across all of the measures ranging from 52 points to 76 points democrats in contrast give the president net negative ratings across all of the measures by a similar but inverted 53 point to 78 point range notably in the specific areas of health care and fighting poverty president trump receives net negative job approval across all generational educational income and racial and ethnic group lines a sizeable plurality of voters disapproves of president trump s 2017 tax cut legislation and less than one fifth of voters say their taxes have gone down as a result the survey assessed reactions to the president s signature legislative accomplishment on the domestic front the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as highlighted in figure 5 opinions of the bill are more negative than positive with 45 percent of voters disapproving of the tax cut bill 37 percent approving and nearly one fifth not offering an opinion consistent with other partisan trends republicans approve of the 2017 tax law by a 59 point margin while democrats disapprove of the law by a 60 point margin independents align more with democrats in their judgment disapproving of the tax bill by a 20 point margin generational differences emerge as well with gen z millennial and gen x voters disapproving of president trump s tax bill by an 18 point margin and 7 point margin respectively and baby boomer silent generation voters returning a split verdict in terms of the perceived effect of the 2017 tax cut legislation the plurality of voters 46 percent say the taxes they pay have stayed about the same while 27 percent report that they ve paid more in taxes less than one fifth of voters report that they ve paid less in taxes as a result of the bill despite the trump administration s arguments that its signature tax law would produce wide benefits in terms of reduced taxes and higher wages voters say they have seen no direct benefits the class dimensions on the perceived effect of the tax cuts are stark higher income voters those earning more than 100 000 annually are more than twice as likely as lower income voters those earning less than 50 000 per year to say they ve paid less in taxes due to trump s tax plan 27 percent versus 12 percent respectively health care access and affordability dominate voters priorities list for 2020 the survey presented voters with a list of specific issue areas and asked them to indicate the two issues that they think are the most important priorities for congress and the president to work on in the upcoming year as highlighted in figure 6 each of the health care items employed in a split sample test are chosen twice as often as other issues in terms of voter priorities 51 percent of voters choose making health care more affordable in one half of the sample while 41 percent choose making health care more accessible as a top priority in the other below health care issues a mix of different priorities cluster together in terms of voter priorities with just more than 1 in 5 voters selecting updating our national infrastructure like roads bridges and airports reducing the number of people living in poverty reducing the cost of prescription drugs or cutting taxes and regulation as one of their two top priorities increasing workers paychecks and creating more jobs emerge in the next tier of priorities with education issues in the final tier health care affordability is the highest rated priority across party lines while cutting taxes and regulation emerges slightly above health care access among republican voters in addition creating more jobs and increasing wages are higher priorities for younger voters than older voters with infrastructure and prescription drug costs rating much higher among older voters than younger ones a comprehensive examination of voter attitudes about the economy government and poverty at the center of this study voters were presented with a series of 20 attitudinal statements focused on a mix of topics related to the economy and government and were asked to rate each on a scale of zero to 10 in terms of how much they disagreed or agreed with each item looking across all of the indicators the survey finds voters expressing broad support for increased government action to deal with a number of concerns including the need to lower education costs to increase taxes on the wealthy to check big corporations and to ensure all people have basic economic necessities surprisingly given overall partisan polarization there were several areas of genuine consensus across party lines looking at the results in table 1 the two statements with majorities of democrats independents and republicans expressing agreement are focused on high college costs as well as the need for the wealthy to pay more and the middle class to pay less in taxes eighty eight percent of democrats 74 percent of independents and 67 percent of republicans agree with the following statement colleges and universities are too expensive and state governments should do more to lower costs and help people afford a college education without getting buried in debt even though greater partisan differences likely exist in terms of what federal action on college costs should look like voters across the spectrum clearly recognize the importance of a college education for young people and want states to do more to alleviate debt burdens on this matter the second idea with wide partisan affirmation involves taxation nearly 9 in 10 democrats three quarters of independents and a majority of republicans agree with the following idea rich families and corporations should pay a lot more in taxes than they do today and middle class families should pay less the issue of the relative balance of taxation and concern about what is provided in return for paying taxes is clearly on the minds of many american voters on top of the desire to tax the wealthy at higher rates less than 4 in 10 voters across all party lines express agreement with the following statement the combined state local and federal taxes my household pays seem fair to me for what we get in terms of services and benefits issues regarding the power of big corporations and the need for government to ensure that all people have basic necessities also generate fairly broad agreement for example 84 percent of democrats 72 percent of independents and nearly half of republicans agree that big corporations have too much power and should be strongly regulated to better serve the public interest further areas related to government regulation receive more divided opinions however as republican voters score lower than others on the issue of regulation and inequality nearly 6 in 10 republicans agree with the idea that inequality is a natural result of a free market economy and trying to reduce it through government regulations only will make everyone less well off compared with 43 percent of independents and 35 percent of democrats checking big corporate power clearly unifies american voters more than the idea of reducing inequality on the public expenditures front more than 8 in 10 democrats nearly two thirds of independents and almost half of republicans agree with the basic principle that ensuring that all people have basic economic security and access to decent living standards is a critical function of government as will be seen later in the report voters differ on other aspects of social programs particularly related to perceptions of potential abuse and dependency but they are fairly aligned on the fundamental idea that government should play a role in ensuring basic living standards for all people majorities of voters across party lines are aligned in opposition to cuts to social security medicare and medicaid despite rising federal budget deficits under president trump american voters are in basic agreement that steps to cut important federal health and retirement programs to reduce deficits should not be taken only 30 percent of democrats 35 percent of independents and 43 percent of republicans agree with the idea that our national debt is way too high and we need to cut government spending on the biggest programs like social security medicare and medicaid most voters across demographic lines disagree with cuts to federal health and retirement programs but the survey highlights some generational divides although a majority of gen z millennial voters disagree with the idea of cutting spending on these programs support among the youngest voters is noticeably higher than it is among baby boomer silent generation voters 46 percent versus 28 percent respectively nearly two thirds of voters prefer funding programs to help low income families get the basics rather than cutting these programs to address large deficits in a separate test on deficits and program cuts pitting two competing ideas against one another the survey finds strong support for maintaining public spending on programs that provide low income families with access to basic living standards sixty four percent of voters overall say the following statement comes closer to their view it is more important to me to help provide basic living standards like housing nutrition and health care for those struggling to make ends meet conversely only 29 percent of voters favor the alternative idea it is more important to me to address large budget deficits by reducing overall spending on government assistance programs for low income people as will be shown the study also finds strong support for not just protecting existing health care programs for americans but also for expanding public health insurance options to more people who may be uninsured without employer provided health care voters are split on the perceived effect of global trade on workers but oppose trade wars as a solution two of the statements in the list of 20 items deal with issues of trade and tariffs regardless of party affiliation voters are split on the following argument international trade and globalization have been good for american workers a slight majority of democrats 55 percent agree with this idea as do 49 percent of independents and 51 percent of republicans basically a draw interestingly no major differences emerge along demographic and class lines voters genuinely are split on the overall effect of trade and globalization however the current administration s approach to dealing with trade and globalization is not well supported by most of the voting public eighty percent of democrats and 64 percent of independents agree with the following statement trade wars with nations such as china and mexico only increase costs for american consumers which is why we need to reduce tariffs and increase economic cooperation with other nations although republicans are clearly more aligned with president trump s approach than are democrats 45 percent of these republican voters similarly agree that trade wars have negative consequences that should be avoided big partisan differences exist on issues related to the role of government versus the private sector in job creation and training personal willingness to pay more for health care and the causes of poverty rounding out the exploration of the attitudinal statements the study finds some critical areas of economic policy that produce more significant partisan differences for example more than 6 in 10 republicans agree that there are enough good jobs with decent pay where i live compared with less than 4 in 10 democrats likewise more than 6 in 10 republicans but only 4 in 10 democrats agree with the notion that creating quality jobs and training workers for those jobs are roles that should be left to private businesses and markets without government interference in contrast more than 8 in 10 democrats and only around 4 in 10 republicans agree with the following statement on increased government role in job creation too many people in america today face limited work opportunities and the government should do more to create better jobs and increase wages perhaps reflecting different interpretations of what health care affordability means to voters or divergent views about redistribution to others there is wide partisan disagreement in voters willingness to personally pay more for health care nearly 6 in 10 democrats agree with the following statement i m willing to pay more in taxes to help provide more affordable health care versus roughly one quarter of republicans and about 4 in 10 independents partisan voters also diverge over ideas related to both the causes of poverty and the effects of anti poverty measures for example twice as many republicans as democrats 60 percent and 29 percent respectively agree with the following statement people get stuck in poverty primarily because they make bad decisions or lack the ambition to do better in life conversely more than three quarters of democrats but only 4 in 10 republicans agree that most people who live in poverty are poor mainly due to factors beyond their control whether it s jobs that don t pay enough to live or the high cost of basic things like housing health care and education strong majorities of voters across party lines back specific policy proposals to expand health care curb prescription drug costs invest in infrastructure and implement a wealth tax despite some partisan differences in theoretical debates about government and the economy the study finds broad agreement among all types of voters for a range of concrete steps to make the tax code more progressive and to invest in specific programs to expand economic security and opportunity table 2 highlights the full list of tested policy proposals as seen majorities of voters across partisan lines support all but two of these specific ideas for increasing economic fairness opportunity and security in american society health care proposals dominate the top tier of the list with overwhelming majority support for providing a public option for health care for the uninsured and for curbing prescription drug costs eighty five percent of democrats and roughly three quarters of both independents and republicans support a proposal to allow people who don t get health coverage through their employer to buy health insurance from a public plan almost exact proportions of each partisan bloc also support efforts to either place a maximum out of pocket limit on the cost of prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries or to penalize pharmaceutical companies if the prices of their prescription drugs increase faster than inflation beyond health care related issues strong consensus also emerges on investing in the foundations of a good economy eighty three percent of democrats 72 percent of independents and 76 percent of republicans back a specific plan to create more jobs and make american businesses more competitive by investing 1 trillion in our nation s infrastructure including roads bridges railroads broadband and expanded production of clean energy as noted earlier voters clearly prefer new policies that increase taxation on the very wealthy consistent with this broad sentiment the study finds widespread agreement with a specific proposal to reduce inequality in our country by creating a 2 percent wealth tax on americans with fortunes over 50 million and 3 percent wealth tax on fortunes worth more than 1 billion nearly 9 in 10 democrats 6 in 10 independents and more than half of republicans support this wealth tax proposal large majorities across partisan lines support federal government action to help reduce poverty and ensure all people have access to basic economic necessities on the anti poverty front strong majorities of voters including 9 in 10 democrats 7 in 10 independents and 6 in 10 republicans support a specific commitment to reduce poverty by ensuring that all families have access to basic living standards like health care food and housing if their wages are too low or they can t make ends meet majorities across party lines also back concrete proposals to increase the child tax credit and provide an extra boost for families with children under the age of 5 to help them make necessary investments during the critical early years of life and to increase the earned income tax credit for workers without dependent children and allow workers to access up to 500 of their tax refund ahead of tax season so they don t have to go into debt to make ends meet a strong majority of voters also backs increasing the minimum wage indexing it to inflation and expanding it to more people more than 6 in 10 voters back steps to increase the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour make sure it rises with inflation and extend the minimum wage to include groups like tipped workers and workers with disabilities who are currently allowed to be paid less than the full minimum wage nearly 8 in 10 democrats 6 in 10 independents and more than 4 in 10 republicans back this proposal for increasing and expanding the minimum wage voters oppose cuts to federal nutrition assistance programs including to school lunches and instead want political leaders to focus on creating better jobs with higher wages the study presented voters with two competing statements about potential cuts and restrictions on federal nutrition programs and asked which one comes closer to their own view sixty one percent of voters prefer a course of action described as follows taking food away from families struggling to make ends meet including over half a million hungry children only makes it harder for them to succeed in school or get back on their feet instead congress should focus on policies that help create jobs and boost wages so their families can get ahead in contrast only one third of voters prefer the alternative notion that we need to tighten eligibility requirements to access nutrition assistance benefits including school lunches in order to promote self sufficiency prevent abuse and dependency among low income people and to ensure that benefits are going to those truly in need three quarters of democrats 6 in 10 independents and nearly half of republicans want to preserve federal nutrition programs and focus on jobs and wages rather than restrictions in addressing poverty beyond the issue of opposing cuts the study finds strong support for a proposal to expand these programs sixty two percent of voters support an effort to ensure those who rely on food assistance benefits can feed their families for the entire month by increasing benefits to account for how much working families pay for food and by linking benefits to the cost of living for those in areas with higher costs for rent utilities and other basic necessities the narrative arguments that resonate with voters voters across party lines embrace narrative arguments focused on taking back our government from wealthy special interests making sure that government works for all of us and finding political leadership that seeks to unite people around simple goals we all share beyond exploration of basic values and attitudes and support for specific policies the study examined voter reactions to a number of common narrative themes about government and the economy and asked voters to rate each one on a scale of zero to 10 in terms of how convincing the statement is to them personally the two highest rated thematic narratives focus on breaking the link between special interests and government and making sure that government benefits all people not just the rich and powerful nine in 10 democrats 8 in 10 independents and 6 in 10 republicans find the following narrative argument convincing we need to take back our government from wealthy special interests and make sure it works for all americans government at its best should ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to get ahead in life and has access to affordable health care good schools and a secure retirement government should work for everyone not just the rich and powerful roughly similar proportions of each partisan group find a second related argument convincing in line with the above sentiments the question we really need to answer is not whether government is too big or too small but rather who does the government work for and benefit does it benefit working people or does it benefit the wealthy america will be much stronger and more cohesive when we ensure that our government works for all of us and not just the richest few obviously these narrative frameworks do not include some of the substantive policy arguments assessed in other parts of the study and would need to be fleshed out in practice but it is instructive to see basic alignment across different types of voters on the importance of breaking special interest influence over government and ensuring that government is focused on the needs of regular voters and not just the wealthy a third narrative also emerges as a convincing framework for capturing voter attention and advancing arguments for a different approach to politics eighty three percent of democrats and about 7 in 10 independents and republicans find the following argument convincing the politicians running our country today are purposefully pitting americans against one another based on race and ethnicity they want us to fight with each other over cultural differences as they pursue policies that transfer wealth and power to the rich and wall street instead we need a government that seeks to unite people regardless of where they live what they look like or how much money they have around simple goals we all share like basic economic security for our families and a chance to get ahead in life again the focus of this narrative framework needs more concrete substance to work in practice but it is clear that voters across the board are fed up with purposefully created cultural divisions in politics and desire more unity around common economic values and goals conclusion this study provides interesting and useful empirical evidence about voters views on a range of complex economic and governmental issues although there are some contradictory trends in public opinion and clear partisan divisions on a number of indicators it is important to recognize the many areas of commonality among voters ahead of the 2020 election voters clearly desire their government to be less focused on the wishes of the wealthy and big corporate interests and more focused on creating the conditions for national prosperity and ensuring greater economic opportunity and security for middle and working class families to that end voters want political leaders to make health care more affordable and accessible they want more tax fairness and more checks on corporate power they want to ensure everyone has access to basic necessities and strongly oppose cuts to programs such as nutrition assistance that help families make ends meet and they want their government and political leaders to put regular voters economic needs above the interests of the wealthiest and most powerful as the nation prepares for what will certainly be a fiercely contested presidential election political leaders across the board should understand that the above concerns are the foundations for economic policy that most voters want to see them pursue about the authors john halpin is a senior fellow and co director of the politics and

quarter 2019 earnings news release with that let me turn the presentation over to bharat bharat masrani group president and chief executive officer thank you gillian and thank you everyone for joining us today 2019 was a good year for td we continue to add volumes in our retail segments winning more customers and taking share with a differentiated customer experience we made further progress in our wholesale banking us dollar strategy growing the corporate and investment banking and global markets businesses and we continued to invest in our people and our capabilities to meet our customers evolving needs while we accomplished much the operating environment was challenging marked by lower interest rates volatile markets and normalizing credit conditions from historically low levels resulting in more modest earnings and eps growth fiscal 2019 earnings of cad12 5 billion and eps of cad6 69 were up 3 from the prior year and q4 eps of cad1 59 was down 2 year over year let me elaborate on the main factors that affected our results this quarter first with declining rates and heightened macro concerns pointing to a more subdued outlook for industry revenue growth we took some restructuring charges this quarter we are accelerating ongoing efforts to modernize our operations and improve our efficiency the charges which were booked in each of our segments totaled cad0 06 of eps second while we otherwise had a very good performance in our wholesale bank revenues were reduced by derivative valuation charges which riaz will discuss third while pcl was within our expectations the ongoing normalization of provisions for credit losses clearly weighed on earnings growth this quarter and for the year as a whole overall eps growth for 2019 was more modest we stayed focused on our long term strategy and i feel good about what we accomplished this year we executed well on our enterprise priorities continuing to serve our customers and clients within our risk appetite we generated consistent organic capital ending the year with a strong cet1 ratio of 12 1 even after the repurchase of 13 million common shares and we created significant value for shareholders increasing our dividend paid by 11 on a full year basis and delivering above average peer total shareholder return for the three five and 10 year periods we achieved these good results while positioning ourselves for future success all year long i ve been sharing examples of our forward focused investments and more frontline advisors supported by enhanced education and training to give our people the capabilities they need to help our customers feel more confident about their finances in new platforms and end to end journeys to make customers and colleagues lives easier in data and analytics that deliver better insights and create new sources of value for our customers and our business and in state of the art technology systems and architecture to enhance the security of our operations and transform the way we do business in october we opened the td fusion centre a multi disciplinary agile work space in toronto that will strengthen our ability to detect and respond to cyber threats it s the latest addition to the global support network we ve put in place focused on protecting our assets safeguarding our customers privacy and recruiting and developing the next generation of experts in this critical field this quarter we launched a first in canada credit card feature that gives card holders the ability to temporarily block any in person international charges through the td app and we are leveraging layer 6 s predictive ai capabilities in our td helps program to identify customers who may be facing financial hardship and reach out with proactive advice and solutions as our digital evolution proceeds it will continue to be informed by a commitment to develop the industry best practices for the use of powerful new ai and machine learning technologies as we discussed in our recent responsible ai report i m proud of the disciplined choices we ve made guided by our one td strategy to drive continued leadership in innovation and customer experience at the enterprise level and in each of our businesses let me turn to them now our canadian retail segment earned cad7 4 billion in 2019 up 3 from a year ago we strengthened our market leading position and keep product lines and took advantage of solid top line growth to fund strategic investments we continued our journey of distribution transformation through our future ready branch strategy and digital homeowner journey and the launch this quarter of our td wheels app which gives canadian customers a personalized digital car financing experience that is seamless simple and convenient in wealth td asset management continued its track record of investment excellence with seven refinitiv lipper awards including recognition in the fixed income balanced equity and etf categories we also expanded our product capabilities with the launch of 16 etfs and several real estate alternative investment solutions for our high net worth and institutional clients and we successfully upgraded our client servicing and underwriting insurance platform turning to the us our us retail bank performed well in 2019 with earnings up 6 we continued to drive peer leading growth in non interest bearing accounts and anchored products that reflects our focus on acquiring high quality primary customers it s a similar story with our small business banking strategy where we ve amplified our community centric model with investments in enhanced data insights in infrastructure like the digital next generation platform we introduced earlier this year customers are responding by bringing us more of their business with td ranking number 1 in sba lending in our main two florida footprints and taking top spot in customer satisfaction for small business banking in the south region by j d power we also continued to make our business more efficient achieving positive operating leverage this year and reducing our efficiency ratio by another 100 basis points at the segment level with another strong contribution from td ameritrade us retail earnings increased 10 for the year or 14 in canadian dollars to just shy of cad5 billion and we were delighted last week to enhance our support for the acquisition of td ameritrade by charles schwab this is a transformative deal that will deliver significant value for td and give us an ownership stake and was the most innovative and highly regarded investment firms in the us rounding out the picture our wholesale bank earned cad608 million this year book ended by market volatility in q1 and derivative valuation and restructuring charges this quarter while this was clearly a disappointing result i am pleased with the progress we are making across our business we increased our leadership position in the canadian market occupying the number 1 spot for m a announced and completed syndicated loans and government debt underwriting and the number 2 spot for corporate debt underwriting and equity options block trading we also built on our leadership position in domestic m a with td securities advising on several marquee transactions including this quarter s cad5 2 billion recapitalization of gardaworld security the largest by a privately owned canadian company we made strides with our us dollar strategy on boarding 60 new corporate clients adding senior leaders to support our technology power and utilities and sponsored lines and leading 72 us investment grade corporate bond deals and we were active in the green and sustainability bond space a growing segment of the market that is well aligned with the bank s strong esg profile and commitment to support the transition to the low carbon economy of the future looking ahead we expect the operating environment to remain challenging with continued geopolitical and trade tensions further normalization of credit conditions from historically low levels and late cycle concerns keeping interest rates under pressure and financial markets on edge we also feel the effects of the move we will also feel the effects of the move by us discount brokers to eliminate online equity trading commissions which will impact our equity pickup from td ameritrade overall while we will continue to execute on our strategy guided by our medium term objectives we expect eps growth to be more moderate again next year despite these uncertainties the fundamentals of our business remains strong and i m confident that we can continue leveraging the investments we have made to add customers increase volumes and continue to grow our business as always we remain confident in our purpose to enrich the lives of our customers colleagues and communities one way we are supporting our colleagues development is by empowering them to contribute to their communities and our customers through the launch of the td ready commitment network the network enables colleagues to track their personal goals and engage in meaningful volunteer activities including our recently announced initiative td mindpower which bears non profit organizations with a dedicated team of skilled td data and analytics employees who collaborate to help them leverage data and grow their community impact this is just one of many purpose driven initiatives we ve launched in 2019 you can find more highlights in our annual report i invite you to read my letter to shareholders in the pages that accompany it which present our strategy in more detail in the transformative investments it is enabling to close i am proud of what we achieved in 2019 i d like to thank our more than 85 000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication to our vision purpose and strategy our customers for the opportunity to serve them and our shareholders for the confidence they have placed in us i look forward to another year of accomplishments in 2020 with that i ll turn things over to riaz riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer thank you bharat good afternoon everyone please turn to slide 7 in 2019 the bank reported earnings of cad11 7 billion and eps of cad6 25 up 3 and 4 respectively adjusted earnings were cad12 5 billion and adjusted eps was cad6 69 up 3 for the year revenue increased 6 reflecting volume growth and higher margins in our retail businesses higher insurance and wealth fee based revenue and the impact of fx translation partially offset by lower trading related revenue in wholesale expenses increased 9 on a reported basis reflecting charges related to air canada greystone and this quarter s restructuring pcl increased 22 primarily reflecting higher pcl in the consumer and commercial lending portfolios and volume growth canadian retail and us retail delivered net income of cad6 9 billion and cad5 billion for the year respectively and wholesale reported approximately cad600 million in earnings please turn to slide 8 for the fourth quarter the bank reported earnings of cad2 9 billion and eps of cad1 54 adjusted earnings were cad2 9 billion and adjusted eps was cad1 59 down 2 revenue increased 2 provisions for credit losses increased 36 quarter over quarter and expenses increased 3 including cad154 million of restructuring charges please turn to slide 9 canadian retail net income was cad1 7 billion level with prior year on an adjusted basis net income increased 2 revenue increased by 5 primarily reflecting volume growth and higher insurance and wealth fee based revenue average loans and deposits increased 5 year over year reflecting growth in both personal and business volumes and wealth assets grew 14 or 9 excluding greystone margin was 2 96 consistent with the prior quarter total pcl increased 27 quarter over quarter with increases in impaired and performing pcls total pcl as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 37 basis points up 8 basis points quarter over quarter expenses increased 4 reflecting higher costs supporting business growth and charges related to the acquisition of greystone on an adjusted basis expenses were up 3 and we delivered 200 basis points of operating leverage please turn to slide 10 us retail net income was usd900 million up 5 year over year on a reported basis and 3 on an adjusted basis us retail bank s reported earnings were flat year over year average loan volumes increased 7 year over year reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments deposit volumes excluding the td ameritrade s suite deposits were up 5 including 4 growth in core consumer checking account net interest margin was 3 18 down 9 basis points sequentially primarily due to lower deposit margins and largely in line with us peers we expect margins to continue trending downwards reflecting the impact of the recent fed rate cuts total pcl including only the bank s contractual portion of credit losses in the strategic cards portfolio was usd223 million up 17 sequentially as an increase in impaired pcl was partially offset by a decrease in performing pcl the us retail net pcl ratio was 55 basis points up 7 basis points from last quarter expenses were flat year over year reflecting restructuring charges of usd52 million and business volume growth partially offset primarily by productivity savings the contribution from td s investment in td ameritrade increased to usd219 million and segment roe was 11 8 please turn to slide 11 net income for wholesale was cad160 million down 44 year over year reflecting lower revenue higher expenses and higher pcl revenue decreased 9 primarily reflecting derivative valuation charges this quarter we implemented a new derivative valuation system and related methodologies which will enhance our ability to manage risk and pricing expenses were cad600 million reflecting restructuring charges of cad23 million higher securities lending fees and software costs and the impact of fx translation partially offset by lower variable compensation please turn to slide 12 the corporate segment reported a net loss of cad240 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of cad181 million in the fourth quarter last year the increase in reported net loss was primarily attributable to lower contribution from treasury items and non controlling interests partially offset by lower net corporate expenses net corporate expenses decreased largely reflecting lower net pension expenses in the current quarter partially offset by restructuring charges of cad51 million please turn to slide 13 our common equity tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 12 1 consistent with the prior quarter we had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 32 basis points to our capital position and this was mostly offset by the repurchase of over 8 million common shares in the quarter as well as growth in rwa and actuarial losses on employee pension plans our leverage ratio was 4 and our liquidity coverage ratio was 133 during the quarter the board approved the launch of a new ncib to repurchase up to an additional 30 million common shares subject to regulatory approval looking ahead to q1 2020 we expect the implementation of ifrs 16 and the revised securitization framework to have a 28 basis points impact on cet1 capital in line with the guidance we provided last quarter we expect the impact to be mitigated by internal capital generation i will now turn the call over to ajai ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thank you riaz and good afternoon everyone overall credit quality was good across the bank s portfolios in fiscal 19 and credit losses were in line with our expectations please turn to slide 14 gross impaired loan formations were cad1 5 billion or 22 basis points stable quarter over quarter and year over year please turn to slide 15 gross impaired loans ended the year at cad3 billion or 43 basis points stable quarter over quarter and down 4 basis points year over year please turn to slide 16 recall that our presentation reports pcl ratios both gross and net of the partner s share of the us strategic card credit losses we remind you that credit losses recorded in the corporate segment are fully absorbed by our partners and do not impact the bank s net income the bank s pcls in the quarter were cad893 million of 51 basis points up 13 basis points quarter over quarter and up 10 basis points year over year the quarter over quarter increase reflects the us credit card and auto portfolios largely due to typical seasonal trends as experienced in previous years pcls in the us credit card and auto portfolios typically rise in the fourth and first quarters due to back to school and holiday shopping balances and delinquencies historically decrease in the second and third quarters as customers catch up with their payments the balance of the quarter over quarter pcl increase is largely reflected in the canadian retail and wholesale segments primarily due to credit migration please turn to slide 17 the bank s impaired pcl increased cad151 million quarter over quarter largely related to the us credit card and auto portfolios reflecting seasonal trends and credit migration in the canadian commercial and auto portfolios performing pcl increased cad78 million quarter over quarter driven by the canadian commercial canadian cards and wholesale lending portfolios primarily due to credit migration and seasonal trends in the us credit card and auto portfolios partially offset by the impact of prior quarter parameter updates in the consumer lending portfolios for 2019 the full year rate is 45 basis points up 6 basis points from 2018 the increase in total pcl in 2019 largely reflects ongoing credit normalization in the canadian retail and wholesale segments from prior year s cyclically low levels and volume growth across the bank s portfolios in summary we ve had good credit quality across the bank s portfolios in 2019 and are well positioned for continued growth in our lending portfolios looking to the year ahead the period of cyclically low loss rates are likely behind us subject to quarterly seasonal fluctuations and provided economic conditions remain supportive i expect fiscal 2020 pcl to be in the neighborhood of 50 basis points with that operator we are now ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator and the first question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good afternoon i guess riaz if you could start on the margin outlook you talked about the fed rate cuts impacting the us margin if you can give us a sense of the cadence of incremental margin compression that you expect next quarter and if the fed is truly done for the time being is that when do you expect the us margin to begin stabilizing or do you expect the continued drift lower greg braca group head us retail td bank group and president and ceo td bank america s most convenient ebrahim thank you this is greg braca so thanks for the question i just start by saying as you know we ve had three rate cuts starting in july and then september and then at the end of october 25 basis points each and over the next quarter you would generally expect that the margins would continue to trend lower given the fact that the last cut just occurred at the last day of the fiscal year end on october 31st and the second rate cut only had the effect of being in the fourth quarter for half the quarter so all things being equal obviously there s a lot that goes into this including the mix of the business and what the long end of the rate does and on off rates and things that we ve talked about before but given those three rate cuts and certainly two impacting q4 to what would be q1 you were generally see a glide path to lower margins in q1 ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and if i may one more just in terms of capital it sounds like you should be able to absorb the ifrs 16 impact relatively easily in the next quarter as we think about capital deployment and with sort of some clarity on the ameritrade front any updated thoughts bharat in terms of as you think about m a opportunities in the us be it within the northeast within your banking footprint or non bank m a bharat masrani group president and chief executive officer no change ebrahim as we ve said previously i mean we look at capital deployment on a holistic basis obviously we want to support the strategies we have laid out that is organic growth the rwa growth that follows we want to make sure that we also have capital flexibility should we need to build out any capabilities that are more appropriately done through acquisitions rather than trying to organically build them i think greystone falls into that category quite nicely we also said that we will always be make sure that we have capital flexibility issued some opportunities present themselves and you ve seen td participate in those transactions there are so many over the past few years that have turned out to be terrific for us and then finally yes we are interested in acquisitions we ve said the southeast is particularly attractive to us given the potential there in the us we ve also said we would look at others that makes sense from a strategic and a financial perspective so nothing has changed from that perspective and i m sure with the type of environment we are seeing and what we are calling for that is which is challenging that certainly may give us opportunities more so than it might have previously so we will keenly watch the space and should anything compelling present itself we will be looking at it seriously ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thank you operator thank you and the next question is from meny grauman from cormark securities meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good afternoon question on the restructuring charge just wondering about what expense savings you expect to recognize from that restructuring and for 2020 and 2021 riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer meny it s riaz as you would have noted in our sub factor over the course of 2019 we ve added almost 3 500 ftes in various frontline and technology projects and corporate functions and the business is do from time to time and take the opportunity to look at ways of optimizing how we work modernizing our operations and improving our efficiency if you look at the expense that we have reported over the last five quarters excluding the effects of restructuring charges the expenses have been relatively stable so i think you should look at this more and more as an optimization exercise within a context of a growing bank and not necessarily driven to create additional productivity meny grauman cormark securities analyst got it and then just in terms of the charge related to the derivative systems upgrade just wondering if there is any revenue lift that you expect from that change you mentioned better pricing so i m wondering if there is a benefit that you see from that that will be materially noticable bob dorrance group head wholesale banking td bank group and chairman ceo president td securities meny it s bob dorrance i think by better pricing what we re talking about as faster pricing being able to respond more quickly i think the benefit that we will achieve because we will have real time mark to market of the portfolio and all the various parameters in what is a complex portfolio was the ability to hedge the portfolio better so the expectation is that we work with this system over the next year that we ll be able to reduce the volatility that we ve experienced in marking the book to market once a month meny grauman cormark securities analyst so just as a follow up is it going to be observable it on your results this kind of upgrade or is it more just sort of behind the scenes bob dorrance group head wholesale banking td bank group and chairman ceo president td securities no i think we ll wait and see and how that plays out meny meny grauman cormark securities analyst okay thank you operator thank you and the next question is from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good afternoon just wanted to ask about your risk appetite and we got margins coming down we got pcl ratios normalizing and does that affect your risk appetite at all i know a couple of years ago you were talking about expanding fairly ambitiously in the unsecured personal lending space in canada how has that changed at all and what would need to happen for you to maybe ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer it s ajai thanks for the question so let me start i think you re aware our risk appetite statement is a principles based risk appetite statement but it is also informed by all the stress testing work that we do and quite frankly risk appetite is not something that we keep changing so there s got to be something significant has to happen for us to want to change our risk appetite so we re not changing our risk appetite having said that if there are opportunities that are within our risk appetite like i believe personal lending is we will certainly explore that so no change in risk appetite but there are enough opportunities for us that are within risk appetite maybe i ll turn it over to teri for a few comments gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst thanks maybe i would just add there are a number of areas as we ve talked about before where we have embedded growth opportunity well within our risk policies and our risk appetite you cited unsecured personal lending we still have the heloc hybrid market share in fourth place where we have the opportunity and continue to seek out business with our own customers impulse business in the business bank there are geographies where we re continuing to add bankers where we have opportunity and industry segments where we can do more so definitely we are open for business and growing well within those at risk policy okay how about the glass half full perspective and so easy to get down in the dumps these days but rates are down a lot for margins we go still a lot of ink on that but from a credit risk standpoint that should help right ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer yes it s ajai i think if rates come down at some point it will help credit but it could take some time gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer we believe lower rates in the longer run could help credit yes gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst thanks and happy holidays bharat masrani group president and chief executive officer for you too as well gabe this is bharat just to add something ajai and teri covered it up well i mean risk appetite is not something that is fleeting or changing quarter by quarter it is very principles based as ajai noted and something that we take very seriously and within our risk appetite you know the size of our bank the scale of our bank and when we say we want to grow certain parts of our business it is not based of indications in one quarter or two quarters it is a plan it is a long term plan and we execute against that plan of course we ll be adaptable should there be a fundamental change in the environment but you should not expect from td a knee jerk reaction in changing our risk appetite because a one particular quarter gave one indication gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay i m going to have to rewrite that section to just give gillian manning head of investor relations operator i think we re ready for our next question operator thank you and the next question is from sumit malhotra from scotia capital please go ahead sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst thank you good afternoon i just want to pick up with ajai please so going from 45 basis points to 50 for a bank of your size it s not the biggest deal in the world but i just wanted to dig in a little bit since you re giving us such a specific forecast in and around that range for 2020 i mean when i look at some of the underlying metrics in credit for your bank and there are lot of things can move around but your gross impaired loan balance hasn t really moved that much for a few quarters your formations have been relatively well contained and to the extent these are some of the first factors we look at they seem to be ok what parts of the portfolio your portfolio do you look at it and say this is a portion of the book that we can reasonably expect loss rates to migrate higher in the near term ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer well thanks for the question so let me tell you how i get to the neighborhood of 50 basis points i m basically assuming that certain portfolios which i believe are not yet operating at normalized levels will continue to normalize and in my mind there are three so canadian retail is one of them like if you look at canadian retail three of the last four quarters we operated between 25 bps to 30 bps to me that s cyclically low and for the full year were 31 bps so i expect that to continue to normalize the second book is wholesale like if you look at wholesale losses and i believe in the first three quarters it was like cad2 million so if i look out like i think wholesale will continue to also gradually normalize and the third book is us commercial so if i look at us commercial i d say no or very little losses in that book for a few years so i am assuming because we are late in the cycle that will continue to see normalization in that portfolio so if i look at all three portfolios that s what kind of gets me to a number of closer to 50 basis points okay and i should also clarify that from a economic perspective i m generally assuming stable economic conditions consistent with our disclosures sumit malhotra scotia capital analyst that s very specific and i appreciate that because when we go one step further here for example you re right your wholesale provision is higher this quarter but the bulk of that came from the performing provision and when i look at td in the last two years that we ve been under the new standard your provisions on the performing portion of the book have been 5 basis points to 6 basis points respectively and i think in every quarter the bank has had an actual provision in the performing in the stage 1 and stage 2 buckets which hasn t been the case for all of your peers i know there is different approaches to this it was different setup costs across the sector this is a i m going to ask if you could give a simple answer to something that s a complex question but why do you think it is that your bank has been so consistent in having provisions in the performing portfolio and that hasn t necessarily been the case across the group ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer well i can t speak to my peers but i can certainly tell you what s occurring at td so first let s ground ourselves in what are the drivers of performing pcl one its volume two its credit migration three its parameter updates and four its macroeconomic changes so if i look at our allowances and this is all disclosed in the allowance tables our allowance year over year went up by cad378 million off that performing is actually cad399 million and let me just explain that to you stage 1 is cad237 million so what that s telling you is most of our allowance build is volume and some of it is some of that is also parameter updates we then have cad162 million in stage 2 and that is partly credit migration and partly parameter updates so the migration some of it is occurring in canadian commercial there is a bit in canadian cards but a big part of it is actually parameter updates there is a bit in us cards and there is a bit in wholesale then if i turn to stage 3 stage 3 increase for us is only cad61 million so which tells you like we ve actually built stage 3 allowances in the past and the offset to that it s cad82 million in aci or debt securities so i hope that helps but volume is the bigger story here teri currie group head canadian personal banking no and i ll stop there i guess the thing is volume in and of itself we would expect the dollar amount of provisions to look to rise and not necessarily the ratio i guess when i look at you guys you have so much more than you ve charged off your allowances now continue to rise so it is somewhat surprising to me on a lot of these quarters that we see your ability to continue at that pace but i think you re saying to me volume is part of it but perhaps some of the parameter updates you re applying are more conservative than we re seeing across the group that s more of a statement of my part so i will leave it there and i thank you for your help ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer thanks operator thank you and the next question is from robert sedran from cibc capital markets please go ahead robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst hi good afternoon just first quickly a point of clarification ajai that 50 basis point number that s for the total provision not for the provisions on impaired correct ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer that s correct total robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer not giving a specific number i said in the neighborhood off and robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst understood understood i just wanted to make sure that s what you were speaking i mean not just the provisions on impaired so that s great and then maybe for riaz the card services line on in non interest income was looked a bit light this quarter i don t know if there is an element of seasonality or if there is something else going on in there can you tell us what happened on that please riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer sure rob from time to time as we look at how cardholders engage with us we have a revaluation of points liabilities reward points liabilities etc so it s mostly in this quarter are reflective of those revaluations robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst so absent that impact it would be something closer to what a normal run rate for that line would be is that fair riaz ahmed group head chief financial officer yes teri currie group head canadian personal banking maybe the only thing i would add is that s driven obviously by our customers being more engaged with the program and doing more business with the program so i think that s a well it is an adjustment it s a positive robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator thank you and the next question is from scott chan from canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst good afternoon i always like looking at the aum on a fiscal year on annual basis and when i look at the us segment for you guys the numbers are bit perplexing versus peers us was down another 17 year over year and i think peers are kind of in the high teens you talk about the headwinds of active to passive and i think that is kind of a less of a tailwind going forward but perhaps you can explain why what is going on there and if any kind of actions that kind of stop those outflows greg braca group head us retail td bank group and president and ceo td bank america s most convenient sure so thank you it s greg braca thank you for the question so first i would like to just start off by saying that wealth and and asset management the us continues to be important part of our growth strategy long term and we are spending a lot of time discussing it and you correctly pointed out that there is an industry dynamic going on from active to passive and that s part of the story but i think a couple of quarters ago i also mentioned that we made the strategic decision to exit some money market funds that does drive the top line aum number and we ve called that out in the past and it was a strategic decision they re very very low margin business they were in strategic to us long term and we did exit that so i d say if you think about it half of that story is roughly aum and the active to passive story and the other half is really related to the exit of those money market funds scott chan canaccord genuity analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you and the next question is from nigel d souza from veritas investment research please go ahead nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst thank you good afternoon so i have a few i guess housekeeping items so one question i have for you as you noted that the impact that we had from the derivatives valuation charges in wholesale banking and offset to that was higher trading revenue i believe but when i look at your disclosure looks like trade revenue actually declined sequentially am i misinterpreting the numbers there or is there something i m missing here greg braca group head us retail td bank group and president and ceo td bank america s most convenient no nigel in aggregate the derivative valuation charges in q4 were cad96 million and they were taken through the trading related lines so if you want to get the impact you would have to grow stack back up on to the trading related on the fixed income line nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst got it that s really helpful and then the second point i had is more so on the dividend payout ratio so looking at your supplement the adjusted payout ratio is at 46 5 i understand that includes those restructuring charges which were backed out this quarter but even if we do back that out it s still i believe higher than the run rate we ve seen in prior quarters so does that have any impact i know it s early to talk about it but is that have any impact to your future dividend policy decisions in 2020 or is this just a one off item that we should be looking at bharat masrani group president and chief executive officer let me take that nigel this is bharat we look at our dividends generally speaking once a year and we will do so again and our general policy is to be within the range of 40 to 50 there have been times when we said our ratio will be more influenced by trying to get to the mid range of that range but sometimes we are not the greatest forecasters and it comes in lower than that i think what you saw this quarter because of this various charges it should not be viewed as a pattern from td nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst and the last question i have speaking of those charges the distribution across the segments it s higher and us retail and lower allocation to canadian retail so is this like you mentioned is this merely repositioning in a normal i guess restructuring event or does this at least or do these charges tie in at all to the macro because i think you d expect more headwinds in domestic banking relative to the us banking greg braca group head us retail td bank group and president and ceo td bank america s most convenient yes so it s greg and i ll just start off on the us portion that we ve called out we had cad52 million pre tax and restructuring charges in the us and i d say it s probably half and half as i think about our franchise and store distribution and how we optimizing that in real estate costs and the other half of that charge would be around how are we driving more efficiencies how are we investing for the future and if you ve seen the trend over the last several quarters and over the last year you ve seen us getting more and more expenses out being more efficient as an operation to really allow us to invest in the things that our core including investments in the new platforms and digital and technology and i think we ve made some major strides in 2019 on that front so i divide it up to half on half as i just described for the us nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst okay that s very helpful i appreciate the color thank you operator thank you and the next question is from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you ajai i just wanted to come back to you we talk a lot about normalization of the credit is there any reason to believe loss content by product category whether it s credit cards or other lines of consumer credit lines the loss content as we go into the next cycle will be anymore a punitive or higher than you may have been in prior cycles ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer i don t have any reason to believe that i mean but consumer leverage is high in canada as you could see a little more severity on the canadian side that s the only comment i would make sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst but that s not something that is necessarily you ve explicitly kind of factored into your buildup to that plus or minus 50 basis points ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer not necessarily but i ve certainly taken into account that insolvencies in 19 are higher than 16 17 and 18 they re much lower than 09 but i m certainly assuming we will continue to see that and in my mind the driver of that is the consumer leverage in canada sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and not to belabor the point but from what very limited stuff you ve already seen is there any reason to believe it s going to have a more severe loss content ajai bambawale group head chief risk officer i don t believe so sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you there are no further questions registered at this time i would now like to return the meeting back to bharat masrani bharat masrani group president and chief executive officer thank you operator and thank you for all of you for joining us this afternoon just to conclude very challenging environment it was great to see that we continued to make progress in our enterprise priorities

open this photo in gallery democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren speaks during a campaign stop on nov 23 2019 in manchester n h the associated press elizabeth warren is leading a liberal rebellion against a long held economic view that large tax increases slow economic growth trying to upend democratic policy making in the way supply side conservatives changed republican orthodoxy four decades ago generations of economists across much of the ideological spectrum have long held that higher taxes reduce investment slowing economic growth that drag the consensus held would offset the benefits to growth from increased government spending in areas like education warren and other leading democrats say the opposite the senator from massachusetts who is a leading candidate for the democratic presidential nomination contends that her plans to tax the rich and spend the revenue to lift the poor and the middle class would accelerate economic growth not impede it other democratic candidates are making similar claims about their tax and spend proposals some liberal economists go further and say that simply taxing the rich would help growth no matter what the government did with the money democrats in the past including the party s 2016 nominee hillary clinton have argued that a more modest combination of tax increases and spending programs would expand the economy but no democratic nominee before warren had ever proposed so many new taxes and spending programs and leaned so heavily into the argument that they would be in economist parlance pro growth that argument tries to reframe a classic debate about the economic pie in the united states by suggesting there is no trade off between increasing the size of the pie and dividing the slices more equitably among all americans warren has proposed nearly 3 trillion a year in new taxes on businesses and high earners largely focused on billionaires but sometimes hitting americans who earn 250 000 and above per year the taxes would fund wide reaching new government spending on health care education and family benefits like universal child care and paid parental leave last month warren wrote on twitter that education child care and student loan relief programs funded by her tax on wealthy americans would grow the economy in a separate post she said student debt relief would supercharge growth the last batch of economists to disrupt a political party s consensus position were conservative the so called supply siders who built influence in the late 1970s and gained power in the reagan administration previous republican presidents had focused on keeping the budget deficit low which constrained their ability to cut taxes if they did not also cut government spending supply siders contended that well targeted tax cuts could generate big economic growth even without spending cuts warren is making the case that the economy could benefit if money is redistributed from the rich and corporations to uses that she and other liberals say would be more productive their argument combines hard data showing that high levels of inequality and wealth concentration weigh down economic growth with a belief that well targeted government spending can encourage more americans to work invest and build skills that would make them more productive fuelling their argument is the fact that the united states now has one of the lowest corporate tax burdens among developed nations a direct result of president donald trump s 2017 tax cuts tax revenues at all levels of government in the united states fell to 24 3 per cent of the economy last year the organization for economic cooperation and development reported on thursday down from 26 8 per cent in 2017 america is now has the fourth lowest tax burden in all of the oecd just above mexico chile and ireland a development that democrats say has helped corporate executives and shareholders get rich but has done little to help working americans in making their pitch democrats also cite evidence that transferring money to poor and middle class individuals would increase consumer spending because they spend a larger share of their incomes than wealthy americans who tend to save and invest the economy has changed our understanding of it has changed and we understand the constricting effects of inequality on growth said heather boushey the president of the washington center for equitable growth a think tank focused on inequality inequality has widened significantly in america over the past several decades the congressional budget office estimates that the incomes of the top 1 per cent of americans more than tripled from 1979 to 2016 before taxes and government transfer payments are taken into account for the middle class incomes grew 33 per cent more than a decade after the recession wage growth for the middle class continues to run well behind previous times of economic expansion like the late 1990s research by economist emmanuel saez and colleagues shows that the last time such a small sliver of americans controlled such a large share of the nation s income and wealth was in the late 1920s just before a stock market crash set off the great depression world bank researchers have warned that high levels of inequality are stifling growth in south africa which has the globe s worst measured inequality we have an economy that isn t delivering like it used to said boushey who advised clinton s 2016 democratic presidential campaign that s leading people to say let s re examine the evidence the contention that tax and spending increases can lift economic growth is not the only challenge to traditional orthodoxy brewing in liberal economic circles some democrats have also embraced modern monetary theory which reframes classic thinking that discourages large budget deficits as a drag on growth its supporters including rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and economist stephanie kelton an adviser to sen bernie sanders of vermont argue that the u s government should be spending much more on programs to fight inequality like a federal job guarantee without imposing new taxes some of the inequality focused economists say they are hoping to build new economic models to predict the effects of their policies though they acknowledge few of those models exist yet instead they rely on evidence about the likely effects of individual programs added together many economists who study tax policy contend that warren s plans and other large tax and spend proposals from democratic candidates this year would hurt the economy just as classic economic models suggest some elements of the large increase in government spending on health and education proposed by sen warren would promote economic growth through channels like improved education said alan auerbach an economics professor at the university of california berkeley who has written some of the most influential research in the profession on the relationship between tax rates and growth but he said i am very skeptical that these growth effects would offset the negative effects on growth of the higher taxes particularly given that the spending increases are not specifically targeted toward enhancing growth warren disagrees in the latest democratic debate she said the spending programs funded by her wealth tax would be transformative for workers those plans would raise wages make college tuition free and relieve graduates of student debt she said adding we can invest in an entire generation s future an emerging group of liberal economists say taxes on high earners could spur growth even if the government did nothing with the revenue because the concentration of income and wealth is dampening consumer spending we are experiencing a revolution right now in macroeconomics particularly in the policy space said mark paul an economist who is a fellow at the liberal roosevelt institute in washington we can think of a wealth tax as welfare enhancing in and of itself simply by constraining the power of the very wealthy to influence public policy and distort markets to their advantage taken together warren s proposals would transform the role of federal taxation if every tax increase she has proposed in the campaign passed and raised as much revenue as her advisers predict a contingency hotly debated among even liberal economists total federal tax revenue would grow more than 50 per cent the united states would leap from one of the lowest taxed rich nations to one of the highest it would collect more taxes as a share of the economy than the netherlands and only slightly less than italy sanders plan envisions a similarly large increase in tax levels former vice president joe biden s proposals are much smaller in scale he would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations by 3 4 trillion over a decade in order to fund increased spending on health care higher education infrastructure and carbon emissions reduction if warren s tax program is enacted said gabriel zucman an economist at berkeley who is an architect of her wealth tax proposal in my view the most likely effect is a small positive effect on growth depending on how the revenues are used another economist who has worked with the warren campaign to analyze its proposals mark zandi of moody s said he would expect her plans to be largely a wash on long term economic growth researchers at the levy economics institute of bard college projected this summer that warren s wealth tax and spending policies would generate a 1 7 per cent increase in the size of the economy a preliminary study of a wealth tax like warren s proposal by the penn wharton budget model found that it would reduce the size of the economy by a similar 1 7 per cent the model uses the sort of classic methodology that liberals are now rebelling against and did not evaluate warren s spending proposals historical experience offers few parallels for assessing the economic effects of a taxation and spending program on the scale of warren s ambitions a 2002 study of wealth taxes in rich countries found that those taxes most of which have since been abandoned reduced economic growth slightly on an annual basis conservative economists roundly disagree that large tax increases can spur faster growth even those who say government spending on paid leave and child care may get more americans into the labour force they say a wealth tax on the scale of warren s proposal would greatly reduce savings and investment by the rich what a wealth tax does is it directly taxes savings said aparna mathur an economist at the conservative american enterprise institute who favours a narrow paid leave program and whose research finds benefits from reducing tax rates on business and investment if you re taxing savings you re implicitly taxing investment so how can that possibly be pro growth the supply side economists plans were similarly denounced george bush called them voodoo economic policies while running for president in 1980 but in time dominated republican proposals some members of the new liberal revolt against tax orthodoxy welcome the comparison to the supply side uprising while i think that the supply siders were wrong and were always wrong they were reacting to very real economic problems in the 1970s said michael linden the executive director of the groundwork collaborative a liberal policy and advocacy group there was something really wrong with the economy at the time i think there is now

in the business upon closing with this transaction we expect to improve cibc s common tier 1 equity capital ratio by over 40 basis points on closing and free up capital to reinvest in our core

greater detail over to you hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you victor and good morning everyone my presentation will refer to the slides that are posted on our website starting with slide six this morning we reported earnings of cad1 2 billion and diluted earnings per share of cad2 58 for the fourth quarter of 2019 adjusting for items of note detailed in the appendix of this presentation net income for the quarter was cad1 3 billion and earnings per share of cad2 84 was down 5 year over year overall our pre provision earnings growth of 4 was more than offset by increased provision for credit losses in the quarter revenues of cad4 7 billion were up 4 year over year reflecting solid margin and volume growth across our client franchise expenses grew in line with revenues as we continue to balance strategic investments across our bank with prudent expense management provision for credit losses of cad402 million was up sequentially and compared with the prior year laura will speak to this in more detail in her remarks turning to slide seven our capital position strengthened to 11 6 in the quarter up from 11 4 last quarter and comfortably above our target range including the impact of the announced reduction in our stake in cibc firstcaribbean our pro forma cet1 ratio was approximately 12 internal capital generation of 27 basis points this quarter was partially offset by the impact of higher risk weighted assets due to strong organic growth model updates and the impact of share buybacks rwas increased by cad3 billion in the quarter reflecting largely credit growth across portfolios in our business partly offset by a decrease in market risk in our capital markets business this quarter we also bought back 1 million common shares as part of our ongoing normal course issuer bid which had an impact of 5 basis points on cet1 going forward we expect continued balance sheet strength but anticipate quarterly cet1 increases to be more modest than what we experienced this quarter as we grow our business organically and return capital to shareholders at a more accelerated pace the balance of my presentation will be focused on adjusted results which exclude items of note let me now turn to the performance of our business units starting on slide eight slide eight reflects our personal and small business banking results where we continue to see improved growth in funds managed and return to quarter over quarter growth in residential secured lending balances net income of cad603 million was down 10 from last year as continued investments in the business outpaced revenue growth and we experienced higher provision for credit losses revenue of cad2 2 billion increased 1 year over year driven by underlying nii growth of 3 as a result of expanded margins and deposit volume growth partially offset by lower fee income net interest margin was 253 basis points in the quarter down 2 basis points sequentially due to competitive pricing but up 8 basis points from last year primarily due to the benefit of favorable rates non interest expenses of cad1 2 billion were up 5 from the prior year as we continue to invest in modernizing our bank s infrastructure distribution channels and products as we ve noted before while there is some quarterly volatility and expenses due to timing of initiatives our full year expense growth for the segment of 3 is in line with our previous guidance slide nine shows the results of our canadian commercial banking and wealth management business net income for the quarter was cad307 million down 8 from a year ago due to a cad73 million increase in provision for credit losses primarily due to one notable impairment we continue to see strong operating growth in this business pre provision earnings were up 7 from a year ago driven by revenue growth of 4 against the 2 increase in non interest expenses primarily associated with strategic initiatives including our continued hiring in client facing roles commercial banking revenues were up 8 as we continue to gain share on both sides of the balance sheet with particular strength in deposits deposit and lending balances were up 14 and 12 respectively from the same period last year wealth management revenues were up 2 primarily driven by strong volume growth in our private banking business and higher fee based assets in our brokerage business aum balances grew 11 year over year from growth in our mutual fund and institutional businesses while aua balances grew 7 net interest margin remained relatively stable in this business at 310 basis points down 1 basis point year over year and 2 basis points sequentially driven in part by unfavorable rates and modest pricing compression in the commercial banking business slide 10 shows the results of our us commercial banking and wealth management business net income for the quarter was cad191 million up cad52 million or 37 from the year prior in addition to pre provision earnings growth of 14 the business benefited from particularly strong credit performance this quarter which resulted in a cad23 million reduction in provision for credit losses over the prior year revenues were up 11 from the prior year driven by double digit volume growth and higher asset management fees more than offsetting the impact of lower interest rates average loans grew 4 3 billion or 18 from a year ago reflecting our continued momentum in client development the growth in loans was driven by increases in both the commercial real estate and c i portfolios while the institutional real estate portfolio continued to remain relatively flat average deposits grew 2 9 billion or 21 from a year ago reflecting strong organic growth from new clients and other deposit initiatives net interest margin was 293 basis points down 25 basis points sequentially and 31 basis points from a year ago as noted last quarter our nim benefited from certain non recurring items which contributed 7 basis points to our q3 margin the balance of the decrease quarter over quarter was largely due to the impact of falling rates related to the three recent fed cuts we also continue to grow our us private wealth business aum was up 15 over the prior year driven by organic growth helped by tighter integration with our commercial and private banking businesses non interest expenses increased 8 from the prior year reflecting continued but moderating investments in headcount infrastructure and marketing expenses to support growth as with last year we anticipate a seasonal expense increase in q1 related to the accrual of incentive and benefit cost but expect full year expense growth in 2020 to come in below the levels we experienced this past year turning to capital markets on slide 11 net income of cad226 million for the quarter was down cad7 million or 3 from a year ago as pre provision earnings growth of 19 was offset by cad49 million higher provision for credit losses revenues this quarter were cad735 million up cad86 million or 13 from the prior year this reflects strong performance across the business with higher trading activity broadly across all products strategic growth in corporate banking and higher underwriting activity our differentiated capital markets business continues to generate strong returns and stable revenues supported by our growth momentum in the us and our growing revenue streams from its connectivity with our other business units non interest expenses of cad386 million were up cad30 million or 8 from a year ago primarily driven by higher performance related compensation and higher spend on growth in enterprise initiatives finally slide 12 reflects the results of the corporate and other business unit net loss for the quarter was cad18 million compared with a loss of cad11 million for the prior year these results reflect strong performance in fcib and disciplined expense management balance against our ongoing investment and enterprisewide strategic initiatives we anticipate the announced sale of a portion of our stake in fcib to close in the second half of 2020 and we will continue to recognize income from fcib in the normal course until that let me now turn to slide 13 which summarizes our full year 2019 results on a full year basis net income of cad5 4 billion and earnings per share of cad11 92 were both down 2 year over year a record pre provision earnings of cad8 1 billion were up 5 from the prior year underpinned by revenue growth across each of our businesses and positive operating leverage we maintained a return of equity of 15 4 for the year ahead of our 15 target and we finished the year with a strong balance sheet and cet1 ratio of 11 6 heading into fiscal 2020 we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our clients and we are well positioned to build momentum and earnings growth through 2020 and with that i will turn the call over to laura laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer all right thank you hratch and good morning so let me start with the review of our credit performance in the fourth quarter turning to slide 15 provisions for impaired loans increased to cad330 million representing a provision rate of 33 basis points this increase was driven mainly by our business and government portfolios and was largely as a result of one fraud related impairment that amounted to cad52 million in our canadian commercial bank our provisions on for performing increased to cad72 million this quarter cad40 million of the move relates to changes in our forward looking indicators including our scenario weightings which were adjusted toward the downside the remainder of the increase is related to credit migration mainly in our business and government portfolios the next slide provides an overview of our gross impaired loans which increased to 47 basis points the increase was mostly driven by our business and government loans as i mentioned earlier slide 17 shows the net write off rates of our canadian consumer portfolios the increase in net write offs over the course of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by our unsecured lines of credit notwithstanding the slight increase write off continue to perform within our risk tolerance and in line with consumer insolvency trends that we are seeing in canada slide 18 provides the 90 plus day delinquency rates of our canadian consumer portfolios our delinquency rates have moved up this past quarter the increase is mainly in insured mortgages and secured lines of credit within personal lending that have conservative collateral coverage as such we do not expect them to translate into notable losses increases are primarily from the alberta region which is experiencing more challenging economic conditions and higher unemployment rates page 19 summarizes our credit performance on a full year basis our key metrics such as write off delinquency rates and loan impairments continue to remain well within our risk appetite provisions on impaired loans ended the year within expectation at 29 basis points and that s despite some distinct impairments during 2019 when we account for this i would expect our provisions on impaired loans to remain relatively flat in 2020 when compared with 2019 and with regards to provisions on performing loans they migrated higher this year primarily as a result of changes to our forward looking indicators and scenario weights more specifically we slightly shifted the scenario weighting to the downside along with the more tempered outlook for unemployment and wti prices that said to the extent our economic outlook remains stable we would expect moves in provisions on performing to be more modest in 2020 than they were in 2019 to conclude we continue to have solid underwriting standards and credit policies a strong team of experts along with a proactive management of accounts and i continue to have a strong degree of comfort with the quality and resiliency of our credit portfolios and with our credit outlook for 2020 with that i ll turn the call back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you the first question is from gabriel dechaine with national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst hi good morning just wanted to ask first about the us margin you mentioned the three fed rate hikes is there any reason why the drop was sharper this quarter than it was in q3 or was it just a lagged effect jumped out at me and then sorry where do you expect that to be in q1 and 2020 hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you gabriel it s hratch so addressing the nim in the quarter i think first starting with the 7 basis points one time help that we had in the q3 quarter so i think that creates a bit of noise and then in this quarter i would say we have a couple of basis points of one time negative so those things combined i think skew the quarter over quarter picture a little bit so i think for the rest of it as you look at the combined margin change over the latter half that represent the bulk of the impact in our business due to the recent changes in yield curve and the fed cuts and the reason it presents that way with the bulk in the quarter is really the pricing dynamic of our book and so as our assets reprice with libor and we continue to reprice our deposits on a negotiated basis with clients that effort is still under way despite the pressure on nim though i ll note nii was up 7 year over year this quarter due to our strong volume growth and in terms of looking at that forwards we do largely anticipate that stabilizing here given where we re at libor is at this point maybe a slight downward pressure from here but largely stabilizing and with that we feel confident between the stabilizing margin and the continued growth in volume that we will continue to see good nii growth gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst so a couple of basis points down over the next few quarters hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i d say something in that neighborhood generally flat gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay then on the credit i just wanted to better understand the guidance for that you re giving full year loss rate on impaired loans of 29 basis point so you think you re expecting that to be stable in 2020 i keep hearing the word normalization from banks and i m just wondering if that means no we re actually going to move higher laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer so yes what i did say is that when we account for the unusual items that took place during 2019 that i do expect our provisions on impaired loans to remain flat when i compare them to 2019 so thinking out to 2020 so there would be some if you will normalization in the numbers so increased impaired but offset by some of the one off items such that we remain flat or expected to remain flat on a year over year basis gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst okay and then just the last one how does like this trend of higher provision is going to you talked about a lot how does it affect your risk appetite thinking about card which is a battleground and that s only going to intensify to the mid year midpoint of 2020 unsecured personal lending has been a growth area for a few banks in the last number of years how does all of this change your appetite looking forward laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer well it doesn t change our appetite when we look forward as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we continue to have strong underwriting standards that will continue to apply and we re very proactive in terms of how we manage our account base and while we are seeing some rise in our delinquency numbers and write offs all within risk appetite as i said we are seeing some increases in insolvencies across canada some softness in alberta but nothing of concern and i think that s why you re hearing everyone talk about the term of normalization if you will recall we ve come off of some really low loan losses in history and i think this is just a bit of a return to normal so don t see anything of concern gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst thank you for that operator thank you and the next question is from scott chan with canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst good morning could you remind me how much the annual impact is on firstcaribbean on an annualized basis and if that is factored into your fiscal 2020 eps guidance of low single digit hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks it s hratch i ll take that so we see fcib impact as more of a later 2020 and 2021 impact so it s not in the numbers that we re speaking of as we ve mentioned before we expect that transaction to close somewhere toward the end of the year depending on the regulatory processes so it s not a 2020 impact for 2021 going forward and the way we would think about it is that we see the impact of the reduction in earnings that we realize of our fcib position netted off against some income we have from the loan and then in terms of the net of that we haven t talked about the specific numbers but generally when we do the math the capital that we will be freeing up in the transaction if deployed toward the buyback programs and net net we think that generally neutralizes the impact to eps so that s the way we would guide to it scott chan canaccord genuity analyst okay and just on the canadian personal and small business banking side i saw that nim was up 8 bips year over year but i didn t see the sequential number i don t know if you have that and perhaps an outlook on that on the margin for that in fiscal 20 hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure so the sequential was down 2 basis points on the canadian psbb business and that really was the net some pressure on margins on certain products as we got into q4 but still some continued momentum from favorable rates on the repricing of our tractors and so going forward at this point with our expectation and what seems to be generally in line with markets expectation for rates in canada it s looking like stable with maybe slight negative margin pressure in that business but generally sorry full year 19 to full year 20 in the same neighborhood scott chan canaccord genuity analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you the next question is from steve theriault with eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital group analyst thanks very much want to ask a question on mortgages for christina christina can you talk about your outlook for a mortgage growth in 2020 and specifically do you have a better sense of when you get back to market levels of growth seeing some improvement this quarter here christina kramer senior executive vice president and group head personal and small business banking canada thank you steve while we have some more work to do to get back to market level of growth we re pleased with what we re seeing and what we re delivering in the market so we expect improvement in our performance as you may be aware this quarter we saw growth as hratch mentioned and that growth came across our banking centers and our mobile mortgage advisor teams and that comes after a period of flat growth the quarter prior in several quarters of decline prior to that we see continued strong retention rates and our pipeline remains improved on a year over year basis so with all of that we expect that market growth we will improve our growth rate and it may take some time as we get to market level growth rates steve theriault eight capital group analyst is that foreseeable in 2020 or is it difficult to say at this stage christina kramer senior executive vice president and group head personal and small business banking canada it s difficult to say but our objective is to continue to improve and we based on what we re seeing we re confident that we will see that steve theriault eight capital group analyst okay thanks for that i had one quick question just about one of the unusuals the interest income settlement on tax matters wondering if is that related to the cra reassessments of the total return swap activity from a few years back can you help me with that hratch hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer sorry can you repeat the questions steve theriault eight capital group analyst one of the unusuals this quarter was it was called interest income settlement on certain tax matters i was wondering if that s linked back to the cra s reassessment of some of the total return swap activities hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer no so that was related a portion of that was related to the enron settlement that we had announced and then a few other pieces but nothing to do with that other file steve theriault eight capital group analyst and also the increase in legal provisions was that related at all to the provision in the canadian bank or was that is that something else hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer so we won t speak to specifically the matters underlying that there is some ongoing legal matters that were provisioned for before and this is an increase to that provision steve theriault eight capital group analyst okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman with cormark securities please go ahead meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good morning it s come up before but definitely relevant today just trying to get a better sense of how to forecast provisions on performing loans and specifically the forward looking indicators and i ask it specifically because i don t think we ve seen any other updates this quarter from other banks and i appreciate you can t speak to peers but it stands out from that perspective and also just given even the bank of canada s statement yesterday so i m just wondering if you could give us any more guidance here how much levy do you have when you re making these kinds of updates like was this an update that could have been made like can you defer it to a quarter or two how does those mechanics work or anything that you can point to give us a better sense of when these types of adjustments are going to be made laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer sure meny it s laura so i ll take that one so a lot of it again hard to compare all of the banks but it really depends on where our starting point was back when we first implemented ifrs 9 and so from there really it s formulaic in that every quarter we have an economic outlook that gets updated and that s what tends to drive portion of this number so for us this quarter the biggest impact with the flis as i mentioned in my prepared remarks was around the forward looking indicators and the scenario weights so essentially what we did is we increased the probability weight to the downside scenario and equally decreased the way to the upside scenario and so from an economic outlook perspective that was to reflect increased uncertainty in the macro environment so that change if you will accounted for both half of the move the rest of it came from revised forecast to certain factors as i mentioned one of those was unemployment and the other one was wti so again it s really how we update our economic outlook on a quarterly basis so hopefully that clarifies and as i said in my prepared remarks when we look forward into 2020 so to the extent our economic outlook remains stable we d expect that the provisions on performing would come in at a more modest level than they have this year does that help you meny grauman cormark securities analyst yeah i mean i guess it s it seems like a very small changes in sort of economic outlooks lead to relatively large changes in updates to the forward looking indicators when it comes to performing loans is that correct like is there the sensitivity is would you say is relatively high to small changes that s what it seems is going on laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer yeah that s right and i think as we ve always talked about ifrs 9 with that comes the volatility that you d expect to see on a quarter over quarter basis now we do always have the ability to overlay our expert credit judgment which we do on occasion but for a lot smaller amounts for us here at cibc this is primarily formulaic driven meny grauman cormark securities analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from mario mendonca with td securities please go ahead mario mendonca td securities analyst good morning just one sort of detailed question first the net interest income in the corporate segment it seems elevated now i understand that a big portion of that hratch is cad67 million interest settlement but even adjusting for that it does look somewhat elevated my suspicion is that that s offset somewhere else perhaps in other revenue or non interest income can you help me think through that is that the right way to look at it hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks mario so you re right in that the large part of that nii is related to that cad67 million of interest income outside of that i would say we have the continued performance of fcib as well as within treasury we had some good performance this quarter that would drive that but generally no other specific items to point out there mario mendonca td securities analyst and so there is no natural offset there like non interest income being maybe a little light in that division is there any sort of logical offset or is it just good treasury performance this quarter that you d highlight for us hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer no not really i think it s those factors of those key pieces of nii being performing well mario mendonca td securities analyst okay and then just broadly on expenses i thought i heard you say something to the effect of expense growth should be lower in 2020 than it was in 2019 now you may have been referring specifically to a segment so if it was a segment could you offer a more broad outlook on expense growth in 2020 hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure and that comment was specific to the us business mario as we ve continued to invest in that business mike has talked about that in the past both in terms of the back end capabilities as well as the front line so any particular more color on that i ll let mike take it if you want in terms of total bank guidance the last back half of the year we ve been guiding to that 4 5 range and that s why we re in and our goal overall is to manage the business over the long term for positive operating leverage and improve efficiency over time so we re pleased to have done that both in q4 as well as full year this year going forward we think as we are seeing currently the revenue environment and the expenses that drives as well as the investments that we will continue to make we think that back half is still the right range to target for 2020 and again long term we are managing to positive operating leverage here and there ll be some quarterly volatility in that and you may have some negative operating leverage but we think at this point with the revenue we re seeing that s the right expense level for us mario mendonca td securities analyst 4 to 5 then thank you for that operator thank you the next question is from doug young with desjardins capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins capital markets analyst hi good morning just back to you laura just on the credit side when you gave your guidance for impaired loans being pcl rate being flat year over year you talked about it excluding unusual items can you talk a bit about what you define as being some of the unusual credit items that came through in fiscal 19 laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer yeah for myself the more unusual items would have been those that we mentioned that took place this quarter so items that are really not representative if you will of the strength of the overall loan book the unusual items we had this year that would have gone sort of straight to stage 3 and not transited sort of through the stage 2 provisioning doug young desjardins capital markets analyst and that would been the fraud in canadian commercial and that was the cad52 million i believe in pcl is that correct laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer that s right and you ll recall we spoke of one in the utility sector earlier on in the year so those would form if you will the bulk of what i see is isolated events doug young desjardins capital markets analyst okay and then you re performing loan pcl for the year was about 4 basis points but you re essentially saying between it s going to be less than that essentially is what you re anticipating absent any changes to forward looking indicators or your models and scenario weights essentially laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer that s right doug young desjardins capital markets analyst okay and then victor you mentioned in your comments change of cost structure and i don t want to take it out of context but what i d like to know is do you think big changes need to be made to your cost structure and if so do you anticipate having to take a restructuring charge to reset your cost structure victor g dodig president and chief executive officer so doug good morning it s a good question i think it s important to kind of provide broader context on our cost transformation over the years if you look at the last couple of years we ve made progress on simplifying our bank and improving efficiency in a number of ways and we use that through a combination of restructuring charges in 2016 and importantly normal course efficiency gains and with that focus on cost transformation our nix ratio had improved from where it was in 2016 at 58 to 55 6 today our goal is to get to 55 some of the revenue softness that we had got in the way we re 55 6 and we re fairly pleased with those results as we go forward we ll continue down the same path and we believe we have further opportunities to simplify our operations and create efficiency and while we prefer to execute this gradually over the normal course we continue to review all our options and that could potentially require a charge down the line in order to accelerate our progress we ve got a target of 52 by 2022 that was based on the old revenue environment i think a more realistic mix target for 2022 based on the macroeconomic factors that we see out there is in the 53 5 to 54 range so we need to work diligently to get there doug young desjardins capital markets analyst so not really what would be the pivot point where you think some drastic change has to be made is that just what the revenue environment is just not turning the way that you anticipate is there any sense that you can give us victor g dodig president and chief executive officer don t look at it as pivot points doug we kind of look at it as an ongoing transformation and we re sort of halfway through the cost transformation at cibc we ve made really good progress and there is more progress to make doug young desjardins capital markets analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you the next question is from sumit malhotra with scotiacapital please go ahead sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst thanks good morning i want to just start with a couple of things with credit on the canadian commercial fraud situation looking at your all bank numbers here your charge offs weren t really that different than they ve been running out here i have got a lot of paper on my desk so i think it was in the neighborhood of cad234 million in the quarter so is your provision for this situation is it resolved that this is something that you re not going to collect or is there any possibility of this comes back because obviously there is a big delta between what you provision and what you charged off in q4 laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer yeah hi sumit you re right i mean the provision level can always change over time because it really depends on how the situation evolves at this point in time we re provisioned that cad0 49 on the dollar i think we re adequately provisioned at this point in time but the story will play out but at this point in time it feels like we re adequately provisioned sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst and just a couple of more for you i think doug was getting at this too so if we look at the full year pcl ratio for the bank i think it s around 33 basis points this year and you referenced a couple of things whether it s the fraud whether it s pg e earlier in the year i mean look further we go in the cycle these things are going to happen when you couple that with the movements in your underlying parameters or methodology when you think total pcl for cibc in 2020 the bank has at times in the past given us some indication relative to that 33 basis points on a total level what do you think is an appropriate range investors should be thinking about laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer well as i talked to and i break it down into two amounts because as you can appreciate the provisions on impaired feels a little easier if you will to predict so barring unforeseen events my expectation as i said is that we remain relatively flat so we came in at 29 basis points for the year as i said which was within guidance that we provided last year i would expect us to remain flat next year and with regards to provisions on performing as you said they were up 4 basis points and i would expect again unless things change in terms of our economic outlook that the increase would be more modest than before sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst and last one for you there has been some volatility in the canadian consumer bankruptcy and solvency proposals that we ve seen in the last number of months which seems to be at odds with the jobs data in canada and some of the underlying credit metrics we ve seen from the banks did that play any part at all in the parameters update you enacted and any comment from you especially given the larger credit card portfolio of the bank as to how you re thinking about that situation with respect to your consumer book laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer i m actually feeling very comfortable with our consumer book and our credit cards are actually i would say performing in line with expectation we did see a bit of increase in delinquency rate sort of quarter over quarter but that was really seasonality where we see delinquencies normalizing after usually low summer numbers what we re saying here and maybe if i look at it in two parts so on the delinquencies is the bulk of the uptick was really in our insured mortgages and secured lines of credit and that was mainly driven by the softness that we saw in alberta so from that perspective all of those loans are really well collateralized so losses would be very lowest ever materialize but if you look at our net write offs where we re seeing the bulk of the increases there is really in our unsecured lines of credit and that would be in line with the broader trend that we re seeing in canada where we ve seen consumer insolvencies up i guess i d just point out that even with that increase in the personal lending segment when you look at it from a year over year basis it s a cad9 million increase cad15 million from a quarter over quarter basis so nothing of great concern and in our provisions for performing there was some delinquency migration in that number but as you saw on i think it was slide 15 it was a very small amount does that answer your question sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst that s very good thank you for that last question and just very quickly for hratch i think ex of the accounting or ifrs changes next quarter pro forma on capital you re about 11 8 one of the better numbers in the group i believe you answered the question on fcib saying that you could neutralize the eps impact by buying back more stock is that something you re suggesting will occur as that transaction closes or given your pro forma visibility is that uptick in buyback activity that you re referencing something that the bank is thinking about prior to the close of that transaction hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thanks sumit i ll take that one but we re going to have to move on after this sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst absolutely hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer on the capital one so i think we have slightly different numbers than you on the q1 and as we ve disclosed the ifrs impact for us is a bit smaller than what the peer group has disclosed but leaving that noise aside in q1 as i mentioned in my remarks we do expect capital generation forward to continue to be net positive maybe a bit more modest than this quarter because of some of the one time helps we had this quarter but still net positive and we feel pretty good about that and even before that close and having the capital in the door on fcib we feel strong about our capital trajectory and with that we anticipate accelerating the buyback activity in advance of that so as i said in the remarks again going forward from here we anticipate to be more active in that than we have been in the past sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst will compare numbers after thanks for your help hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks sumit operator thank you the next question is from nigel d souza with veritas investment research please go ahead nigel d souza veritas investment research analyst hi my questions have actually been asked and answered thank you operator thank you the next question is from mike rizvanovic with credit suisse please go ahead mike rizvanovic credit suisse analyst hi good morning just want to go back to laura on the provisioning on performing loans so if you could just help me understand but your guidance for a lower number in 2020 is a bit confusing to me just based on the fact that you re discussing more downside risk it seems like you re a bit more negative than you would have been last quarter or even at the beginning of the year can you just sort of help me understand that dynamic laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer yeah well maybe i ll start with provisions on performing so those are forward looking and so i would say that that takes into account that downside my expectation again at this point in time would be that our economic outlook at this point remain stable so in that regard that s why i expect provisions on performing to come in lower in 2020 than they did this year that s what s regards to provisions on performing with regards to provision on impaired loans just in keeping with a bit more downside on the horizon i do expect impaired provisions to increase in 2020 relative to 2019 but essentially what i ve done is i ve taken into account the unique events of 2019 that we spoke of and i assume that those likely won t represent and when i took all that into account how i get to flat in my expectations for provisions on impaired in 2020 relative to 2019 does that help mike rizvanovic credit suisse analyst yeah it helps is it fair to say that so as you add loans in 2020 you would be provisioning slightly more on the performing is that fair on those new loans just given your more negative outlook laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer well i m not sure that that s the way i would look at it i mean the provisions on performing take into account the economic outlook and during the year i will take into account credit migration so yeah i guess there will be some of that in there but even with that i still expect that provisions on performing when we look forward to come in less than what we had in 2019 mike rizvanovic credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful thanks and then just one quick one for christina just wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about the trade off between getting your residential mortgage growth back up toward industry peer levels with the margin like are you going to look to maybe protect the margin and maybe this is a longer process than was originally anticipated or how do you think about that trade off christina kramer senior executive vice president and group head personal and small business banking canada so it is in the mortgage strategy trade off it s really about our focus on our clients and growing with our clients and the markets that we serve them in and across canada so as we continue to see opportunity to continue to help clients with their home ambitions we expect there is opportunity for growth in this space and it will also then contribute to our relationship strategy because homeownership is a great moment for us to help canadians with broader goals their financial planning goals beyond that so when we look at the margin question it s really about how do we build a longer term relationship with our clients and we will compete in the market at the rates we ll need to compete in mike rizvanovic credit suisse analyst so is it fair to look at that catch up is maybe more of a 2021 story just given the sizable differential that you currently have christina kramer senior executive vice president and group head personal and small business banking canada we will see growth in this segment of the business in the mortgage space in the portfolio over the course of the year and i d say that because we re seeing it in q4 and it s been improving for a couple of quarters now and the growth will continue over that course of that business and by the end of the year will position us well for 21 as well mike rizvanovic credit suisse analyst okay thanks very much operator thank you the next question is from sohrab movahedi with bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst quick question for jon hountalas jon if i look at just the commercial banking component of canadian commercial and wealth the margins in that business are down every quarter this year anyway can you just talk to me to us i guess a little bit about the dynamics there between volume growth and margin compression as you look into 2020 jon hountalas senior executive vice president and group head commercial banking and wealth management canada thank you for the question so our model has been pretty consistent and we don t compete on rates at all has the market gotten a little kind of more aggressive yes but nothing material a lot of the compression you see is just rate impact so we haven t seen big clients compression and whatever has existed has been more on the deposit in the loan side going forward i don t see again from client pricing perspective i don t see big deterioration so could it move a basis point a couple of basis points perhaps but nothing material sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst but the direction however is generally low or down i should say jon hountalas senior executive vice president and group head commercial banking and wealth management canada i mean client pricing i don t think will be going up so again we re running a relationship bank we will compete in the market we don t meet on price but we re in business when they are good clients and when they are relationship clients sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst okay and then maybe just a couple of quickies here hratch you or victor i guess i mean we ve talked about the capital ratios now and pro forma and potential for buyback but generally speaking is there a kind of level that you are going to try and run the bank with the capital ratio level is at 11 5 is it low 11 s is it high 11 s can you give us a kind of yardstick on that victor g dodig president and chief executive officer good morning sohrab it s victor here so we ve done a good job in building up a very robust capital level on a pro forma basis at 12 we think about running the bank at 11 to 11 5 range being the comfortable range for us we re clearly at 11 6 today just to remind you of our capital priorities going forward and they try to do this every quarter we have four the first one is to invest in our businesses for organic growth we have been investing and that s reflected in our expense growth with an over indexing in our commercial banking and wealth management businesses in addition to our canadian personal banking business share buybacks are an important component of that i think hratch has been clear we bought back 1 million shares last quarter we do intend to accelerate the pace of share repurchases given our current capital level with respect to dividends we target the mid point of our 40 to 50 range on an adjusted basis we re slightly above that we plan to grow our dividends as in line with our earnings and the last one on inorganic investments and i think we ve been quite clear that we re selective we re in no rush we re investing in our business organically you can see the growth in the us is quite robust with the expansion in the markets our bias is really toward tuck ins at most for the foreseeable future sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst i mean that s excellent victor do you think you to rethink the dividend policy from a semi annual to an annual just to give a bit more flexibility given some of the kind of lack of transparency or visibility i guess into the outlook or you think there is no need for that victor g dodig president and chief executive officer all right at this point in time there is no need to rethink it we may we re really focused on improving the performance of our businesses we did not deliver what we wanted to deliver to our shareholders and we are focused on getting the bank back to earnings growth in 2020 that s the primary preoccupation of the leadership team sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you very much operator thank you this will conclude today s question and answer session i would now like to turn the meeting over to victor victor g dodig president and chief executive officer thank you operator so we said in 2015 that we are going to succeed by building cibc into a client focused bank and we ve made clear progress in that regard this year we continue to improve our client experience numbers across our canadian retail business we drove robust topline growth in commercial banking delivered strong results in our us businesses and continued the transformation of our capital markets franchise into a connected business that s driving high quality earnings consistently for our bank we are affirming our belief that we re on the right path and as i look to 2020 i m confident that we are well positioned to deliver value to our clients and team and growth to our shareholders just before i wrap up i d like to thank kevin glass for his contributions to our bank over the past 11 years he s been quiet during this call but he has been beside a microphone in case you did have a question for him kevin has been a tremendous leader and an important part of our team and we wish him the very best as he starts his retirement at the end of the year and on behalf of our board and executive leadership team i want to thank our entire cibc team for your continued dedication to making our clients ambitions a reality and to our shareholders for your continued support have a wonderful holiday season everyone we will talk to you in the new year operator thank you the conference has now ended please disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation duration 60 minutes call participants geoff weiss senior vice

gold will not surpass its 1980 peak when gold s price reached 850 per ounce in january 1980 it seemed as if nothing would stop the runaway train that was headed straight for 1000 per ounce but it was stopped and began sliding downhill quickly by june 1982 two and one half years later gold s price had declined by sixty five percent at close to 300 per ounce the price of gold seemed farther away from the 1000 mark than ever before at 300 per ounce the eventual low for gold of 250 was a short distance away but that downside price did not come until seventeen years later in late 1999 as far as 1000 gold is concerned that did not occur until september 2009 almost thirty years after gold peaked at 850 in january 1980 after that gold s price continued higher to almost 1900 in august 2011 since then gold s price has declined to 1050 in december 2015 and then retraced some of that decline back up to over 1500 per ounce currently the price of gold is at 1460 per ounce below is a chart showing a one hundred year history of the gold price including the past forty years 1980 2019 which are summarized above looking at the chart it would appear that gold s price is in a prolonged uptrend that continues to provide positive results for long term holders of gold who exercise patience in real terms however the chart is quite deceptive here is another chart of the same history this one is adjusted for the effects of inflation as can be seen clearly in the second chart gold did not make a new high in 2011 its price in inflation adjusted dollars topped out just below its peak in 1980 not only that but in inflation adjusted terms gold s peak intra day price in 2011 was twenty two percent lower than its peak intra day price in 1980 in other words gold at 1900 per ounce in august 2011 represented a loss in purchasing power of more than one fifth from its high of 850 per ounce in january 1980 because gold has declined further since 2011 that loss in purchasing power has ballooned to almost one half very bluntly and to the point every dollar in gold from january 1980 to today is worth only 53 cents that is not because gold is a bad investment it is because gold is not an investment gold s price is an inverse reflection of what is happening to the us dollar see the chart below all of the major high points and low points 1933 1971 1980 2001 2011 for inflation adjusted gold prices coincided with major changes in the relative strength and value of the us dollar what appears to be volatility in gold is really volatility in the us dollar regardless of the apparent volatility when we look at gold over a longer period of time a different picture emerges over the past one hundred years the us dollar has lost between ninety eight and ninety nine percent of its purchasing power this correlates directly to a gold price that is currently seventy times higher than it was one hundred years ago 20 67 x 70 1446 the range in gold prices over the past several years is indicative of the broader parameters of the dollar s decline a ninety eight percent decline correlates to a gold price at 1000 per ounce its low point in december 2015 was 1040 a ninety nine percent decline correlates to a gold price of 2000 per ounce gold s high in august 2011 was approximately 1900 gold s value is in its use as money money s value is in its purchasing power what you can exchange it for as the us dollar continues to decline in value the price of gold over time will reflect that by moving higher conversely there are periods of relative strength and stability in the us dollar during those periods the price of gold will remain stable or move lower those periods are seen on the third chart above 1 1933 1970 2 1980 2000 3 2011 current part of the problem in understanding gold is due to our inherent tendency to view changes in an item s price as a change in its perceived value that can be true to a certain extent when assessing the value of stocks real estate household goods personal services education etc or anything else for that matter except money that is because money is what we use to value all of those other things that is fine when the money is stable and a reliable store of value see a loaf of bread a gallon of gas an ounce of gold gold is original money it was the measure of value for everything else the us dollar and all paper currencies are substitutes for original money i e gold today some are trying to assess a value for gold based on fundamentals that are inapplicable these so called fundamentals include interest rates social unrest wars political instability changes in the economy etc none of these things have any impact on gold gold s value is constant and unchanging does it make sense to try to measure the value of real money gold using a money substitute the us dollar most analysts have it backwards they keep analyzing gold or trying to anyway and those who listen to them will continue to be confused and disappointed by results that do not meet expectations the object of analysis should be the us dollar at some point ahead the price of gold will eventually approach and exceed its previous peak from august 2011 but in inflation adjusted terms it will not exceed either of its previous peaks in 1980 and 2011 that is because the real value of gold is constant and unchanging it is the measure of value for everything else for example in today s dollars gold s potential high point is slightly less than 2100 per ounce see the second chart above the difference between gold s previous high of 1900 and 2100 today represents the loss in purchasing power of the us dollar that has taken place since august 2011 well then can gold s price go higher than 2100 yes absolutely but that will only happen with further deterioration in the value of the us dollar which means that no matter how high the price of gold goes it will only be indicative of how weak the us dollar gets and however high that price is on an inflation adjusted basis it will not exceed its previous peaks of 1980 and 2011 as the dollar buys less and less over time the dollar price of gold continues to rise but as we discussed earlier the increasing dollar price of gold doesn t represent profits the price of gold changes depending on changes in whatever money substitute is used right now gold is priced and international trades are settled in us dollars changes in the dollar price of gold are indicative of changes in the us dollar if everyone agreed to price gold in chinese yuan or any other currency or combination of currencies nothing would change insofar as gold s value is concerned see gold and the usd cny it s still about the us dollar regardless of how high or how low the price of gold goes its value does not change changes in gold s price are inverse reflections of changes in the us dollar by kelsey williams kelsey williams is a retired financial professional living in southern utah his website kelsey s

financial measure quarterly revenue was 121 2 million up 15 from the same quarter last year gross margin percentage for the quarter was 28 1 compared to 27 4 for the corresponding period last year ebitda was up more than 30 to 20 5 million for the quarter as compared to the same period last year the impact of ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 was minimal at 0 5 million net earnings were 7 3 million or 0 09 per share for the quarter compared to 3 3 million or 0 04 per share for the prior year quarter net cash is up 12 8 million during the quarter to 22 5 million demand for our services continued to grow in all of our regions this quarter driven primarily by market share growth as customers value our specialized expertise and safety culture said denis larocque president and ceo of major drilling group international inc we had a very good operational quarter all around which has allowed us to produce good margins margins were also strengthened by a one time revenue adjustment from escalation and currency clauses on one of our contracts the company s ebitda increased by 30 with a 15 revenue growth demonstrating the company s operational leverage we continue to reap productivity benefits from the tools we ve developed over the last few years and from our enhanced training and skilled labour force also our administrative costs remained relatively stable despite the revenue growth the company improved its net cash position by 12 8 million to 22 5 million this quarter we spent 5 5 million on capital expenditures adding one new rig to our fleet as well as rod handlers and support equipment and disposed of one rig in line with our strategy of improving our fleet and services the fleet total remains unchanged at 601 rigs added mr larocque we are continuing to improve the suite of services we offer our customers with new innovative solutions and improved equipment through increased hands free rod handling capacity computerized rigs and deep hole capacity we have established mutually beneficial partnerships with several of our senior customers to develop these innovative solutions it is important to note that we are now in our third quarter traditionally the weakest quarter of our fiscal year as mining and exploration companies shut down often for extended periods over the holiday season as usual due to the time it takes to mobilize once new contracts are awarded a slow start up pace is expected in january and february additionally the company schedules substantial overhaul and maintenance work on its equipment during this slower period these factors result in reduced revenue increased costs and reduced margins in the third quarter said mr larocque following the end of the second quarter on november 1st the company closed a transaction to acquire the shares of norex drilling limited the transaction was completed by payment of a cash portion of 15 2 million subject to post closing debt working capital adjustments and holdbacks out of the company s current cash balance and the issuance of 334 169 common shares of the company in addition an earn out of up to 2 5 million will be payable in cash following the third anniversary of the closing subject to certain conditions looking forward to the fourth quarter and beyond senior customers are still working through their budget process and have yet to decide on post holiday exploration plans the price of gold which historically has accounted for approximately 50 of the company s drilling activity has remained above us 1 400 an ounce over the last four months which has produced some good cash flow generation and improved balance sheets for our senior gold customers although exploration expenditures are down globally in calendar 2019 we have increased our revenue with senior mining companies by 24 as we continue to build our relationships with these customers as activity increases we expect to face labour and materials cost inflation we are in a position to react quickly to customers demands as the company s financial strength has allowed it to invest in safety equipment innovation and to maintain its equipment in excellent condition finally i am pleased to announce that ms sybil veenman has been appointed to the company s board of directors ms veenman brings over 20 years of mining industry experience both as a public company director and a senior executive previously she was senior vice president and general counsel and a member of the executive leadership team at barrick gold corporation she currently serves as a director at royal gold inc iamgold nexgen energy ltd and noront resources ltd second quarter ended october 31 2019 total revenue for the quarter was 121 2 million up 15 from revenue of 105 5 million recorded in the same quarter last year the favourable foreign exchange translation impact for the quarter when comparing to the effective rates for the same period last year is estimated at 1 million on revenue with a negligible impact on net earnings revenue for the quarter from canada u s drilling operations increased by 16 to 65 3 million compared to the same period last year with both regions demonstrating growth our u s operations experienced another strong quarter of revenue growth due to increased market share with senior customers south and central american revenue increased by 2 to 29 8 million for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year a strong quarter in mexico and brazil was offset by a continued slowdown in argentina due to political uncertainty as well as business interruptions in chile and suriname due to unforeseen political and civil unrest asian and african operations reported revenue of 26 1 million up 32 from the same period last year indonesia and southern africa continued their recent growth trends which more than offset the loss of revenue from closing our burkina faso operations in the previous year the overall gross margin percentage for the quarter was 28 1 compared to 27 4 for the same period last year a good operational quarter somewhat strengthened by a one time revenue adjustment from escalation and currency clauses on one of our contracts contributed to the margin growth general and administrative costs were 11 5 million an increase of 0 3 million compared to the same quarter last year the marginal increase was mainly driven by our share based compensation plan that was impacted by the positive upward movement of the share price over the quarter offset by the impact of ifrs 16 net earnings were 7 3 million or 0 09 per share 0 09 per share diluted for the quarter compared to net earnings of 3 3 million or 0 04 per share 0 04 per share diluted for the prior year quarter non ifrs financial measure the company uses the non ifrs financial measure ebitda the company believes this non ifrs financial measure is key for both management and investors in evaluating performance at a consolidated level ebitda is commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt and as a valuation metric this measure does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs

for the year ended april 30 2019 except as described in note 3 3 adoption of new ifrs the company adopted ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 which replaces ias 17 leases for its annual period beginning may 1 2019 using the modified retrospective approach whereby no restatement of comparative periods is required under ias 17 leases of property plant and equipment were recognized as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying assets were transferred all other leases were classified as operating leases ifrs 16 requires lessees to recognize right of use assets representing its right to use the underlying asset and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make payments right of use assets are measured at cost comprised of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liabilities lease payments made on or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs they are subsequently depreciated on a straight line basis and reduced by impairment losses if any right of use assets may also be adjusted to reflect the re measurement of related lease liabilities lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with international financial reporting standards ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the useful lives of property plant and equipment for depreciation purposes property plant and equipment and inventory valuation determination of income and other taxes assumptions used in the compilation of share based payments fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment testing

the fed is in a catch 22 in the wake of recent stock market volatility and uncertainty surrounding the trade war and monetary policy concerns are only increasing there is growing consensus that the makings of a financial crisis of some sort is building and could drop sooner rather than later while there is speculation over whether it will be as big as the last one and whether it will come in waves or one main event the widespread belief is that something is wrong i sensed that from the federal reserve itself when i met with them earlier this year what i learned is that some of the biggest playmakers in finance don t want to disclose the true nature of their positions and money making schemes this confirmed my own experiences as a former investment banker the truth is that the leaders at the fed have a firmer understanding of what s really going on in the economy than they allude to publicly even though the fed has been able to avoid another financial crisis the last decade with quantitative easing qe policy or what i call dark money their toolkit might not render us safe enough going forward they need to grapple with this reality you see the fed manufacturers dark money that the markets have come to rely on through qe the central bank accumulated a balance sheet that hit a high of 4 5 trillion of assets at its peak by having purchased these assets with electronically created money the fed was able to keep rates at the middle and longer end of the yield curve low while they specifically set low rates for the short end of the yield curve too just to remind you the yield curve is the difference between short and long term interest rates long term rates are normally higher than short term rates when the two converge it often means markets are anticipating low growth ahead when the yield curve inverts when long term rates fall below short term rates it s almost always a sign of looming recession historically speaking parts of the yield curve have inverted within the past months which is a sign of trouble that doesn t mean you can expect an imminent recession the yield curve can sometimes stay inverted for up to two years before the economy suffers a recession of course it can also happen much sooner no one can really say when it will happen just that an inverted yield curve is a strong recession indicator and despite the fed s quantitative tightening qt that it ran until recently the fed s book of assets hasn t been reduced all that much to about 3 8 trillion which is still historically large qt was supposed to run through september but at its july meeting the fed announced it was ending immediately the problem is during the next recession or financial crisis the fed won t be able to dramatically expand its balance sheet like it did after 2008 before the crisis the balance sheet had about 800 billion in assets and again it exploded to about 4 5 trillion before qt brought it down to about 3 8 trillion today the fed would risk a serious loss of confidence in the dollar if it tried qe on a similar scale next time no one can say what the exact limit is but the fed doesn t want to find out the hard way so the fed is currently in a catch 22 u s gdp is still growing although the pace is slowing but it could all come unglued next year a previous article by economists nouriel roubini and brunello rosa lists ten reasons why 2020 could be the year of the next financial crisis they range from the economic to the geopolitical triggers the main four reasons are by 2020 a modest fiscal drag will pull growth from 3 to slightly below 2 trump s trade wars will almost certainly escalate leading to slower growth and higher inflation around the world growth outside of the u s will likely slow down especially if more countries retaliate against u s protectionism in addition china would have to slow its growth to reduce its level of excessive leverage in order to avoid a hard landing in the event of a correction the risk of illiquidity and fire sales undershooting will become more severe that could result in high frequency algorithmic trading that produces flash crashes which could hurt exchange traded and dedicated credit funds i would add corporate debt to the list u s nonfinancial corporate debt is now about 10 trillion or 48 of gdp that s in contrast to the 4 9 trillion in 2007 before the last financial crisis but total corporate debt is actually far higher than that when you add the debt of smaller firms and other businesses not listed on the stock exchanges you re looking at another 5 5 trillion or so when you add it all up that means total corporate debt is about 15 5 trillion or nearly 75 of gdp so the financial system is more highly levered today than it was prior to the last financial crisis in its 2019 financial stability report the fed stressed that the debt loads of businesses are historically high and fed governor lael brainard said the levels of corporate debt stand out even former fed chair janet yellen recognizes the growing problem of corporate debt two years ago she said that she didn t think there would be another financial crisis in her lifetime attributing this to banking reforms made since the 2008 financial crisis but last year she told the new york times that corporate indebtedness is now quite high and i think it s a danger that if there s something else that causes a downturn that high levels of corporate leverage could prolong the downturn and lead to lots of bankruptcies in the non financial corporate sector she noted that clos could be a real problem as i ve been warning for over a year clos or collateralized loan obligations are a wall street product stuffed with corporate loans if that sounds familiar to you there s a reason wall street is doing exactly what they did with mortgage loans before the 2008 financial crisis but with corporate ones just because she s no longer running the fed doesn t mean she has no contact with jerome powell who was her number two the people and connections within central banks and wall street are always in play if the corporate debt bomb detonates it could make 2008 look like child s play and the fed doesn t have nearly the amount of dry powder it had to fight the last crisis but if it keeps cutting rates and possibly returns to qe it risks eventually inflating the everything bubble to extreme levels which would lead to an even bigger collapse down the road truly the fed is in a catch 22 regards nomi prins for the daily reckoning

by vuyani ndaba johannesburg dec 5 reuters emerging market currency gains will probably be dominated by high yielding currencies rather than low risk bets next year as economic growth finally recovers in response to lower interest rates a reuters poll found on thursday three quarters of 40 strategists and analysts polled by reuters said next year would be dominated by high yielding emerging market currencies ing financial markets wrote that while it sees a modest slowdown in chinese growth it expects recoveries in the likes of brazil russia mexico india and several other asian countries meaning the growth outlook favours emerging versus developed market currencies the brazilian real brl is expected to be one of the notable gainers in emerging markets against the dollar firming to 3 97 brl poll in a difficult year so far for emerging market investors currency markets looked to safer bets in general shunning high risk reward pairs such as the south african rand against a very strong dollar the high yielding rand zar d3 might not even be part of that theme next year as official data this week confirmed the economy contracted 0 6 last quarter raising concerns that a recession is currently in play but the currency will likely remain fairly resilient in the face of many challenges slipping 3 to 15 per dollar in three months and then stay there after all some of these large emerging market monetary easing cycles and big currency declines should be providing some support the ing note added south africa s reserve bank is probably one of the few major emerging market central banks that unlike peers such as mexico and india has not taken part in easing rates this year low volatility citi analysts wrote that notwithstanding the central bank of turkey s cumulative easing of 1 000 basis points since july the lira has been holding up relatively well to be sure the strong current account adjustment underpinned by the unprecedented import compression and the fed s dovish pivot have played an important role in supporting the currency wrote analysts at citi however the reuters poll suggests the lira which was considered very cheap earlier this year will be tested next year to the tune of about 10 losses to 6 34 per dollar low volatility is expected to be part of next year s theme that supports carry trades as investors currently do not expect another reduction in u s rates until at least the middle of 2020 probably pushing out any possibility of hikes capable of sending markets into a frenzy carry trades comprise a strategy where investors benefit from holding a higher yielding currency borrowed in a lower yielding one in latin america an outburst of protests is adding pressure on the central banks of the region s two main economies brazil and mexico to keep easing in order to accelerate tepid growth and avoid an ugly social outcome as in chile ecuador and to a lesser degree colombia both currencies are entering the new year on the defensive on worries about the effectiveness of reforms and outstanding trade issues with the united states still mexico s peso fared better than other major latin american currencies this year helped by recent positive developments on the u s china issue local monetary policy should also be supportive of peso behaviour as the easing bias of banxico is likely to remain cautious with rate cuts of 25 basis points more likely than the 50bp cuts advocated by a minority of board members wrote citi additional reporting by gabriel burin in buenos aires polling by sujith pai and nagamani lingappa in bengaluru editing by jonathan cable and william maclean vuyani ndaba thomsonreuters com 27 11 775 3157 the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc

robust growth rate armenia is no exception to the global foreign direct investment trend investment flows are struggling to recover from the heights reached before the financial crisis a wait and see attitude prevails among investors who have reacted with caution to the recent political transition the united nations conference on trade and development s unctad recent investment policy review finds after a significant hike from 184 million us dollars in 2015 to 334 million us dollars in 2016 fdi in the country stood at 250 million usd in 2017 and grew by just 1 6 per cent last year for armenia attracting investment remains a key challenge the latest edition of the world bank s doing business report ranks armenia s economy 47th in its list of 190 economies down from its historic high of 41st place in 2018 while far from welcome the drop does not signify a change in attitude towards investors far from it the country is pushing to become an attractive market on the ease of the doing business score which assesses a country s absolute level of regulatory performance armenia s score went up from 73 2 in doing business 2019 to 74 5 in doing business 2020 says sylvie bossoutrot the world bank s country manager for armenia adding that the country is indeed continuing to narrow the gap with the global regulatory frontier which is a positive and promising development why armenia according to mrs bossoutrot the country has achieved substantive improvements in the business regulatory framework of four key areas over the past year construction quality control was strengthened by the government s imposing of stricter qualification requirements and the country strengthened the protection of minority investors by requiring independent reviews immediate public disclosures of transactions as well as by increasing shareholder rights and their role in major corporate decisions in addition armenia made the payment of taxes easier by extending refunds of vat to cases of capital investment while exporting was made faster by allowing the online submission of customs declarations aside from the overall world bank ranking armenia made it into the top 10 countries globally when it comes to starting a business it also ranks higher than any other country in the commonwealth of independent states a positive signal for those seeking access to former soviet republics if you ask me why you should invest in armenia my answer will be the following investing in a small country with a global network and skilled labour force is promising claims armenia s prime minister nikol pashinyan is this the case armenia s efficiency profile is characterised by a well educated workforce strong skills heritage and competitive salary levels unctad s investment policy review says while costs related to the workforce are affordable much attention should be paid to transportation costs georgia is the only transit route for armenian goods due to embargoes from azerbaijan and turkey the unctad report claims that several industries can aim for a billion us dollars in export sales in goods and services during the next 10 20 years hi tech data science deep technology tourism textiles and garments promoting investment amid a global slowdown less than a year after armenia s velvet revolution mr pashinyan in february announced an economic revolution which amongst much else was aimed at creating a better business environment fighting corruption and protecting the rule of law all three being crucial for those wishing to invest in the country we see a strong will to reform institutions fight against corruption bolster the rule of law and improve the quality of human capital says marina stefani the director of sovereigns at us based international ratings agency fitch ratings which in may affirmed its b rating for armenia earlier this year standard poor s also affirmed the armenian economy with a stable outlook while moody s changed the country s outlook from stable to positive dimitar bogov the regional lead economist of the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd who claims that the authorities moved towards greater transparency adds that a major tax reform programme was carried out which included cutting corporate taxes from 20 per cent to 18 per cent from next year the tax on dividends for non resident organisations will also halve to five per cent reforms need to be institutionalised in a way that does not negatively affect regular operations of the private sector the ebrd warns noting that strengthening the tax administration and further increasing the fairness and transparency of the tax framework would facilitate the private sector s ability to drive future growth if the latest projections of the international monetary fund imf prove correct armenia can be the growth champion of emerging europe in 2019 it expects the country s economy to grow by at least six per cent this year with the ebrd also projecting six per cent growth while the global economic slowdown which seems more inevitable and is likely to impact the whole of emerging europe will also impact armenia the country s growth rates will remain significant on the short term the imf has agreed to provide armenia with 248 2 million us dollars over the next three years within the framework of a precautionary stand by arrangement to support the government s efforts to strengthen armenia s economic fundamentals however as yulia ustyugova the imf s resident representative in armenia points out consumption led growth may not be entirely fortunate since it is investment that is the key building block for growth in the future so the challenge remains how to generate sustainable long term growth that is driven by investment and exports rather than consumption she concludes

driven by continued strength in our canadian banking wealth management and insurance businesses i m pleased with our results particularly given the challenging operating environment including low interest rates and continued trade tensions canadian banking recorded strong volume growth as we continued to leverage our scale to take an outsized share of industry volumes and generate strong operating leverage and earnings growth our wealth management businesses continued to expand our number one position in canada benefiting from constructive markets and strong net sales also driven by a growing advisor base and our leading asset management platform which continues to outperform the industry investor and treasury services had another challenging quarter impacted by secular industry trends and difficult market conditions and this quarter we took a number of steps to reposition the business which i will speak to shortly in capital markets solid fixed income results were offset by the impact of declining global fee pools on investment banking revenue stepping back and looking at 2019 overall our diversified business model and disciplined approach to cost and risk management enabled us to deliver record earnings of close to cad13 billion our leading roe of 16 8 allowed us to generate 60 basis points of capital this year ending 2019 with a strong cet1 ratio of just over 12 our profitability and balance sheet strength enabled us to keep investing in our leading franchises and navigate an uncertain macro environment while also returning over half of our 2019 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks let me now provide some highlights on our business segment performance canadian banking generated record earnings of over cad6 billion in 2019 nearly half of our total earnings we continued to leverage our scale and unique client value proposition to achieve strong client driven volumes we added approximately 300 000 net new canadian banking clients this year in addition to the thousand 300 000 acquired in 2018 with the momentum we are building we are on the way to meeting our client growth target of adding 2 5 million clients by 2023 set at our 2018 investor day we also delivered an all time low efficiency ratio of 41 8 while continuing to invest in our future reflecting cost discipline overall i m extremely pleased with the segment s continued momentum and the fact that we re earning market leading client loyalty scores this year we added an additional cad50 billion of volumes to our market leading franchises reaping the benefits of our significant multi year investments in both sales power and innovative digital capabilities we added over 200 investment advisors and mortgage specialists in canadian banking over the last year but our strategy is more than just adding capacity it s also about having the right talent and capabilities to deliver differentiated advice products and experiences across our channels backed by the number one brand in canada one example of this is myadvisor our digital platform for clients to activate their personalized financial plans which now has nearly 1 4 million clients online 14 of which are new to rbc our digital channel has now over 7 million active users and our mobile banking user base is up 16 year over year to nearly 4 5 million across all key product categories we continue to be a market leader with either a number one or number two market share in canada our credit card business saw growth across both spend and lend revenue streams with card balances and purchase volumes up 6 and 7 year over year respectively our relationship with petro canada continues to drive new clients to rbc while also delivering fuel savings for rbc card holders at any of petro canada s 1 500 retail locations nationwide with rbc ventures we continue to move beyond banking with a focus on engaging clients in new and innovative ways to date we have accumulated 3 2 million connections with canadians across our portfolio of ventures including those we ve both built and acquired we now have 17 ventures in market and another 14 under development one of these is movesnap a digital concierge to help clients move from home to home providing home buyers with compelling insights and support as they make the significant investment in their future client feedback has been very positive and our mortgage specialists saw this as an important addition to rbc s existing competitive advantage we plan to scale this venture nationally in 2020 ampli our new loyalty program which launched in july of this year already has active participation from over 40 leading brands and we are seeing good early signs of client engagement we re excited about the possibilities and we will be scaling up this venture as well in 2020 in business banking our strong results are driven by a focus on high return sectors that align with our risk framework they also reflect the benefit of multi year investments we ve made in talent and cash management solutions and increasingly in unique digital capabilities for example with the launch of rbc insight edge an industry first our canadian business clients can now leverage aggregated data gain relevant insights into their industry customers and markets to enable them to make more informed business decisions turning to wealth management where we also reported record earnings this year even after adjusting for a gain in this quarter with over 80 of our assets under management outperforming the benchmark on a three year basis rbc gam continued to build on its leading market share in canada adding cad8 billion of retail net sales this year alone in these uncertain times our clients are trusting us with more of their business following our advice service and capabilities illustrating this rbc gam was recognized for investment excellence in the 2019 canada lipper fund awards winning seven individual fund awards with ph n winning two group awards our canadian wealth management business remains an industry leader in both revenue and fee based assets per advisor the clients continue to benefit from the insights distribution and digital capabilities we offer through our team of nearly 1 900 advisors in canada our us wealth management business generated pre tax earnings of cad1 billion this year our us private client group is the sixth largest in the us by aua and had a record year for advisor recruitment attracting a number of experienced advisors from large wirehouses across the industry our momentum also continued at city national with double digit growth in both commercial lending and jumbo mortgages offsetting some of the industrywide margin pressure this year city national expanded further into our core markets of los angeles new york san francisco and washington dc we are upgrading our treasury management systems and technology to streamline the onboarding of new clients this along with our recent acquisitions of exactuals and filmtrack are important steps in continuing to grow our us deposit base our insurance business had a strong year with earnings of over cad800 million our second highest year on record we continue to develop innovative solutions to serve our 5 million insurance clients including a digital tool to simplify the application process for our term life insurance offering this segment continues to generate a high roe while serving a diverse client base including being a market leader in individual disability insurance moving to investor and treasury services as we ve highlighted in our prior quarters it s been a challenging environment and this quarter we took steps to reposition the business this journey is not easy as part of this process this quarter we made the difficult decision to reduce roles in europe and reduce our footprint in australia looking ahead we remain focused on key markets where we can provide the most value to our clients or returns are most attractive this includes canada which continues to provide a diversified source of deposits turning to capital markets against the challenging market backdrop we generated over cad2 6 billion of earnings this year corporate investment banking was impacted by an industrywide decline in fee pools as some client stayed on the sidelines given ongoing economic uncertainty our results were further impacted by delays in the completion of deals in our pipeline within this context i m proud of our team s continued continue to be awarded some significant mandates including as lead financial advisor to blackstone on its recently announced cad6 billion cross border acquisition of dream global this and other recently announced deals highlight the strength of our franchise and add to our healthy pipeline heading into 2020 in global markets our client centric model drove robust results and our fixed income business performed well despite an unfavorable market environment before moving to the outlook i want to touch on the macro environment in north america our core markets continue to be supported by healthy us consumer and their spending and a resilient canadian household sector both backed by strong labor markets and low interest rates the canadian housing market has also stabilized in business investment intentions remain healthy in canada including spending to expand the workforce and update technology to support higher demand as we look out to 2020 while we still see strength in our core markets there is no question it s expected to be a challenging macro environment uncertainty is weighing on both global growth and trade and was a key factor in the recent fed rate cuts bank of canada is balancing solid economic growth against elevated external risks leaving the door open for an interest rate cut in 2020 and based on what we re seeing today the next couple of years are likely to be challenging given interest rate trends uncertainty around global growth trade tensions and normalized credit conditions among other factors with this backdrop we are maintaining our medium term objectives recognizing that our performance relative to these objectives will be largely dependent on the macro environment we believe we are well positioned to meet our medium term objectives around roe capital strength and dividend payouts while meeting our 7 plus diluted eps growth objective may be challenging in the near term we are focused on meeting this target in the medium term as we ve done in recent years within this context we remain well positioned to continue driving strong market share gains in our leading client franchises and the power of our leading scale balance sheet strength and diverse revenue streams will allow us to continue investing in technology and sales capacity in this period of secular change we will maintain a disciplined approach to balancing near term operating leverage while creating long term sustainable value for our clients and shareholders we also maintain a consistent and prudent approach to risk management through the cycle so to sum up we enter 2020 with strong momentum in all our canadian retail franchises driven by multi year investments in our people products and technology we believe our focused growth strategy positions us well to continue to deliver an exceptional client experience gain market share and return capital to our shareholders to close i m proud of what we ve achieved this year and i want to take this opportunity to thank all 85 000 colleagues across the bank it s our talented and engaged employees who give back to communities and deliver leading advice and service to our clients and with that i ll turn the call over to rod rod bolger chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone starting on slide 7 against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop we delivered solid fourth quarter earnings of cad3 2 billion down 1 year over year diluted eps of cad2 18 was down 1 as well for the last two quarters i ve given an update on our cost management progress and i ll do so again this quarter we are focused on driving efficiencies so that we can continue to invest in future growth during this prolonged low interest rate environment this quarter expense growth was 7 4 year over year or 4 4 on an adjusted basis over 40 of the increase was in client facing roles as well as technology and digital initiatives as we invested in serving clients and continued business growth indicative of our expense discipline expense growth in the second half of 2019 slowed to 3 4 on an adjusted basis as compared to 6 6 in the first half of the year in other words the growth rate was cut nearly in half looking forward to 2020 we expect to continue to slow expense growth by leveraging our scale while continuing to strategically grow our client base and deepen client relationships turning to slide 8 our cet1 ratio of 12 1 was up 20 basis points quarter over quarter strong internal capital generation was partly offset by organic rwa growth and share buybacks this quarter we bought back 4 5 million shares for a total of cad474 million that puts us at 10 3 million shares repurchased for the year for cad1 billion moving to our business segments on slide 9 personal and commercial banking reported earnings of cad1 6 billion this quarter up 5 year over year canadian banking net income of cad1 6 billion was up 6 year over year we continued to see strong volume growth of 8 year over year across our core products this quarter residential mortgages grew at more than 7 year over year driven by strong double digit mortgage origination volume growth and strong retention results business loan growth was up nearly 10 year over year slightly lower than the growth achieved over the last nine quarters deposit growth was strong across both personal and business deposits in particular we continued to see strong growth of 14 in personal gics as clients continue to shift toward deposits in response to macroeconomic uncertainty our net interest margin of 2 76 was down 4 basis points from last quarter due to the impact of competitive pricing pressures looking forward to 2020 we expect nim to drop approximately 4 to 6 basis points for the year given current competitive mortgage pricing expense growth was nominal for the quarter due to strong cost management and our ability to leverage scale as a driver of efficiency operating leverage in canadian banking was 4 3 for the quarter and 2 for the year within our previous guidance of 2 to 3 range for the year looking forward to 2020 we expect operating leverage to be 1 to 2 given the impact of interchange and expectations for sustained low interest rate environment our historical operating leverage trends can be seen on slide 22 turning to slide 10 wealth management reported earnings of cad729 million which were up 32 year over year adjusting for the gain on sale of bluebay s private debt business earnings were up 8 year over year global asset management revenues were up 39 year over year and excluding the gain revenues were up 10 this was largely due to higher fee based revenue and higher aum driven by market appreciation and net sales in canada global asset management increased its retail mutual fund industry market share by 70 basis points year over year to 15 8 as of september canadian wealth management revenues were up 3 year over year driven by higher fee based assets market appreciation and net sales over the course of the year including in q4 we continued to add investment advisors to deliver more advice and insights to our clients our non us wealth management s efficiency ratio was 60 8 adjusting for the gain our efficiency ratio was 66 5 which improved 220 basis points year over year in us wealth management revenues were up 14 year over year in us dollars driven by 19 loan growth at city national and record fee based asset growth at our us private client group despite the declining interest rate environment in the us in the latter part of 2019 city national continued to generate solid growth in net interest income up 8 year over year deposit growth in q4 was up 14 year over year reflecting funding benefits from higher sweep deposits as well as accelerating growth in business deposits this quarter we saw net interest margin decline 29 basis points quarter over quarter to 3 14 excluding the 8 basis point gain on recoveries from legacy loans last quarter nim was down 21 basis points looking forward to 2020 we expect nim to decline in the first quarter albeit at a slower rate reflecting the full quarter impact of the september and october us rate cuts as well as the impact from the implementation of ifrs 16 absent any further us rate cuts in 2020 and increasing competitive pressure on deposit pricing we expect margins to tick lower before stabilizing in the latter half of 2020 moving to insurance on slide 11 net income of cad282 million was down 11 from last year primarily due to lower favorable reinsurance contract renegotiations and less favorable annual actuarial assumption updates higher claims costs and lower favorable investment related expense also contributed to the decrease these factors were partially offset by the impact of new longevity reinsurance contracts from 2016 to 2018 approximately 60 of insurance earnings were recorded in the second half of the year in 2019 the percentage earned in the second half of the year was also 60 but with a higher proportion earned in q3 moving to investor and treasury services on slide 12 net income was cad45 million as dave mentioned earlier we are committed to improving the profitability of i ts and as such recognized cad83 million after tax in repositioning costs in q4 associated with repositioning this business excluding this charge net income was cad128 million down 17 year over year i ts was impacted by lower funding and liquidity revenue primarily driven by the short term interest rate environment and lower gains from the disposition of certain securities we also saw a lower asset services revenue due to reduced client activity and lower client deposit revenue largely driven by margin compression on slide 13 capital markets earnings of cad584 million were down 12 year over year corporate and investment banking revenues were down 14 primarily due to lower m a activity across all regions this quarter saw investment banking fee pools decrease 13 year over year across most products with m a down 21 year over year despite a challenging quarter across the industry we rose to 10th in the global league table for fiscal 2019 up from 11th in the prior year global markets revenues were up 6 despite the challenging market environment we saw solid fixed income trading which was partially offset by lower equity trading revenues overall our trading businesses performed well against our peers on a year to date basis given our diversified geographic and product mix looking ahead to 2020 our investment banking pipeline remains strong with the timing of several large deals expected to close in the first quarter 2020 in conclusion we are pleased with the resiliency of our franchise to manage through the challenging environment our core retail franchises continued to grow in q4 offsetting market and wholesale industry challenges and macroeconomic headwinds our results reflect the strength of our diversified business model and commitment to long term value creation for our stakeholders and with that i ll turn it over to graeme graeme hepworth chief risk officer thank you rod and good morning everyone starting on slide 16 this quarter we had provisions on impaired loans of cad434 million which equated to 27 basis points additionally we established provisions on performing loans of cad71 million or 5 basis points for a total of cad505 million or 32 basis points provisions on performing loans increased by cad41 million or 3 basis points from last quarter unfavorable changes in our overall portfolio mix including seasonal factors related to our cards portfolio and credit migrations contributed to the quarter over quarter increase these factors were partially offset by a more favorable macroeconomic forecast in areas such as canadian housing and the impact of model changes for a few of our retail portfolios provisions on impaired loans increased by cad35 million or 2 basis points from last quarter mainly due to higher provisions in canadian banking and city national which were partly offset by lower provisions in caribbean banking for fiscal year 2019 pcl on loans totaled 31 basis points up 8 basis points from last year provisions on impaired loans totaled 27 basis points up 7 basis points from last year which represented a shift from the cyclical lows of 2017 and 2018 to more normalized levels this year let me now provide some additional detail on three of our businesses in canadian banking pcl on loans of cad400 million increased by 5 basis points from last quarter about half of the increase was due to provisions on performing loans related to the factors already noted the remaining increase is a result of higher provisions on impaired loans primarily attributable to our cards and personal lending portfolios in wealth management pcl on loans of cad34 million increased by cad7 million from last quarter mainly due to a new impaired loan in the consumer discretionary sector in the us this sector has been the largest source of loan losses for city national bank in 2019 largely in relation to the quick serve restaurant industry where clients are being impacted by rising labor and capital costs notwithstanding higher provisions at our city national portfolio in fiscal 2019 it continues to perform ahead of our expectations in capital markets pcl on loans of cad78 million increased by cad22 million from last quarter mostly due to higher provisions on performing loans reflecting downgrades in our oil and gas portfolio provisions on impaired loans were up cad7 million from last quarter this reflects ongoing weakness in the oil and gas sector as well as provisions in a few other sectors turning to slide 17 gross impaired loans of cad3 billion were relatively stable from last quarter as higher new impairments in canadian banking were mainly offset by higher repayments in caribbean banking as well as repayments and loan sales in capital markets overall we saw a decrease in new formations in our capital markets portfolios even though we continued to see heightened levels of formations in the oil and gas sector this quarter we remain comfortable with our exposure to the oil and gas sector which represents about 1 of our total loans this portfolio is governed by borrowing bases and size of the proven reserves of the borrowers which provide good protection against credit losses looking at our retail portfolio on slide 19 we saw an increase in insolvencies primarily in the form of consumer proposals in our personal lending and cards portfolios prior year s interest rate increases have impacted some of our clients by raising debt servicing costs notwithstanding the overall strong labor markets and income growth this past year we also saw an increase in delinquencies and insolvencies in our cards portfolio in quebec this increase follows the implementation of a new rule on minimum credit card payments which took effect in the province last august while these factors contributed to a moderate increase in pcl this quarter in our unsecured retail portfolios the overall credit profile of our retail clients remain strong with stable levels of delinquencies high fico scores and low ltvs looking at fiscal 2020 we would expect provisions on impaired loans to be in the range of 25 to 30 basis points and provisions on performing loans to be in the range of 3 to 5 basis points should credit conditions continue to normalize as we ve cautioned in past years there will be inherent volatility from one quarter to the next particularly for our wholesale portfolios where provisions tend to be more concentrated we also expect some degree of volatility in our provisions on performing loans based on volume growth changes in macroeconomic variables and portfolio mix to conclude we maintain our prudent risk management approach and are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment we are confident that our credit performance will remain resilient throughout the credit cycle given the strength of our underwriting standards the diversification of our portfolio and the quality of our client base with that operator let s open the lines for q a questions and answers operator thank you the first question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i had just a two part question on expenses i guess rod you mentioned expenses should taper a little relative to the 3 5 growth we saw in the back half of 19 i guess does that imply something like a 2 to 3 expense growth expectation for 2020 all else equal and just taking a step back and just listening to dave in terms of his cautious outlook on the revenue environment is there anything bigger that the bank needs to do in terms of flexing the expense lever more as we think about 2020 and beyond rod bolger chief financial officer thanks ebrahim yeah on the expenses recall that we have a large wealth management business and capital markets business so as revenue ramps up or down we have a natural hedge on expenses so if the first quarter ends up being strong for capital markets and or wealth management you might see expense growth tick up a little bit or if it s weaker as it did in the second half of the year as it came down a little bit versus the growth in the first half of the year expenses will be a little bit lower so it does moderate we re taking the core rate of expenses down in terms of the growth rate and you ll see that in a number of the line items if you look in our supplement our marketing costs and travel costs things like that we have taken the rate of growth of that down and our technology investment we have been growing that over the last five years significantly and over the last year or so and we expect to continue to take that rate of growth down and so given the macroeconomic environment largely the interest rate environment now which had been providing us tailwinds for two plus years enabling us to invest in future growth invest in continued market share now we have a lot of the pieces in place both from a technology standpoint and a talent standpoint and distribution standpoint to continue to grow revenue despite those macroeconomic uncertainties and expenses toggle down a little bit with it so the guidance that i gave that we expect to continue to see it to moderate would hold and we d expect to see low single digits ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst and we shouldn t be expecting any bigger actions on expenses like the restructuring you did i know it was specific to the investor and treasury business but anything much larger or something that should investors anticipate something like that over the course of the next year or so david mckay president chief executive officer ebrahim it s dave and what i d like to reinforce is we continue to look at our cost structure and we re managing it the same way across the organization we have over the last five or six years which is trying to get ahead of our cost structure invest in technology manage through various levers over time and bring our base down so we don t forecast i mean it take an aggressive short term repositioning because we are trying to get ahead of things we have a number of programs across the organizations we saw this coming so i think you can expect from us generally a continued management of costs programmatically across the organization so that s how we see the world right now having said that we did take a short term repositioning of investor services because we had to make a quick pivot a quick pivot from europe into asia in a number of roles in there and adjust our cost base more quickly given the things that we re trying to do in the business so that came at us quite quickly and i d say that was more out of the ordinary for how we manage our cost structure than typical of what you ve seen us do in the past so the core message is continue to expect us to manage our base down programmatically across the organization the way we ve done in the past ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s very helpful thank you both operator thank you and the next question is from gabriel dechaine with national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial inc analyst good morning i want to ask graeme about your outlook for 2020 on the pcl loss range i don t i didn t come across that in your materials but you were a smidge above your target range for this year i know there were some idiosyncratic losses early in the year but on the other hand maybe some seasoning effect in the cards portfolio capital markets seems to be in an upswing there for pcls balance the factors where do you see the ratio lining up in 2020 graeme hepworth chief risk officer yeah i think as i made in my comments we re forecasting the ratio in that stage three to be 25 to 30 basis points into the stage three side of it and an additional 3 to 5 basis points in stage one and two i think some of your observations and the comments i made all factor into that as you referenced certainly in the first half of the year we saw some very idiosyncratic events in our wholesale portfolios particularly in both capital markets and in commercial and canadian banking i mean the latter half of the year i would say it s been a bit it s been a bit more broad based but a bit more what we would view as more normal and so when you look at longer term trends in retail at around 34 basis points and in wholesale around 31 basis points we still feel we re certainly coming off two very strong years from a pcl perspective in 2017 and 18 where looking at the wholesale things i would say they were abnormally low but we re still i would say below long term averages but acceptable levels and levels that don t concern us gabriel dechaine national bank financial inc analyst you also mentioned in the cards and personal loans as drivers the seasonality and i always thought of that as more of a q4 thing and on the quebec regulatory change there for making minimum payments and that s like a five year phase in so i m a bit surprised to hear that s already having an impact we are seeing insolvency data moving higher across canada and just wondering is that where you see the most pressure coming in next year in terms of normalization or seasoning in that portfolio graeme hepworth chief risk officer well i d say normalization is not specific to retail again as i highlighted in wholesale 2017 and 18 were quite exceptional years they would be more abnormal than what 2019 was so on wholesale again i think we can you can expect to see a continuation of what we saw in the latter half of 19 retail has continued at very low levels we expect to see that tick up moderately but overall there ll be some puts and takes there that give us comfort to that overall 25 to 30 basis point range retail more specifically yes we ve seen some factors i don t want to overstate the factors we ve seen in card i was just trying to highlight what we are seeing there cards overall this year was up 12 year on year about half of that is related to growth a portion of that i would attribute to weakness in alberta and then the insolvency factor that i highlighted but overall in retail outside those factors we continue to see very stable delinquency profiles our origination quality continues to be very strong so again we feel quite comfortable with the profile there but do reflect the fact that we re probably coming off some very strong years and we ll see it normalize to some degree gabriel dechaine national bank financial inc analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from john aiken with barclays please go ahead john aiken barclays bank plc analyst good morning taking a look at your objective for us wealth management given the challenging year that we ve had as well as the margin compression that we ve seen in those operations what s the level of confidence in achieving the stated objective for 2020 as we sit here today david mckay president chief executive officer i think if you look at the progress we ve made in city national the real strength is we ve doubled the size of the core franchise over the past four or five years from a balance sheet perspective and continue to maintain double digit lending growth numbers throughout the cycle we dipped a bit on deposits but you ll see our deposit strength came back nicely in q4 to i think roughly 14 so our primary focus is to continue to invest in that core franchise expand geographically grow our mortgage and our commercial business and continue to expand our private banking business so from that perspective from a balance sheet growth perspective a client growth perspective we re at or a little bit ahead of our overall targets what we can t control in our forecast that we gave you when we did the presentation in 2016 was the level of interest rates so we made that forecast of where earnings where we had rates coming back and holding a bit longer than they ve held and we didn t forecast the quick reduction in rates in fed rate cuts that you ve seen over the past year so if rates continue to hold where they are and go lower it s going to be tough for us to generate enough margin off balance sheet growth which has exceeded our expectations to meet those targets so we are looking at slowing cost growth we re looking as i ve talked about in our recent investor conference we ve significantly ramped up our cost structure beyond where we thought we d be to try to meet the growth opportunities we saw in the marketplace if the us economy doesn t perform where it has potential you could see us pull back on some of that cost structure and deliver some earnings there so we ve got a number of levers but i think you should focus on the core franchise customer balance sheet growth has been significant it s double it s ahead of where we thought it was the margins are a bit off and we can t control that but the core franchise has performed exceptionally well john aiken barclays bank plc analyst thanks dave and as a bit of a follow on given what we re seeing on margins now i understand the overall profitability of the platform remains quite strong but as margins are under compression is there any discussion about slowing the growth that we ve seen over the past year david mckay president chief executive officer yeah i just referenced that as we ve talked about i m heading out to la tomorrow absolutely we ve accelerated our growth we ve opened in hudson yards we are opening other stores in new york we re opening in washington we can t slow some of the staffing of those stores but we can certainly slow our back office growth which ramped up for a significant growth and if the growth doesn t materialize but even having said that i think we ve kind of run up our back office growth quite aggressively and there is an opportunity to reduce it through technology investment but also just through kind of managing that cost structure down in a slower growth environment so we do foresee the ability to grow our earnings by managing our cost structure as another lever that we haven t pulled to date we ve allowed that cost structure to move ahead to grow because we have not made an acquisition and therefore we ve invested in organic growth where we get the highest returns so i think the answer is absolutely that s something that i m focused on and kelly coffey our ceo of city national is focused on so thanks for your question i think we ll take the next question operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman with cormark securities please go ahead meny grauman cormark securities inc analyst hi good morning rod in your commentary kind of you talked about i think it was 4 to 6 basis points of additional margin pressure given competitive dynamics just a clarification i assume that doesn t include any bank of canada rate cuts but i just wanted to see how that would change your outlook rod bolger chief financial officer yeah thanks meny that s correct i mean the market is not forecasting with high likelihood of a rate cut until potentially the end of next year so it wouldn t really have an impact certainly in the first three quarters and maybe marginally on the fourth quarter if it happens so a lot of that is really the stock and flow of the growth in the book and so i think it s important to step back and look at the strong volume growth 8 in q4 the strong net interest income growth which was 5 6 in q4 and over 7 for the year and so part of this is mix and the mortgage market has come back and there is continued reports on that we continue to grow share in that space those products tend to have a lower spread than other unsecured products and so as we grow that book as the market grows at higher level you re going to just see some mix issues cause that nim to come down and overall with good volumes it s still a positive and it s still a positive revenue story so part of this is a little bit of math when you look at the underlying rates versus five years ago so a lot of our deposits the tractoring and the internal transfer pricing on that it is positive interest rates the five year rate actually despite the low rate environment today is still higher than it was five years ago so structurally in the deposit side we re ok the mortgages is a competitive pricing element so there is nothing that is actually ominous in this outlook it s just a factor of what s the market is bringing us and our continued market share growth so i wouldn t look at that as a negative per se i think the business is quite strong meny grauman cormark securities inc analyst just as a follow up on that you highlight improved mortgage growth and i m just wondering your perspective on what s driving that and is there an element there that is concerning in terms of that reacceleration neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking it s neil i ll handle that one no definitely nothing concerning we would look at the strong mortgage performance in 2019 directly as a result of a review we did around some internal processes and just making sure that we were following up on better lead management following up on leads more quickly getting back to customers more quickly as well as some changes in our adjudication process that made sure that once we had a transaction in front of us we didn t lose that customers so graeme spoke to the underwriting which continues to be very strong and we would look at both house prices and home sales across the country being quite balanced and starting to stabilize after b 20 we have seen the fall have more activity and sort of the buying season a little bit elongated but as we look at it all around we would feel very comfortable with the performance of the mortgage business meny grauman cormark securities inc analyst thank you doug guzman group head rbc wealth management rbc insurance and rbc investor treasury services thank you well let s move on to the next question operator thank you and the next question is from steve theriault with eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much if i could just start with a quick follow up rod last quarter you talked about 40 basis points of nim or thereabouts over five quarters given rate cut expectations maybe does that still hold and if so should we be thinking of the q4 impact of 29 basis points or the 21 basis points you mentioned on a more adjusted basis rod bolger chief financial officer thank you steve i assume you re talking about city national steve theriault eight capital analyst yes sorry city national yeah rod bolger chief financial officer yeah so i would think of in terms of 21 basis points that 8 basis points was a one time gain and we tried to call that out last quarter as well as this quarter not to build that in yes so we ended at kind of 3 14 i spoke to last quarter that if the fed was cutting which the fed ended up doing both in september and october that basically the fed funds rate was going to be back to levels that you had seen in 2017 ish which is when city national had spreads in the high 2s the 2 85 to 2 9 range and absent a big tick up in the five year rate which would help with some of the asset pricing and the tractors on the deposits you d expect the margins come into similar levels as what it was so on adjusted basis you are at 3 35 in q3 40 basis points would take you down to the 2 95 range i think you re within that range as i mentioned i think my message is we expect to continue downturn in q1 given the two fed cuts but then we see it leveling off and we see modest spread compression from there and that s what the markets are saying right now based on their expectations for fed activity but we ll see what happens with the trade discussions and tariffs and future fed activity one way or the other that would change the outlook for us steve theriault eight capital analyst okay that s helpful and then just lastly a question on investor and treasury services post the restructuring and repositioning can you talk about what can you offer up in terms of the earnings power going forward what type of bottom line benefit we ll see from that cad83 million of restructuring this quarter doug guzman group head rbc wealth management rbc insurance and rbc investor treasury services yeah it s doug couple of things one is the charge that we just took that is point to the effect of that as rod said in his statements is really going to be seen kind of leaking into the p l in terms of reduced expenses over the course of the year so as you get toward the back end of the year you ll see i think more improvement on the expense side in terms of the revenue side we have been struggling with a flattening yield curve with a short end and some margin compression we ve changed how the trading reports we ve put on some more term and the accrual book is producing more regularly right now and so we re just going to try to manage that and so on the revenue side we ll see what the market will give us on the investor services side we re just working away in terms of trying to do more business with customers and we ll see how it plays out david mckay president chief executive officer thanks steve we will move on to next question steve theriault eight capital analyst sure operator thank you the next question is from robert sedran with cibc capital markets please go ahead robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst hello good morning just want to follow up with neil on the mortgage question everything we hear is that mortgage spreads are at historic lows but when the market leader is growing at market leading rates it would suggest that this is something you re doing rather than something that is happening to you in terms of the competitive pressure so i understand all the process issues you talked about but i presume you re also not shying away from the price competition as well so is this just part of a client acquisition strategy or are you comfortable with the mortgage as a stand alone strategy that you can continue to grow at these rates as profitably as you d like to neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah thanks for the question i mean our strategy is not obviously to lead the market down in terms of price i think we re leading with advice and we re leading with distribution so dave mentioned in his commentary we added mortgage specialists and my comments were more about the productivity of those mortgage specialists in terms of making sure they got back to customers more quickly making sure they got better leads and they can access those leads so reality is we do participate in the market we don t have as much influence as i think some feel in terms of setting the price that said we are not going to have other customers come in and put a mortgage into our customers hands when we feel it should be with us so we re going to remain competitive on price absolutely agree with your comments in terms of the level competitiveness and spreads and i think there s just a lot of competition out there and especially in the last half of this year robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst so given all that above average market growth is still what you d expect graeme hepworth chief risk officer we re maintaining kind of that we re mid single digits and that s still really our target range robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from sumit malhotra with scotia capital please go ahead sumit malhotra scotiabank global banking analyst thanks good morning for dave we ve spoken many times about how the stars really aligned for the bank and the timing of the purchase of city national a lot of questions on this call about the interest rate environment and the growth of that business if it s affecting your franchise it s obviously affecting your competitors as well especially with your capital ratio one of the stronger aspects of the quarter sitting something like 11 8 11 9 on a pro forma basis does the acquisition or external capital deployment supplementing that business become more attractive given what s happening to some of your competitors in this rate backdrop than it has been in the last few years or you content to hold capital and continue to buy back a larger amount of stock david mckay president chief executive officer it s a great question i would say certainly leaning toward the latter than the former and that s we re going to continue to grow organically you ve seen the double digit mid 14 15 16 loan growth 14 deposit growth we re investing in new branches investing in expanded sales force capability launching new products building our brand in the us so the organic build we ve invested heavily with and we continue to focus on that because that drives the highest roes for our shareholders now being patient and waiting has paid off already and i think it s going to pay off even more to continue to be patient and watch the us marketplace as we watch the economy and we watch valuation of banks and we re being very careful we would only look at something that grow a strong shareholder return grow our franchise geographically or grow our product capability and enhance the existing strong growth rate that we have right now and doesn t overly distract management with something that s too small so i think those are the same parameters we ve talked about organic growth first and with our strong cet1 ratios it gives us an opportunity to return capital to shareholders while meeting all our organic growth objectives across all our businesses so we sit in a very strong position to continue to create relative total shareholder return for our investors sumit malhotra scotiabank global banking analyst that s very clear thanks for that and then lastly for rod bolger we ve talked a lot this year on these calls about the declining trend in the tax rate in the capital markets segment and it took another significant step down this quarter is there anything i know there is some competitive factors at play here rod so i d appreciate any insight you could give us as to what exactly has driven the tax rate down to something like 3 this quarter and are there any risk to the bank in terms of an impact on revenue or normalization in this line in 2020 for how we think about earnings for that unit rod bolger chief financial officer yeah thanks for that sumit i wouldn t call it a risk to the bank i would expect it to normalize a bit and be back into double digits in 2020 you saw some updated guidance out of the us even this week on the beat tax for example and i think they re coming out with more guidance so there is a natural upward bias on the tax rate i think globally as countries try to capture more of a tax base especially and banks fall into that even when they re going after technology companies but also there is an ebb and flow to this as the earnings were a bit off in q4 in capital markets the geographic mix ends up being favorable oftentimes from a tax perspective and so as earnings normalize going forward and increase as we highlighted with the strong backlog and strong pipeline i would expect that the geographic mix would be less favorable from a tax perspective than it was this quarter so as a result all indications are that we would be back toward a more normalized double digit tax rate in this business in 2020 sumit malhotra scotiabank global banking analyst thanks for your time and doug mcgregor i think this is your final call thanks for your help over the years doug mcgregor group head investor treasury services thank you thanks for that comment next question operator thank you the next question is from doug young with desjardins capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins securities inc analyst hi good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered but one i wanted to go back to because i think you addressed the adding 2 5 million new clients by fiscal 23 for canadian banking but i think at the investor day you also threw out a target for rbc ventures of adding 5 million active users and converting 10 to royal bank clients i m hoping just to get a bit of color on how that transition is going because i think you added i think you mentioned 3 2 million connections but looking at that conversion to canadian bank clients just wanted some color on that thank you david mckay president chief executive officer thanks doug for your question i ll start with the overall ventures targets and neil will talk about the bigger impact of 2 5 million net new clients of which we said 500 000 conversions would come from ventures now we re a couple of years into this now and we ve really focused on building those 5 million new connections that you would have had to buy in a social media or digital channel but for now we have a connection to a new canadian potential client that we never had before and they ve come through those 17 ventures so we ve really made that the primary focus and we actually haven t tried to convert them to rbc product holders as yet we re trying to build deeper relationships trying to get to know them and that s going to pay off over the long term having said that 2020 is a big scaling year where we are going to start the conversion process through a number of these ventures i gave the example of movesnap which we embedded into our overall mortgage process our mortgage sales force of over 600 specialists said it was one of the biggest tools they had to help close mortgages in a price competitive marketplace as you referenced i would say though that rbc did try we did increase our mortgage rates over the past year given the volatility i think twice right neil and you can comment on that further but having said that we re competing primarily on creating value for our customers and movesnap came into that fray we have another five or six ventures in the mortgage space that s creating value that we re ready to scale nationally so i think we ve focused on 3 2 million we re already 65 toward our 5 million target after a year and a half to two years so we feel that we ll likely exceed the 5 million but the conversion proof is going to come over the coming quarters and we re very much focused on scaling ampli i think when you can add 40 retailers over a two year period and if you look at what it took air miles add retailers over a decade the fact that we have a team now of high profile brands creating value for canadians you re going to see us scale that aggressively in 2020 and convert off of that so i think we re really positioned well to start to show you some numbers on the bank conversion side which is still not insignificant i think we ve done over 50 000 conversions just in pilot phase without any real marketing spend behind it we ve already factored marketing budgets in to scale this internationally so i think that is kind of a little more color on ventures i ll turn it to neil to talk about the overall client acquisition and how we re building on the 300 000 over the past each year over the past two years neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah so thanks for the question i think the ventures we d say is where we is on plan it s where we wanted it to be dave talked about the first fly we needed to make is they actually get the client engagement and so that s the first sort of the first milestone is to engage customers that we didn t have a relationship before have them coming back to these digital experiences and we ve also been very cautious about managing what is referred to as kind of the load factor how many times we want to put the rbc brand or an rbc value proposition in front of them is something we re really testing we don t want to limit that engagement we re having and you ve seen that s another digital business model i think in terms of we have seen some of the ventures for example owner which is focused at the venture focused at new small business originations we re seeing a very good conversion rate there small business owners can go into the app they can register the small business they re immediately offered a small business banking package and we re seeing upwards of 40 conversion rate on that venture things like the drive venture we ve actually integrated that into our mobile app they ve talked about the number of customers we have logging into the mobile app multiple times a month so we re able to give exposure to the value proposition there movesnap was one of the offers we put out to our customers this summer it proved to be actually as or more valuable than some of the more traditional offers like for example just the cash incentive so we re feeling that three good examples already providing value in terms of ampli dave mentioned the relationship with the merchants we really look at this as key part of it to have the quality of the merchants so right now in the ampli app we have merchants like home depot and rexall westjet the keg indigo and so the key there is that we ve got these relationships with merchants they re willing to put value on the table for our clients and again it s that virtuous circle of providing getting the engagement providing the value and then us testing into how we drive the conversion so that s really how we re thinking about it david mckay president chief executive officer okay and we should move on to the next question thanks we have i know we re almost at time but we ll try to get a couple more in operator thank you the next question is from sohrab movahedi with bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst i just wanted to kind of go back to that new client stuff neil 300 000 you say i think you ve added this year 300 000 and last year the 2 5 million target can you just i know we re short on time but can you give us a sense of how that is translating into your segment s results and whether or not you are actually having to still provide incentives whether it s ipads or cash to pick up some of these customers neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah so thanks for the question so the new client acquisition those are both step ups from where we d be running with net new client acquisition in the previous three years so we re feeling that we re on the trajectory we set out to your point incentives still are part of the strategy we were out again with the ipad campaign as we do the analytics those are well performing solid returning investments you will see us on a go forward basis there will be a mix there ll be some new value propositions that we feel can really start to drive an increase in the trajectory and we ll look for that in the back half of the year but right now we re pleased with our new client results and we re also seeing in terms of just the core checking account service fees we were actually one of the drivers of other income so we are seeing it pull through on that line sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst i appreciate that thank you doug guzman group head rbc wealth management rbc insurance and rbc investor treasury services thanks sohrab we ll take one more operator thank you and the last question will be from scott chan with canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity corp analyst good morning just quickly on the oil and gas portfolio maybe just a two part question just on the credit you cited was that us or canada and the second part just in terms of the strong growth i know it s a modest part of your portfolio but i think it was up 30 year over year is that kind of like a comfortable growth trajectory with that book going forward thank you graeme hepworth chief risk officer sure thanks for the question it s graeme i ll probably a little bit more commentary on the oil and gas our oil and gas portfolio was about 70 canada and 30 other if you will the other being mostly the us of that portfolio about three quarters would be exploration and production the mix between investment grade and non investment grade would be roughly i think 23 investment grade remaining non investment grade in terms of the growth that s happened there just how that s in terms of credit quality the growth over the last year that we ve seen i would say has been more balanced to investment grade non investment grade roughly about 50 50 there so we ve actually seen the portfolio quality skew up a little bit over the last year the non investment grade piece as i mentioned in my remarks is certainly the credit risk we really mitigate through a really high quality structure the borrowing base structure so that even though we see impairments in that sector as our clients struggle with some of the headwinds there the amount of loan losses accrued to us have been relatively moderate i think our loan losses over the last five years they have been around just over 100 basis points despite the real difficulties that sector is facing so that would be just a kind of quick summary on the credit profile there i don t know if doug or derek wanted to comment on what s driving the growth derek neldner ceo and group head rbc capital markets all right it s derek i ll maybe comment just briefly i think as graeme said i think the growth we feel quite comfortable with it s been an even balance between investment grade names and some borrowing base names that would all be conforming part of the growth was driven by a couple of larger investment grade m a related transactions that came on to the books and so we think overall it s quite a comfortable risk profile scott chan canaccord genuity corp analyst great thank you very much david mckay president chief executive officer thanks scott and before i end the call i would like to recognize two of our leaders who are retiring shortly jennifer tory who is our current chief administrative officer for her illustrious 42 year career at rbc which includes roles as you know as group head of p cb and as i said most recently as our chief administrative officer we d like to sincerely thank her for her contribution over her career and we ll certainly miss her and as i ve already acknowledged on the call doug

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by vuyani ndaba johannesburg reuters emerging market currency gains will probably be dominated by high yielding currencies rather than low risk bets next year as economic growth finally recovers in response to lower interest rates a reuters poll found on thursday three quarters of 40 strategists and analysts polled by reuters said next year would be dominated by high yielding emerging market currencies related stories ing financial markets wrote that while it sees a modest slowdown in chinese growth it expects recoveries in the likes of brazil russia mexico india and several other asian countries meaning the growth outlook favors emerging versus developed market currencies the brazilian real is expected to be one of the notable gainers in emerging markets against the dollar firming to 3 97 in a difficult year so far for emerging market investors currency markets looked to safer bets in general shunning high risk reward pairs such as the south african rand against a very strong dollar the high yielding rand might not even be part of that theme next year as official data this week confirmed the economy contracted 0 6 last quarter raising concerns that a recession is currently in play but the currency will likely remain fairly resilient in the face of many challenges slipping 3 to 15 per dollar in three months and then stay there after all some of these large emerging market monetary easing cycles and big currency declines should be providing some support the ing note added south africa s reserve bank is probably one of the few major emerging market central banks that unlike peers such as mexico and india has not taken part in easing rates this year low volatility citi analysts wrote that notwithstanding the central bank of turkey s cumulative easing of 1 000 basis points since july the lira has been holding up relatively well to be sure the strong current account adjustment underpinned by the unprecedented import compression and the fed s dovish pivot have played an important role in supporting the currency wrote analysts at citi however the reuters poll suggests the lira which was considered very cheap earlier this year will be tested next year to the tune of about 10 losses to 6 34 per dollar low volatility is expected to be part of next year s theme that supports carry trades as investors currently do not expect another reduction in u s rates until at least the middle of 2020 probably pushing out any possibility of hikes capable of sending markets into a frenzy carry trades comprise a strategy where investors benefit from holding a higher yielding currency borrowed in a lower yielding one in latin america an outburst of protests is adding pressure on the central banks of the region s two main economies brazil and mexico to keep easing in order to accelerate tepid growth and avoid an ugly social outcome as in chile ecuador and to a lesser degree colombia both currencies are entering the new year on the defensive on worries about the effectiveness of reforms and outstanding trade issues with the united states still mexico s peso fared better than other major latin american currencies this year helped by recent positive developments on the u s china issue local monetary policy should also be supportive of peso behavior as the easing bias of banxico is likely to remain cautious with rate cuts of 25 basis points more likely than the 50bp cuts advocated by a minority of board members wrote citi additional reporting by gabriel burin in buenos aires polling by sujith pai and nagamani lingappa in bengaluru editing by jonathan cable and william maclean
given the current global and domestic economic scenarios it is hard to believe that competitiveness is not an issue for further accelerating and sustaining economic growth in bangladesh the country is expected to graduate from the least developed country ldc status by 2024 this will lead to several challenges for the country s export sector due to the loss of preference in its major export destinations the country expects to achieve the stringent sustainable development goals sdg by 2030 and also eyes to become an upper middle income country by 2031 and a high income country by 2041 there are also changing global trade scenarios the ongoing trade war between the usa and china the brexit the collapse of the multilateral trade negotiations under the wto growing protectionism in the developed countries china s belt and road initiative bri and the emergence of mega trading blocs are examples of the changing global trade scenarios on the domestic front the country s economic growth prospect is closely linked to the growth in exports remittances and private sector investment however there have been a slowdown in growth in exports and remittances over the past few years also sluggish private sector investment over the past few years remains a big concern all these have been accompanied by the falling trend in export gdp remittance gdp and fdi gdp ratios in recent years moreover the export basket of the country persists to be highly concentrated around ready made garments rmg and the diversification efforts over the past few decades have not seen much success even if we look at the rmg exports of bangladesh which now occupy around 84 percent of the total exports the rmg export basket is also highly concentrated at the 6 digit hs code level only 10 rmg products account for 68 percent of the total rmg exports the corresponding figures for china india and vietnam are 36 percent 46 percent and 42 percent respectively the scenario of the inflow of foreign direct investment fdi in bangladesh is frustrating the fdi share in gdp in 2018 in bangladesh was even lower than the ldc average during 2014 and 2018 on average bangladesh s fdi gdp ratio was 1 2 percent and bangladesh attracted usd 2 5 billion s3 4 billion fdi annually by contrast during the same period the average fdi gdp ratio of vietnam was 6 percent and the annual average fdi inflow was usd 12 6 billion the upshot of the above discussion points to the fact that there is a need for significantly enhancing the competitiveness of our economy in the coming years to address the aforementioned challenges and meeting the development goals there are two types of competitiveness price and non price competitiveness while price competitiveness is dependent on labour costs relative inflation and real effective exchange rate reer the non price competitiveness is dependent on a number of issues including product quality and design business research and development r d strength of local brands effectiveness of marketing in overseas markets levels of dynamic efficiency of firms levels of x inefficiency poor management excessive bureaucracy government failures and investment in human capital for skill development there is no denying the fact that while in terms of labour costs bangladesh has a competitive advantage over many of its competitors in the case of other components of price competitiveness and most of the components of non price competitiveness bangladesh is seriously lagging behind its major competitors the economy is now witnessing a gradual appreciation of the real effective exchange rate which is eroding the competitiveness of bangladesh s exports low average years of schooling and very low public expenditure on both education and health as percentages of gdp are resulting in stagnation in skill development and skill diversification there is a need to undertake reform in critical economic domains including the financial sector taxation sector trade and exchange rate policies and business environment faster and cost effective implementation of the mega projects and special economic zones attracting large scale fdi addressing institutional challenges in export diversification substantial spending on research and development and making skill development and skill diversification a national priority are the steps towards enhancing the country s competitiveness there is no doubt that we also need to come out of the so called comfort zone created by the glossy picture of an ever increasing gdp growth rate dr selim raihan is a professor at the department of economics university of dhaka the paper is a member of the straits times media partner asia news network an alliance of 24 news media organisations
here comes the dark money we all know the adage the more things change the more they stay the same it s especially like that with central banks central bank representatives from 40 different nations recently made their way to the kansas city fed s jackson hole economic policy symposium the conference itself began in 1978 six years after the end of the gold standard in 1982 it moved permanently to jackson hole wyoming where it became a sort of summer camp for international central bankers the late august festivities take place at the jackson lake lodge which is a u s national park service facility giving it that rustic yet elitist sort of feel each year the symposium has a unique theme this year that theme was challenges for monetary policy original right according to pre symposium material the topic was chosen because monetary policymakers face a range of challenges as they pursue their mandates since the financial crisis the powers of capt obvious go on to elaborate different rates of recovery have led central banks to chart different courses for the normalization of monetary policy following a period in which most central banks used both conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools to handle the great recession unconventional indeed another main topic of the conference was how to unwind these unconventional policy actions but here s the thing that s only if unwinding is even on the menu right now and therein lies the real difference it s the growing gap between what the fed leader wants to say about unwinding versus what he and other central banks are actually doing the u s stock market has gained more than 300 from its financial crisis low of 666 in march 2009 other major economy stock markets have followed suit albeit not with quite as much fervor and more recently with growing volatility in the mix the second outcome of the central banking jubilee was a debt boom the world s debt pile sat at a record 244 trillion as of the beginning of this year that s more than three times the size of global gdp the amount of debt is particularly high in the emerging market countries where it has taken the form of government debt and corporate debt denominated in u s dollars the u s dollar strengthened first on the back of the fed s tightening policies from late 2015 through late 2018 then as other economies slowed down relative to the u s and their central banks cut rates to ostensibly stimulate growth the cost of servicing this debt has increased if economies outside the u s weaken further payment and internal domestic budgeting will get even more precarious this will produce more geopolitical tension more nationalism and trade wars and more business and financial uncertainty as a result there will continue to be more overall central bank maneuvering toward looser monetary policy but this time more central banks will join in let s consider the list of central banks loosening policy the bank of canada for the first time in almost three years the bank of canada lowered its five year benchmark rate the bank dropped the rate 15 basis points from 5 34 to 5 19 primarily because canada s big banks have decreased their five year posted rates canada s central bank gave almost no indication that it was nearing a rate cut but it had signaled major concerns about the trade climate especially between the u s and china european central bank at the end of october current ecb leader mario draghi will be handing over his money conjuring baton to now former imf leader christine lagarde as mentioned above he is aware that ultra loose monetary policy like the ecb s deposit rate of 0 4 which still has the power to startle has done little to spark inflation in the eurozone in order for her to be able to keep true to his ultra dovish legacy draghi has given lagarde all the headroom she needs to keep monetary policy as loose as she possibly can even if inflation exceeds the 2 target which it probably won t last month the ecb left its key interest rate at 0 4 but sent strong signals that it might cut even deeper into negative territory as soon as september 12 it also hinted that it could restart the huge asset buying program it ended in december to boost the eurozone economy the ecb is the latest g7 central bank to hint that lower rates are imminent in an effort to stave off a global slowdown and trade war risk and to ramp up below target inflation in the meantime draghi looks like he may end his term in october the way he started with quantitative easing let s hear it for super mario those are just two examples but both before and after the fed cut u s interest rates on july 31 many central banks from emerging markets around the globe did the same with an increasing number of them not even waiting for the fed s move central banks from the world s largest emerging market countries have thus sent a clear signal that even with global debt at new highs especially in em countries policymakers are invoking easy money and more market stimulus on the surface the fed s rate cut in july was expected to weaken the dollar something that president trump and u s businesses have demanded since 2018 however as central banks around the globe turn dovish the dollar could actually continue its outperformance by default that s why the fed has less ability to tweak the dollar than president trump would like the fed doesn t exist in isolation but in a world of other central banks that react to it that s especially important to keep in mind since uncertainty about brexit and possible u k elections the u s china trade war the slowing eurozone and em economic and periodically acute turmoil like argentina s markets falling by nearly 50 in a day weigh on sentiment in turn this turmoil boosts the dollar s safe haven appeal and by extension u s financial asset markets when the fed cut rates in july it unleashed easy policy thinking amongst central banks that had thought as recently as late 2018 they were supposed to embark upon a tightening platform to keep up now they have had to do a 180 to keep their economies and markets fueled by cheaper money as the bigger countries embark upon a renewed dovish period into this vortex fed chair jerome powell delivered his keynote speech at jackson hole on aug 23 what he said is the worst of all worlds for central banks and markets he was wishy washy about the fed s direction so the fed s actions will remain a puzzle however other major central banks will ease because they can but here s the bottom line a flood of dark money from around the world is on the way it won t do much to help the global economy if the past 10 years are any indication but it ll probably give the markets another artificial jolt in other words it ll just kick the can down the road until the ultimate day of reckoning regards nomi prins for the daily reckoning

risk appetite returns on reports suggesting trump was only bluffing on trade pound surges as election polls show tories consolidating their lead loonie climbs on less dovish boc looks to opec meeting optimistic trade headlines breathe life back into riskier assets us stock markets snapped a three day losing spell on wednesday with the s p 500 gaining 0 63 on the back of a report claiming that american and chinese negotiators are moving closer to agreeing the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a phase one accord the encouraging news likely blindsided investors as it stood in sharp contrast to the fiery rhetoric as of late recall president trump cranking up the pressure by saying he could wait until after the 2020 election to make a deal all told the message for the market was that a preliminary deal hasn t been derailed at all but rather that trump was once again just posturing in order to maximize his negotiating leverage and extract more concessions from beijing that took the wind out of the sails of defensive currencies such as the yen and swiss franc but catapulted the likes of the kiwi dollar higher alongside crude oil with both wti and brent recovering all their losses from last week looking ahead the focus will likely remain on whether the white house will ultimately follow through with the december 15 tariffs or whether they ll be voided or at least postponed to keep the deal alive clearly both sides want to strike that deal trump needs a victory against china to tout before he hits the campaign trail in earnest while beijing needs some economic relief as stimulating an already overleveraged economy is a giant gamble that said we aren t there yet and moving closer to a deal is a hollow phrase in the world of trade negotiations where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed sticking points remain and in this sense it wouldn t be surprising to see more brinkmanship and tariff threats in the coming days as each side tries to give away as little as possible implying that risk sentiment could remain shaky and swing wildly cable sails past 1 3100 as bears go into hibernation the british pound outperformed yesterday as incoming election polls showed the conservatives consolidating their sizeable lead over labour amplifying hopes for a majority government that moves brexit forward and thus supercharging cable pulls the pair broke above 1 3000 which was the upper bound of its recent trading range and is now hovering around 1 3130 mind the risks though because the market seems to be getting overly confident about a tory majority in other words this is still a most unpredictable election and if investors run ahead of themselves in pricing in a tory majority but the result is ultimately a hung parliament then the crash back down in sterling could be ferocious in the bigger picture even if the pound rallies further on a conservative victory next week it s questionable how long any rally can be sustained see our uk election preview loonie soars on upbeat boc looks to opec the canadian dollar was the second best performer yesterday after the nation s central bank kept rates unchanged and downplayed the prospect of a near term rate cut the tone of the accompanying statement was less dovish overall with policymakers noting that the outlook for the global economy has improved for example the loonie also capitalized on a weaker us dollar and higher oil prices today energy markets and the loonie will turn their gaze to the opec meeting in vienna amid conflicting signals lately markets seem split about whether the cartel will deepen its production cuts to stabilize prices as it would risk losing more market share to us shale producers elsewhere the dollar was mixed yesterday the adp employment report was very soft pushing the reserve currency lower the ism non manufacturing pmi disappointed too but the details offered a glimmer of hope for the coming months with new orders and employment rising focus remains on tomorrow s all important employment report where the risks surrounding the dollar appear asymmetric

business as usual has been harder borders are there other ways to address climate migration they said the hunger strike was because the eggs were moldy and the food had maggots on oct 18 some 200 detainees at the private prison known as the northwest detention center which management recently rebranded as the northwest ice processing center went on hunger strike work stoppages for detainees on kitchen detail were also held the seven day strike was the first one of the year at the center which has had many in recent memory there was more too a new head of geo group the company that owns the prison in tacoma allegedly forced detainees to stand before they entered rooms under threat of punishment including solitary confinement maru mora villalpando local activist and co founder of la resistencia which organizes against the detention center relayed what people inside were telling her we re being given trash to eat and at the same time you have these old trays and the machine doesn t really wash them the entire conditions created a moment where people went on hunger strike mora villalpando said finally because nothing was done things kept being the same way then they went on a hunger strike in the months after an activist was shot and killed outside of the processing center geo group has renamed the facility and started allowing reporters inside for what activists have called a sanitized tour in september a group of journalists were given a tour of the facility one report from q13 saw detention center employees showcasing televisions and computers to the reporter later during the tour detainees were shouting that they were hungry and not being fed around 60 of the people being held at the detention center have been shipped there from the southern border mora villalpando said children are not housed at the center meaning many of the detainees are likely separated from their families there s a lot of people from everywhere mora villalpando said obviously for those that have relatives we get a lot of calls from people outside the state trying to locate their loved ones here access to medical care is also an issue as documented in 2018 by seattle weekly nationwide around 50 000 people are locked away in immigration camps and prisons according to the federal government it s the tip of the spear of a brand of immigration policy that has been enacted by every u s president since bill clinton decided to get tough on immigration in the 1990s public radio international reports that climate change is putting pressure on central and latin america and that a system of borders camps and deportations could be the federal government s response to migrants and refugees in the coming decades predictions climate change in and of itself is only one of the factors that plays into migration kayly ober is a senior advocate for climate displacement at refugees international she said often times climate change is part of the mixture when people decide to move climate change can exacerbate some of the principal factors ober said in syria before its civil war there were issues of poor governance related to water but drought made it worse it s debatable how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which is designed for communities that will likely bear a disproportionate amount of the impact the county board of health met on nov 21 to discuss the new plan and heard from a panel comprised of people working within communities of color to address climate preparedness one panelist was nourah yonous a somali immigrant who started the organization african women business alliance she works with immigrant women to help grow and stabilize their businesses she said there will likely be an influx of climate migrants coming and that local government could do more in particular communities could use more tools to cope with climate change we are not really well prepared she said of local governments when communities of color aren t being given tangible and culturally responsive tools to address issues like displacement economic injustice or food insecurity government action doesn t lead to communities being more climate resiliant instead it s a bandage she said for that reason i think it s very important for us to know that these issues are connected she said improving public transit building more affordable energy efficient housing increasing solar and wind power and reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger
crippling student bills in america sky high mortgages in australia and another default scare in argentina a decade of easy money has left the world with a record 250 trillion dh918 29tn of government corporate and household debt that s almost three times global economic output and equates to about 32 500 for every man woman and child on earth much of that legacy stems from policymakers deliberate efforts to use borrowing to keep the global economy afloat in the wake of the financial crisis rock bottom interest rates in the years since has kept the burden manageable for most allowing the debt mountain to keep growing with central bank rates at their lowest levels and us treasuries at their richest valuations in 100 years we appear to be close to bubble territory but we don t know how or when this bubble will burst now as policymakers grapple with the slowest growth since that era a suite of options on how to revive their economies share a common denominator yet more debt from green new deals to modern monetary theory proponents of deficit spending argue central banks are exhausted and that massive fiscal spending is needed to yank companies and households out of their funk fiscal hawks argue such proposals will merely sow the seeds for more trouble but the needle seems to be shifting on how much debt an economy can safely carry central bankers and policymakers from european central bank president christine lagarde to the international monetary fund have been urging governments to do more arguing it s a good time to borrow for projects that will reap economic dividends previous conventional wisdom about advanced economy speed limits regarding debt to gdp ratios may be changing says mark sobel a former us treasury and imf official given lower interest bills and markets pent up demand for safe assets major advanced economies may well be able to sustain higher debt loads he adds rising expectations of fiscal stimulus measures across the globe have contributed to a pickup in bond yields spurred by signs of a bottoming in the world s economic slowdown ten year treasury yields climbed back above 1 80 per cent earlier this week while their japanese counterparts edged up closer to zero a constraint for policymakers though is the legacy of past spending as pockets of credit stress litter the globe at the sovereign level argentina s newly elected government has promised to renegotiate a record 56 billion credit line with the imf stoking memories of the nation s economic collapse and debt default in 2001 turkey south africa and others have also had scares as for corporate debt american companies alone account for around 70 per cent of this year s total corporate defaults even amid a record economic expansion and in china companies defaulting in the onshore market are likely to hit a record next year according to s p global ratings so called zombie companies firms that are unable to cover debt servicing costs from operating profits over an extended period and have muted growth prospects have risen to around 6 per cent of non financial listed shares in advanced economies a multi decade high according to the bank for international settlements that hurts both healthier competitors and productivity as for households australia and south korea rank among the most indebted the debt drag is hanging over the next generation of workers too in the us students now owe 1 5tn and are struggling to pay it off even if debt is cheap it can be tough to escape once the load gets too heavy while solid economic growth is the easiest way out that isn t always forthcoming instead policymakers have to navigate balances and trade offs between austerity financial repression where savers subsidise borrowers or default and debt forgiveness the best is to grow out of it gradually and consistently and it is the solution to many but not all episodes of current indebtedness said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser to allianz policymakers are ploughing on in the hope of such an outcome to shore up the us recovery the federal reserve lowered interest rates three times this year even as a tax cut funded fiscal stimulus sends the nation s deficit towards 5 per cent of gross domestic product japan is mulling fresh spending while monetary policy remains ultra easy and in what s described as britain s most consequential election in decades both major parties have promised a return to public spending levels last seen in the 1970s china is holding the line for now as it tries to keep a lid on debt with a drip feed of liquidity injections rather than all out monetary easing on the fiscal front it has cut taxes and brought forward bond sale quotas rather than resort to the spending binges seen in past cycles as global investors get accustomed to a world deep in the red they have repriced risk which some argue is only inflating a bubble around 12tn of bonds have negative yields anne richards chief executive of fidelity international says negative bond yields are now of systemic concern with central bank rates at their lowest levels and us treasuries at their richest valuations in 100 years we appear to be close to bubble territory but we don t know how or when this bubble will burst she adds the imf in october said lower yields are spurring investors such as insurance companies and pension funds to invest in riskier and less liquid securities as they seek higher returns debt is not a problem as long as it is sustainable says alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist at natixis in hong kong who previously worked for the european central bank and bank of spain the issue is whether the massive generation of debt since the global financial crisis is going to turn out to be profitable
washington elizabeth warren is leading a liberal rebellion against a long held economic view that large tax increases slow economic growth trying to upend democratic policymaking in the way supply side conservatives changed republican orthodoxy four decades ago generations of economists across much of the ideological spectrum have long held that higher taxes reduce investment slowing economic growth that drag the consensus held would offset the benefits to growth from increased government spending in areas like education ms warren and other leading democrats say the opposite the senator from massachusetts who is a leading candidate for the democratic presidential nomination contends that her plans to tax the rich and spend the revenue to lift the poor and the middle class would accelerate economic growth not impede it other democratic candidates are making similar claims about their tax and spend proposals some liberal economists go further and say that simply taxing the rich would help growth no matter what the government did with the money democrats in the past including the party s 2016 nominee hillary clinton have argued that a more modest combination of tax increases and spending programs would expand the economy but no democratic nominee before ms warren had ever proposed so many new taxes and spending programs and leaned so heavily into the argument that they would be in economist parlance pro growth

by howard schneider new york dec 4 reuters u s senator elizabeth warren has carried the idea of a wealth tax onto the center stage of american politics but the roots were planted far away in a young french economist s work unraveling the flow of money through global tax havens the more gabriel zucman understood about capital being hidden in places like the cayman islands the more he became convinced the run up in u s wealth inequality was no accident and beyond a point it puts the economy at risk he and fellow university of california berkeley professor emmanuel saez argue too much in the hands of too few threatens to stymie economic growth starve public health and education systems of funds and leave the middle class pinched with debt and less able to consume and save to which the massachusetts democrat might add sound familiar what we don t know zucman said in a recent interview with reuters is the point past which inequality becomes really bad and undermines the ability of families to reach and sustain middle class living standards and ultimately chips at the economy s overall health advertisement advertisement tepid growth and weakness in the middle bands of wealth and income is a problem for aggregate demand said zucman who was mentored by thomas piketty a fellow french economist whose seminal research on inequality has fed the global debate over whether workers are getting a fair shake among economists the idea is not controversial analysts at oxford economics have estimated roughly 70 billion in missing u s consumption annually in part due to rising inequality how to address it is another matter and one where politicians on the left right and center have starkly different ideas it is a huge problem for politics zucman said and may explain harsher attitudes towards immigration globalization and capitalism itself advertisement advertisement post recession hangover the argument is playing out notably in the democratic primary as candidates argue that the american middle class remains vulnerable despite the longest economic expansion in history warren and senator bernie sanders of vermont are among those offering large structural changes while others like former vice president joe biden are taking a more gradualist approach story continues the discussion has drawn one multibillionaire into the race former new york mayor michael bloomberg a wealth tax opponent whose estimated net worth of 53 4 billion placed him at no 8 on forbes list of the richest people in the country but all are speaking amid a deep reconsideration among economists and policy analysts of what s needed and what s feasible in a sense it is a culminating chapter of the economic crisis a decade ago as the recovery from the great recession struggled to gain altitude occupy wall street protesters and the tea party staked out the left and right extremes advertisement advertisement then came donald trump who played off the latent anger around stagnant wages and lost factory jobs nearly three years into his presidency the recovery continues but the fundamental issue can the american middle class thrive if ever more wealth is held in fewer hands remains unresolved the response to the financial crisis was almost to sort of kick the can down the road on these underlying questions said former federal reserve governor and treasury official sarah bloom raskin the one percent solution the wealthiest 1 of households did see a drop in their fortunes during the financial crisis when their wealth fell by a massive 5 trillion new federal reserve data shows advertisement advertisement but that was their only setback in at least the past 30 years as stock markets and the economy recovered the net worth of the richest families mushroomed from roughly 15 1 trillion in mid 2009 to 34 7 trillion now their share of all u s wealth which dipped during the crisis resumed its steady climb and now accounts for nearly a third of americans collective worth up from about a quarter a decade ago rampant gaming of the income tax system cuts the marginal tax rate for these one percenters to near zero zucman contends and don t wait for the rich to die he argues because the estate tax has been gutted his solution is to tax the whole sum of their holdings each year to fund programs needed now to boost the economy advertisement advertisement warren has included the idea in her recent plan to expand medicare and launch other social programs she suggests a 2 levy on any assets over 50 million and 6 on assets over 1 billion sanders has a slightly different variation even at those tax rates research by zucman and saez suggests the share of wealth held by the richest families would still have grown in recent decades but only slightly back to the future the idea faces a number of criticisms practical as well as ideological legal and constitutional challenges certainly await any u s wealth tax enforcement may be difficult requiring efforts to track and estimate sources of wealth ranging from the mundane like stock portfolios or real estate to the exotic like artwork or the present value of mineral rights that may not be exploited for years advertisement advertisement it won t help that europe where zucman came of age has largely abandoned wealth levies ill designed in his view they started at wealth levels so low they created broad opposition and lacked provisions to keep people from skirting them by moving to another country while some billionaires like warren buffet agree that taxes on the wealthy are too low others are likely to fight back and argue they are defending american capitalism it isn t zucman argues a new debate in their recent book the triumph of injustice zucman and saez noted that taxes have sometimes been criticized in america as the evil import of european professors advertisement advertisement but until ronald reagan s election as president in 1980 top tax rates were much higher than today go back to the 1930s under the administration of democratic president franklin delano roosevelt and it was a common view that too much wealth in too few hands was bad for the country it is also true that those years of higher taxation particularly the 1950s and 1960s were years of strong growth and investment think of the wealth tax zucman said as modernizing an old idea there is this tradition of tax justice and tax progressivity in the u s he said and it has been forgotten reporting by howard schneider editing by dan burns and andrea ricci

results could differ materially from those discussed additionally we will be referencing certain non gaap financial measures and reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap metrics can be found in the appendix of today s presentation and now i turn the presentation over to pete on slide 3 peter g watson president and chief executive officer thank you matt and good morning everyone it s been really eventful year at greif and i m really proud of what our greif team has accomplished in a very challenging market environment we recorded a step change improvement in financial performance fueled by the successful acquisition and ongoing integration of caraustar industries and made notable progress in each of our strategic priorities for fiscal 2019 net sales rose by nearly 19 to 4 6 billion we generated nearly 660 million in adjusted ebitda and most importantly drove adjusted free cash flow significantly higher by 50 the 268 million despite a very challenging market environment we use that free cash flow to fund our capital maintenance and operations to delever our balance sheet to invest in profitable growth investments in the fund our industry leading dividend we are laser focused on controlling the areas that we control customer service excellence and disciplined operational execution this will help us build additional momentum as we head in the fiscal year 2020 i d please ask you to turn to slide 4 our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda adjusted class a earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow all rose versus the prior year quarter the story for the fourth quarter is very similar to what we related fiscal q3 and that is we are operating extremely well despite continued weak demand from a slowing industrial economy and uncertainty caused by trade tensions caraustar continues to exceed deal assumptions and global intermediate bulk container volumes continue to grow i d like to now review our business performance by segment and if you could just please turn to slide 5 the rigid industrial packaging segment continue to seek face weak demand due to declining industrial manufacturing environments and trade uncertainty our global ibc volumes grew by roughly 1 4 versus the prior year quarter and we re negatively impacted by softer market conditions predominantly in north america global steel volumes declined by roughly 4 versus the prior year quarter and it s important to note that volumes vary by region and that demand softness is not a global phenomenon our steel volumes in the middle east north africa and eastern europe which accounts for roughly 19 of our rips global steel volume in 2019 were up nearly 10 versus the prior quarter thanks to growing industrial demand in those regions and capital growth projects that strong performance couldn t outpace steel drum demand softness in trade sensitive regions such as the u s gulf coast and central and western europe those two regions account for roughly 32 of rips global steel volume this year were down almost 7 versus the prior year quarter rips fourth quarter sales were roughly 39 million lower versus the prior year quarter and on a currency neutral basis rips sales fell by approximately 28 million due to volume softness while fourth quarter gross profit margin improved by roughly 70 basis points versus the prior year due to lower raw material costs and improved price product mix management rips fourth quarter adjusted ebitda fell by 1 5 million versus the prior year quarter due to lower sales a 2 6 million fx headwind and 2 5 million of less favorable opportunistic sourcing opportunities partially offset by a one time 7 million tax recovery in brazil that s recorded as income in sg a looking in the fiscal 2020 we anticipate continued weak demand and trade related softness in parts of the world we anticipate rips steel volume to be roughly flat compared to fiscal 2019 due to a slowing industrial economy and particularly in the u s we anticipate ibc volume growth in the low double digits thanks to new projects coming fully online in north america and europe and also due to a full year contribution from tholu our new ibc reconditioning business those ibc projects will help us further penetrate less cyclical end markets such as food and agrochem we also continue to examine a range of cost reduction activities in light of prolonged demand softness including shift reductions hiring freezes potential rooftop consolidations and target sg a reductions i please ask you to turn to slide 6 our flexible products services segment delivered solid results despite the continuation of weak demand in western europe fourth quarter segment sales were roughly 9 lower than prior year quarter but on a currency neutral basis fell by 6 fourth quarter adjusted ebitda increased over 9 versus the prior year quarter and overcame a 1 5 million fx headwind margins improved by 140 basis points primarily due to better operating efficiencies in fiscal 2020 we expect flexible products adjusted ebitda to be roughly flat for fiscal year 2019 we anticipate market softness in our 4 loop western european business to continue and 1 loop volumes which predominantly serves ag and fertilizer customers got off to a slow start this fiscal year due to wet weather in parts of western europe i d ask you to please turn to slide 7 paper packaging s fourth quarter sales grew by 290 million versus the prior year quarter due to caraustar s contribution partially offset by lower published prices in our containerboard business volumes were negatively impacted by 12 000 tons of containerboard economic downtime and by 6 500 tons of planned containerboard maintenance downtime at massillon ohio mill that last year occurred in fiscal three and this year we took the scheduled downtime in q4 paper packaging s fourth quarter adjusted ebitda rose by roughly 75 versus the prior year caraustar continues to demonstrate its merit and outpaced deal assumptions for the second consecutive quarter with quarterly adjusted ebitda of roughly 64 million in fiscal 2020 paper packaging will benefit from the additional 3 5 months of caraustar and from various new capital growth projects coming online including our new corrugated sheet feeder in palmyra pennsylvania we ll face a headwind from lower published containerboard prices that occurred midway through this past year which will only be offset partially by lower input costs our assumption for occ costs will remain lower for longer with an average of 46 on a blended rate in fiscal 2020 down slightly from the fiscal 2019 average of 50 a ton i d like to please turn to slide 8 caraustar s integration is progressing the plan and we realized roughly 24 million of synergy in fiscal 2019 recall that we originally expected to capture 15 million in the first 12 months following the deal close the positive synergy delta was generated by accelerated sg a activity internalization and cross selling opportunities by accelerated productivity and footprint optimization including our decision to shut down one paper machine in our mobile alabama uncoated recycled boxboard mill complex we expect to achieve synergies of at least 70 million by the end of fiscal 2022 and capture an incremental 26 million in fiscal 2020 which is factored into our guidance by q2 2020 we expect our payroll systems sourcing financial reporting systems to be on one common platform which will drive deeper integration between growth and legacy caraustar and serve as a catalyst for future sg a savings we currently have over 190 synergy opportunities still to be assessed and quantified although most are smaller in nature as we prioritize larger opportunities first finally we have not yet completed the consumer packaging business strategic review we originally expected that assessment to be completed by fiscal year end however we are still actively engaged in that process we expect to conclude this review in early 2020 i d like to now turn the presentation over to chief financial officer larry hilsheimer larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you pete good morning everyone please turn to slide 9 to review our quarterly financial performance big picture we delivered a very solid fourth quarter considering the weakened industrial economy and trade related headwinds we faced fourth quarter net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange rose by 26 versus the prior year quarter due to caraustar s contribution partially offset by demand softness in rips and in fps legacy pps similar experience softer market demand and lower year over year published containerboard pricing fourth quarter adjusted ebitda grew by 32 versus the prior year quarter primarily due to caraustar s contribution partially offset by lower ebitda in our legacy paper business roughly 4 million of fx headwinds and 2 5 million of fewer opportunistic sourcing opportunities for fiscal 2019 fx was a roughly 9 million headwind and we had 10 million less in opportunistic sourcing benefits as pete mentioned in his remarks rips adjusted ebitda includes a one time 7 million tax recovery in brazil that recovery was from overpayment of taxes due to government that occurred in prior periods and were wrongly administered that item will not recur in fiscal 2020 below the operating profit line interest expense rose by roughly 20 million while other expense was slightly lower versus the prior year quarter adjusted class a earnings per share rose by roughly 15 versus the prior year quarter to 1 24 per share our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 17 and benefited from 6 million of one time items such as return to provision adjustments and reserve releases as a result of examination and statute closures for fiscal 2019 we delivered adjusted class a earnings per share of 3 96 well above our stated guidance range that 3 96 per share includes 0 15 a share of one time tax benefits including 0 05 a share from a recycling tax credit disclosed at q3 and 0 10 a share from the one time items in the fourth quarter it also includes an 0 08 per share benefit from the one time brazilian tax recovery we received that was recorded in sg a finally and incorporates in 0 11 per share inventory step up headwind disclosed at q2 that we did not back out of our results none of those items will recur in fiscal 2020 fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was roughly flat to the prior year quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted free cash flow rose by roughly 89 million versus the prior fiscal year and was driven primarily by caraustar s contribution and by stronger working capital dollars working capital performance as conveyed at the third quarter we are biased to the upside of our free cash flow range and we outperformed please turn to slide 10 to review our fiscal 2020 guidance and key modeling assumptions we expect to generate between 3 63 and 4 13 in adjusted class a earnings per share in fiscal 2020 our range is wider than usual to account for the significant macroeconomic uncertainty our customers face bridge fiscal 2019 s actual results to fiscal 2020 is midpoint of 3 88 per share start with the 3 96 that we printed back out 0 12 per share for the net non recurring items we experienced in fiscal 2019 which takes you to 3 84 per share from there we anticipate between 13 and a 29 0 13 headwind to a 0 29 per share tailwind from operational performance to include caraustar s incremental contribution and our new strategic growth projects we also expect between 0 05 to 0 09 per share lift primarily from lower year over year non controlling interest and non gaap tax excluding the fiscal one time tax items fiscal 19 one time tax items partially offset by other higher other expense we also expect between 0 13 and 0 09 per share headwind for the year on year over year higher interest expense we anticipate 2020 adjusted free cash flow between 245 million and 285 million including anticipated adjusted capital expenditures of between 160 million and 180 million we paid roughly 71 million of cash tax in fiscal 2019 and anticipate it will be higher in fiscal 2020 mostly due to additional pre tax income finally we anticipate working capital to be a use of cash between 0 and 20 million primarily related to the northeast pennsylvania corrugated inventory needs as it s typically the case at greif we anticipate our adjusted ebitda to be stronger in the second half of the year versus the first the results from the timing of various agricultural seasons around the world drive that delay we will continue to break out caraustar s financial performance in the body of our earnings release until fiscal until q2 fiscal 2020 we do expect caraustar s ebitda to decline sequentially in fiscal q1 due to winter construction industry slowdown typically seen in the business that time of the year finally we assume occ prices of 46 per ton for fiscal 2020 versus the 50 per ton average for fiscal 2019 as a reminder every 10 per ton movement in occ equates to roughly 1 2 million change in ebitda per month turning to capital priorities on slide 11 investing in our existing business through appropriate maintenance projects and organic growth opportunities remains our top priority since that cash will fund our deleveraging plan we ve repaid roughly 178 million in net debt since fiscal q2 and our compliance leverage ratio at the end of q4 was roughly 3 5 times we have no plans to alter our industry leading dividend which today pays a compelling yield of roughly 4 and offers investors a steady source of income to augment market returns with that i ll turn the call back to pete for his closing comments before our q a peter g watson president and chief executive officer hey thank you larry and if everyone could please turn to slide 12 our greif team delivered a very strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 performance despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment and personally like to thank our team for the efforts that they put together this year as we proceed in the fiscal 2020 we re well positioned to serve a variety of attractive markets through our industry leading product portfolio and also our commitment to customer service excellence we re advancing lower risk growth opportunities close to our core and caraustar continues to demonstrate its value as a driver of significant free cash flow expansion in the future i want to thank you all for participating this morning and we appreciate your interest in greif sharon if you could please open the line for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from george staphos with bank of america george staphos bank of american merril lynch analyst hi everybody good morning apologies for the background noise two questions how are you two questions on rips and again thanks for all the details first of all it would appear that pricing was negative in this quarter in rips north america it had been running more positively as i recall i m guessing some of it s probably just past through but can you comment what was driving the lower pricing was any of it related to competitive activity and then the bigger picture question on rips from us right now pete you ve done a great job obviously trying to integrate and trying to keep profitability stable and what s been a very difficult environment nonetheless if i look at rips s profitability over a number of years it s really been fairly stable there really hasn t been an upward trajectory despite all the cost reduction actions and so on is there anything else more structurally that needs to be done you mentioned that you d be looking at new initiatives but why will this be any difference in terms of what we get out of it which is just flat performance thank you very much peter g watson president and chief executive officer yeah so george thanks for the question i ll answer the first one around the pricing so you re right rips north america pricing is down it s really a reflection of lower raw material costs and to give you a perspective the raw material costs on steel are down over 20 and as you can see their prices down much significantly less than that so i think they re doing a very good job one passing through pricing as we normally do during raw material changes but they re also doing a really good job of managing their price and mix product management your question on the other regarding rips overall i think the big big challenge we have is in this quarter and the fiscal year is demand and there is really two stories the big story is the weakness in north america which you can see in the performance and i would tell you that our demand and our volume performance and our operating performance in latin america emea and apac is significantly better this year so the drag is really in north america and it s related to two things it s volume and also opportunistic steel sourcing that we have not had in the past years and your point on overall what is there any fundamental structural changes to that business we are pivoting to plastic substrates both ibc and ibc reconditioning and plastic drums and as you know now about 60 of our revenue in that business is steel drums and that is a low growth more challenging environment on a regional basis so as we rationalize our portfolio and what you seen in the footprint rationalization is really around our steel drum business because of the demand outlook that we see we are growing and we are investing in our plastics business we re expanding our ibc and reconditioning business quite dramatically that s one of our big strategic growth drivers that has the potential for higher profit generation we also have in certain regions the plastic drum business that is it shows greater profitability and better volume potential so we are shifting the portfolio away from steel to a more diversified platform and that is it doesn t take you can t just do that overnight so i think when you look at our capital allocations from a strategic investment standpoint in that business it s really generated to plastic in ibc and ibc reconditioning and that s the direction we re taking but it does cause some pain right now and it s particularly emphasized higher because of the volume demand weakness is particularly north america and western europe operator next question comes from ghansham panjabi with baird ghansham panjabi baird equity research analyst hey guys good morning i guess first off can you provide just give us a bit more color on end market volumes in rips segment during the fourth quarter where volumes particularly weak at any point in the quarter and can you give us a sense as to how november also tracked and just more broadly what our customers sort of managing calling out in terms of inventory management through year end this year calendar year end peter g watson president and chief executive officer sure ghansham thanks for the question i ll go real quick around the globe for you and then make some comments on the within the quarter and then november so again if you look at the big story not only in rips but all the greif is really weak demand in north america and that s impacted both paper and our rigid business and you can see the double digit reduction in our volumes in rips if you look in europe emea were up 1 7 it s really led by really good strength in eastern europe in the middle east and north africa with really strong growth driven by lubes specialty chemicals and those business is also from a profitability had excellent years china while that shows negative on the charts if you look at same store sales as you remember we closed some operations last year they re flat versus a year ago so we are making progress in that business we ve changed leadership in that business and we re starting to see some improvement and then latin america at 2 3 improvement in volumes for the quarter and really led by brazil and argentina which had excellent volumes really relative to strong ag and food sectors if you look at inside the quarter i think the demand was fairly consistent through the three months in each of the quarters and quite frankly in november we re not seeing a whole different scenario in our volumes in rips that we saw through the quarter ghansham panjabi baird equity research analyst great thanks so much pete and then for pps how much in aggregate did downtime cost you through fiscal year 19 on an ebitda basis and then separately specific to caraustar how do that business performed during the quarter on a volume basis and legacy ebitda what was the baseline for ebitda in 4q fiscal year 18 and setting aside the synergies where did you come in upper 4q of fiscal year 19 thanks so much peter g watson president and chief executive officer yeah so we took the 12 000 tons of economic downtime in our containerboard mills and then we had 6 500 tons of planned and scheduled maintenance downtime which happened in q4 this year q3 a year ago and you re roughly talking about 12 million to 14 million of ebitda of those two events in containerboard when you pivot over to caraustar very pleased with the performance of that business there are certainly some volume challenges as there is everywhere in north america every substrate we have in north america has some volume challenges but really pleased with one the ability of those teams to drive integration and get greater synergies if you look at the weakness in our containerboard business in the entire market that certainly is reflected over in our tube and core business is that s a large segment of their business and some of their weaknesses in tube and core is a reflection of that end market exposure to the paper mills larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah ghansham i ll just supplement one thing and just to clarify that the 12 million 12 million or 13 million kind of number is for the economic downtime we had for the year on the 39 000 tons or so with respect to caraustar we re really pleased i mean while there were some volume drop that pete mentioned in the urb space a lot tied into the containerboard business on comparison to the ebitda upon which we bought it they performed actually above our budget now they did have the tailwind of occ but then the synergy left obviously was also very very helpful operator next question comes from adam josephson with keybanc capital markets adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst pete larry matt good morning thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it peter g watson president and chief executive officer hey adam adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst hey larry on the eps bridge thanks for giving that bridge 19 to 20 by the way you mentioned that the 3 96 less the 0 12 from non recurring benefits in 19 and then you mentioned i think the operational performance range of anywhere from a drag of 0 13 to a benefit of 0 29 if i heard correctly which averages out to an 0 08 a benefit which would be about 7 million of ebitda if i m doing my math correctly given that you have 3 5 additional months of caraustar plus the synergies that s a lot of additional ebitda coming your way but i think again if i correct me if i heard this wrong but you re talking about single digit million of ebitda improvement in fiscal 20 can you just help me understand kind of that bucket along with that 5 to 9 lift from a variety of things that i couldn t quite make out larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i d say at the top level adam the key thing if you go back and you look at our discussions in this call a year ago we started talking than about seeing industrial weakness it has just gotten worse throughout the year in north america in particular pete mentioned it but a lot of elsewhere in the world we re seeing some positive trends but nothing is really exciting in terms of the uplift so when we are building that out the weakness that we saw in the fourth quarter in our rips business and as pete mentioned also replicated in november we re playing out throughout the year and so yeah there is a drag year over year in that rips business relative to what we saw in the first couple of quarters last year that s offsetting the lift that we re getting from the from the pps business in particularly the caraustar side we re also forecasting flat on fps as was mentioned just because it has been lagging a little bit the impacts that it sees in its primary market in northern europe so those are the things that combined you ve got it right i mean there is a lift from caraustar acquisition the enhanced synergies your drags on pps also from the price decreases that we saw in this year and a little bit on the back end where we ve got occ trending up in the third and fourth quarter of this year and remember when we talk about the 50 versus the 46 we didn t have caraustar in the first quarter last year too so you work through the math on how all of this works and it gets you to those range but the primary driver is just the severe weakness that we re seeing in the industrial economy in north america which is certainly evidenced by the pmi data that we ve been seeing adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst just a follow up on that i think of the 0 05 to 0 09 lift from that kind of a hodgepodge of items what was that exactly larry larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer the well you mentioned i mean it s primarily driven by what we re getting out of the acquisition of caraustar by having it in the full year and also the enhanced synergies is the big driver now we ve got other capital projects that are driving additional incremental eps as well pete mentioned the play out of some of our ibc plant investments and also our acquisition of tholu but those are relatively minor peter g watson president and chief executive officer so on that 0 05 to 0 09 later in the bridge adam it s primarily lower nci right adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst oh well thank you peter g watson president and chief executive officer a little bit higher other expense so primarily lower nci larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i missed the question operator next question comes from justin bergner with g research justin bergner g research analyst hi good morning peter g watson president and chief executive officer hi just larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin justin bergner g research analyst good morning pete good morning larry couple of questions you mentioned cash taxes that number came at me a little quickly can you remind me what it was in 2019 larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer 71 million bucks or so justin justin bergner g research analyst i m sorry 71 matt eichmann vice president investor relations and corporate communications yeah peter g watson president and chief executive officer justin bergner g research analyst and i mean that s running below your i guess adjusted taxes which in turn benefit was onetime items is cash tax going to consistently stay below book tax in the coming years even if they increase from current levels larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s what as a tax advisor you re always trying to defer taxes as much as you can but at some point it flips for you but i wouldn t count on it always being below our tax expense now we expect cash taxes in fiscal 2020 to be roughly 25 million to 30 million higher than in fiscal 19 operator next question comes from gabe hajde with wells fargo securities gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst pete larry and matt good morning peter g watson president and chief executive officer hey gabe matt eichmann vice president investor relations and corporate communications good morning gabe gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst i was curious if you could elaborate a little bit pete i know it s maybe a little bit premature but just given sort of where we ve seen a lot of the more volume weakness in the rips business is it safe to assume that any sort of i guess rooftop consolidation might happen or be more u s centric and then can you comment at all in terms of what that might look like maybe on a consolidated basis maybe a cash drag or something like that and is that contemplated in your free cash flow outlook peter g watson president and chief executive officer yes so i ll make some comments on the consolidation we ve already done and what we may consider doing and then i ll let larry comment on the cash tax drag but so far in the past year we ve done seven consolidations across our global portfolio that s been predominantly around steel drum and fibre drum also a few smaller operations in paper around our caraustar acquisition but if you look at volume trajectories that we had in this year and what we project for next year we expect to grow our ibc and ibc reconditioning in our plastic drum volume and so consolidation probably is not going to happen there unless we can get rooftop efficiencies and run more volumes in a certain region out of less facilities but i think what you ve seen and what you should we would evaluate going forward is in a declining steel drum market how do we operate at a lower cost basis which means lower rooftops and you can see the same thing in north america about fibre so that s really strategically it aligns to our volume trajectory and then we ll evaluate in 2020 what our volume demand looks like and our customer requirements are and that will drive our decision making about any future rooftop consolidations i ll ask larry to comment on cash tax larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah gabe on the on the potential restructuring cash outlay we re estimating 20 million to 30 million and that is incorporated into our guidance range gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you operator next question comes from justin bergner with g research justin bergner g research analyst hi i didn t get my follow ups in first go around but thank you for taking my questions again for the rips you talked about new capacity in the ibc side allowing you deliver flat volumes what would the volume trajectory look like without that new capacity peter g watson president and chief executive officer we actually grew last quarter justin 1 5 and that is a little lower than what we ve been doing when we ve been growing high single digits and that gap in q4 was partially related to some of the weak demand in north america it also had some operating inefficiencies in two of our operations but the that market typically grows annually in low single digit growth basis on a global basis so that s a very strong vibrant business it s becoming a very good choice for our packaging and a bulk format and we expect that volume to continue to grow and that s obviously why we re continuing to invest in that business justin bergner g research analyst okay thanks my question was more around like looking into the current fiscal year fiscal year 20 you expect volumes in rips to be flat but then you mentioned the new capacity in ibc is contributing to that and i was curious if you could sort of give us a rough estimate as to how much that new capacity is contributing to get you to that flat volume exception larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah justin just to clarify the flat was steel drums so peter g watson president and chief executive officer and the new capacity in ibc s it s ramping up so you ll see more of an impact next year on that new that new volume capacity and we ve layered in capacity increases for the last three years on that so it s sequentially improve that so it s really hard to just say that you ve got two new plants we ve layered in one or two every year so over a three year or four year period they contribute in a sequential basis justin bergner g research analyst okay but does that mean then that its steel must be flat that you expect positive rips volumes overall in 2020 fiscal year larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes peter g watson president and chief executive officer yes justin bergner g research analyst okay maybe if i can one more question on the crb strategic review just help us understand maybe are there other options you re considering for that business that maybe you were initially considering when you enter the strategic review or is the delay should we read anything into the delay larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer you shouldn t read anything into the delay justin i mean it s just that we were too optimistic about how quickly we would work through the process we ended up having more interest than some of it did not come initially out of the gate came longer we re trying to assess what s the best answer for our shareholders and it s just taking a little longer but nothing different about our approach to it peter g watson president and chief executive officer yeah i wouldn t read into the timing delay because we re making good progress in the evaluation operator next question comes from steven chercover with davidson steven chercover d a davidson analyst thanks good morning everyone peter g watson president and chief executive officer good morning steve steven chercover d a davidson analyst so my first question hopefully it s fairly easy your 2020 assumption on occ is 46 and that s about 10 higher than the current levels so are you using a different reference point from southeast for your two main corrugated mills larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer we just correlated around what the industry forecast data is and talking through with our team steve and basically filtered in a 15 increase in quarter three and at the beginning of quarter three and a 25 at the beginning of quarter four steven chercover d a davidson analyst okay great and then at your analyst day in late june you outlined some 2022 financial targets and since then you reported a couple of quarters or the 2020 financial targets in line with the trajectory for the three year objectives or we don t need to know now would that change larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer see what i would say we said the same thing in investor day is that we don t anticipate the 2022 economy to be in an industrial recession like we believe we re in now so i would say the things are in line when we even announced the caraustar deal we talked about the fact that we analyzed our ability to pay down debt and those kind of things in an environment without a recession while the broad economy might not be in a recession it appears clear to us that the industrial economy is and we said that in june we still believe it today so you know it impacts things on trajectory but in terms of what we laid out in june we believe that if the economy is back to a more stable and that doesn t have to be vibrant but they re more stable economy and normal operating procedures that that we feel comfortable with those commitments obviously they re based on some underlying assumptions that are still key to that and yeah we ll revisit that probably in the june area and just try to look at things where we see it at that point but at this point there is nothing that would concern us other than just the economic malaise that we find ourselves in at the current time operator next question comes from adam josephson with keybanc capital adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst thanks for taking my follow ups i appreciate it larry just a couple more on guidance is there any more containerboard market related downtime factored into your 20 guidance or for that matter any additional containerboard price erosion or for that matter any urb price erosion just given how weak demand is and given how low occ costs are larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and as you know adam we don t comment on pricing and we don t forecast what things are going to go on in that containerboard market but we obviously look at when we re establishing a range that there is there are economic things that could play out and obviously you ve got a lot of different economists that are many saying they think we re in that proud of the industrial drop right now who knows whether they re right so when i said at the beginning we established a fairly wide range to accommodate the macro economic uncertainty that we re in and when we do that we that we contemplate all kinds of things but we don t we don t forecast economic downtime we plan to run to demand as we always do but we try to put enough range in there to accommodate those factors adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst thanks larry and just one more on the 20 guidance so i grant some numbers i think last week and i estimate about 3 5 months of caraustar plus additional synergies should have ebitda close to 100 million and i guess what you re assuming is that weakness in paper packaging particularly in containerboard and then weak continued weakness in rigid will mostly offset that call it 90 million to 100 million benefit from higher caraustar ebitda am i thinking about it roughly the right way larry a hilsheimer executive vice president and chief financial officer first of all let me comment on this the quarter that was not in our results this year is the first quarter which as we mentioned in our comments today has a little bit of a downtime annually for that business because of construction is generally slower in the winter months and so you have a little less robust and if you go back our deal assumptions we bought it based on 220 million of run rate ebitda if you divide that by four it s 55 million take it down a little bit for that seasonality and then bump it up a little bit for some of the synergies that will come and add a little bit of occ benefit you re not going to get anywhere near 100 million operator we have a question from george staphos with bank of america george staphos bank of american merril lynch analyst hi everyone thanks for taking my follow on question first just a point of clarification pete so on pricing in rips in the quarter that just passed that was largely lower input costs we understand obviously tough volume environment was there anything inordinate in terms of competitive activity that would have also contributed pricing or is it almost entirely cost pass through the second question you might have mentioned already apologies if you did can you talk about what the exit rates were in paper and containerboard and as much as what are you seeing in terms of volume right now to date not asking your forecast going forward but to date have you taken any downtime in the current quarter thank you and good luck in the quarter guys peter g watson president and chief executive officer yeah so back and i apologize i didn t answer that part of your question so the 4 price reduction in north america was really all around pass through and lower raw material costs and there is nothing from a competitive market that would be anywhere close to material to our results and in regard to november we took no containerboard downtime in november for our paper packaging business george staphos bank of american merril lynch analyst thank you very much peter g watson president and chief executive officer yeah thank you george operator and at this time i will turn the call over to mr eichmann matt eichmann vice president investor relations and corporate communications well thank you very much sharon we appreciate everyone s time this morning and we hope that you have a good holiday season ahead thank you operator duration 45 minutes call participants matt eichmann vice president investor relations

data source yale program on climate change communication center for climate change communication at george mason university it wasn t over of course it was hidden behind a smoke screen of outsourcing to private profit making contractors further attenuating the connection between the taxes people pay and the services they get a cornell university study in 2012 the midst of democrat barack obama s presidency found that 40 percent of americans on medicare 53 percent of those with student loans and 25 percent receiving food stamps believed that they did not receive any government benefits democrats eyes roll as they mock the man who famously shouted at his democratic senator keep your government s hands off my medicare typically left out of the story is that the senator responded that he certainly would most americans recognize that global warming is a problem but despite the roughly 40 years of scientific research grown to a virtual consensus forecasts of catastrophic change that will wreck their own lives strike some skeptics as just that forecasts by experts who cannot predict tomorrow s weather with 100 percent accuracy those old enough might also remember the near consensus of 1970s experts that the world was running out of oil for most of us who cannot by ourselves evaluate the science it is a matter of weighing probabilities so far given the natural inclination of humans to discount the future asking americans who live paycheck to paycheck to make major changes in their lives today in order to reduce the risk that the maldives or even miami beach will be underwater by 2050 has not been an easy sell a majority say they are willing to see their taxes raised by a dollar or two but not much more indeed the green new deal itself is in part a way of getting around the resistance to high carbon taxes by promising that public investments and regulation can do better with less apparent costs to voters pocketbooks you campaign in poetry you govern in prose famously said the late mario cuomo the campaign for the green new deal correctly understands that it needs both the stark prose of doomsday science and the poetic vision of building a better world government s leadership in molding the future is firmly in our democracy s 200 year economic development tradition which includes visionary infrastructure projects subsidies for critical technologies and land grants to settle the west more recently before reagan pushed his party down the right wing rathole republican dwight eisenhower launched big long term investments in higher education low income housing and transportation and promoted a national goals commission the environmental protection agency was established and the clean air act made law under republican richard nixon in the late 1970s coalitions from business labor and the congress proposed industrial policies to arrest the slide in america s international competitiveness a forerunner of the green new deal s call for making the u s a leader in alternative fuel technologies the ocasio cortez markey green new deal resolution calls for a national social industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since world war ii but the green new deal is an even tougher test of our democracy s capacity for collective action like all wars world war ii required the blood sacrifice of those who fought but for most americans who had been mired in ten years of economic depression the war brought prosperity nor did fdr s case for the new deal ask the people to accept less of the american dream of material abundance he promised more creating distrust in government was a bipartisan project begun by ronald reagan and furthered by wall street democrats like bill clinton who declared the era of big government is over when today s voters ask where the green new deal will take them the answer is not so clear some advocates assure them life would be pretty much the same but with more electric cars solar panels and windmills others insist that it will require a radical change in lifestyles and values but what that means remains murky naomi klein whose book on fire the burning case for a green new deal is a popular text for the movement tells us we need a radical change in where we live where we go and what we eat not to worry she assures us this will require sacrifices only for shareholders of polluting corporations and the wealthiest 10 20 percent of humanity she glosses over the reality that in a world of almost eight billion humans the richest 20 percent certainly includes almost all americans green economists have credibly made the case that a sustainable energy future could create new jobs and opportunities but the typical voter will want to know what is the plan for me when on friday i lose my job that is directly or indirectly dependent on our current wasteful system will i have a better paying green one on monday expand jason schneider we are racing time so the green new deal needs to become operational fast speed is also necessary to establish credibility that democratic government and national planning can deliver it should therefore be front loaded with easy to understand projects that deliver tangible benefits in the form of jobs and services such as retrofitting homes improving mass transit and building smart energy grids it should also end counterproductive costly programs such as the federal insurance subsidies for people who keep rebuilding their homes in flood prone coastal areas investments in new technology take time to produce results so they also have to be started early and they have to be big enough to spread the risks and transparent enough to avoid charges of cronyism done properly a green new deal can operate cumulatively to rebuild the trust in government on which it depends the good news is that the ideological space is opening as economic stress has spread into the middle class the reagan clinton deification of the free market certainly has lost credibility particularly among the young who are no longer spooked by the word socialism large majorities favor government guaranteed access to health care and more federal investment in education and infrastructure and regulation of guns moreover according to a september pew poll 64 percent of americans agree that distrust of government makes it harder to solve the country s problems and 84 percent think it s possible to reverse it like the original new deal the green one is primarily a project of the democratic party so there is no way forward unless democrats stop dancing around the need for big government for fear of being charged with being big spenders the republican claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility has been a sham since the reagan years the shameless tax giveaways by nominally conservative republicans should finally embolden democrats to pursue fiscal policies that strengthen the country and not the country club but the country is more than the democratic base acceptance of a federal civilian government with increased power will not float on rhetorical crosscurrents of identity politics that divide rather than unite certainly social justice and equity needs to be built into the design of a post carbon society the poor and disadvantaged who will be most affected by global warming need special help but they themselves may not be all that enthusiastic about transition even if it is labeled as just because they have less ability to sacrifice short term financial security for long term goals moreover when the dominoes fall from the dismantling of carbon contaminating industries which go far beyond coal and oil the number and types of people who feel unjustly treated will surely rise three years into donald trump s vile kleptocracy this might seem like the worst of times to make the case for policies that depend on honest capable government on the other hand the trump scandals and outrages have helped create the conditions for much stronger campaign finance and conflict of interest laws which are absolutely essential to rebuilding the credibility of the public sector moreover the willingness of some medium rank deep state officials to risk blowing the whistle on trump has demonstrated the value of smart dedicated bureaucrats the green new deal will not make its public servants rich so the rewards will come from the respect of the country for the job they do one of john kennedy s first goals as president was to make the government s treatment of its workers a model for the private sector in a famous episode he publicly celebrated frances kelsey a mid level analyst with the food and drug administration who resisted enormous pressure from the pharmaceutical industry to approve the drug thalidomide which turned out to cause deformed babies the typical voter will want to know what is the plan for me when on friday i lose my job that is dependent on our current system will i have a better paying green one on monday still however dedicated and smart a new generation of green public servants may be the prospect that a major redirection of voters lives will be guided by the experts in washington or silicon valley is unnerving after all the best and the brightest kennedy brought into the government eventually gave us the vietnam war we should also remember that world war ii like all wars brought with it the curtailment of civil liberties so as the debate over the green new deal widens so will the question of whether we can mobilize for climate change without further undercutting our already fragile democracy and even strengthen it one answer might lie in returning to the models of democratic planning that were evolving until they were aborted by reagan s right wing revolution the politics of the 1960s helped establish the right of ordinary citizens to participate in public decisions that were previously made behind closed doors later the nixon administration made many federal transfers to state and local government contingent upon long term locally approved plans the process took another step forward in the mid 1970s in part inspired by the bicentennial of the american revolution citizens and officials all over the country held public dialogues over their collective future many produced specific plans visions of what california or maine or atlanta could be like in the year 2000 some addressed the questions of energy use and environmental sustainability others land use planning some the more difficult questions of race and gender relations but all that stopped dead with the election of 1980 what was the point of a collective plan for the future in an era of radical individualism as reagan s ideological partner margaret thatcher famously lectured the anglo american world there is no such thing as society the conservative conceit is that progress cannot be made by government only by individuals voluntarily cooperating in their own self interest which often turns out to create a vacuum filled by corporations but as the pew poll also reports the decline in trust in government has been associated with a low level of individuals trust in each other underneath the distrust of democratic government is a distrust of democracy eventually climate change bringing floods fires dislocated migrants and the need for unprecedented global cooperation will force more power into the hands of central government if history is any guide the dangers of authoritarianism are real polls over the last several years report that 25 to 30 percent of americans say they would support a military coup the persistent 35 to 40 percent who remain in trump s camp no matter what tells us that fascist sentiment is now closer to the surface of our politics than many of us had thought like the green new deal the restoration of our citizens faith in our democracy and themselves as citizens is a project full of unknowns but it is essential designing ways for national climate change strategies to be informed by local priorities rather than by a tussle between conservative corporate lobbyists and elite liberal experts would be a start assuring citizens that they will be dealt into planning for the goals of the green new deal may be the last chance to salvage both our planet and our democracy

china s collapse has only begun for years we ve been hearing about and reading stories on the coming dominance of the chinese economy the story line is that china is growing faster than the u s has a much larger population and a growing military capability and that it is just a matter of time before china surpassed the u s as the hegemonic power in east asia and the western pacific there is certainly some merit in these arguments china has the largest population in the world about 1 4 billion people although it is soon to be overtaken by india china has the third largest territory in the world 3 7 million square miles that s just slightly larger than the united states 3 6 million square miles and only slightly behind canada 3 8 million square miles china also has the fifth largest nuclear arsenal in the world with 280 nuclear warheads about the same as the uk and france but well behind russia 6 490 and the u s 6 450 china has the second largest economy in the world at 15 5 trillion in gdp behind the u s with 21 4 trillion and well ahead of number three japan with 5 4 trillion china s foreign exchange reserves including gold are the largest in the world at 3 2 trillion hong kong separately has 425 billion in additional reserves and china is the largest gold producer in the world at about 500 metric tonnes per year by these diverse measures of population territory military strength and economic output china is clearly a global super power and the dominant presence in east asia in its most extreme form the story line about china s inevitable ascent says the 1800s were the british century the 1900s were the american century and the 2000s would turn out to be the chinese century this narrative was proposed by the same globalist elites from the universities and think tanks many of whom are americans who proposed open borders zero tariffs global supply chains and outsourcing of u s jobs but as usual the elites are wrong on all counts open borders put downward pressure on u s wages zero tariffs meant goods could be made in cheap labor countries like china and shipped to the u s duty free outsourcing destroyed perfectly viable u s operations in steel autos and electronics and moved those jobs to sweatshops and prison labor camps in china the result was a declining u s economy and greater income inequality finally the u s is fighting back trump s tariffs have slowed export led growth in china and expanded u s manufacturing more importantly china s growth is slowing for internal reasons that are not entirely related to the trade wars china has grown with investment but most of that investment has been wasted on empty ghost cities and other white elephant infrastructure that cannot pay its way china is weighed down with trillions of dollars in dollar debt that it cannot easily repay without depleting its dollar reserves china s banking system is insolvent and much of its real estate investment has been financed with wealth management products that cannot be paid back because the financing is little more than a gigantic ponzi scheme china s per capita income is only 11 000 per person compared to per capita income of 65 000 in the united states put differently the u s is only 38 richer than china on a gross basis but it is 500 richer than china on a per capita basis most importantly at 11 000 per capita gdp china is stuck squarely in the middle income trap as defined by development economists the path from low income about 5 000 per capita to middle income about 10 000 per capita is fairly straightforward and mostly involves reduced corruption direct foreign investment and migration from the countryside to cities to pursue assembly style jobs the path from middle income to high income about 20 000 per capita is much more difficult and involves creation and deployment of high technology and manufacture of high value added goods among developing economies excluding oil producers only taiwan hong kong singapore and south korea have successfully made this transition since world war ii all other developing economies in latin america africa south asia and the middle east including giants such as brazil and turkey remain stuck in the middle income ranks china remains reliant on assembly style jobs and has shown no promise of breaking into the high income ranks in short and despite enormous annual growth in the past twenty years china remains fundamentally a poor country with limited ability to improve the well being of its citizens much beyond what has already been achieved and trade wars with the u s are escalating not diminishing trump s recent decision to delay many of the 10 tariffs on the remaining 300 billion of chinese imports not currently tariffed will help china to some extent but china s initial shock devaluation of the yuan below 7 00 to one dollar a level that had previously been defended by the people s bank of china shows just how badly china is losing the trade war it is also counterproductive because it will incite more capital outflows from china the chinese lost 1 trillion of hard currency reserves during the last round of capital flight 2014 2016 and will lose more now despite tighter capital controls the spike of bitcoin to 11 000 following the china devaluation was a symptom of chinese people using bitcoin to avoid capital controls and get their money out of china it s at 10 693 80 today the unrest in hong kong is another symptom of the weakening grip of the chinese communist party on civil society the unrest spread from street demonstrations to a general strike and shutdown of the transportation system including the cancellations of hundreds of flights this social unrest will grow until china is forced to invade hong kong with 30 000 peoples liberation army troops now massed on the border this will be the last nail in the coffin of the academic view of china as a good global citizen that view was always false but now even the academics are starting to understand what s really going on there s even speculation that the hong kong protests are being organized with outside help to goad china into another tiananmen type crackdown that would isolate china internationally and derail its plans for a chinese led economic integration of eurasia and beyond through its silk roads project international business is already moving quickly to move supply chains from china to vietnam and elsewhere in south asia once those supply chains move they will not come back to china for at least ten years if ever these are permanent losses for the chinese economy with slower growth declining reserves and massive debt the stresses in china s economy are now apparent to all despite upbeat talk from beijing the collapse in china will accelerate and result in capital controls asset freezes and political repression of social disorder this collapse is just getting started and has far to run regards jim rickards for the daily reckoning

the green new deal refers to two distinct ideas the narrower idea which i discuss here is a strategy to decarbonize the u s energy system in line with the paris agreement the broader urgent idea is an integrated program including renewable energy infrastructure health care education and jobs contrary to some commentaries decarbonization will not require a grand mobilization of the u s economy on par with world war ii the incremental costs of decarbonization above our normal energy costs will amount to 1 to 2 percent of u s gdp per year during the period to 2050 by contrast during world war ii federal outlays soared to 43 percent of gdp from the prewar level of 10 percent of gdp in 1940 the key today is to redirect outlays now spent on fossil fuel based technologies toward zero carbon technologies instead that redirection will require a serious increase in federal and state public infrastructure spending but most importantly will depend on new federal and state regulations to redirect the energy related spending carbon pricing such as a carbon tax will be one useful tool for redirecting the spending but will be of less importance than regulations limiting global temperature rise the core goal of the paris agreement is to strengthen the global response to climate change by holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 c above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change article 2 section 1a the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc followed the paris agreement with a crucial study 2018 highlighting the very grave risks of exceeding the 1 5 degree celsius limit there are three kinds of dire risks first the global damages from 2 degrees of warming would be significantly higher than from 1 5 degrees second even 1 5 degrees may well be above the threshold for major irreversibilities such as a multi meter rise in the sea level caused by the partial disintegration of the antarctic and greenland ice sheets third increases in temperature above 1 5 degrees threaten to unleash powerful positive feedbacks that could lead to a spiraling of further warming such as the massive release of co2 and methane from the melting permafrost a superb comprehensive scientific overview of several of these issues was written by james hansen and co authors see here for an up to date account of possible large scale positive feedback effects that could dramatically amplify climate change indeed the long term risks of even a 1 5 degree warming sustained over decades or centuries are so high that we must be more ambitious than merely stabilizing at 1 5 degrees hansen cogently argues that we should return co2 concentrations to levels consistent with long term warming of just 1 degree celsius that means that after reaching a peak co2 concentration of perhaps 450 ppm parts per million or less at mid century we should enter a sustained phase of global net negative co2 emissions so that co2 concentrations gradually return to 350 ppm over the long term or ideally even sooner besides phasing out carbon emissions this goal can be accomplished through two kinds of carbon storage geological storage capturing co2 in the air and pumping it into geologic reservoirs and biological storage afforestation reforestation and restoration of degraded lands all capturing co2 in vegetative cover and soils to stay below 1 5 degrees of warming all regions of the world should reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the very latest the u s currently represents around 15 percent of global co2 emissions and that share will decline in the coming years therefore decarbonization of the u s energy system must be complemented by decisive actions abroad but the u s needs to lead the green new deal should include a pillar for u s diplomacy and international economic policy designed to speed actions abroad not only in the united states at a minimum the u s must remain a leader of the paris agreement five technological pillars of decarbonization expand jason schneider hundreds of scholarly and policy studies have reached a broad consensus on the technology pathway to decarbonization the consensus points to five pillars of decarbonization the first and most important single pillar is zero carbon electricity this is the most important measure since zero carbon electricity can be deployed directly in battery electric vehicles for example and indirectly in green chemistry to manufacture zero carbon fuels hydrogen for example zero carbon electricity involves a shift toward zero carbon primary energy sources and a very significant overall expansion of electricity production for the electrification of transport buildings and industry zero carbon electricity worldwide will tap multiple primary energy sources including renewables broadly defined to include wind solar hydro geothermal ocean and tidal nuclear biofuels and carbon capture and storage of fossil fuel generated electricity recent global studies have emphasized the core role of renewables in zero carbon electricity this is because the costs of renewable energy have plummeted especially solar photovoltaics while nonrenewable energy sources nuclear biofuels and carbon capture each pose major technical and social obstacles leading to public opposition nuclear power of course raises massive concerns over nuclear accidents and nuclear wastes see the companion article by alexander sammon biofuel raises great concerns about ecosystem degradation and competition with food supplies carbon capture raises massive opposition over technological doubts e g leakage of co2 land use obstacles e g pipelines to carry the co2 and high costs the second pillar of decarbonization is the electrification of end uses there are many sectors currently using fossil fuel energy that can be converted to direct use of green electricity these include battery electric vehicles bevs heat pumps for residential and commercial buildings electric cooking e g induction and microwave stoves and direct reduction of ores in metallurgy these pathways of electrification seem more likely today than just a few years ago major automakers are now making significant commitments to electric vehicles for example with dates set for the phaseout of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles the third pillar is green synthetic fuels for economic sectors not easily electrified in aviation transport there is continuing debate about the feasibility of electrification it seems increasingly likely that electrification will cover short haul flights e g under one hour but that longer haul flights will continue to require liquid fuels of high energy density these synthetic fuels can be manufactured using green electricity see the companion article by mara prentiss the fourth pillar is a smart power grid built on big data artificial intelligence and the internet of things the idea of a smart grid is a self regulating system that can shift among multiple sources of power generation and multiple uses to provide reliable and low cost systems operations despite the variability of renewable energy on the supply side a smart grid will integrate variable renewable energy from many sources in order to smooth the variability of power generation a larger connected grid covering more geography and more sources of variable renewable energy will reduce variation of power various storage options including batteries pumped hydro compressed air and conversion of renewable energy into synthetic fuels will help to stabilize the supply side the demand side will also show flexibility by enabling smart meters to turn on and off electricity consumption of users depending on temporal needs urgency and shifts in market prices that reflect supply demand conditions the fifth pillar is energy and materials efficiency to economize on the use of primary energy and on the plastics metals cement and other industrial materials that emit co2 in their production and use improved materials and material flows popularly known as reduce reuse and recycle or circular economy can significantly improve energy and materials efficiency reduce the process emissions of co2 such as in the manufacture of clinker for cement and slash energy inputs needed for industrial processes easier and harder sectors decarbonization of electric power will be relatively straightforward though there remain important challenges to managing power grids that are fully dependent on renewable energy low carbon power sources such as photovoltaics and wind have already come down dramatically in cost so that their levelized costs that is their long term costs including the costs of capital investments are already competitive with fossil fuels the biggest operational challenges arise from the intermittency of the renewables and their limited dispatchability the relative inability of renewable energy sources to ramp up and down quickly in response to market needs there are two complementary solutions to intermittency one is power storage for example in grid scale batteries synthetic fuels e g hydrogen and systems such as pumped hydro in which excess renewable energy is used to pump water into an uphill reservoir for later use in hydroelectric power generation the other solution is geographical diversification of renewable energy sources through a large interconnected grid a more extended grid reduces the variability of power generation relative to the average load and therefore reduces the need for energy storage as a percentage of the average load as for dispatchability storage solutions such as pumped hydro and synthetic fuels e g hydrogen offer the necessary dispatchability we need to enter a sustained phase of global net negative co2 emissions so that these concentrations gradually return to 350 ppm over the long term some downstream users of fossil fuels will be easily electrified while others will be difficult or impossible to electrify light duty vehicles and urban delivery vans for example will almost certainly shift soon from internal combustion engines to zero emission battery electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the hydrogen will have to be produced in a zero emission manner such as by hydrolysis using renewable energy or by fossil fuels combined with carbon capture and storage other transport modes long distance trucking ocean shipping and aviation are hard sectors in that electrification is much less straightforward or out of reach onboard batteries are heavy and take up considerable volume needed for freight other solutions such as synthetic green fuels or biofuels for aviation hydrogen fuel cells for ocean shipping and catenary lines for electric trucks along major highway routes will be necessary the recent report by the energy transitions commission mission possible reaching net zero carbon emissions from harder to abate sectors by mid century and the feem sdsn report roadmap to 2050 power industry transport and buildings discuss the technology possibilities for the harder sectors most new buildings will be relatively easy to electrify using electric heat pumps and overall improvements in insulation and ventilation older buildings that currently rely on fossil fuel heating will have to be retrofitted for electric heat pumps retrofitting will require a long national effort and will be moderately expensive major challenges remain in decarbonizing certain industrial sectors including metallurgy petrochemicals cement and some other heavy industries that intensively use fossil fuels for process heating and feedstocks there will be no one size fits all strategy certain kinds of process heating can be electrified others not at least currently certain feedstocks can be replaced by non carbon emitting materials others not at least currently a timeline for decarbonization the essence of decarbonization is the replacement of today s fossil fuel using capital stock with a new zero carbon capital stock coal fired power plants need to be phased out and replaced by renewable energy power generation internal combustion engine vehicles need to be phased out and replaced by electric vehicles boilers and furnaces in buildings need to be phased out and replaced by electric heat pumps and so forth the least cost solution in each case is to retire the existing capital at the end of its normal life and replace it with zero carbon capital cars and trucks last 15 to 20 years power plants 30 to 50 years buildings 50 to 100 years and so forth this means that with the natural life span of vehicles we would require 15 to 20 years from the first date at which all new vehicles brought to the market are zero emission vehicles the alternative strategy which is more costly is to scrap the existing capital stock early for example by removing even new internal combustion engine vehicles from the road of course if we factor in the costs of the worsening climate the cost benefit calculus changes expand gerry broome ap images installing a smart meter in raleigh north carolina consider for example the challenge of decarbonizing the u s fleet of some 200 million light duty vehicles suppose as an illustration that cars last for 20 years and that ten million vehicles are currently retired each year and replaced with ten million newly produced vehicles the industry s production capacity is geared to ten million sales per year in order to shift the u s automobile fleet to electric vehicles the industry must be retooled let us stipulate for purposes of illustration that converting the u s automotive industry to the production of ten million bevs per year will require a decade providing the time not only to retool existing production lines and to design the new vehicles but also the time to build new supply chains for batteries and other components as of 2030 all new u s vehicle production and sales will be electric between 2030 and 2050 the entire fleet of 200 million internal combustion vehicles will be phased out and replaced by electric ones could this happen instead by 2040 that would require replacing 200 million vehicles during a ten year period 2030 to 2040 annual production and sales of electric vehicles in the 2030s would have to average 20 million vehicles twice the current industrial capacity yet after 2040 production and sales would fall for many years because of the young age of the bev fleet the production boom would be replaced by a bust in the long run production would revert to ten million per year on average moreover the early conversion of the fleet would only reduce emissions to the extent that the u s power system also had been decarbonized and expanded by 2040 to accommodate the 200 million electric vehicles perhaps the early replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040 could be accomplished but the extraordinary costs of the early scrappage of existing vehicles the massive rise in overall vehicle production to 20 million per year during the 2030s and the subsequent closure of industrial capacity after 2040 would effectively require the nationalization of the automobile industry and the emissions from the temporary boom of automobile production could easily overwhelm any emissions reductions achieved by the early scrappage of the internal combustion engine fleet this simple parable is meant to illustrate a point we will need until 2050 to achieve full decarbonization even then we will be incurring many extraordinary costs to meet the mid century target including the early closure of hundreds or even thousands of fossil fuel based power plants yes we should have started decarbonization in earnest in the 1990s by adopting the kyoto protocol instead it was spurned by the u s senate so here we are in 2020 with far too little time left for climate safety yet we must proceed zero carbon power generation can probably be achieved nationwide by 2040 to 2045 new york state has set 2040 and california has set 2045 as respective target dates given the older ages of most existing coal fired power and many gas fired plants such a timeline would permit the natural retirement of most carbon based power generation with only a modest need for early closures market forces will also lead to some early closures as the capital inclusive costs of new renewable power generation decline below the marginal operating costs of some existing thermal plants the conversion of the automobile and trucking fleet will require most of the period to 2050 we should anticipate and regulate that as of 2030 all new sales of light duty vehicles will be zero emission vehicles mostly battery electric vehicles new buildings could become all electric within the next few years since the technologies to build all electric heating and cooking systems are already at hand the retrofitting of existing buildings however will take far more time almost surely to 2050 the incremental costs of decarbonization the best current estimates put the incremental cost of decarbonization at around 1 percent of gdp each year or perhaps even less decarbonization will neither break the budget nor massively spur the economy by itself but yes it can save the planet from environmental ruin the extra costs incurred to shift from fossil fuels to zero carbon energy include the incremental costs of providing electricity with renewables rather than fossil fuels of shifting to zero emission vehicles of buildings using green electricity for heating ventilation and cooking rather than fossil fuels and the incremental costs of decarbonizing several hard sectors including aviation ocean shipping steelmaking cement and petrochemicals smart meters turn electricity consumption on and off depending on the needs of users and shifts in market prices that reflect supply and demand conditions the incremental costs also include all the complementary infrastructure needed to operate a zero carbon energy system for example the u s will need additional grid transmission to connect high quality renewable energy southwest solar energy midwest wind energy canadian hydropower and offshore wind energy with final users new charging stations across the nation will be needed for electric vehicles new catenary lines overhead electric lines may be added to interstate highway lanes for electric trucks extensive new investments in 5g capacity will be needed to manage smart grids and so forth several recent studies have nonetheless concluded that the overhaul of the energy system will not be large relative to the economy my columbia colleague geoffrey heal provided an especially insightful estimate of transition costs showing that renewable energy plus storage can cut u s emissions by 80 percent by 2050 for less than 1 percent of gdp per year another colleague jim williams of the university of san francisco has similarly calculated that an 80 percent reduction of u s emissions by 2050 could be accomplished for around 0 8 percent of gdp per year a recent study on global decarbonization by 2050 led by christian breyer at lappeenranta university of technology in finland concludes that the levelized costs of a 100 percent renewable energy system in 2050 will be less than the costs today 52 euro mwh compared with 70 euro mwh today and a 2015 study by alexander macdonald and co authors found that co2 emissions from the u s electricity sector can be reduced by 80 percent relative to 1990 levels without any increase in the levelized cost of electricity moreover the transition to renewable energy will create many more jobs than will be lost in the closure of the fossil fuel sector see the companion article by harold meyerson a major ongoing study by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel reportedly finds that a u s super grid connecting high quality renewable energy resources with major population centers would cost around 80 billion in total a mere 0 4 percent of gdp as a one time investment and would deliver economic benefits of at least twice that sum there are fears that the nrel findings are being suppressed or delayed by the trump administration i should underscore that most of the studies to date examine the incremental costs of 80 percent decarbonization rather than 100 percent decarbonization it is likely true that the marginal costs of decarbonization will rise as we approach 100 percent as one example jessika trancik s team at mit has determined that the storage costs to back up 95 percent of an all renewable power system would be roughly half of the costs to back up 100 percent of the system since 100 percent backup requires vastly more storage to protect against an extremely rare shortfall of intermittent energy in summary the gist of recent studies is that decarbonization is not hugely expensive as a proportion of the total economy the estimates suggest that 80 percent decarbonization can be reached at a cost of 1 percent of gdp or less per year complete decarbonization by 2050 could perhaps cost up to 2 percent of gdp per year taking into account the higher marginal costs of decarbonizing the harder sectors but could in fact end up being much less costly than 2 percent of gdp and even below 1 percent of gdp would it be worth the extra costs to accelerate u s decarbonization to 2040 rather than 2050 assuming that it would be technically feasible the answer is no u s co2 emissions from energy in 2020 will be around 5 3 billion tons if we compare a linear ramp down to zero by 2050 and a faster linear ramp down by 2040 the faster ramp down would reduce u s cumulative emissions of co2 by around 27 billion tons that in turn would reduce the atmospheric concentration of co2 by around 1 8 ppm with reduced global warming on the order of 0 01 degrees as of 2100 in other words negligible the short term effect on temperature would be even less and we must remember that an accelerated decarbonization might not actually cut cumulative emissions as assumed by a steeper linear ramp down because of the larger buildup of new industrial capacity e g electric vehicle production needed in the accelerated transition even if the entire world were somehow to decarbonize on a linear ramp down by 2040 rather than 2050 the reduction of global warming as of 2100 would be on the order of 0 1 degrees with a smaller short term effect yes such a reduction in warming would definitely be beneficial each 0 1 degree warming hurts yet the practical time needed to phase out the world s existing fossil fuel capital stock build massive new infrastructure retool major global industries such as automotive production and solve countless technological challenges all while attending to the urgent sustainable development needs of the more than six billion people in developing countries argues overwhelmingly for a timeline to 2050 rather than 2040 decarbonizing globally by 2050 will itself be a near miracle one that requires a global breakthrough in politics and policies starting imminently and carried forward for decades a national policy framework for decarbonization the national policy framework for decarbonization should aim at three overriding objectives 1 the end of u s energy based emissions of co2 by 2050 2 a low cost pathway for the transition and 3 a fair transition to address vulnerable groups and regions including workers in fossil fuel related sectors who will lose their jobs in the transition regions currently dependent on fossil fuel production and low income households the green new deal should involve all levels of government including state and local rather than put all responsibility at the federal level an effective plan should involve distinct strategies for each of the four major energy sectors power generation transport buildings and industry with special attention paid to key subsectors such as light duty vehicles intercity trucking aviation and ocean shipping the plan should distinguish between the easy and hard sectors including r d for the hard sectors the plan should address several dimensions of public policy including timelines for phasing out fossil fuel related capital stocks allocations of responsibilities among federal state and local governments carbon pricing including carbon taxes feed in tariffs and renewable energy auctions r d outlays for the hard technologies public investments in interstate transmission charging stations catenary lines government fleets and buildings and other public infrastructure financing for a fair transition job retraining income supplements regional development public financing for building retrofits u s international leadership within the paris agreement there are two heatedly debated questions that dominate the policy debate the first is over the use of carbon pricing especially carbon taxation the second involves the allocation of responsibilities across levels of government carbon regulation and pricing there are two basic policy approaches to pollution control that also apply to decarbonization 1 quantity regulation and 2 corrective pricing under quantity regulation the government sets quantitative limits on pollution either in absolute amounts or per unit of output and timelines to abide by the limits under corrective pricing the government taxes the pollutant and or subsidizes the green alternatives in the case of decarbonization both quantity regulation and corrective pricing will be needed but the relative balance between the two should vary according to the sector of the economy quantity regulation is the preferred option when the technological alternatives are well known easy to monitor and already cost effective corrective pricing makes sense when the alternatives are uncertain difficult to monitor and with highly varying cost effectiveness depending on the context in those cases a corrective price e g a tax on the pollutant allows markets to search for low cost solutions and promote innovations the most important international pollution abatement to date has been the highly successful global phaseout of ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons cfcs this phaseout was governed by the 1987 montreal protocol and subsequent amendments in this case the pollutant cfcs had a known and cost effective alternative the hydrofluorocarbons hfcs the montreal protocol thereby relied on quantity regulation all signatory governments to the montreal protocol agreed to timelines for the phaseout of cfcs the u s also deployed a bit of corrective pricing mainly in the form of import levies to block the importation of cfcs while u s production of cfcs was being curtailed another notable success story of quantity regulation is the removal of lead from gasoline a process mandated by federal law rather than carried out by corrective pricing expand john minchillo ap images a capacitor bank at an electrical transmission substation in westerville ohio a smart grid can shift among multiple sources of power generation to provide reliable electricity despite the variability of renewable energy in the case of decarbonization quantity regulation has been used for power plants both at the federal level such as president barack obama s clean power plan to phase out coal fired power plants and at the state level for example in state renewable portfolio standards that require utilities within the state to phase out fossil fuel based power generation on a timeline quantity regulations have also been used to raise the fuel efficiency of the u s vehicle fleet under corporate average fuel economy cafe standards corrective pricing by contrast has also been used in a variety of ways to induce profit oriented utilities to choose zero carbon power solutions these include tradable emissions permits where the market price of the permit creates the incentive to shift technologies feed in tariffs whereby utilities are given a bonus per unit of low cost energy and reverse auctions for the supply of zero carbon power the low bidder wins the supply contract no state has yet adopted a carbon tax but it is under consideration in several states i would suggest that quantity regulations for decarbonization will be most effective for four sectors power generation light duty vehicles heavy duty vehicles and buildings for these sectors the federal government should implement a timeline for phasing out the fossil fuel based capital stock for example the federal government might mandate that all new power generation capacity in the u s should be zero carbon after a certain date say 2022 and that remaining fossil fuel based power generation should be phased out by a certain date say 2040 similarly the federal government should mandate that all new light duty vehicles sold from 2030 onward must be zero emission vehicles and that internal combustion light duty vehicles must be phased out no later than 2050 a somewhat extended timeline might be given for trucks e g all new trucks must be zero emitting as of 2035 for buildings a federal building code for new construction might mandate zero emission buildings electric heating ventilation cooking from 2030 onward and retrofits on existing buildings by 2050 such quantity regulations can be supplemented by a gradually rising carbon tax that will accelerate the transition process and ensure the retirement of old carbon emitting capital corrective pricing makes more sense as a primary instrument for sectors in which the best alternative technologies and incremental costs are still highly uncertain thus we should consider a gradually rising carbon tax on aviation ocean shipping steelmaking cement and petrochemicals since the capital stock in these sectors rolls over gradually the carbon pricing should be introduced with enough lead time to enable companies to make changes in planned future investments thus the carbon tax on aviation ocean shipping and other sectors might be introduced into law but begin only as of 2025 or 2030 this will avoid an arbitrary rise in taxes on current capital but will incentivize firms and industrial sectors to replace that capital in the future the green new deal should avoid the social eruptions that have recently hit france chile and elsewhere where governments introduced a new levy on transport that essentially taxed the existing capital e g automobile use often in a regressive manner without any real opportunity for those hit by the levies to change their behavior in the short term carbon taxes should be phased in gradually and focus on future decisions rather than tax existing carbon using capital that only serves to redistribute income regressively without affecting short term emissions to any significant extent see the companion article by james boyce federal state and local responsibilities the regulation of the u s energy system is shared among the federal state and local governments the green new deal should tap into this intergovernmental structure rather than put all responsibility at the federal level bypassing the states would create huge inefficiencies political backlashes and serious obstacles for ongoing state level regulation of the utilities the federal government should lead on nine dimensions of the green new deal federal timeline and standards for electric utility decarbonization federal timeline and standards for zero emission vehicles federal standards for electrification of buildings federal financing for building retrofits e g as grants to states federal infrastructure including an expanded interstate energy grid interstate highway charging stations interstate highway catenary lines for trucking federal zero emission fleets and buildings federal r d program including energy storage technologies smart grid aviation ocean shipping smart transport systems etc federal green bank for utility sector financing fair transition programs for vulnerable individuals and regions u s leadership under the paris agreement state renewable portfolio standards even with a federal mandate on all utilities to decarbonize by 2050 the states will still have responsibilities for regulating the power utilities within each state including the licensing of sites the regulation of transmission and distribution lines system safety and reliability environmental protections and of course electricity pricing each state should be directed to adopt and implement a renewable portfolio standard rps program that is consistent with the federal mandate to decarbonize by 2050 to defeat big oil advocates need a specific plan that demonstrates how renewable energy alternatives will benefit every part of the country the lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl reports that 29 states have rps requirements to raise the share of renewable energy in overall retail sales some non rps states such as indiana north dakota and wyoming have also increased their renewable energy capacity to serve rps demands in nearby states the 29 rps programs cover 56 percent of total u s retail electricity sales three states have recently set dates for 100 percent zero carbon power in their rps california 2045 new mexico 2045 and new york 2040 in total ten states plus the district of columbia and puerto rico have set zero by 2050 targets into law or executive order california 2045 hawaii 2045 maine 2050 minnesota 2050 nevada 2050 new jersey 2050 new mexico 2045 new york 2040 washington 2045 and wisconsin 2050 the rps requirements provide a very important institutional mechanism for implementing federal zero emission power standards rps programs to date have mandated 45 percent of the increased delivery of renewable power generation since 2000 in 2018 37 percent of solar capacity additions and 19 percent of wind additions were to meet rps requirements some of these renewable energy investments would have happened without rps but rps surely played a significant role not only in directing the utilities toward zero carbon energy but supporting them to do so in an efficient manner consistent with overall objectives of power plant siting low costs to consumers system reliability and other objectives at the same time the current power crisis of california s pg e points to the reality of significant underinvestments in systems infrastructure when private sector utilities pursue short term profits at the expense of long term standards financing decarbonization there are two basic ways to finance the energy transition the first is through market transactions the government mandates zero carbon technology and private sector producers invest and sell goods and services to the public for example utilities are required to invest in renewables and they recoup their costs by their sales to households and businesses automobile producers are mandated to sell zero emission vehicles and they recoup their costs through vehicle sales in this case the direct role of government financing is very limited the second is through direct government provision of zero carbon energy in this case the federal or state governments would directly own and operate power generation facilities and transmission and distribution grids they would recoup some or all of their costs through market sales by public enterprises or alternatively finance their operations through general government revenues there will be a mix of the two outlays for certain public infrastructure will require government financing for example the expansion of the interstate transmission grid for renewable energy as a natural monopoly the expanded transmission grid would be unsuitable for private ownership another case will be the federal outlays for a fair energy transition which by design will not recoup a flow of earnings federal support for building retrofits will also likely be grants rather than loans most of the transition costs therefore will be borne not by the federal and state governments but by energy users household and commercial buyers of electricity car owners and others since the zero emission technologies are already close to the costs of fossil fuel based technologies there is no reason to anticipate any major hardships on energy users as noted earlier the total national costs might come to around 1 to 2 percent of national income per year roughly 200 to 400 billion with most of that borne by the private sector there are of course many technological uncertainties and the total costs could end up higher or lower indeed as the costs of clean energy continue to fall and as conservation measures improve improved building insulation more efficient appliances many users could experience net savings on energy bills total federal outlays could reach up to 400 billion per year or roughly 2 percent of gdp if we factor in the total costs of new infrastructure spending on roads fast rail protected coasts and waterways restored bridges expanded transmission grids and other infrastructure that is needed in any event given the decrepit state of u s infrastructure this added spending is not the incremental cost of decarbonization per se but the cost of restoring and modernizing america s overall infrastructure a worthy and much needed objective research and development outlays should also rise significantly we may estimate that research outlays for renewable energy should be of roughly the same scale as the biomedical research budget of the national institutes of health roughly 30 billion per year it is notable that senator bernie sanders has presented a multiyear green new deal plan with a headline price tag of 16 trillion the main reason for this enormous sum is sanders s call for the federal government to build and operate the new renewable energy system essentially displacing the existing utility industry in the process in the plan that i have sketched i assume that the utility sector not the federal government will bear the investment costs sanders also includes generous outlays for retrofitting buildings and for a highly accelerated replacement of the existing vehicle fleet my cost estimates and those of the studies i have quoted are based on decarbonization by 2050 in line with the ipcc 1 5 degree scenario getting started in 2020 for the next presidency proponents of the green new deal will need to do their homework if they are to triumph in congress over the big oil lobby public opinion is in favor of climate action but that doesn t matter in congress what counts is who pays the campaign bills unfortunately the answer is big oil in the 2016 federal election cycle the oil and gas industry gave 56 million in campaign financing to republican candidates compared with just 8 million to democratic candidates in the 2018 election cycle the republicans received 43 million compared with just 6 million for the democrats to beat big oil the green new deal advocates need a specific plan one that demonstrates how decarbonization will work and how it will benefit every part of the country with such a plan green new deal advocates will be able to turn public opinion into votes in congress every congressman indeed every voter should have a specific idea of what the green new deal would mean for their district and region without such a plan climate activists will continue to win the battle over climate science but still lose the war over climate action to date advocates of decarbonization have tended to focus their advocacy on pricing policies cap and trade carbon tax feed in tariff etc yet such pricing proposals only serve to raise suspicions and opposition to new taxes such policy proposals fail to win the hearts and minds of the general public and the public fails to press the congress for action a historical analogy may be useful when president dwight eisenhower first proposed the interstate highway program in 1953 conservatives in congress were reluctant to support the program the congressmen could not see what was in it for them and the proposal was stalemated then in september 1955 the bureau of public roads of the department of commerce put out a book of maps showing the general location of the proposed highway system in dozens of major metropolitan areas suddenly congressmen could see the benefits of a new highway system passing through their district the vividness of the proposed plan helped to carry the day in congress see the article by robert paaswell the good news is that the specifics of a green new deal to decarbonize the energy system are finally coming into focus we now understand clearly the key pillars of decarbonization we now understand that today s technologies can get most of the transition accomplished and that even the hard sectors can be decarbonized after a bit more r d and the truly great news is that all of this can be achieved at very low cost decarbonization to save the planet is actually the greatest bargain of our time endnotes james hansen et al young people s burden requirement of negative co2 emissions earth system dynamics 8

throughout history there have been a number of extremely meaningful volatility spikes across major financial markets each had defining characteristics that made them similar despite occurring in very different markets and for different reasons the continuity seen across these volatility cycles is a good thing because while it doesn t necessarily make a major volatility spike predictable historical precedence offers a blueprint for identifying conditions that are supportive for a potential vol event to occur and how they are likely to unfold once in motion this can be of great help in guiding trading decisions whether that is to steer clear of a potential vol blow up or move towards it with the appropriate strategy that can take advantage of the outsized price swings that come with unusual levels of volatility we will first discuss what a volatility event typically looks like in terms of the behavior of volatility itself then take a close look at some of the largest spikes ever witnessed in major financial markets what is volatility in simple terms volatility can be defined as the variations at which a market fluctuates the more an asset s price moves the higher the volatility the less the price moves the lower the volatility paul robinson dailyfx in this piece we are looking at a short term measure of volatility two week duration called realized volatility which is volatility as it has already occurred it is also known as historical volatility what does a volatility event cycle look like in the lead up to a volatility spike there is often a build up period where volatility rises gradually indicating markets could be headed for significant dislocation and disruption the period of subtle unrest is followed by a sudden vertical move in volatility that reaches a climax before quickly reversing and normalizing through a gradual but bumpy decline towards pre event volatility levels the graph below is a composite of several past volatility cycles accounting for 100 days before and after the peak in volatility notice the build up period the volatility spike itself and the normalization phase as well as the asymmetry between the phases cycle of a volatility spike source dailyfx behavior of volatility differs among asset classes another aspect of market volatility to understand is that it doesn t behave in the same way across all asset classes nor necessarily even within the same asset class for example stock market volatility generally behaves differently than it does in currencies and commodities stocks have had an inherent long bias to them as they are generally an asset of appreciating value over the longrun market participants invest in company shares making the stock market almost an exclusively long market with limited short interest because of this bias volatility runs high in down markets when there is fear as a result of financial losses and selling and low in up markets where fear is minimal occasionally you will see stock market volatility rise in a bull market as participants collectively suffer from fomo but this isn t the norm and only happens towards the end of long powerful trends a couple of which we will look at here shortly recommended by paul robinson building confidence in trading get my guide vix demonstrates that volatility tends to rise on selling decline on buying data source bloomberg as shown in the graph above volatility typically runs opposite of the s p 500 especially when the market declines over the long run currencies and commodities don t have a natural bias to them and tend to oscillate in large bull and bear cycles that end in minimal net change volatility can rise in either direction and isn t consistent over time in the case of commodities i e gold volatility can actually be more likely to rise with a price rise than during a decline but again this is not wholly consistent across a cycle gold vs two week realized volatility data source bloomberg in the graph above the green boxes mark periods when volatility rose while price appreciated and the red boxes mark periods when it rose while the price of gold depreciated this highlights the non directional bias that volatility can have in commodities the same also holds true for currency volatility a history of market volatility the biggest volatility cycles we ll have a look at the some of the most significant volatility cycles that have happened in the major financial markets since 1929 and investigate their build up peak normalization phase and after effects crash of 1929 at the end of the roaring 20s bull market the crash of 1929 kicked off the great depression of the 1930s the october 28 29 crash in 1929 is particularly noteworthy and resulted in a two day loss of 24 in the dow jones industrials average with two week realized volatility rocketing to 127 in the short term aftermath the dow price spent the next two weeks closing 6 higher or lower from the prior day s session as was the case with the death of other major historical stock markets the crash didn t come from all time highs ath but after a period of weakness that caused volatility to rise ahead of the major spike heading into the late october rout the market was already off the ath by 21 with short term volatility rising from only 11 to 81 after the initial episode of the 1929 1932 stock market decline volatility initially normalized by falling from a two week reading of 127 to under 10 in about five months time volatility would ramp up again later but did not exceed 100 again until almost two years later when the worst part of the bear market drew near its conclusion dow jones industrial average 1929 1931 data source bloomberg in the chart above volatility spiked sharply red after weeks of

to manipulate the price of silver in what was one of the most famous market cornerings ever it wasn t just the brothers trading activity though inflation was rapidly rising and precious metal hedges were in high demand silver topped out at over 49 after trading at only 6 a year prior during the spectacular price rise volatility at times rose sharply with each major surge including the final one that concluded in january 1980 volatility declined during the initial portion of the sell off before spiking to near record levels as the market panicked out of long positions during the spring of 1980 from there it was a bumpy ride but the two week realized volatility declined to only 12 a mere five months after super spiking to 240 silver 1979 1981 data source bloomberg in this chart the green boxes highlight the volatility spikes during bullish phases and the red boxes when volatility spiked on selling it is clear there was a larger tendency for volatility to rise with the price of silver versus when it fell black monday 1987 the 1987 stock market crash in the united states was in large part blamed on program trading the first technology financial engineering driven crash of its kind however massive speculative excesses were built up prior to the crash unlike anything since the 1920s this played a significant role in the decline of stock prices and the massive spike in volatility the one day 20 decline in the major averages was of course a significant surprise outside the possibility of projection but as has been the case with most other major volatility cycles it didn t exactly occur out of the blue during the last 10 of the bull market two week realized volatility rose with the s p 500 from 8 to 15 highlighting growing instability in the uptrend by the time black monday rolled around the spx had already declined from the high by 16 while volatility was materially higher with a short term reading of 25 short term volatility spiked to over 130 in the wake

came at the cost of main st the decline from 2007 to 2009 was the largest plunge in both stocks and the economy since the great depression but it wasn t without some type of warning that a major blow up in volatility could be in the works just before things got really wild in the fall of 2008 two week volatility was already at 41 from there the s p 500 fell another 27 in about five weeks which saw short term volatility rocket to 97 during that time the widely watched vix index exploded from 36 to 80 in the year following volatility normalized with two week realized vol and the vix hitting 20 and 23 respectively but even going back to 2007 before the bear market began like in so many other bull markets nearing their conclusion volatility began creeping higher despite the s p 500 having gained about 8 ytd up to the october 9 2007 high the vix itself had also risen from around 12 to 16 a 25 increase the wheels on the bus were beginning to wobble despite all looking well on the surface

only 30 40 which is still extremely high for currencies s p 500 e mini flash crash 2010 the first major flash crash to speak of occurred on may 6 2010 when the s p 500 e mini futures were rocked by

which are cancelled just before getting filled now while this may have contributed to the decline the market was already in a fragile state to begin with as is typically the case when flash crashes occur to put volatility into perspective the vix had risen from 15 to 25 in the weeks prior before rocketing past 40 on the day of the crash volatility actually didn t finish rising until about three weeks later when the vix hit 48 from there volatility declined in typical fashion until early 2011 before popping again s p 500 2010 data source bloomberg the s p 500 e mini flash crash showed

results were announced but gbp usd ended up closing down 8 on the day that the vote was finalized two week realized vol exceeded 46 thereafter this was a known event to take place so there was no surprise to see volatility rise ahead of time in anticipation nevertheless volatility provided a warning that things could get dicey in the month before the vote two week realized volatility rose from a mere 6 to over 16 as market participants weighed in on the potential outcome one that the market wasn t fully prepared to handle even with warning post brexit vote volatility initially cratered from

global intangible low taxed income gilti tax which represents a u s income tax on the company s foreign earnings the continued shift in mix of taxable income that is mostly earned by the company s foreign operations located in china and canada at higher income tax rates in relation to the u s has also contributed to this increase in the company s effective tax rate importantly income taxes incurred in the u s on a cash basis for fiscal 2020 are expected to be minimal due to the projected utilization of the company s u s federal net operating loss carryforwards commenting on the results frank saxon chairman and chief executive officer of culp inc said we are pleased with our performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 while we had a modest drop in overall sales compared with the prior year period we had an improved operating performance in both our mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics businesses we believe the domestic mattress industry is still working to stabilize from the disruption related to low cost mattress imports from china and the continuing variability in the market is evidenced in recent industry sales reports we are monitoring the development and demand trends among our legacy mattress customers and the rapidly growing roll packed boxed bedding segment with our broad product mix and flexible manufacturing platform we have been able to respond to these changing demand trends additionally while our upholstery fabrics business has been affected by ongoing trade disputes and international tariffs we were pleased with our ability to make supply chain adjustments to address these challenges and meet the needs of our customers we also continued to refine our strategies for culp home accessories our finished products business and we believe we

dumping measures said iv culp president and chief operating officer of culp while demand is softer in our legacy mattress fabrics business we experienced very favorable demand trends for mattress

line with expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 noted boyd chumbley president of culp s upholstery fabrics division the slight drop in sales over the prior year period reflects the

june 2011 the company has returned approximately 66 million to shareholders in the form of regular quarterly and special dividends and share repurchases financial outlook commenting on the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 bowling remarked we expect overall sales to be comparable to the third quarter of last year we expect mattress fabrics sales to be slightly down and operating income and margins to be moderately down compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the third quarter is a traditionally slower sales period and is affected by the loss of multiple weeks of production and distribution for our class cover business as a result of government mandated holiday shutdowns in haiti and the timing of chinese new year the impact of these seasonal shutdowns during this period is greater this year as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 because the class sewn cover business is a more significant part of our current operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we currently expect sales to increase slightly and operating income and margins to be significantly up as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we anticipate benefits from a return to strong growth for our class cover business continued improvement in overall industry conditions and improved operating efficiencies across all product lines as a result we expect sales for the second half of fiscal 2020 to be comparable to sales for the second half of fiscal 2019 and operating income and margins for the period are expected to be moderately higher as compared with the second half of the prior year in our upholstery fabrics segment we expect third quarter sales and operating income and margins to be comparable to the same period last year similarly for the second half of fiscal 2020 we also expect sales and operating income and margins to be comparable to the second half of fiscal 2019 in our home accessories segment we expect third quarter sales to be slightly down compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as we continue to refine our strategies and focus on higher margin products we expect an operating loss for the quarter but with meaningful improvement as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for the fourth quarter we expect operating performance to be near break even considering these factors as well as increased unallocated corporate expenses due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the company expects to report pre tax income for the third quarter of 2020 in the range of 3 2 million to 3 8 million excluding any restructuring and related charges or credits and impairment charges if any pre tax income for last year s third quarter was 4 3 million which included a net charge of approximately 769 000 in restructuring and related charges and credits and other non recurring items excluding these charges pre tax income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 5 0 million the company currently expects our performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to be significantly better than the results achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and as a result our performance for the second half of fiscal 2020 is currently expected to be better than the results achieved during the prior year period based on our current budget capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be in the 7 5 million to 8 0 million range additionally free cash flow for fiscal 2020 is expected to be comparable to last year s results even with an uncertain geopolitical environment added bowling about the company culp inc is one of the world s largest marketers of mattress fabrics for bedding and upholstery fabrics for residential and commercial furniture the company

prince costumes unbuttoned and backpacks hanging from the shoulders of their colonial period dresses flip flops on lunch boxes in hand legions of workers stream into an employee parking lot at walt disney world weary from another shift of making magic at the world s busiest theme park this is the place where the pixie dust loses its sparkle it s where the low wage workers who power orlando s tourism machine leave the attractions hotels and eateries and fade into a community that doesn t have enough affordable housing public transportation or opportunities in industries with higher paying jobs table contents width 100 a year after a landmark decision by disney to raise its minimum wage for about 40 000 union workers to 15 an hour by 2021 many of those employees are better off by october the number of unionized workers earning more than 15 an hour had more than quadrupled to 13 057 compared to august 2018 according to the service trades council union but people earning near the 15 mark long considered the gold standard for a living wage still find their paychecks barely cover the basics so they move farther from the attractions to find lower rent and make difficult decisions each month about whether they can pay overdue medical bills or buy enough groceries to feed a family they re people like gabby alcantara anderson gabby alcantara anderson unwinds in her car after a day of work at magic kingdom alcantara anderson has spent nearly a decade at disney and earned promotions beyond entry level yet her family struggles to make ends meet she hops off an employee bus at the lot for magic kingdom workers at 12 12 a m on a humid september night and makes a beeline for her kia soul where a permit on the back window reads frontierland cast member after almost seven years at disney she spends her shifts monitoring rides while also answering guest complaints at the park s old west themed land home to the splash mountain flume and country bear jamboree she slips out of sneakers and into black crocs climbs into the car pulls out of the parking lot and heads to a 7 eleven on disney property it happens to be a good night she has enough cash stowed in the sunglasses case above her head to buy gas for the 63 mile drive to her home south of lakeland but sometimes on the worst nights when the tank is on e and she can t scrounge even a few bucks for gas she doesn t leave the lot instead she pulls into a dark corner cracks the windows and reclines the seat all the way back she calls her family and she checks to make sure there s a clean uniform in the back seat for the next day and then she falls asleep waiting for her paycheck to deposit overnight that doesn t happen as often lately alcantara anderson s wages jumped from 11 50 an hour in september 2018 to 14 75 today after disney s agreement with the unions last year to increase pay no unionized disney workers earn less than 13 an hour today compared to last year when nearly 21 000 people made less than 11 but alcantara anderson is still one of about 25 600 disney workers in the union making less than 15 an hour and life in the world s vacation kingdom is still a calculus of choices rent food medicine a birthday gift for her child she and her husband who works at an auto repair shop will make about 45 000 this year wages that will also support her daughter and her sick mother that lands them squarely in the low wage bracket according to guidelines from the department of housing and urban development we have no savings we have no nest egg we have nothing to fall back on said alcantara anderson 28 we pretty much live hand to mouth orlando earned its place among the world s leading vacation spots after years of dizzying growth today nearly 50 years after the magic kingdom opened the region s 75 million visitors surpass london and paris combined the tourism industry employs nearly 280 000 workers in the four counties surrounding orlando accounting for the largest portion of the entire local labor force more than 20 disney employs more than a quarter of those workers or about 77 000 people so many tourism jobs in one place many of them low wage come with a consequence paychecks across all industries in central florida rank dead last among the top 50 metropolitan areas in the united states the median annual wage in the orlando metro is 33 150 lower than in smaller regions such as austin nashville memphis and raleigh n c orlando also falls behind other big tourism towns including las vegas new orleans atlantic city and honolulu according to an analysis of 2018 data from the bureau of labor statistics and wages in the hospitality sector are even lower than the local overall median at 28 289 in the orlando metro graphic container img width

florida is last in that national ranking list too a public transit system in dire need of funding and the region s fits and starts at luring higher wage industries bring the fragility of orlando s low wage workers into focus it s like the gordian knot said eric gray executive director for social service agency united against poverty orlando it s so complicated that people hesitate to want to try and untie it desmond burns a former cook for a contractor at a disney hotel lives in lakeland and drives two hours four days a week to pursue a culinary degree in tampa hoping more education will lead to a higher paying job diego henry after six years at disney still doesn t make enough to move his family of three out of a one bedroom apartment and nicky wilkins endures a more than three hour commute to her job as one of the many theme park employees who rely on the struggling lynx bus system those workers along with alcantara anderson are all active or hold leadership roles in one of the six unions that represent people who work at disney the sentinel also interviewed workers at universal orlando and other hotels and restaurants outside of disney who discussed similar worries about wages housing and transportation many of those workers who do not have protection from a union were reluctant to share their stories publicly for fear of job repercussions do you work in orlando tourism share your story with the orlando sentinel many said they feel left behind amid the region s attractions boom some like alcantara anderson say tourists by design don t see the whole picture they don t realize that when this worker goes home they have a separate life that s not doing so great she said the shadows for alcantara anderson even at 14 75 an hour there s little wiggle room an unexpected expense can mean months of playing catch up like when she was hospitalized for six days in march a bout of bronchitis worsened when she contracted enterovirus and norovirus she ended up with pneumonia and spent a night in the intensive care unit i thought then what would have happened if i would have died that week was pretty much like i was dead because i wasn t here to take care of things she said at the time she was her family s sole income earner when she arrived home from the hospital alcantara anderson discovered her husband dipped into the savings they had at the time to keep bills from piling up with her six sick days used up earlier in the year she d only received a few days worth of short term disability then she looked around their kitchen there was a can of green beans some vinegar gabby alcantara anderson with her daughter chastity mcconnell at their home in mulberry we had eaten the last of our food alcantara anderson said and her 11 year old daughter chastity mcconnell was hungry she came over to me like hey mommy are we going to have dinner today are we going to eat alcantara anderson recalled that was one day where i felt like i had legitimately failed her at the time alcantara anderson s grandmother gave them some ground beef milk bread eggs and cheese to eat but they still wear the episode like a scar as recently as august their checking account was in the red 504 89 bill collectors were calling and yet alcantara anderson is nearly always smiling she started off at disney in a seasonal cooking job and moved on to positions where she could use her outgoing personality to more closely interact with guests her hair is often in two full pigtails and she wears a boba fett tattoo after the star wars bounty hunter on her right shoulder in 2014 she won one of disney s highest cast member honors the disney heroes award for performing cpr on a guest at epcot to save money alcantara anderson lives in a tiny rural town outside of lakeland about an hour and a half from disney in a three bedroom house owned by a relative who cuts her a break on rent the modest home is also close to medical care for her mom who has battled cancer and is legally blind she said she wouldn t be able to afford the same amount of space if she lived closer to the theme parks recently her husband zac anderson took on a second job part time at o reilly auto parts four days a week alcantara anderson who is now temporarily on leave from the magic kingdom to work for the union picks up overtime when she can the extra money helps at the root of many of her family s challenges and the problems other workers face whether they can pay for an education save for a down payment get an ailing tooth pulled is wages said jeremy haicken president of local 737 one of two locals in the unite here labor union that represent 26 000 of the area s disney workers as wages go up people can afford to make healthier choices in how they eat where they buy groceries where they live what kind of housing they have haicken said as wages go up there s a better life here but industry officials say they re limited in what they can do without hurting the local economy the problem we are facing is twofold the customer will only pay so much for a room said mark waltrip chief operating officer for timeshare giant westgate resorts if i said let s pay everyone 25 an hour i would have to double my room rates central florida tourism would crash we are stuck between a rock and a hard place disney spokeswoman andrea finger said the company has set itself apart through its commitment to increase worker pay we re proud of the bar we set to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2021 which is among the highest in the country for entry level employees in the service industry finger said disney also provides health care insurance and benefits including an on site clinic the company offers groceries for employees at near wholesale prices at an on site store as well as discounted child care on disney property with flexible hours through a partnership with the ymca employees who take the bus can save money by using pre tax dollars to buy bus passes disney s aspire education program pays 100 tuition at in network schools including the university of central florida or valencia college for eligible employees more than 11 000 have enrolled so far in addition disney notes its philanthropic efforts across the community the entertainment giant which reported 12 6 billion in profit last year has its name on a pavilion at adventhealth s hospital for children as well as the main theater in the dr phillips center for the performing arts disney also supports second harvest food bank the boys girls club and other charities across central florida however paychecks have barely budged for two decades despite population growth at a rate that far outpaces the national average the region has had some of the slowest growth in per capita personal income when compared to the 10 fastest growing metros just about 8 when adjusted for inflation between 2000 and 2018 that s lower than the national average of more than 20 according to the bureau of economic analysis last year brought a breakthrough disney agreed to its historic minimum wage increase after about a year of negotiations with its unions eric clinton president of local 362 which represents disney attraction and custodial workers said the agreement came about in part because of surging angst over wages across the country eric clinton president of local 362 left and jeremy haicken president of local 737 represent 26 000 of the area s hospitality workers battles to boost minimum wages have erupted from seattle to new york the subject is stump material for 2020 presidential candidates and a low unemployment rate helped too pushing companies to raise pay or benefits to attract candidates there s a lot of anger in the country and a lot of people mobilizing clinton said and our negotiations took place in that sort of context so it wasn t in a vacuum when disney raises wages everyone pays attention seaworld rose to 11 an hour in december 2018 and universal increased its minimum wage to 12 an hour universal which has 25 000 workers will move all employees to 13 an hour next year and to 15 when its new park epic universe opens in 2023 the median hourly wage for theme park attendants in orange county is 10 16 an hour while housekeepers earn 10 63 and fast food cooks make 10 08 according to the most recent data from the bureau of labor statistics trial attorney john morgan is seizing the momentum around wages with a proposed constitutional amendment to lift florida s minimum pay from 8 46 an hour today to 10 by september 2021 and 15 by september 2026 in the past seven years the minimum wage has increased by less than 1 morgan acknowledged his amendment isn t a cure for the many workers who exist just above the poverty line even at 15 an hour some will still struggle when they leave their shifts and become invisible to tourists as well as locals who work outside the service industry people don t want to see it morgan said people don t want to go out to the food bank and watch people in uniform from their day job get free food with their children in hand people don t want to see people sleeping on the street or sleeping in cars the easiest thing is to shut your eyes when you drive past it he said because these people are hidden in the shadows we survive as a community because of this when the magic kingdom opened to fanfare in 1971 orlando s economy began its metamorphosis morgan was just a kid when disney chose orlando and like a lot of people he got a job there he dressed in character as fiddler pig before being promoted to the more coveted role of pluto we couldn t believe it was here he said in this land of lakes that previously hadn t been known for much more than orange groves smaller attractions like the first reptiles at gatorland or the mermaids of weeki wachee springs and a whole lot of heat i think walt disney world made orlando florida seaworld opened quickly after in 1973 and universal followed in 1990 disney now has four main gates plus two water parks and continues to open new attractions such as a star wars themed land and a toy story land universal is planning to open a third park in 2023 orlando international airport is in the middle of a 2 8 billion expansion and the orange county convention center plans to open more meeting space by 2023 we survive as a community because of this said gray the nonprofit director there is no question florida collects nearly 9 of its sales tax 5 1 billion in 2017 from tourists many of them visitors to orlando in orange county about half of all the sales tax collected is from travelers alone the industry is the top property taxpayer in orange county and is expected to bring in an estimated 412 8 million between the theme parks hotels golf courses and businesses on international drive this year according to the county property appraiser s office the money pays for a variety of services including public education road

none bill peeper the first ceo of visit orlando the region s marketing arm said tourism s benefits outweigh the burden brought by a workforce concentrated with low wages are there challenges in that area yes but there are also wonderful opportunities for many of these individuals who would not have another source of livelihood peeper said low wages this sounds like it justifies it but let s not criticize our own community for something that is prevalent throughout the country companies can only do so much one of those challenges the cost of welfare and charity borne by government and private donors the number of households on food stamps or cash public assistance in the orlando metro area rose by 46 from 2010 to 2018 far outpacing population growth in that time period 17 according to the census bureau universal declined an interview for this story saying through spokesman tom schroder that the company has worked hard to be a good employer a good neighbor and a good corporate citizen we are proud of our record and our contribution to the community we are proud of the role tourism has played in our community seaworld also declined an interview hotelier harris rosen who owns eight hotels also did not comment he has earned a reputation as a philanthropist offering his own health care to employees and free schooling and scholarships to children from tangelo park and parramore two impoverished neighborhoods in november he was recognized for those efforts by the orlando economic partnership and noted in his acceptance speech that others in the business community could also do more we ve been trying for years 26 years to convince others to replicate the program rosen said sadly no takers why we have no idea a city in transition for years central florida leaders have tried to lure new high wage industries like film and biotech but there s only been limited success the region s aspirations as hollywood east fizzled along with the state s film tax incentive program a plan to transform florida into the silicon valley of biotechnology also crashed medical research group sanford burnham prebys which state and local leaders promised some 300 million to come to lake nona in southeast orlando created fewer jobs than expected and announced plans to leave town in 2016 after 10 years those losses haven t stopped the region from trying again in kissimmee osceola county s 500 acre neocity recently opened a stem focused high school with courses in areas like advanced manufacturing and biomedical engineering downtown orlando s creative village development is targeting high tech media companies with space for the downtown campuses of ucf and valencia and some affordable housing too and lake nona in southeast orange county boasts nemours children s hospital the veterans affairs medical center and the university of central florida college of medicine but even in higher paying jobs orlando workers still see lower wages compared to other cities according to the bureau of labor statistics 2018 figures the orlando metropolitan region ranked 47th out of 50 in annual median wages for business and financial occupations a developing sector that is often touted as a sign of the growing economy orlando construction wages another booming area ranked 49th while health career wages came in at no 39 and engineers and architects made less too at 44th out of 50 the reason for the lower wages said gray of united against poverty is an abundance of low skilled workers all vying for tourism jobs it depresses the wages in those areas he said the three major reasons why we re not able to attract a higher paying industry in the community are no 1 the lack of skilled labor in this community and no 2 and 3 the lack of skilled labor in this community and because disney universal and major hotel chains are not headquartered in orlando the money travelers spend doesn t necessarily stay here take a family of four visiting walt disney world they may spend about 6 360 on average for flights hotels souvenirs food and park tickets during a four night trip according to a 2017 analysis by money magazine that s as much as alcantara anderson the frontierland low level manager makes in about three months about 35 of the money vacationing families spend in the orlando region goes elsewhere according to an analysis for the orlando sentinel by implan a provider of economic impact software used by economists those dollars are sent to out of state company headquarters and manufacturers overseas known in the industry as leakage the figure is about average compared to other tourism destinations but when that s what most of your economy relies on it can be a problem said owen beitsch senior director of economic and real estate advisory services at gai consultants orlando has only one fortune 500 company headquarters olive garden parent darden restaurants i think we do lose what i would call some quality of life things we arguably do lose some significant presence that sends a signal to the rest of the world beitsch said but the major economic consequence is that the money that does get spent here is not for the highest wage jobs orlando mayor buddy dyer said he s well familiar with the local economy s pitfalls you re not going to talk to any elected official that doesn t talk about diversification of our economy dyer said and we ve actually done a pretty good job of that but the tourism component of it so outshines everything else that s there that the region s fledgling industries don t get as much attention while orlando is cemented as a tourism town dyer and other officials haven t stopped showering attractions and hotels with public dollars in the past fiscal year the orange county economic development office spent 2 9 million to attract high wage companies the department said in that same time visit orlando s budget rose to 65 4 million according to the county comptroller s office money that will largely be spent marketing tourism and convention spaces in orange county so conservatively for every 1 orange county spent to diversify its economy it spent about 22 49 to bring more tourists my job is everything alcantara anderson knows what it s like to make good money she did once as a radiology technician in tampa before bad working conditions pushed her to leave burns the cook knows it too he was a mechanic before pursuing a second career in culinary arts he worked at disney s coronado springs resort as a prep line cook making 13 an hour until september when he left to look for higher pay for the better part of this year burns journey to a new life has been a drive through punishing traffic from his home in lakeland to cooking classes at the art institute of tampa it s been long days and even longer nights traversing the belly of the state with a composition book in his passenger seat door and his daughter s pink backpack now his in his trunk as a single dad he worries his kids will one day fall in the same cycle of poverty that he s trying to break when he has to tell his straight a daughter that he couldn t afford the 70 fee to put her in her high school honor society or his son that he didn t have enough for his 48 driving learners permit he wonders if the classes will be worth the extra hours he sacrifices away from home i m trying to build something now not only for my kids if something

one that ignites when you do something you really love alcantara anderson and many of the theme park and hotel workers interviewed by the sentinel said they never liked their old jobs as much as their tourism jobs positions that in many ways seemed like dreams come true the kind of thing animated princesses sing about they love the feeling that comes with coaxing a smile out of a child spending time on a special meal or helping a harried parent relax and get more out of their vacation hospitality comes easily to them paying the bills on a service paycheck does not it s not like one of those boring jobs where she s just into it for the money said alcantara anderson s daughter chastity 11 she s in it because it s something she wanted to do it was chastity s first day of middle school and alcantara anderson was sitting on her couch in their single story home near lakeland listening to her talk but i work a lot huh alcantara anderson responded i don t really get to see you that often sometimes chastity nodded most days alcantara anderson leaves for work two hours early to be sure she s at the magic kingdom on time when she gets out at midnight the drive back will take an hour if she s lucky then she cooks dinner for her family for the next evening does laundry cleans up most nights she ll sit outside in her car and play a little sudoku the quiet is often interrupted by the sound of cicadas it s her only alone time she goes to bed at 3 or 4 a m it s then when the stress catches up with her those moments without the distractions and the drive without the go go go of checking up on her daughter s homework crunching numbers on bills and medical appointments for her mom the fear creeps in if she calls out of work she worries will they think i m unreliable will they bump me down from my coordinator role for someone who doesn t have a sick mom and a pre teen to care for i would lose everything i couldn t i couldn t do it she said her voice breaking up i m just terrified of that because for her two things are true at once life at 14 75 an hour is a daily test of will but her happiness and her livelihood also depend on being employed at disney to me my job s

and with it an outstanding year for synopsys in fiscal 2019 a year in which we successfully navigated several external challenges we once again exceeded our plan we generated 3 36 billion in revenue and are well on track to our next milestone of 4 billion our backlog grew to 4 4 billion we expanded operating margin significantly and delivered 17 non gaap earnings growth to 4 56 for the year while returning 329 million to shareholders through buybacks business was strong across our semiconductor system design segment and strengthened as the year progressed software integrity achieved profitability and grew 19 to 335 million trac will discuss the financials in more detail against a challenging global market backdrop with geopolitical stress and unevenness in the semiconductor industry design activity remains strong growth in machine learning automotive 5g iot cloud and the proliferation of smart everything is considerable new entrants including ai start ups and cloud hyperscalers are pushing the boundaries of technology and time to market synopsys is at the center of this wave of innovation and growth and we are uniquely positioned to enable electronics design from the intricacies and complexity of silicon to the power and pervasiveness of software a year ago i communicated our strategy for our next phase of growth first sustain and grow our technology and market leadership in eda and ip second continue to scale and grow software integrity in a diverse customer base at new tam while steadily moving to solid profitability and third further drive operational excellence toward multi year operating margin expansion during fiscal 19 we made very good progress on all three let me provide some highlights beginning with eda and ip where we substantially expanded relationships with our customers and ecosystem partners tsmc for example recognized synopsys with partner of the year awards for the ninth straight year award this year were for interface ip joint development of 6 nanometer design infrastructure joint delivery of innovative 3d chip stacking and cloud based productivity solutions in addition some of the world s largest and most influential companies expanded their reliance on us one key example is the us mobile systems leader who significantly expanded its business with us across both eda and ip in eda our platforms increasingly stand out as the strongest they ve ever been this year we began proliferating several game changing new products that already have significant momentum notably our unrelenting innovation push in digital design is driving benchmark wins and increased competitive displacements our fusion platform including our new fusion compiler product launched last november is achieving widespread wins and growing deployment exceeding our initial business targets fusion compiler is winning head to head benchmarks with consistently better results and run time across many applications breakthrough competitive wins have ranged from the largest global communications processor and graphics firms to high impacts cloud hyperscalers to multiple influential system houses such as a large global consumer electronics company for image sensor designs a leading automotive semiconductor company for autonomous driving soc designs and expanded competitive displacements at a leading mobile company for 5 nanometer and sub 5 nanometer designs benchmark wins at a us based graphics company with superior quality of results and turnaround time a large cap us systems company selecting fusion compiler as its primary solution for digital implementation and the us semiconductor leader who is aggressively expanding deployment of fusion compiler for its mission critical programs representing more than 95 of its business while still early in our multi year product cycle these important wins represent significant momentum and usage share gains setting the stage for revenue share gains going forward turning to custom design custom compiler revenue nearly doubled this year fueled by multiple full flow competitive displacements our expansion is driven by key wins in the 5g ai and server chip markets including a tier 1 north american server company a large us high speed communications chip maker and complete full flow competitive displacements at a large idm in japan and a major dram company we also announced a full flow custom compiler platform deployment at samsung for its five lpe process and are seeing good momentum with start ups who are not locked into a legacy flows and demand modern technology let me now move to our verification continuum platform where we hold the number 1 market share position in both software and hardware benefiting from native integration of the fastest engines on the market our verification software products continue to drive competitive wins and proliferation contributing substantially to growth are broad set of system houses and chipmakers ranging from cloud hyperscalers in north america to ai automotive mobile and memory leaders around the world hardware based verification was strong as well despite our largest hardware customer delaying delivery of a substantial number of emulators due to near term spending priorities we finished the year with a record hardware revenue we maintain the number 1 market segment position for the third year in a row our hardware products are particularly well suited to today s complex designs with unmatched speed highest capacity lowest cost of ownership and lowest power consumption as a result we significantly expanded our customer base adding nearly 40 new customers and more than 80 repeat orders in 2019 we saw major expansions and share gains at influential customers ranging from prominent global systems companies to growing hyperscalers and leading semis amd for example standardized on zebu expanding the emulation capacity to accelerate time to market for processor graphics and gaming chips now to ip with strong market demand and our rich portfolio are driving double digit growth we had a record year reaching more than 750 million in revenue with prominent engagements across all major markets including ai automotive cloud and 5g as the number 1 provider of interface embedded memory and foundry specific ip we provide the industry s broadest portfolio to address today s most complex design requirements accelerate time to market and lower risk for customers we have particular strengths in usb memory interfaces and pci express 5 0 this year we achieved the significant milestone of 1 billion in cumulative usb ip bookings bolstering our position as the number 1 usb provider by far and our new 56 and 112 gig serdes ip is gaining good market traction during 2019 momentum accelerated in automotive where we ve achieved nearly 230 automotive socket wins and advanced finfet processes across approximately 30 major semiconductor companies we announced the collaboration with infineon to incorporate the arc embedded vision processor into their next generation rx controller to accelerate ai in automotive applications from the embedded vision alliance we were awarded the best process award for 2019 finally our track record of delivering ip and advanced process nodes continues and is highly valued by our customers we achieved more than 250 ip wins on tsmc s 7 nanometer finfet process and announced the collaboration with tsmc for development of ip on their most advanced 5 nanometer process where we signed yet another significant multi year agreement with a very large global customer we re also seeing great momentum with samsung foundry process down to four lpe and global foundries across a range of processes now to software integrity the tools that test software code for security vulnerabilities and quality issues we entered this new tam in 2014 by the end of 2018 we had completed a number of significant acquisitions integrated them into synopsys and enhanced our products with new features and broader language coverage in 2019 we completed phase 1 of our software integrity strategy by delivering 10 of synopsys revenue and achieving approximately 10 operating margin although orders were a bit softer than planned we outpaced the market with 19 growth this was achieved through progress in driving multi year multi million dollar agreements a steady increase in the number of customers adopting multiple solutions and growth in all of our key verticals in 2020 we are now moving to phase 2 scaling the business to 0 5 billion and beyond the opportunity is vast as companies must embed security testing into their software development process without compromising time to market synopsys is well positioned to enable this evolution with a great combination of high value products and consulting services our scaling efforts for 2020 span three areas one expanding polaris our cloud based software integrity platform we announced polaris in q2 including a compelling road map of product integrations and new capabilities over the subsequent 12 to 18 months we ve had a growing number of adoptions thus far including a fortune 500 insurance company and customers ranging from financial services to networking to medical and industrial digitalization stay tuned as we expand the polaris capabilities and enhance support of large deployments two scaling consulting engagements this is where we help our customers with high level benchmarking program development advice as well as large product deployments it s a key synopsys differentiator in the software and devops market and three refining our channel we ve realigned our sales organization to better serve large enterprise customers key market verticals and new regional business in fy 20 we intend to further increase both our sales and support capacity we believe we are on track to exceed market growth in this business delivering approximately 15 to 20 growth over the next couple of years as the market evolves for 2020 we plan to hold non gaap operating margin roughly steady then resume expansion in 2021 and beyond for synopsys as a whole in fy 20 we expect solid revenue growth even as we exclude from our forecast any revenue from companies currently on the us government s entity list furthermore we plan substantial non gaap operating margin expansion mid teens earnings per share growth and strong operating cash flow in summary we executed very well in 2019 delivering financial results substantially above beginnings of year targets market demand is strong and we are well positioned our product platforms are driving benchmark wins and competitive displacements and we are driving continued financial execution and growth as we move into the holiday season i want to thank our employees for their innovative and hard work and our partners and customers for their continued commitment to our products and trust in synopsys with that i ll turn it over to trac trac pham chief financial officer thanks aart good afternoon everyone 2019 was a very strong year in spite of what was at times a tough macro environment we achieved record results in all key metrics and finish well ahead of our initial expectations we delivered these results despite multiple unique hurdles including the operational transition to asc 606 the us entity list and general geopolitical uncertainty around the world we delivered strong growth in revenue non gaap earnings and operating cash flow while expanding non gaap operating margin by almost 3 percentage points we re entering 2020 well positioned to continue our momentum our product portfolio is as strong as it s ever been which in combination with healthy design activity is driving robust demand the result is reflected in our backlog which ended the year at 4 4 billion up from 4 1 billion at the end of 2018 despite the asc 606 backlog deduction our results speak to our solid execution and the durability of the business we built within approximately 90 recurring revenue model a diversified customer base spanning multiple key verticals and geographies and a product portfolio consisting of mission critical tools we are confident in our ability to deliver growth even in the context of an uneven macroeconomic environment i will now review our full year 2019 results we generated total revenue of 3 36 billion 8 growth or 9 adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2018 semiconductor system design revenue was 3 03 billion an increase of 7 or 8 adjusting for the extra week with both product groups contributing to the strong results ip reported a strongest year to date and eda software continues to grow well within our mid to high single digit target range revenue had another record year reflecting the broad based strength of that business we again earned the number 1 market segment position as growth in our diversified customer base more than offset a decline in emulation revenue from our largest hardware customers excluding hardware revenue from that customer grew very well the software integrity segment generated revenue of 335 million 19 growth or 20 adjusting for the extra week as aart discussed 2019 marks the key milestones as we grew the business to approximately 10 of total revenue a solid profitability returning to the consolidated level total gaap costs and expenses were 2 84 billion which includes approximately 47 million in restructuring costs as we work to optimize our resource allocation for sustainable long term growth total non gaap costs and expenses were 2 52 billion resulting in a non gaap operating margin of approximately 25 for our segments adjusted operating margins were 26 7 for semiconductor system design and 9 6 for software integrity gaap earnings per share were 3 45 and non gaap earnings per share were 4 56 17 growth or 19 adjusting for the extra week turning to cash operating cash flow for the year was 801 million we completed buybacks of 329 million in the year and 1 8 billion over the past five years returning approximately 75 of our free cash flow to investors over that period we ended the quarter with a cash balance of 729 million and total debt of 138 million now to our targets which assumed no change in the us government s entity list during the year based on our current assessment of the timing of hardware and ip deliveries we expect the first half second half split of roughly 45 55 for revenue and 35 65 for eps due to more evenly distributed expenses for fiscal 2020 revenue of 3 6 billion to 3 65 billion total gaap costs and expenses between 2 934 billion and 2 983 billion total non gaap costs and expenses between 2 63 billion and 2 66 billion resulting in a non gaap operating margin of approximately 27 other income and expenses between minus 16 million and minus 12 million our non gaap normalized tax rate of 16 outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million gaap earnings of 3 72 per share to 3 90 per sharel non gaap earnings of 5 18 per share and 5 25 per share cash flow from operations of 800 million to 825 million and capital expenditures of approximately 180 million as project timing costs some of the spending plan for 2019 to push into 2020 we expect expenditures to decline in 2021 now to the targets for the first quarter revenue between 805 million and 835 million total gaap costs and expenses between 715 million and 744 million total non gaap costs and expenses between 635 million and 655 million other income expenses between minus 5 million and minus 3 million our non gaap normalized tax rate of 16 outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million gaap earnings of 0 43 to 0 54 per share and non gaap earnings of 0 89 to 0 94 per share in summary our results this year reflect our strong execution and the resiliency of our business model our strength came from across the portfolio as we exceeded our near term commitments and made significant progress on our longer term operating objectives as we look to 2020 and beyond our focus remains consistent strong execution to deliver on our long term targets of high single digit revenue growth sustained margin expansion to the high 20s in fy 21 and 30 longer term double digit non gaap eps growth and strong cash flow these metrics combined with the capital allocation strategy built on balancing internal investments m a and buybacks give us confidence in our ability to continue to drive sustainable long term shareholder value with that i ll turn it over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator and we first turn to the line of rich valera with needham company please go ahead your line is open rich valera needham company analyst thank you good afternoon based on your annual profile or half to half profile looks like you must be expecting significantly stronger hardware at least beyond the first quarter can you talk about if that s the case and what kind of visibility you have to that hardware ramp and if that includes a significant pickup from the large customer that was down last year and the hardware shipments trac pham chief financial officer hi rich that s part of it yes it s a combination of both ip and hardware deliveries that is affecting the quarterly profile rich valera needham company analyst got it and can you just talk about your visibility to that is that something that s kind of in backlog or how what are sort of underpins the visibility particularly the hardware since that tends to be a little more volatile than the subscription revenues trac pham chief financial officer yes you ve taken a good point which is that hardware and ip generally is more more variable from quarter to quarter and the way that we re projecting revenues for this year is no different than how we have done in the past it s a combination of what is in backlog as well as our assessment of our ability to close the deals that are in our pipeline and both in ip and hardware so it really does reflect our best estimate of the profile at this point rich valera needham company analyst great just quickly it looks like sig was a little bit light in the fourth quarter and you ve moderated i think your longer term target that had been 20 is now 15 to 20 is there anything structural you re seeing in that business or there is sort of large numbers as you grow it how should we what accounts for that sort of moderation of that growth target there thank you trac pham chief financial officer yes rich that s a good point i ll start with the second half of your question which is is there any fundamental change in the business and we don t see it that way certainly we re very optimistic about that business and we do see a good outlook for it we did see some challenges this year which we were quick to address and we feel good that we should be able to continue to grow at the market rates or higher and it is natural to us it s a the natural ebbs and flows of growing the business rich valera needham company analyst great thank you congratulations on a good year trac pham chief financial officer thank you aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer thank you rich operator we have a question from the line of mitch steves with rbc capital markets please go ahead mr steves your line is open you might have your phone muted mitch steves rbc capital markets analyst hey sorry about that can you hear me trac pham chief financial officer hi mitch aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer now we can mitch steves rbc capital markets analyst sorry about that so i have really two questions unfortunately at the pick on track a little bit here but so if i look at the numbers from the guide you guys are giving us like kind of like 21 22 operating margin for q1 but that implies the kind of the rest of the year that q2 to q4 is going to be around 28 6 so wouldn t that mean that basically by 21 you re kind of getting close to high 20s starting the year or am i doing the math incorrectly there trac pham chief financial officer well certainly for the full year we expect to be around 27 operating margin as we ve said in the past the quarterly profile is really an outcome of the plan candidly when i think about the budget for fy 21 99 of my time is really been focused on the full year plan and making sure that we ve got an outlook for revenue growth that is sustaining where we are and are accelerating some areas and then making sure that we re investing in the appropriate places while simultaneously improving margins for this year the outcome of the quarterly profile really is just the timing of these deals so i wouldn t read too much into the quarterly profile and i ll close it out by saying we remain committed to our long term commitment of high 20s in fy 21 and we will comment on that further as the year progresses mitch steves rbc capital markets analyst okay and the second one to add is you guys did have done a few smaller acquisitions lately and that includes employee headcount and so all of that is encapsulated in the full year guide you guys are giving correct meaning that there s going to be no additional opex in that number trac pham chief financial officer yes that s correct mitch steves rbc capital markets analyst okay perfect thank you so much trac pham chief financial officer all right operator we turn to the line of tom diffely with d a davidson please go ahead tom diffely you might have your line on mute tom diffely d a davidson analyst yes hello can you hear me aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer yes we can tom diffely d a davidson analyst all sorts comes today yes so just a quick question when you look at the outlook for 2020 and the nice margin profile if you look at it on a year over year basis how would you split the margin growth from product mix versus overhead absorption versus potentially a fine tune cost structure trac pham chief financial officer it s really kind of across the board the progress that we made this year in 2019 in terms of improving it by 3 percentage points really came across all areas of the business we saw it across the different business groups from sales from the g a functions and it s really a continued and broad based effort for 2020 and beyond that we ll continue to do the same thing it s really fine tuning across all areas of the business tom diffely d a davidson analyst okay great and then when you look at items like ip and hardware that tend to be a little lumpier is there any other are there any trends in 2020 we should know about as far as it can be fourth quarter weighted it can be even after the first quarter any other kind of trends on a quarterly basis trac pham chief financial officer we could probably help you with the quarterly profile in detail but q4 would likely tend to be the highest quarter for us given what we are what our visibility is at this point from both ip and hardware tom diffely d a davidson analyst okay and then final question is ip fairly seasonal at this point i feel like it s always a little bit higher in the second half of the year trac pham chief financial officer we re not really seeing much seasonality in the business and as we said it really depends on the timing of when the ip has delivered or when the ip is pulled down by our customers and you re going to see that variability increase due to 606 so just keep that in mind but overall the demand drivers for ip continues to be really strong and that s reflected in our outlook for 2020 tom diffely d a davidson analyst great thanks for your time today trac pham chief financial officer all right thanks tom operator and next we turn to the line of adam gonzalez with bank of america please go ahead adam gonzalez bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thanks for taking my question can you just help us understand i don t know if you guide out this far but the revenue growth you expect by product group for fiscal 20 is it kind of in line with the longer term targets you set out or is there any substantial deviation in any particular product group thank you trac pham chief financial officer no our long term model spells it out pretty well between eda ip and software integrity and typically we don t break that down quarterly or on an annual basis our view is we do manage this business over a multi year horizon and the beauty of it is that we have been pretty good about managing it within that range over time adam gonzalez bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and the reason why i guess i asked that is because there has been some weaker data points on enterprise spending overall i d imagine you are a bit more insulated from that given the relative size of your sig business but are you seeing any kind of impact from that going into fiscal 20 or again are you insulated from that thank you trac pham chief financial officer those sort of concerns are certainly factored into our guidance i would reference you to how we performed historically and that s the great part of having a business that is close to 90 recurring is that there is adapting effect when things go through different cycles aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer the other thing i would add to that is certainly if you look at the software integrity business it s a business where we re actually very young in an emerging situation and so there are many many customers that we haven t even touched yet and so i think that is a fairly open space now overall obviously we re are subject to the fluctuations of the global markets but from a technology utilization point of view right now i think the demand for technology is quite high and so the rates continues to be quite fast adam gonzalez bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks i ll get back in the queue operator and next we turn to the line of gary mobley with wells fargo securities please go ahead gary mobley wells fargo securities analyst hey everyone i appreciate you taking the question it looks like you re not going to file your 10 k until january 1 so i was hoping that on this call you can share with us your next 12 month backlog which excludes non cancelable fsa and future royalties trac pham chief financial officer we actually don t disclose that information what lisa l ewbank vice president of investor relations in the k trac pham chief financial officer in the k we will discuss that do you have that number i m sorry i don t have that number off the top of my head gary mobley wells fargo securities analyst okay part of the question is is that it looks like you could take you next 12 month backlog as you ve been disclosed in your recent sec filings and you divide that by your next 12 months revenue expectations which is i think the critical juncture now it looks like you re generating more revenue or expect to generate more revenue from next 12 month backlog so just hoping that maybe you can speak to why you guys are sort of modeling in lower turns business as it relates to that trac pham chief financial officer well i ll give you some specific numbers around that the backlog that we have scheduled for fy 20 is roughly 65 that s lower than it s traditionally been mostly because of the transition to 606 and with a hard higher mix of hardware and ip from a modeling perspective when we take take into account what we have visibility to from hardware and ip the range and the range of how we re building the business between backlog and turns and what we have visibility to is pretty consistent with what we ve been managing to over the last few years gary mobley wells fargo securities analyst okay and could you give us an update on the degree of the impact from the entity list not specific to maybe the one big customer but maybe in the entirety aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer well in general as you know we don t disclose the specific customers nor do we disclose the subset of customers obviously it has a negative impact but at the same time the guidance that we gave which i think is rather strong has fully encompass the facts that we assuming zero return or zero revenue from the entity list customers so if things change for the better we will let you know of course immediately but for right now the wisest path is to not comment much more about the situation gary mobley wells fargo securities analyst okay alright didn t you comment in the past that it could be 100 basis point impact to the top line trac pham chief financial officer no we have not provided specific numbers around that gary mobley wells fargo securities analyst okay alright that s it for me thanks guys aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer you re welcome operator next we turn to line of jackson ader with jpmorgan please go ahead jackson ader jpmorgan securities analyst thanks good evening guys first question is on the delay in the emulation and hardware is this something that s just absolutely single customer specific or is it possible that it could be some symptom of a broader trend aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer it was single customer specific jackson ader jpmorgan securities analyst okay okay any just to follow up on that any additional color on that i mean why the delay do you expected in i think rich asked earlier what you expected in the first half or when the actual delivery will be but any additional color you can give there aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer no we don t want to give color because as you know we always very cautious to not comment about specific customers maybe i can give a little color in a different dimension which is we were quite diligent at finding opportunities to grow in a broader set of markets and actually if you look at our verification area and specifically the hardware we did really really well and so we have no doubt that the capabilities we offer the very need for a lot of customers to run their software on prototypes where they don t have the real hardware yet continues to be a great opportunity for us and we continue to both invest there and are bullish about the broader customer sets that we have jackson ader jpmorgan securities analyst okay thank you that is actually helpful color then switching gears to the integrity business the refining of the sales channel and looking to scale this thing to 500 million and beyond so what do you think in the sales channel or sales processes needed to be refined relative to what you re doing in 2019 any additional specifics you can give there aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer well let me just take a first step back given that we ve had the unique experience of growing synopsys literally through these phases as well and i m always thrilled by the fact that enterprises do go through different phases and so the 50 million company is very different than the 100 million and that in term is very different than the 0 25 billion and 500 million again is different and the difference is essentially the complexity of how you manage not only internal product development and management but also the external relationship with the customers and this is certainly also true in the case of the software integrity group because there too there is also a bifurcation between large enterprise customers that typically are cautious and slow in adopting but when they adopt they keep adopting and keep adopting and so they become over time the biggest spenders versus many of the smaller agile companies that very quickly buy a few copies and then it s more ad hoc how they expand on top of that you have the gradual broadening of geography any of the start ups that we acquired originally had certain geographies that they were focused on we of course are a global company and therefore open up broader domains and then the third one which is maybe more marked here that was in the semiconductor domain we originally was in were in is that they deal with individual verticals and so dealing with automotive is different than dealing with the financial sector or the health sector and so on and so you have sort of these multiple variables and now the question is how do you deploy and manage your salespeople and support people i should say against that backdrop of multiple dimensions and that s just another way of saying one continually learns and evolves and as we are looking now to phase 2 which is the crossing of the 0 5 billion and beyond that is essentially what we are talking about when we are saying we have the opportunity to optimize our go to market again and no doubt in 1 5 years we will say it again jackson ader jpmorgan securities analyst okay all right thank you aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer you re welcome operator and next we turn to the line of jay vleeschhouwer with griffin securities please go ahead jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities analyst thank you i ll ask both questions at the same time first for you aart and then for trac aart following up on the conversation we had when you were here in new york a couple of months ago regarding the next big thing in eda you answered that prototyping broadly speaking and new requirement and extraction would be the next growth driver for eda and by that you meant of course not just hardware prototyping and my question is is this already showing itself in new business and how are you investing toward that since it s likely to be a multi year phenomenon and then secondly for trac you spoke of your largest customer in two separate ways but we combine that and could you talk about the total business from the largest customer in fiscal 18 according to last year s k it was 15 4 of your business which worked out to just over 480 million and that was flat with 17 which have been up very strongly so many and now everything you just said about customer did your business in fact grow either proportionately or in absolute terms thanks aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer okay jay the next big thing and of course next is always a function of short term long term medium term you name it but we have to say i sort of agree with my answer that i gave you a number of months ago which is that the more systems we complex the more it s necessary to essentially build mark ups we call those prototypes of them to see how well they work because the working is often illustrated on how well the software runs and the challenges may very well be inside of the hardware but in other words you always have a very complex modeling proposition of how do you create a prototype of the hardware the level of abstraction of the hardware to use that word and then run software on its agency how fast is it how much power does it consume or there weird stops what happens if something breaks can you restart it if it s in the middle of some lock up of things like that and these things become a dramatically more important if the systems also impact life dangerous situations such as driving a car or operating as some machinery and it is very clear that a lot of the world is going is actually in that direction so how well have we done with that well initially we went after some markets that was considered to be extremely slow moving in stodgy and that was the automotive market and that s quite radically changed a few years ago when two things happened one is a car got ha ed jeep and it was literally driven off the street by somebody using a cellphone and secondly people suddenly saw the coming about of autonomous driving with all the potential and the challenges for security and safety and it s been quite remarkable to see how the oems so these are the end car companies have in term pushed on their tier 1 which is their supply chain which in terms pushes on the semiconductor guys which is their supply chain to now start putting all of these capabilities in model so that they can assemble at long before the car is actually already has a prototype and so we ve been central to that and it s been quite rewarding to see how quickly this has advanced on an industry that fundamentally for good reason has to be slow because it has to be safe now the concept i just described actually happens in all of the more sophisticated electronic systems and this is only true also for a cellular phone that has a very short time to market where one can run the software on an emulator for example and actually discover surprises before i actually ships the product so that is one of the many directions that we are going into and it literally takes advantage of our entire stack of relationships in the supply chain and stack of relationships in the technology levels trac pham chief financial officer hi jay this is trac so to your second question you will see in our 10 k filing in a couple of weeks that the revenue for our largest customer will be down in 2019 and that is strictly a function of the hardware decline the rest of the business eda and ip grew very well in 2019 jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities analyst got it thank you if i could squeeze in one more perhaps regarding your headcount your number of ae openings has increased significantly and particularly in the americas where they ve nearly tripled over the last year and up by about 60 over the last year in asia flat in emea so maybe comment on what s driving that growth in ae rex and is it coincidental indicator or leading indicator how are you thinking about filling what is your second largest function by openings after r d aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer jay you always give me the best summary of our hiring practices but the increase of aes invariably has to do with either products that are in deployment and need support as we harvest the opportunity and that s certainly the case in areas such as fusion compiler custom and many of the place of verification or it is a gradual rebalancing of the geography make up as different parts of the world grow different rates or have different needs at various times it is rarely the needs to increase specific skills because our teams are actually quite strong and very broad but every so often bringing in some specialists let s say for example in the prototyping or in the intersection of hardware and software can be quite beneficial as well so the fact that we are hiring i think you can take as a positive in general and adding much more it probably enters the competitive knowledge space i ll refrain from that thank you jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities analyst thank you operator next we turn to the line of jason celino with keybanc capital markets please go ahead jason celino keybanc capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my question one kind of tying back to aart s comments about the sig margins 27 operating margin guidance for full year on track to do the high 20s in fiscal 21 but how should we think about the design margins versus sig margins because i think aart you said that margins won t be as expensive in 2020 but then ramp again in 2021 aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer yes that s correct i think we said that we hold sig probably roughly flat and now of course that means if the rest of the ops margin for the company growth and everybody has to chip in and we have obviously multiple parts in the company everybody is sensitized to the operating margin that we want to achieve for the company and so all of the bus and subgroups are all focusing on how do we get there while at the same time not making any compromises for future growth and so you are probably aware that somewhat loosely we used the rule of 40 as a guideline and so there is room for people to make improvements to get there but on a strongly positive note i think synopsys throughout management is not only sensitize to this desire but very committed and has budget and plans to get there so from year to year i think different bus will get a little bit more or less of a reprieve as a function of the investment needed or corrections or whatever else we need to do but in aggregate we all know that we want to deliver on the numbers that we are guiding you toward jason celino keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then maybe a little more clarification if you can on some of the fiscal responsibility you d see in your eda side because the guidance would suggest most of that improvement would have to come from that business aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer well realize of course that if figures roughly 10 of synopsys is tuned by definition the rest of 90 and we have multiple very different efforts in eda and we have a relatively large but still less than a quarter of the company ip business and so obviously between those different groupings they all have to contribute and if i m not mistaken all but one of the businesses are heading toward improving ops margin one of them is heading a little bit more toward growing the revenue but in aggregate and it s sometimes difficult to measure because they intertwine in the deals and so on but in aggregate it s all heading in the same direction which has put a dent in the rule of 40 jason celino keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you i appreciate the color aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer you re welcome operator next we turn to the line of krish sankar with cowen company please go ahead krish sankar cowen company analyst yes hi thanks for taking my question i have two of them aart i think in your prepared comments you said the sig group could be 0 5 billion in revenues next year if that is the case it looks like your semi and systems division going to grow only like 3 which seems lower than historical is that a function of the entity list or is there anything else going on there and then i have a follow up aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer sorry if i was not clear enough but my statement was that the next milestone is to pass 0 5 billion i did not say that it would pass 1 billion next year and so we gave you a sense of the growth rate for sig at 15 to 20 which we think is a bit above the markets that it is in right now and so fundamentally there is no real change in the past that synopsys is on and all its components from what we did this year and the past year we re fortunate to have a set of businesses that are all doing well some are very profitable also and so it s an aggregate improvement that manifest itself in the financial result largely because of many years of big investments and a number of i think really good acquisitions that got integrated well so we are continuing the pathway and if you want to get a different sense of synopsys then just graph our results over the last 10 years and then you ll see a very different level of stability of how we manage the company krish sankar cowen company analyst got it it s very helpful aart and then just as a follow up a much more longer term industry question given you guys have a good portion of fpga haps hardware and also you completed the acquisition of the dini group recently i m kind of curious from your vantage point and it looks like five years or more than five years out where do you stand on the durability of fpgas for ai applications reduced down on the fpga versus sig debate aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer well the ai field itself is a field that has its own specialty and many many companies that all making different bets and it s useful to take a small step backwards which is fundamentally ai has one need which is much much much much much faster computation well no matter how hard we push on moore s law and so on that s hard to achieve and so the answer by definition has to be therefore architectures will become optimized for different applications now architectures can mean chips it can be groups of chips it can be fpgas it can be a combination of things and actually a number of the very large suppliers who provide combinations of processors together was graphics processors together was fpga pieces all with one objective optimize for an architecture that s appropriate for specific situation and so in many ways we ourselves have been a user of these capabilities because of course we use a lot of computation for our software tools but the hardware tools that we provide is our own way to say for certain tasks such as for simulation we can do much better on an emulator or fpga board so i expect all of these technologies to continue to evolve to continue to be available in various combinations and the race will continually be on of how do you build machines that can do really well my last comment is we ourselves are the provider of tools to a vast vast group of emerging ai companies and this is encouraging because i think those people will not give up for quite a while in trying new architectures and some will ultimately go into very large volume and so in many ways we see a number of those companies as hard technology drivers for synopsys and business wise we re doing very well with them krish sankar cowen company analyst thanks aart aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer you welcome operator and speakers we have no further questions in queue aart de geus chairman and co chief executive officer well given that as you heard we had a very strong 19 we have a great outlook for 20 the market around us which was a bit soft last year looks up slight bit there are a lot of uncertainties as we all know but meanwhile i think we re executing well and this is also a good time to say thank you to you for your support you re often provocative and stimulating questions and we ll be back with some of

seven years at disney she spends her shifts monitoring rides while also answering guest complaints at the park s old west themed land home to the splash mountain flume and country bear jamboree she slips out of sneakers and into black crocs climbs into the car pulls out of the parking lot and heads to a 7 eleven on disney property it happens to be a good night she has enough cash stowed in the sunglasses case above her head to buy gas for the 63 mile drive to her home south of lakeland but sometimes on the worst nights when the tank is on e and she can t scrounge even a few bucks for gas she doesn t leave the lot instead she pulls into a dark corner cracks the windows and reclines the seat all the way back she calls her family and she checks to make sure there s a clean uniform in the back seat for the next day and then she falls asleep waiting for her paycheck to deposit overnight that doesn t happen as often lately alcantara anderson s wages jumped from 11 50 an hour in september 2018 to 14 75 today after disney s agreement with the unions last year to increase pay no unionized disney workers earn less than 13 an hour today compared to last year when nearly 21 000 people made less than 11 but alcantara anderson is still one of about 25 600 disney workers in the union making less than 15 an hour and life in the world s vacation kingdom is still a calculus of choices rent food medicine a birthday gift for her child she and her husband who works at an auto repair shop will make about 45 000 this year wages that will also support her daughter and her sick mother that lands them squarely in the low wage bracket according to guidelines from the department of housing and urban development we have no savings we have no nest egg we have nothing to fall back on said alcantara anderson 28 we pretty much live hand to mouth orlando earned its place among the world s leading vacation spots after years of dizzying growth today nearly 50 years after the magic kingdom opened the region s 75 million visitors surpass london and paris combined the tourism industry employs nearly 280 000 workers in the four counties surrounding orlando accounting for the largest portion of the entire local labor force more than 20 disney employs more than a quarter of those workers or about 77 000 people so many tourism jobs in one place many of them low wage come with a consequence paychecks across all industries in central florida rank dead last among the top 50 metropolitan areas in the united states the median annual wage in the orlando metro is 33 150 lower than in smaller regions such as austin nashville memphis and raleigh n c orlando also falls behind other big tourism towns including las vegas new orleans atlantic city and honolulu according to an analysis of 2018 data from the bureau of labor statistics and wages in the hospitality sector are even lower than the local overall median at 28 289 in the orlando metro graphic container img width

florida is last in that national ranking list too a public transit system in dire need of funding and the region s fits and starts at luring higher wage industries bring the fragility of orlando s low wage workers into focus it s like the gordian knot said eric gray executive director for social service agency united against poverty orlando it s so complicated that people hesitate to want to try and untie it desmond burns a former cook for a contractor at a disney hotel lives in lakeland and drives two hours four days a week to pursue a culinary degree in tampa hoping more education will lead to a higher paying job diego henry after six years at disney still doesn t make enough to move his family of three out of a one bedroom apartment and nicky wilkins endures a more than three hour commute to her job as one of the many theme park employees who rely on the struggling lynx bus system those workers along with alcantara anderson are all active or hold leadership roles in one of the six unions that represent people who work at disney the sentinel also interviewed workers at universal orlando and other hotels and restaurants outside of disney who discussed similar worries about wages housing and transportation many of those workers who do not have protection from a union were reluctant to share their stories publicly for fear of job repercussions do you work in orlando tourism share your story with the orlando sentinel many said they feel left behind amid the region s attractions boom some like alcantara anderson say tourists by design don t see the whole picture they don t realize that when this worker goes home they have a separate life that s not doing so great she said the shadows for alcantara anderson even at 14 75 an hour there s little wiggle room an unexpected expense can mean months of playing catch up like when she was hospitalized for six days in march a bout of bronchitis worsened when she contracted enterovirus and norovirus she ended up with pneumonia and spent a night in the intensive care unit i thought then what would have happened if i would have died that week was pretty much like i was dead because i wasn t here to take care of things she said at the time she was her family s sole income earner when she arrived home from the hospital alcantara anderson discovered her husband dipped into the savings they had at the time to keep bills from piling up with her six sick days used up earlier in the year she d only received a few days worth of short term disability then she looked around their kitchen there was a can of green beans some vinegar gabby alcantara anderson with her daughter chastity mcconnell at their home in mulberry we had eaten the last of our food alcantara anderson said and her 11 year old daughter chastity mcconnell was hungry she came over to me like hey mommy are we going to have dinner today are we going to eat alcantara anderson recalled that was one day where i felt like i had legitimately failed her at the time alcantara anderson s grandmother gave them some ground beef milk bread eggs and cheese to eat but they still wear the episode like a scar as recently as august their checking account was in the red 504 89 bill collectors were calling and yet alcantara anderson is nearly always smiling she started off at disney in a seasonal cooking job and moved on to positions where she could use her outgoing personality to more closely interact with guests her hair is often in two full pigtails and she wears a boba fett tattoo after the star wars bounty hunter on her right shoulder in 2014 she won one of disney s highest cast member honors the disney heroes award for performing cpr on a guest at epcot to save money alcantara anderson lives in a tiny rural town outside of lakeland about an hour and a half from disney in a three bedroom house owned by a relative who cuts her a break on rent the modest home is also close to medical care for her mom who has battled cancer and is legally blind she said she wouldn t be able to afford the same amount of space if she lived closer to the theme parks recently her husband zac anderson took on a second job part time at o reilly auto parts four days a week alcantara anderson who is now temporarily on leave from the magic kingdom to work for the union picks up overtime when she can the extra money helps at the root of many of her family s challenges and the problems other workers face whether they can pay for an education save for a down payment get an ailing tooth pulled is wages said jeremy haicken president of local 737 one of two locals in the unite here labor union that represent 26 000 of the area s disney workers as wages go up people can afford to make healthier choices in how they eat where they buy groceries where they live what kind of housing they have haicken said as wages go up there s a better life here but industry officials say they re limited in what they can do without hurting the local economy the problem we are facing is twofold the customer will only pay so much for a room said mark waltrip chief operating officer for timeshare giant westgate resorts if i said let s pay everyone 25 an hour i would have to double my room rates central florida tourism would crash we are stuck between a rock and a hard place disney spokeswoman andrea finger said the company has set itself apart through its commitment to increase worker pay we re proud of the bar we set to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2021 which is among the highest in the country for entry level employees in the service industry finger said disney also provides health care insurance and benefits including an on site clinic the company offers groceries for employees at near wholesale prices at an on site store as well as discounted child care on disney property with flexible hours through a partnership with the ymca employees who take the bus can save money by using pre tax dollars to buy bus passes disney s aspire education program pays 100 tuition at in network schools including the university of central florida or valencia college for eligible employees more than 11 000 have enrolled so far in addition disney notes its philanthropic efforts across the community the entertainment giant which reported 12 6 billion in profit last year has its name on a pavilion at adventhealth s hospital for children as well as the main theater in the dr phillips center for the performing arts disney also supports second harvest food bank the boys girls club and other charities across central florida however paychecks have barely budged for two decades despite population growth at a rate that far outpaces the national average the region has had some of the slowest growth in per capita personal income when compared to the 10 fastest growing metros just about 8 when adjusted for inflation between 2000 and 2018 that s lower than the national average of more than 20 according to the bureau of economic analysis last year brought a breakthrough disney agreed to its historic minimum wage increase after about a year of negotiations with its unions eric clinton president of local 362 which represents disney attraction and custodial workers said the agreement came about in part because of surging angst over wages across the country eric clinton president of local 362 left and jeremy haicken president of local 737 represent 26 000 of the area s hospitality workers battles to boost minimum wages have erupted from seattle to new york the subject is stump material for 2020 presidential candidates and a low unemployment rate helped too pushing companies to raise pay or benefits to attract candidates there s a lot of anger in the country and a lot of people mobilizing clinton said and our negotiations took place in that sort of context so it wasn t in a vacuum when disney raises wages everyone pays attention seaworld rose to 11 an hour in december 2018 and universal increased its minimum wage to 12 an hour universal which has 25 000 workers will move all employees to 13 an hour next year and to 15 when its new park epic universe opens in 2023 the median hourly wage for theme park attendants in orange county is 10 16 an hour while housekeepers earn 10 63 and fast food cooks make 10 08 according to the most recent data from the bureau of labor statistics trial attorney john morgan is seizing the momentum around wages with a proposed constitutional amendment to lift florida s minimum pay from 8 46 an hour today to 10 by september 2021 and 15 by september 2026 in the past seven years the minimum wage has increased by less than 1 morgan acknowledged his amendment isn t a cure for the many workers who exist just above the poverty line even at 15 an hour some will still struggle when they leave their shifts and become invisible to tourists as well as locals who work outside the service industry people don t want to see it morgan said people don t want to go out to the food bank and watch people in uniform from their day job get free food with their children in hand people don t want to see people sleeping on the street or sleeping in cars the easiest thing is to shut your eyes when you drive past it he said because these people are hidden in the shadows we survive as a community because of this when the magic kingdom opened to fanfare in 1971 orlando s economy began its metamorphosis morgan was just a kid when disney chose orlando and like a lot of people he got a job there he dressed in character as fiddler pig before being promoted to the more coveted role of pluto we couldn t believe it was here he said in this land of lakes that previously hadn t been known for much more than orange groves smaller attractions like the first reptiles at gatorland or the mermaids of weeki wachee springs and a whole lot of heat i think walt disney world made orlando florida seaworld opened quickly after in 1973 and universal followed in 1990 disney now has four main gates plus two water parks and continues to open new attractions such as a star wars themed land and a toy story land universal is planning to open a third park in 2023 orlando international airport is in the middle of a 2 8 billion expansion and the orange county convention center plans to open more meeting space by 2023 we survive as a community because of this said gray the nonprofit director there is no question florida collects nearly 9 of its sales tax 5 1 billion in 2017 from tourists many of them visitors to orlando in orange county about half of all the sales tax collected is from travelers alone the industry is the top property taxpayer in orange county and is expected to bring in an estimated 412 8 million between the theme parks hotels golf courses and businesses on international drive this year according to the county property appraiser s office the money pays for a variety of services including public education road maintenance fire rescue and parks graphic container img width 100 height auto media max width 700px desktop display none mobile display block media min width 701px desktop display block mobile display none bill peeper the first ceo of visit orlando the region s marketing arm said tourism s benefits outweigh the burden brought by a workforce concentrated with low wages are there challenges in that area yes but there are also wonderful opportunities for many of these individuals who would not have another source of livelihood peeper said low wages this sounds like it justifies it but let s not criticize our own community for something that is prevalent throughout the country companies can only do so much one of those challenges the cost of welfare and charity borne by government and private donors the number of households on food stamps or cash public assistance in the orlando metro area rose by 46 from 2010 to 2018 far outpacing population growth in that time period 17 according to the census bureau universal declined an interview for this story saying through spokesman tom schroder that the company has worked hard to be a good employer a good neighbor and a good corporate citizen we are proud of our record and our contribution to the community we are proud of the role tourism has played in our community seaworld also declined an interview hotelier harris rosen who owns eight hotels also did not comment he has earned a reputation as a philanthropist offering his own health care to employees and free schooling and scholarships to children from tangelo park and parramore two impoverished neighborhoods in november he was recognized for those efforts by the orlando economic partnership and noted in his acceptance speech that others in the business community could also do more we ve been trying for years 26 years to convince others to replicate the program rosen said sadly no takers why we have no idea a city in transition for years central florida leaders have tried to lure new high wage industries like film and biotech but there s only been limited success the region s aspirations as hollywood east fizzled along with the state s film tax incentive program a plan to transform florida into the silicon valley of biotechnology also crashed medical research group sanford burnham prebys which state and local leaders promised some 300 million to come to lake nona in southeast orlando created fewer jobs than expected and announced plans to leave town in 2016 after 10 years those losses haven t stopped the region from trying again in kissimmee osceola county s 500 acre neocity recently opened a stem focused high school with courses in areas like advanced manufacturing and biomedical engineering downtown orlando s creative village development is targeting high tech media companies with space for the downtown campuses of ucf and valencia and some affordable housing too and lake nona in southeast orange county boasts nemours children s hospital the veterans affairs medical center and the university of central florida college of medicine but even in higher paying jobs orlando workers still see lower wages compared to other cities according to the bureau of labor statistics 2018 figures the orlando metropolitan region ranked 47th out of 50 in annual median wages for business and financial occupations a developing sector that is often touted as a sign of the growing economy orlando construction wages another booming area ranked 49th while health career wages came in at no 39 and engineers and architects made less too at 44th out of 50 the reason for the lower wages said gray of united against poverty is an abundance of low skilled workers all vying for tourism jobs it depresses the wages in those areas he said the three major reasons why we re not able to attract a higher paying industry in the community are no 1 the lack of skilled labor in this community and no 2 and 3 the lack of skilled labor in this community and because disney universal and major hotel chains are not headquartered in orlando the money travelers spend doesn t necessarily stay here take a family of four visiting walt disney world they may spend about 6 360 on average for flights hotels souvenirs food and park tickets during a four night trip according to a 2017 analysis by money magazine that s as much as alcantara anderson the frontierland low level manager makes in about three months about 35 of the money vacationing families spend in the orlando region goes elsewhere according to an analysis for the orlando sentinel by implan a provider of economic impact software used by economists those dollars are sent to out of state company headquarters and manufacturers overseas known in the industry as leakage the figure is about average compared to other tourism destinations but when that s what most of your economy relies on it can be a problem said owen beitsch senior director of economic and real estate advisory services at gai consultants orlando has only one fortune 500 company headquarters olive garden parent darden restaurants i think we do lose what i would call some quality of life things we arguably do lose some significant presence that sends a signal to the rest of the world beitsch said but the major economic consequence is that the money that does get spent here is not for the highest wage jobs orlando mayor buddy dyer said he s well familiar with the local economy s pitfalls you re not going to talk to any elected official that doesn t talk about diversification of our economy dyer said and we ve actually done a pretty good job of that but the tourism component of it so outshines everything else that s there that the region s fledgling industries don t get as much attention while orlando is cemented as a tourism town dyer and other officials haven t stopped showering attractions and hotels with public dollars in the past fiscal year the orange county economic development office spent 2 9 million to attract high wage companies the department said in that same time visit orlando s budget rose to 65 4 million according to the county comptroller s office money that will largely be spent marketing tourism and convention spaces in orange county so conservatively for every 1 orange county spent to diversify its economy it spent about 22 49 to bring more tourists my job is everything alcantara anderson knows what it s like to make good money she did once as a radiology technician in tampa before bad working conditions pushed her to leave burns the cook knows it too he was a mechanic before pursuing a second career in culinary arts he worked at disney s coronado springs resort as a prep line cook making 13 an hour until september when he left to look for higher pay for the better part of this year burns journey to a new life has been a drive through punishing traffic from his home in lakeland to cooking classes at the art institute of tampa it s been long days and even longer nights traversing the belly of the state with a composition book in his passenger seat door and his daughter s pink backpack now his in his trunk as a single dad he worries his kids will one day fall in the same cycle of poverty that he s trying to break when he has to tell his straight a daughter that he couldn t afford the 70 fee to put her in her high school honor society or his son that he didn t have enough for his 48 driving learners permit he wonders if the classes will be worth the extra hours he sacrifices away from home i m trying to build something now not only for my kids if something happens but for my grandkids and so on he said that s the fire behind this that my parents were not able to leave me anything subscribe max width 1000px height auto margin left auto margin right auto

one that ignites when you do something you really love alcantara anderson and many of the theme park and hotel workers interviewed by the sentinel said they never liked their old jobs as much as their tourism jobs positions that in many ways seemed like dreams come true the kind of thing animated princesses sing about they love the feeling that comes with coaxing a smile out of a child spending time on a special meal or helping a harried parent relax and get more out of their vacation hospitality comes easily to them paying the bills on a service paycheck does not it s not like one of those boring jobs where she s just into it for the money said alcantara anderson s daughter chastity 11 she s in it because it s something she wanted to do it was chastity s first day of middle school and alcantara anderson was sitting on her couch in their single story home near lakeland listening to her talk but i work a lot huh alcantara anderson responded i don t really get to see you that often sometimes chastity nodded most days alcantara anderson leaves for work two hours early to be sure she s at the magic kingdom on time when she gets out at midnight the drive back will take an hour if she s lucky then she cooks dinner for her family for the next evening does laundry cleans up most nights she ll sit outside in her car and play a little sudoku the quiet is often interrupted by the sound of cicadas it s her only alone time she goes to bed at 3 or 4 a m it s then when the stress catches up with her those moments without the distractions and the drive without the go go go of checking up on her daughter s homework crunching numbers on bills and medical appointments for her mom the fear creeps in if she calls out of work she worries will they think i m unreliable will they bump me down from my coordinator role for someone who doesn t have a sick mom and a pre teen to care for i would lose everything i couldn t i couldn t do it she said her voice breaking up i m just terrified of that because for her two things are true at once life at 14 75 an hour is a daily test of will but her happiness and her livelihood also depend on being employed at disney to me my job s everything she said to my family my job is everything orlando sentinel staff writer gabrielle russon former staff writer kyle arnold and data specialist adelaide chen contributed to this report this

a sweeping tax overhaul signed by president donald trump pushed us rates to among the lowest in the world last year the organization for economic cooperation and development said thursday the us posted a steeper drop in tax rates than any other oecd country in 2018 falling to 24 3 of gross domestic product from 26 8 a year earlier that put it roughly 10 points below the organization s annual average rate just three of the 34 countries analyzed chile ireland and mexico had lower tax burdens than the us last year the decline was driven by a 1 5 trillion tax cut package republicans passed in 2017 which was the largest in decades advertisement major reforms to personal and corporate taxes in the united states prompted a significant drop in tax revenues the oecd said in the 12 months after the law took effect in january 2018 tax revenues declined even as economic growth picked up corporate tax revenue fell by 0 7 percentage points while personal income tax revenues slipped 0 5 percentage points along with increased government spending that has lifted the us budget deficit to record highs in july the white house and congress agreed to lift the debt ceiling and increase spending by approximately 320 billion the gap between federal receipts and outlays is expected to surpass 1 trillion for the 2020 fiscal year economists and policymakers have warned that the current pace of deficit growth in the us was unsustainable and would undermine tools to fight a recession even with lower rates and even with decent growth there is still going to be a need to reduce these deficits federal reserve chairman jerome powell told a congressional committee in november frankly if we don t do it what happens is our children will wind up spending their tax dollars on interest rather than things they really need advertisement oecd see also advertisement
dr david bull brexit party 1 what are three key local issues facing your constituency and how would you address them council tax sedgefield has one of the highest rates of council tax in england a household worth up to 40 000 pays 1368 03 just 139 67 less than a house worth 2 million pays in westminster furthermore 12 5 of sedgefield households are single occupancy under labour s plan to scrap the single occupancy discount on council tax 25 these constituents will end up paying 342 more a year this is unfair and unacceptable i would address this issue by working closely with the council and make every effort to reduce the extortionate rate of council tax that my constituents endure alcohol abuse throughout 2015 2018 there was an average of 53 1 per 100 000 of under 18s being admitted to hospital for alcohol related conditions within county durham one of the highest rates of admissions in the country with 707 per 100 000 for adults sedgefield has a real issue with alcohol issues which is caused due to the deindustrialisation and loss of prosperity throughout the 80s steelworks and mines were ripped away and the area has never recovered economically as a doctor i m very concerned about this i would devote myself to ensuring my constituents have the help and necessary services to intervene before it s too late secondly i will ensure that prosperity returns through investment to secure well paying and stable jobs for the people of sedgefield health and wellbeing almost a quarter 24 1 of constituents in sedgefield report having just adequate or bad health one of the highest scores of ill health in the country this is down to the recent cuts to nearby hospitals and social care services it is simply not good enough it is unacceptable to have a postcode lottery of health where you live should not determine your wellbeing i am fiercely passionate about this and i will address this issue by fighting tooth and nail for more nhs investment in sedgefield guaranteeing the nhs remains free at the point of need and readily available for those who need it most 2 leave remain or second referendum what is your stance on brexit and why we voted to leave and we must leave being liberated to trade tariff free with the rest of the world will reduce the cost of living immensely as a country we import 68 75m worth of dutch onions every year dutch onions have an average production cost of 123 75 per ton whereas india has a production cost of 68 19 per ton by striking a trade agreement with india we could drastically reduce the cost of onions examples like these are not just commonplace for all foods but clothing and medicines too i believe that not only will brexit cut the cost of living it could also be vital in the preservation of the nhs 3 should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services like the nhs absolutely not we as individuals in the uk are paying extortionate rates of tax especially my constituency of sedgefield with ludicrous council tax rates public services like the nhs definitely need more money but this financial burden can no longer be forced upon the tax payer we can redirect state funds like scrapping hs2 and halving the foreign aid budget and funnel this money into public services that are in dire need of it 4 high streets are struggling what would you do to rescue them i would enforce the brexit party s contract with the people policy of scrapping business rates for high street shops outside the m25 to reduce the cost of running a high street shop in addition i would want to impose a small sales tax on internet giants like amazon to fund the scrapping of business rates and help fund regeneration projects of our high streets 5 what does the northern powerhouse need to make it work investment the northern powerhouse does not need the vanity project of hs2 it needs genuine local rail and road infrastructure investment it also needs investment in industry to return prosperity to the north not only will this revitalise the north but in addition in post brexit britain a multitude of free trade deals across the world will not only boost these industries but will also attract foreign investment this will return high paid stable jobs this won t just make the northern powerhouse work it will make the northern powerhouse thrive john furness green party 1 what are three key local issues facing your constituency and how would you address them the key local issues are climate climate climate if we do then we generate jobs and improve our wellbeing we would do this by sustainable cheap and public transport cycling walking rail and electric vehicles renewable energy for the home and nation locally sourced food grown non instensively e g organically and not flown from usa we have campaigned with partners like friends of the earth for tree planting and are working to find areas to plant them 2 leave remain or second referendum what is your stance on brexit and why if a medical or any scientific study of a new drug had an outcome like the referendum 51 9 v 48 9 it would not be statistically significant change would not happen without further research if a medical study was dishonest in its method it would not be published and the authors would be referred for professional misconduct and probably struck off the medical register 3 should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services like the nhs yes but not everyone and not just the nhs the wellbeing of a society is better the narrower the gap between the poorest and wealthiest health is a matter of environment climate housing employment nutrition education social services nutrition a caring society and good international relations 4 high streets are struggling what would you do to rescue them tackling climate change by travelling less and living sourcing and buying goods locally will mean the return of the high street 5 what does the northern powerhouse need to make it work northern powerhouse what s that but lip service we all need less flooding to tackle climate change work and learn together and look after the weakest and most vulnerable this is not politics as usual we are honest that the middle and upper classes will have a drop in living standards but everyone will feel better and the planet will last longer if not now when phil wilson labour 1 what are three key local issues facing your constituency and how would you address them irresponsible private landlords are a problem 20 of households are private lets they deserve protection neighbourhoods deserve respect i ve fought in parliament for a national register to keep tabs on landlords the county council is aiming to introduce such a scheme the tories have pushed local schools to breaking point children are taught in larger classes with fewer resources i want fairer funding and targeted resources for the children who need it most our nhs is under immense strain after conservative cuts local people cannot get gp appointments and surgeries are closing i will continue to fight for local services 2 leave remain or second referendum what is your stance on brexit and why brexit is not as simple as the leave campaign promised in the referendum boris johnson knows that his deal won t get brexit done he needs to be honest and tell you if he gets his way brexit will go on and on it will take years to renegotiate existing trade deals i believe voters have the right to compare his tory brexit with the promises he made in 2016 you should have the final say the implications are enormous for the nhs jobs and the sheer length of time brexit will take at the expense of everything else 3 should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services like the nhs after almost a decade of tory government our public services are in desperate need of funding but this burden shouldn t fall on the people who are already working hard and struggling to make a living but those with the broadest shoulders who can afford it i don t think it s too much to ask the wealthiest people in our country pay their way however i do believe it s crucial to be responsible and disciplined with the public s finances and money should only be borrowed to invest whether that s infrastructure projects public services or steps to tackle climate change 4 high streets are struggling what would you do to rescue them it saddens me to see our high streets struggling at least 9 different bank branches have closed across the constituency since the last election it seems that every week another store is closing we need to look at how we can diversify the high street to make it more attractive to customers level the playing field for high street retailers who are struggling to compete against amazon and re purpose empty shops so they are put to good use newton aycliffe will not see investment from the government s future high street fund again the north will miss out 5 what does the northern powerhouse need to make it work the north of england is missing out on massive investment in our infrastructure and transport which is critical to making our region function if the north is missing out so is county durham for example if the government was serious about the northern powerhouse they would ensure that transport expenditure in our region wasn t falling when compared with london if we were receiving the same as the capital the north would have seen an additional 63 billion spent on the region more for buses roads and trains we want to see substance not warm words dawn welsh liberal democrats 1 what are three key local issues facing your constituency and how would you address them better integrated public transport is key to delivering sustainable growth in sedgefield and across the region as is the creation of more and better jobs in places such as trimdon and wingate i will be fighting for sedgefield to have greater powers of self determination through devolved powers which will unlock access to the funding and authority we need to solve these two issues for the many farming communities in the constituency i will continue argue the case that brexit will be bad for our farmers and work hard to prevent any negative impact on their livelihoods caused by brexit 2 leave remain or second referendum what is your stance on brexit and why i believe brexit will be bad for our country and catastrophic for our region because 60 of north east exports go to the eu before joining the eu we were the sick man of europe our region was on its knees and for our children s sake i don t want those days to return i ve seen how eu membership has attracted investment from companies like hitachi and nissan improved social mobility through the european social fund and taken the uk economy to the 5th strongest in the world if there were to be a second referendum i would absolutely campaign for remain 3 should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services like the nhs our public services have suffered dreadfully at the hands of an unencumbered right wing tory government every one of us in some way will hold our own personal debt of gratitude to the fantastic work our nhs and social care services do and i am sure many will agree they deserve to be properly funded the liberal democrats propose a modest rise of 1p on income tax raising 35 1 billion over the next 5 years with 11 2 billion ringfenced for our too often neglected mental health services i fully support this policy because it is the right thing to do 4 high streets are struggling what would you do to rescue them with a background in helping set up and run family retail businesses i personally understand the many challenges retailers face i will be committed to working with regional leaders in the development of long term plans for the growth and development of sedgefield s town centres i will work with small business support services in the region to help small business owners and start ups access support and funding i will also work towards reforming both planning and business rates legislation to help our ailing high streets and to help create vibrant places for people to work shop and socialise in 5 what does the northern powerhouse need to make it work the northern powerhouse for too long has focused on the m62 corridor the north east needs to grasp the opportunities presented by devolved powers to the region for our voice to be heard loud and clear and for sedgefield to benefit this is something which north east labour have spectacularly failed to do they are too busy squabbling amongst themselves rather than putting the north east region first we need our share of investment in road and rail infrastructure public transport and training and skills to create more and better jobs i will be resolutely determined to make this happen paul howell conservative 1 what are three key local issues facing your constituency and how would you address them the sedgefield constituency has 3 distinct parts to it the darlington borough council wards the villages of durham county council and the town of newton aycliffe each of these has distinct strengths and issues but they all require an mp who listens and reflects their concerns into westminster my priority would be to engage better to find out the real needs of each and i would do this by creating forums for engagement with local people rather than to ignore them my current thoughts would be to focus on inward investment training and rural transport 2 leave remain or second referendum what is your stance on brexit and why we need to leave we had a referendum and a result in my opinion democracy is far more important than economics and we have to respect the decision of the british people business is harmed far more by uncertainty than almost anything else there were many statements from both sides in the referendum that were at best overstated or exaggerated but the message from the british people was clear in that as a whole after considering all of the information that they wanted to leave so that is what we must do 3 should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services like the nhs i believe that taxes should be kept to a minimum level required to support services required and it is about ensuring that we get value for money from our investments in services for the tax payer there needs to be a fair basis for the allocation of national funds to local authorities police and fire services etc as the ability of our authorities to raise local taxes is not as great as wealthier parts of the uk having served on both local councils and the combined fire authority i understand the dynamics and the need for fair funding 4 high streets are struggling what would you do to rescue them high streets have many different strengths and weaknesses and each has its own distinct solution required sedgefield does not contain a major retail centre with even the largest in newton aycliffe not one that would contain a marks and spencer or house of fraser instead it has a high number of small centres and the primary way to help these is to generate a need for people to visit and an encouragement to people to spend locally the reason to visit has to come from either good shops or some form of event or occasion that stimulates footfall 5 what does the northern powerhouse need to make it work the northern powerhouse needs the backing of local and national politicians to promote and deliver its agenda ben houchen the conservative leader of the tees valley combined authority is showing what can be done and we need more energy like his behind it but phil wilson was noticeably quiet on the key airport agenda despite it being in his constituency i would like to see core infrastructure investment prioritised and if elected this would be one of my primary points of focus as i fully support the prime ministers agenda to start to rebalance the north v south economic disparity michael joyce independent 1 what are three key local issues facing your constituency and how would you address them my three local issues are crime schooling and investment crime seems to be one of the main issues of sedgefield s constituency for example the co op on the main street in sedgefield has been broken into six times so one has to ask the question how has this been able to happen why hasn t the store been able to implement crime prevention such as electric shutters has the council stopped it or is it the local community as mp for sedgefield i would make this a priority to investigate this schooling why has the council stopped the funding for free school bus services to and from chilton to the secondary school in ferryhill surely as a matter of safety for the children and due to this time of year with the dark nights why are the children walking from ferryhill past allotments where drug users and criminals are known to be frequent in the area to just get home surely as a matter of urgency this service needs to resume investments in sedgefield itself we have a science park the only one in britain and at ferryhill we have an industrial estate ready to be used in chilton we have a pharmaceutical company we also have a tanker company but the main area is aycliffe which consists of engineering manufacturing electronics logistics and hitachi all of these areas are within spitting distances of two major motorway routes a1 north and south and the a19 heading to the north with the infrastructure already in place it has great and superb potential for local investment 2 leave remain or second referendum what is your stance on brexit and why as a staunch leave voter on the 23rd june 2016 17 4million people voted to leave so 3 years and 4 brexit extensions down the line the politicians have caused total chaos due to them not following the democratic decision of the people you cannot trust the main parties to make this decision as both lie and do not tell the people the full story brexit needs to happen as this would cause stability within the country and a saving of 20 billion a year of membership and membership only 3 should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services like the nhs taxes would not have to be raised to help the nhs as money could be found from the cancelation of hs2 this would be a saving of 56 billion also the cancelation of our membership cost to the eu at 20 billion this would give us an available fund of 76 billion which could be invested into a number of issues one being the nhs at the present moment privatisation of the nhs is happening in 1992 john major conservative started the process of pfi private finance initiatives following the rules set by the european union in 1997 labour came to power under tony blair and gordon brown where they allowed the pfi to take route the problem at the moment is not the new contracts as they can be stopped it s the old contracts that are up and running that are valid for 30 35 years the nhs has been crippled under the pfi and it will cost up to 200 billion to get out of these contracts due to the companies able to sue the government for loss of earnings so when both conservative and labour say that the nhs will not be privatised they are both already lying as the nhs is ran by these private companies so any additional funding given by the government does not go to the people who need it i e the doctors and nurses it goes to the private companies who are only accountable to their share holders 4 high streets are struggling what would you do to rescue them 40 thousand jobs have been lost or are at risk household names like house of fraser marks and spencer s have been forced to close and take a long look at how they do business the town centres need more support from the councils such things as a look at the property rent and the parking charges so the council and the local traders need to work together to resolve these issues investing more in skills for residents to create the educated work force that future town centres need to thrive 5 what does the northern powerhouse need to make it work the northern powerhouse needs the backing of local and national politicians to promote and deliver its agenda ben houchen the conservative leader of the tees valley combined authority is showing what can be done and we need more energy like his behind it but phil wilson was noticeably quiet on the key airport agenda despite it being in his constituency i would like to see core infrastructure investment prioritised and if elected this would be one of my primary points of focus as i fully support the prime ministers agenda to start to rebalance the north v south economic disparity

prince costumes unbuttoned and backpacks hanging from the shoulders of their colonial period dresses flip flops on lunch boxes in hand legions of workers stream into an employee parking lot at walt disney world weary from another shift of making magic at the world s busiest theme park this is the place where the pixie dust loses its sparkle it s where the low wage workers who power orlando s tourism machine leave the attractions hotels and eateries and fade into a community that doesn t have enough affordable housing public transportation or opportunities in industries with higher paying jobs table contents width 100 a year after a landmark decision by disney to raise its minimum wage for about 40 000 union workers to 15 an hour by 2021 many of those employees are better off by october the number of unionized workers earning more than 15 an hour had more than quadrupled to 13 057 compared to august 2018 according to the service trades council union but people earning near the 15 mark long considered the gold standard for a living wage still find their paychecks barely cover the basics so they move farther from the attractions to find lower rent and make difficult decisions each month about whether they can pay overdue medical bills or buy enough groceries to feed a family they re people like gabby alcantara anderson gabby alcantara anderson unwinds in her car after a day of work at magic kingdom alcantara anderson has spent nearly a decade at disney and earned promotions beyond entry level yet her family struggles to make ends meet she hops off an employee bus at the lot for magic kingdom workers at 12 12 a m on a humid september night and makes a beeline for her kia soul where a permit on the back window reads frontierland cast member after almost seven years at disney she spends her shifts monitoring rides while also answering guest complaints at the park s old west themed land home to the splash mountain flume and country bear jamboree she slips out of sneakers and into black crocs climbs into the car pulls out of the parking lot and heads to a 7 eleven on disney property it happens to be a good night she has enough cash stowed in the sunglasses case above her head to buy gas for the 63 mile drive to her home south of lakeland but sometimes on the worst nights when the tank is on e and she can t scrounge even a few bucks for gas she doesn t leave the lot instead she pulls into a dark corner cracks the windows and reclines the seat all the way back she calls her family and she checks to make sure there s a clean uniform in the back seat for the next day and then she falls asleep waiting for her paycheck to deposit overnight that doesn t happen as often lately alcantara anderson s wages jumped from 11 50 an hour in september 2018 to 14 75 today after disney s agreement with the unions last year to increase pay no unionized disney workers earn less than 13 an hour today compared to last year when nearly 21 000 people made less than 11 but alcantara anderson is still one of about 25 600 disney workers in the union making less than 15 an hour and life in the world s vacation kingdom is still a calculus of choices rent food medicine a birthday gift for her child she and her husband who works at an auto repair shop will make about 45 000 this year wages that will also support her daughter and her sick mother that lands them squarely in the low wage bracket according to guidelines from the department of housing and urban development we have no savings we have no nest egg we have nothing to fall back on said alcantara anderson 28 we pretty much live hand to mouth orlando earned its place among the world s leading vacation spots after years of dizzying growth today nearly 50 years after the magic kingdom opened the region s 75 million visitors surpass london and paris combined the tourism industry employs nearly 280 000 workers in the four counties surrounding orlando accounting for the largest portion of the entire local labor force more than 20 disney employs more than a quarter of those workers or about 77 000 people so many tourism jobs in one place many of them low wage come with a consequence paychecks across all industries in central florida rank dead last among the top 50 metropolitan areas in the united states the median annual wage in the orlando metro is 33 150 lower than in smaller regions such as austin nashville memphis and raleigh n c orlando also falls behind other big tourism towns including las vegas new orleans atlantic city and honolulu according to an analysis of 2018 data from the bureau of labor statistics and wages in the hospitality sector are even lower than the local overall median at 28 289 in the orlando metro graphic container img width

florida is last in that national ranking list too a public transit system in dire need of funding and the region s fits and starts at luring higher wage industries bring the fragility of orlando s low wage workers into focus it s like the gordian knot said eric gray executive director for social service agency united against poverty orlando it s so complicated that people hesitate to want to try and untie it desmond burns a former cook for a contractor at a disney hotel lives in lakeland and drives two hours four days a week to pursue a culinary degree in tampa hoping more education will lead to a higher paying job diego henry after six years at disney still doesn t make enough to move his family of three out of a one bedroom apartment and nicky wilkins endures a more than three hour commute to her job as one of the many theme park employees who rely on the struggling lynx bus system those workers along with alcantara anderson are all active or hold leadership roles in one of the six unions that represent people who work at disney the sentinel also interviewed workers at universal orlando and other hotels and restaurants outside of disney who discussed similar worries about wages housing and transportation many of those workers who do not have protection from a union were reluctant to share their stories publicly for fear of job repercussions do you work in orlando tourism share your story with the orlando sentinel many said they feel left behind amid the region s attractions boom some like alcantara anderson say tourists by design don t see the whole picture they don t realize that when this worker goes home they have a separate life that s not doing so great she said the shadows for alcantara anderson even at 14 75 an hour there s little wiggle room an unexpected expense can mean months of playing catch up like when she was hospitalized for six days in march a bout of bronchitis worsened when she contracted enterovirus and norovirus she ended up with pneumonia and spent a night in the intensive care unit i thought then what would have happened if i would have died that week was pretty much like i was dead because i wasn t here to take care of things she said at the time she was her family s sole income earner when she arrived home from the hospital alcantara anderson discovered her husband dipped into the savings they had at the time to keep bills from piling up with her six sick days used up earlier in the year she d only received a few days worth of short term disability then she looked around their kitchen there was a can of green beans some vinegar gabby alcantara anderson with her daughter chastity mcconnell at their home in mulberry we had eaten the last of our food alcantara anderson said and her 11 year old daughter chastity mcconnell was hungry she came over to me like hey mommy are we going to have dinner today are we going to eat alcantara anderson recalled that was one day where i felt like i had legitimately failed her at the time alcantara anderson s grandmother gave them some ground beef milk bread eggs and cheese to eat but they still wear the episode like a scar as recently as august their checking account was in the red 504 89 bill collectors were calling and yet alcantara anderson is nearly always smiling she started off at disney in a seasonal cooking job and moved on to positions where she could use her outgoing personality to more closely interact with guests her hair is often in two full pigtails and she wears a boba fett tattoo after the star wars bounty hunter on her right shoulder in 2014 she won one of disney s highest cast member honors the disney heroes award for performing cpr on a guest at epcot to save money alcantara anderson lives in a tiny rural town outside of lakeland about an hour and a half from disney in a three bedroom house owned by a relative who cuts her a break on rent the modest home is also close to medical care for her mom who has battled cancer and is legally blind she said she wouldn t be able to afford the same amount of space if she lived closer to the theme parks recently her husband zac anderson took on a second job part time at o reilly auto parts four days a week alcantara anderson who is now temporarily on leave from the magic kingdom to work for the union picks up overtime when she can the extra money helps at the root of many of her family s challenges and the problems other workers face whether they can pay for an education save for a down payment get an ailing tooth pulled is wages said jeremy haicken president of local 737 one of two locals in the unite here labor union that represent 26 000 of the area s disney workers as wages go up people can afford to make healthier choices in how they eat where they buy groceries where they live what kind of housing they have haicken said as wages go up there s a better life here but industry officials say they re limited in what they can do without hurting the local economy the problem we are facing is twofold the customer will only pay so much for a room said mark waltrip chief operating officer for timeshare giant westgate resorts if i said let s pay everyone 25 an hour i would have to double my room rates central florida tourism would crash we are stuck between a rock and a hard place disney spokeswoman andrea finger said the company has set itself apart through its commitment to increase worker pay we re proud of the bar we set to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour by 2021 which is among the highest in the country for entry level employees in the service industry finger said disney also provides health care insurance and benefits including an on site clinic the company offers groceries for employees at near wholesale prices at an on site store as well as discounted child care on disney property with flexible hours through a partnership with the ymca employees who take the bus can save money by using pre tax dollars to buy bus passes disney s aspire education program pays 100 tuition at in network schools including the university of central florida or valencia college for eligible employees more than 11 000 have enrolled so far in addition disney notes its philanthropic efforts across the community the entertainment giant which reported 12 6 billion in profit last year has its name on a pavilion at adventhealth s hospital for children as well as the main theater in the dr phillips center for the performing arts disney also supports second harvest food bank the boys girls club and other charities across central florida however paychecks have barely budged for two decades despite population growth at a rate that far outpaces the national average the region has had some of the slowest growth in per capita personal income when compared to the 10 fastest growing metros just about 8 when adjusted for inflation between 2000 and 2018 that s lower than the national average of more than 20 according to the bureau of economic analysis last year brought a breakthrough disney agreed to its historic minimum wage increase after about a year of negotiations with its unions eric clinton president of local 362 which represents disney attraction and custodial workers said the agreement came about in part because of surging angst over wages across the country eric clinton president of local 362 left and jeremy haicken president of local 737 represent 26 000 of the area s hospitality workers battles to boost minimum wages have erupted from seattle to new york the subject is stump material for 2020 presidential candidates and a low unemployment rate helped too pushing companies to raise pay or benefits to attract candidates there s a lot of anger in the country and a lot of people mobilizing clinton said and our negotiations took place in that sort of context so it wasn t in a vacuum when disney raises wages everyone pays attention seaworld rose to 11 an hour in december 2018 and universal increased its minimum wage to 12 an hour universal which has 25 000 workers will move all employees to 13 an hour next year and to 15 when its new park epic universe opens in 2023 the median hourly wage for theme park attendants in orange county is 10 16 an hour while housekeepers earn 10 63 and fast food cooks make 10 08 according to the most recent data from the bureau of labor statistics trial attorney john morgan is seizing the momentum around wages with a proposed constitutional amendment to lift florida s minimum pay from 8 46 an hour today to 10 by september 2021 and 15 by september 2026 in the past seven years the minimum wage has increased by less than 1 morgan acknowledged his amendment isn t a cure for the many workers who exist just above the poverty line even at 15 an hour some will still struggle when they leave their shifts and become invisible to tourists as well as locals who work outside the service industry people don t want to see it morgan said people don t want to go out to the food bank and watch people in uniform from their day job get free food with their children in hand people don t want to see people sleeping on the street or sleeping in cars the easiest thing is to shut your eyes when you drive past it he said because these people are hidden in the shadows we survive as a community because of this when the magic kingdom opened to fanfare in 1971 orlando s economy began its metamorphosis morgan was just a kid when disney chose orlando and like a lot of people he got a job there he dressed in character as fiddler pig before being promoted to the more coveted role of pluto we couldn t believe it was here he said in this land of lakes that previously hadn t been known for much more than orange groves smaller attractions like the first reptiles at gatorland or the mermaids of weeki wachee springs and a whole lot of heat i think walt disney world made orlando florida seaworld opened quickly after in 1973 and universal followed in 1990 disney now has four main gates plus two water parks and continues to open new attractions such as a star wars themed land and a toy story land universal is planning to open a third park in 2023 orlando international airport is in the middle of a 2 8 billion expansion and the orange county convention center plans to open more meeting space by 2023 we survive as a community because of this said gray the nonprofit director there is no question florida collects nearly 9 of its sales tax 5 1 billion in 2017 from tourists many of them visitors to orlando in orange county about half of all the sales tax collected is from travelers alone the industry is the top property taxpayer in orange county and is expected to bring in an estimated 412 8 million between the theme parks hotels golf courses and businesses on international drive this year according to the county property appraiser s office the money pays for a variety of services including public education road

none bill peeper the first ceo of visit orlando the region s marketing arm said tourism s benefits outweigh the burden brought by a workforce concentrated with low wages are there challenges in that area yes but there are also wonderful opportunities for many of these individuals who would not have another source of livelihood peeper said low wages this sounds like it justifies it but let s not criticize our own community for something that is prevalent throughout the country companies can only do so much one of those challenges the cost of welfare and charity borne by government and private donors the number of households on food stamps or cash public assistance in the orlando metro area rose by 46 from 2010 to 2018 far outpacing population growth in that time period 17 according to the census bureau universal declined an interview for this story saying through spokesman tom schroder that the company has worked hard to be a good employer a good neighbor and a good corporate citizen we are proud of our record and our contribution to the community we are proud of the role tourism has played in our community seaworld also declined an interview hotelier harris rosen who owns eight hotels also did not comment he has earned a reputation as a philanthropist offering his own health care to employees and free schooling and scholarships to children from tangelo park and parramore two impoverished neighborhoods in november he was recognized for those efforts by the orlando economic partnership and noted in his acceptance speech that others in the business community could also do more we ve been trying for years 26 years to convince others to replicate the program rosen said sadly no takers why we have no idea a city in transition for years central florida leaders have tried to lure new high wage industries like film and biotech but there s only been limited success the region s aspirations as hollywood east fizzled along with the state s film tax incentive program a plan to transform florida into the silicon valley of biotechnology also crashed medical research group sanford burnham prebys which state and local leaders promised some 300 million to come to lake nona in southeast orlando created fewer jobs than expected and announced plans to leave town in 2016 after 10 years those losses haven t stopped the region from trying again in kissimmee osceola county s 500 acre neocity recently opened a stem focused high school with courses in areas like advanced manufacturing and biomedical engineering downtown orlando s creative village development is targeting high tech media companies with space for the downtown campuses of ucf and valencia and some affordable housing too and lake nona in southeast orange county boasts nemours children s hospital the veterans affairs medical center and the university of central florida college of medicine but even in higher paying jobs orlando workers still see lower wages compared to other cities according to the bureau of labor statistics 2018 figures the orlando metropolitan region ranked 47th out of 50 in annual median wages for business and financial occupations a developing sector that is often touted as a sign of the growing economy orlando construction wages another booming area ranked 49th while health career wages came in at no 39 and engineers and architects made less too at 44th out of 50 the reason for the lower wages said gray of united against poverty is an abundance of low skilled workers all vying for tourism jobs it depresses the wages in those areas he said the three major reasons why we re not able to attract a higher paying industry in the community are no 1 the lack of skilled labor in this community and no 2 and 3 the lack of skilled labor in this community and because disney universal and major hotel chains are not headquartered in orlando the money travelers spend doesn t necessarily stay here take a family of four visiting walt disney world they may spend about 6 360 on average for flights hotels souvenirs food and park tickets during a four night trip according to a 2017 analysis by money magazine that s as much as alcantara anderson the frontierland low level manager makes in about three months about 35 of the money vacationing families spend in the orlando region goes elsewhere according to an analysis for the orlando sentinel by implan a provider of economic impact software used by economists those dollars are sent to out of state company headquarters and manufacturers overseas known in the industry as leakage the figure is about average compared to other tourism destinations but when that s what most of your economy relies on it can be a problem said owen beitsch senior director of economic and real estate advisory services at gai consultants orlando has only one fortune 500 company headquarters olive garden parent darden restaurants i think we do lose what i would call some quality of life things we arguably do lose some significant presence that sends a signal to the rest of the world beitsch said but the major economic consequence is that the money that does get spent here is not for the highest wage jobs orlando mayor buddy dyer said he s well familiar with the local economy s pitfalls you re not going to talk to any elected official that doesn t talk about diversification of our economy dyer said and we ve actually done a pretty good job of that but the tourism component of it so outshines everything else that s there that the region s fledgling industries don t get as much attention while orlando is cemented as a tourism town dyer and other officials haven t stopped showering attractions and hotels with public dollars in the past fiscal year the orange county economic development office spent 2 9 million to attract high wage companies the department said in that same time visit orlando s budget rose to 65 4 million according to the county comptroller s office money that will largely be spent marketing tourism and convention spaces in orange county so conservatively for every 1 orange county spent to diversify its economy it spent about 22 49 to bring more tourists my job is everything alcantara anderson knows what it s like to make good money she did once as a radiology technician in tampa before bad working conditions pushed her to leave burns the cook knows it too he was a mechanic before pursuing a second career in culinary arts he worked at disney s coronado springs resort as a prep line cook making 13 an hour until september when he left to look for higher pay for the better part of this year burns journey to a new life has been a drive through punishing traffic from his home in lakeland to cooking classes at the art institute of tampa it s been long days and even longer nights traversing the belly of the state with a composition book in his passenger seat door and his daughter s pink backpack now his in his trunk as a single dad he worries his kids will one day fall in the same cycle of poverty that he s trying to break when he has to tell his straight a daughter that he couldn t afford the 70 fee to put her in her high school honor society or his son that he didn t have enough for his 48 driving learners permit he wonders if the classes will be worth the extra hours he sacrifices away from home i m trying to build something now not only for my kids if something happens but for my grandkids and so on he said that s the fire behind this that my parents were not able to leave me anything subscribe max width 1000px height auto margin left auto margin right auto

one that ignites when you do something you really love alcantara anderson and many of the theme park and hotel workers interviewed by the sentinel said they never liked their old jobs as much as their tourism jobs positions that in many ways seemed like dreams come true the kind of thing animated princesses sing about they love the feeling that comes with coaxing a smile out of a child spending time on a special meal or helping a harried parent relax and get more out of their vacation hospitality comes easily to them paying the bills on a service paycheck does not it s not like one of those boring jobs where she s just into it for the money said alcantara anderson s daughter chastity 11 she s in it because it s something she wanted to do it was chastity s first day of middle school and alcantara anderson was sitting on her couch in their single story home near lakeland listening to her talk but i work a lot huh alcantara anderson responded i don t really get to see you that often sometimes chastity nodded most days alcantara anderson leaves for work two hours early to be sure she s at the magic kingdom on time when she gets out at midnight the drive back will take an hour if she s lucky then she cooks dinner for her family for the next evening does laundry cleans up most nights she ll sit outside in her car and play a little sudoku the quiet is often interrupted by the sound of cicadas it s her only alone time she goes to bed at 3 or 4 a m it s then when the stress catches up with her those moments without the distractions and the drive without the go go go of checking up on her daughter s homework crunching numbers on bills and medical appointments for her mom the fear creeps in if she calls out of work she worries will they think i m unreliable will they bump me down from my coordinator role for someone who doesn t have a sick mom and a pre teen to care for i would lose everything i couldn t i couldn t do it she said her voice breaking up i m just terrified of that because for her two things are true at once life at 14 75 an hour is a daily test of will but her happiness and her livelihood also depend on being employed at disney to me my job s everything she said to my family my job is everything orlando sentinel staff writer gabrielle russon former staff writer kyle arnold and data specialist adelaide chen contributed to this report this
