storm clouds are brewing for the global economy that is the dire assessment of the world bank in its 2019 global economic prospects report which includes a warning about the growing risks to emerging market economies from fractured global trade geopolitics oil prices and rising borrowing costs the world bank cut its forecast for global economic growth as slowing growth in trade and investment as well as tighter financial market conditions due to rising interest rates is expected to dampen momentum it now projects a global expansion of 2 9 percent this year down from 3 percent in 2018 a reduction of 0 1 percentage points from its june forecast the world bank s concerns are echoed in the minutes from the december meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the us federal reserve s policymaking body fed officials at the gathering noted the possibilities of a sharper than expected slowdown in global economic growth an escalation in trade tensions and a further tightening of financial conditions as prominent risks to their economic outlook after raising its target federal funds rate last month the fed signaled a switch to a more data dependent approach to monetary policy a move which could mean fewer rate hikes this year if the predictions of a global slowdown turn out to be accurate mena escalation of iran us tensions could trigger adverse spillovers focusing on the middle east and north africa mena the world bank sees economic activity in the region growing by 1 9 percent in 2019 not much of an improvement over the 1 7 percent gdp growth witnessed in 2018 this projection however as well as the medium term outlook for the region is heavily reliant on the hope that there isn t a significant escalation of geopolitical conflicts us president donald trump has made no secret of his desire to withdraw american troops from prolonged engagements in afghanistan iraq and syria a move many analysts believe will ramp up tensions in the region despite increased attention from the global community the proxy war in yemen between iran and saudi arabia continues turkey might invade syria to attack kurdish forces they have labeled as terrorist groups and the united states will continue to tighten the screws on iran who it views as the primary threat to peace and stability in the region so it is no surprise the world bank believes risks to the mena outlook are tilted to the downside given the potential for an escalation of military conflicts to cause even greater harm to economic activity in particular the agency said a substantial further escalation of us iran tensions could spell bad news for the rest of the region these geopolitical concerns and the uncertain impact on oil production as a result could trigger even more volatility in oil prices complicating or stalling the important progress made to date in both oil exporting and importing nations there is also the matter of tighter credit conditions as noted in a previous article central banks of the countries that make up the gulf cooperation council gcc bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have to raise interest rates in tandem with the fed due to their fixed exchange rate regimes a more abrupt tightening of advanced economy monetary policy could weigh on capital flows to the region and dampen foreign investor confidence in large gcc economies the world bank warned adding that high external debt denominated in foreign currency in some oil importers implies that they are also vulnerable to unexpected sharp appreciation of the u s dollar sub sahara africa domestic risks remain elevated switching focus to expectations for the sub saharan africa region in 2019 faster growth is forecast 3 4 percent vs 2 7 percent estimated for 2018 but with risks also skewed towards the downside a sudden spike in borrowing costs escalating trade tensions between major economies and a sharp drop in commodity prices due to weak global demand then there is the knock on effect these factors could have in compounding domestic concerns such as political uncertainty fragile fiscal positions and adverse weather conditions the direction of oil prices will also be central to the budgets of major oil exporters angola and nigeria this year and it remains to be seen if opec s decision to remove 1 2 million barrels per day from the oil market will boost prices in this weak demand environment in terms of trade data released so far in 2019 indicate an economic slowdown is underway in china a point bolstered by the people s bank of china s decision to again cut the reserve ratio requirement for banks in an effort to spur more lending all signs also point to a slowdown in the euro area as both economies feel the bite from protectionist trade policies initiated by the united states the world bank warned that slower growth in china and the eurozone given their strong trade and investment ties to sub saharan africa would adversely affect the region through lower export demand and investment this risk is exacerbated by the fact many state supported entities have taken out massive loans that are backed by commodity exports increasing the odds that a negative commodity price shock could have a devastating ripple effect the report also said a faster than expected normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies could lead to sharp reductions in capital inflows as investors flock to safe haven assets higher financing costs and damaging currency depreciation the significant drop in foreign exchange values that accompany capital flight would also make it even more challenging for many of these countries to service their foreign currency denominated debt something that is already a rising concern in the region the world bank added south africa s economy already took a beating last year as economic activity contracted and the value of the rand was dragged down by a combination of weaker economic fundamentals and political upheaval while political stability has improved under the leadership of cyril ramaphosa the may general elections scheduled for the middle of this year remain a big x factor the elections will be held to pick a new national assembly and new provincial legislatures in each province it will also determine who will become the next president of south africa with ramaphosa bidding for a full term as president while also seeking to protect the african national congress majority in the national assembly nigeria s general election takes place on february 16 an event that could be a source of unrest and spark a new wave of ethnic violence as a result domestic risks in particular remain elevated the world bank said and political uncertainty and a concurrent weakening of economic reforms could continue to weigh on the economic outlook in many countries for those countries with elections scheduled in 2019 including the aforementioned regional giants the world bank is concerned that domestic political considerations could derail efforts to instill greater fiscal discipline or implement much needed structural reforms especially where public debt levels are high and continue to soar us federal reserve lending a helping hand the deterioration in economic conditions will be a constant risk in 2019 and emerging market economies could witness large outflows of foreign capital if the federal reserve continues to raise rates constraining financing and growth however it is possible the threats posed by a stronger us dollar and higher refinancing costs might not materialize for mena and sub saharan african economies especially if the fed stays committed to a more cautious monetary policy approach this year according to the december fomc minutes many senior fed officials believe that in the current low inflation environment the us central bank could afford to be patient about further interest rate increases on the other hand should upside factors such as tighter labor market conditions or possible risks to financial stability become more prominent fed officials policy outlook would change and emerging market economies will be in for a very bumpy ride
global investors look to china amid slowdown hong kong pedestrians walk on a pavement along russell street in the shopping district of causeway bay in hong kong on friday russell street replaced new york s upper fifth avenue as the world s most expensive retail street by rental value according to property consultants cushman wakefield in november last year afp london ten years after china helped stave off the threat of a global depression with a huge stimulus plan investors are looking once again towards beijing as the world economy heads for a slowdown or worse in 2019 booming china has accounted for about a third of the growth in the global economy in recent years so recent signs that it is losing momentum is unsettling when the us boom turbo charged by president donald trump s tax cuts of 2017 seems to have peaked and europe s heavyweights are stalling china s slowdown is already being felt around the world from apple s profit warning due to weaker sales of its iphones to carmaker jaguar land rover laying off workers after a 22 percent fall in sales in the country in 2018 policy sources told reuters in beijing on friday that the government is planning a lower economic growth target of 6 6 5 percent for 2019 after an expected 6 6 percent in 2018 which would be the slowest expansion since 1990 in the first few days of 2019 china raised infrastructure spending with a 34 billion railway investment and its central bank loosened the screws on banks to encourage them lend more its fifth such move in a year china that s what worries me most joachim fels managing director and global economic advisor at bond giant pacific investment management company said as he surveyed the outlook for the world economy in 2019 as well as cutting china s appetite for imports a deeper slowdown could weaken its yuan currency and fan the flames of the trade war between beijing and washington however fels said his recession models for 2019 were flashing only orange warnings not red in part because the us federal reserve was likely to pause its run of interest rate hikes after one or two more increases china is expected to do more to act to help its economy too although officials in beijing say they do not plan a stimulus of the magnitude of the nearly 600 billion package unleashed in 2008 shortly after the collapse of lehman brothers i find it hard to look at it historically and bet against the chinese authorities managing to stabilize their economy jim mccormick global head of desk strategy for rbs division natwest markets said when china wants to stabilize its economy they tend to be successful in november the organization for economic co operation and development trimmed its forecasts for chinese growth to 6 3 percent in 2019 followed by 6 0 percent in 2020 since then the impact of us china trade tensions have become more apparent oecd senior economist margit molnar said suggesting the forecasts could be lowered again higher borrowing by local governments in china suggested a pick up in infrastructure spending was coming she said potentially helping to offset signs of fragile confidence among chinese consumers the major issue is to guarantee a gradual slowing molnar said investors breathe easier for the time being the concerns of investors in late 2018 about the global economy have eased leading to a tentative recovery in battered stock markets a round of talks between us and chinese trade officials in beijing did not end in acrimony and in europe a slowdown is probably in part due to one off factors such as new pollution rules for carmakers and the impact of the gilets jaunes protests in france which has been felt in the supply chains that stretch across the border into germany steven bell chief economist with bmo global asset management said surveys of purchasing managers in the private sector around the world suggested a broad pick up in industrial production was not far off and for many consumers in rich economies low inflation and gradually rising wages will help their spending power but even if the world economy avoids a painful slowdown this year it faces daunting fundamental challenges many countries seem stuck in a rut of slow productivity growth which puts a brake on earnings and has propelled the rise of populist politics from trump to the protests in france in britain the radical left wing leadership of britain s opposition labor party is worrying investors after prime minister theresa may split her conservative party with her plan to ease britain out of the european union at the end of march gabriel sterne head of global macro research at oxford economics said the pressure on politicians to heed the frustration of voters after years of austerity could help end an overly tight squeeze on public spending by some governments by contrast a worst case scenario is one in which frustrated politicians launch hasty attacks or takeovers of key institutions compromising central bank independence and launching unsustainable fiscal expansions he said afflicted advanced economy assets could even behave as if in an emerging market crisis reuters
euro soars on weak us dollar yuan highest in years reuters london the euro on friday posted its biggest weekly rise in more than four months with the us dollar weakening on cautious signals from the us federal reserve about further rate hikes the euro has been stuck in a us 1 12 us 1 15 range for the past three months due to growth fears and signs that the european central bank ecb is unlikely to end its stimulus soon however dovish fed minutes this week have triggered dollar selling lifting the euro as high as us 1 1581 and propelling it past a 100 day moving average for the first time in three months the single currency has gained 1 2 percent this week the euro remains supported by the soft dollar story the risk of a short squeeze perhaps to the us 1 162 area remains said chris turner head of foreign exchange at ing in london however a soft macro outlook suggests that europe will struggle to attract rotational flows out of us markets he added despite its gains the euro has been pressured by a slew of weaker than expected economic data especially from france and germany in addition the ecb is widely expected to remain accommodative this year which traders have said should prevent the currency from breaking much higher another reason for euro strength could be a resurgence this week in the offshore chinese yuan a stronger yuan means that 23 6 percent of the euro s trade weighted basket is going up and that means that even a currency weighed down by domestic economic and political woes can get a little lift against the dollar said kit juckes a currencies strategist at societe generale sa the yuan has breached the key 6 8 per us dollar level in both onshore and offshore trade against the backdrop of sensitive trade negotiations it has risen 1 8 percent this week in its biggest gain since july 2005 when beijing abandoned the yuan s peg to the us dollar yuan traders had on thursday started offloading us dollars in their proprietary accounts following the wrap up of three days of us china trade talks in beijing markets treated absence of any bad news from those negotiations as good news some corporate clients were joining to sell their dollars said a trader at a foreign bank in shanghai us treasury secretary steven mnuchin late on thursday said that chinese vice premier liu he 劉鶴 will most likely visit washington later this month for trade talks currencies such as the australian dollar a gauge of risk appetite and the new zealand dollar are likely to see further gains if a us sino trade deal is reached said sim moh siong currency strategist at bank of singapore ltd 新加坡銀行 in taipei the new taiwan dollar fell against the greenback slipping nt 0 020 to close at nt 30 802 but it was up 0 2 percent for the week from last week s nt 30 863 the us dollar index on friday rose 0 1 percent to 95 66 down 0 5 percent for the week the index has fallen about 3 percent since the middle of last month on expectations that a slowdown in growth both in the us as well as globally will restrict the fed from raising interest rates this year fed chairman jerome powell said on thursday that the us central bank has the ability to be patient on monetary policy given that inflation remains stable the pound jumped on friday on growing expectations that britain will seek to delay its scheduled departure date from the eu it rose as much as 0 6 percent to us 1 2851 its highest since late november before settling at about us 1 28 up from last week s us 1 27 additional reporting by cna
the west is rotting yes maybe but what a nice smell old soviet joke the word catastrophe has several meanings but in its original meaning in greek the word means a sudden downturn in greek katastrophē overturning sudden turn from kata down strophē turning as for the word superpower it also has several possible definitions but my preferred one is this one superpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position which is characterized by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale this is done through the combined means of economic military technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence traditionally superpowers are preeminent among the great powers this one an extremely powerful nation especially one capable of influencing international events and the acts and policies of less powerful nations or this one an international governing body able to enforce its will upon the most powerful states i have mentioned the very visible decline of the us and its associated empire in many of my articles already so i won t repeat it here other than to say that the ability to exert influence and impose its will is probably the best criteria to measure the magnitude of the fall of the us since trump came to power the process was already started by dubya and obama but it sure accelerated with the donald but i do want to use a metaphor to revisit the concept of catastrophe if you place an object in the middle of a table and then push it right to the edge you will exert some amount of energy we can call e1 then if the edge of the table is smooth and you just push the object over the edge you exercise a much smaller amount of energy we can call e2 and in most cases if the table is big enough you will also find that e1 is much bigger than e2 yet e2 coming after e1 took place triggered a much more dramatic event instead of smoothly gliding over the table top the object suddenly falls down and shatters that sudden fall can also be called a catastrophe this is also something which happens in history take the example of the soviet union the fate of all empires some readers might recall how alexander solzhenitsyn repeatedly declared in the 1980s that he was sure that the soviet regime would collapse and that he would return to russia he was of course vitriolically ridiculed by all the specialists and experts after all why would anybody want to listen to some weird russian exile with politically suspicious ideas there were rumors of monarchism and anti semitism when the soviet union was an immense superpower armed to the teeth with weapons with an immense security service with political allies and supporters worldwide not only that but all the respectable specialists and experts were unanimous that while the soviet regime had various problems it was very far from collapse the notion that nato would soon replace the soviet military not only in eastern europe but even in part of the soviet union was absolutely unthinkable and yet it all happened very very fast i would argue that the soviet union completely collapsed in the span of less than 4 short years 1990 1993 how and why this happened is beyond the scope of this article but what is undeniable is that in 1989 the soviet union was still an apparently powerful entity while by the end of 1993 it was gone smashed into pieces by the very nomenklatura which used to rule over it how did almost everybody miss that because ideologically poisoned analysis leads to intellectual complacence a failure of imagination and generally an almost total inability to even hypothetically look at possible outcomes this is how almost all the soviet specialists got it wrong the kgb by the way had predicted this outcome and warned the politburo but the soviet gerontocrats were ideologically paralyzed and were both unable and often unwilling to take any preventative action the kerensky masonic regime in 1917 russia the monarchy in iran or the apartheid regime in south africa also collapsed very fast once the self destruction mechanism was in place and launched you can think of that regime self destruction mechanism as our e1 phase in our metaphor above as for e2 you can think of it as whatever small push like event which precipitates the quick and final collapse apparently with great ease and minimum energy spent at this point it is important to explain what exactly a final collapse looks like some people are under the very mistaken assumption that a collapsed society or country looks like a mad max world this is not so the ukraine has been a failed state for several years already but it still exists on the map people live there work most people still have electricity albeit not 24 7 a government exists and at least officially law and order is maintained this kind of collapsed society can go on for years maybe decades but it is in a state of collapse nonetheless as it has reached all the 5 stages of collapse as defined by dmitry orlov in his seminal book the five stages of collapse survivors toolkit where he mentions the following 5 stages of collapse stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost having personally visited argentina in the 1970s and 1980s and seen the russia of the early 1990s i can attest that a society can completely collapse while maintaining a lot of the external appearances of a normal still functioning society unlike the titanic most collapsed regimes don t fully sink they remain about half under water and half above possibly with an orchestra still playing joyful music and in the most expensive top deck cabins a pretty luxurious lifestyle can be maintained by the elites but for most of the passengers such a collapse results in poverty insecurity political instability and a huge loss in welfare furthermore in terms of motion a half sunk ship is no ship at all here is the crucial thing as long as the ship s pa systems keep announcing great weather and buffet brunches and as long as most of the passengers remain in their cabins and watch tv instead of looking out of the window the illusion of normalcy can be maintained for a fairly long while even after a collapse during the e1 phase outlined above most passengers will be kept in total ignorance lest they riot or protest and only when e2 strikes totally unexpectedly for most passengers does reality eventually destroy the ignorance and illusions of the brainwashed passengers obama was truly the beginning of the end i have lived in the us from 1986 1991 and from 2002 to today and there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the country has undergone a huge decline over the past decades in fact i would argue that the us has been living under e1 condition since at least dubya and that this process dramatically accelerated under obama and trump i believe that we reached the e2 edge of the table moment in 2018 and that from now on even a relatively minor incident can result in a sudden downturn i e a catastrophe still i decided to check with the undisputed specialist of this issue and so i emailed dmitry orlov and asked him the following question in your recent article the year the planet flipped over you paint a devastating picture of the state of the empire it is already safe to declare trump s plan to make america great again maga a failure beneath the rosy statistics of us economic growth hides the hideous fact that it is the result of a tax holiday granted to transnational corporations to entice them to repatriate their profits while this hasn t helped them their stocks are currently cratering it has been a disaster for the us government as well as for the economic system as whole tax receipts have shrunk the budget deficit for 2018 exceeds 779 billion meanwhile the trade wars which trump initiated have caused the trade deficit to increase by 17 from the year before plans to repatriate industrial production from low cost countries remain vaporous because the three key elements which china had as it industrialized cheap energy cheap labor and low cost of doing business are altogether missing government debt is already beyond reasonable and its expansion is still accelerating with just the interest payments set to exceed half a trillion a year within a decade this trajectory does not bode well for the continued existence of the united states as a going concern nobody either in the united states or beyond has the power to significantly alter this trajectory trump s thrashing about may have moved things along faster than they otherwise would have at least in the sense of helping convince the entire world that the us is selfish feckless ultimately self destructive and generally unreliable as a partner in the end it won t matter who was president of the us it never has among those the us president has succeeded in hurting most are his european allies his attacks on russian energy exports to europe on european car manufacturers and on europe s trade with iran have caused a fair amount of damage both political and economic without compensating for it with any perceived or actual benefits meanwhile as the globalist world order which much of europe s population appears ready to declare a failure begins to unravel the european union is rapidly becoming ungovernable with established political parties unable to form coalitions with ever more numerous populist upstarts it is too early to say that the eu has already failed altogether but it already seems safe to predict that within a decade it will no longer remain as a serious international factor although the disastrous quality and the ruinous mistakes of europe s own leadership deserve a lot of the blame some of it should rest with the erratic destructive behavior of their transoceanic big brother the eu has already morphed into a strictly regional affair unable to project power or entertain any global geopolitical ambitions same goes for washington which is going to either depart voluntarily due to lack of funds or get chased out from much of the world the departure from syria is inevitable whether trump under relentless pressure from his bipartisan warmongers backtracks on this commitment or not now that syria has been armed with russia s up to date air defense weapons the us no longer maintains air superiority there and without air superiority the us military is unable to do anything afghanistan is next there it seems outlandish to think that the washingtonians will be able to achieve any sort of reasonable accommodation with the taliban their departure will spell the end of kabul as a center of corruption where foreigners steal humanitarian aid and other resources somewhere along the way the remaining us troops will also be pulled out of iraq where the parliament angered by trump s impromptu visit to a us base recently voted to expel them and that will put paid to the entire us adventure in the middle east since 9 11 4 704 439 588 308 has been squandered to be precise or 14 444 for every man woman and child in the us the biggest winners in all of this are obviously the people of the entire region because they will no longer be subjected to indiscriminate us harassment and bombardment followed by russia china and iran with russia solidifying its position as the ultimate arbiter of international security arrangements thanks to its unmatched military capabilities and demonstrated knowhow for coercion to peace syria s fate will be decided by russia iran and turkey with the us not even invited to the talks afghanistan will fall into the sphere of the shanghai cooperation organization and the biggest losers will be former us regional allies first and foremost israel followed by saudi arabia my question for you is this where would you place the us or the empire on your 5 stages of decline and do you believe that the us or the empire can reverse that trend here is dmitry s reply collapse at each stage is a historical process that takes time to run its course as the system adapts to changing circumstances compensates for its weaknesses and finds ways to continue functioning at some level but what changes rather suddenly is faith or to put it in more businesslike terms sentiment a large segment of the population or an entire political class within a country or the entire world can function based on a certain set of assumptions for much longer than the situation warrants but then over a very short period of time switch to a different set of assumptions all that sustains the status quo beyond that point is institutional inertia it imposes limits on how fast systems can change without collapsing entirely beyond that point people will tolerate the older practices only until replacements for them can be found stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost internationally the major change in sentiment in the world has to do with the role of the us dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and the yen the other two reserve currencies of the three legged globalist central banker stool the world is transitioning to the use of local currencies currency swaps and commodities markets backed by gold the catalyst for this change of sentiment was provided by the us administration itself which sawed through its own perch by its use of unilateral sanctions by using its control over dollar based transactions to block international transactions it doesn t happen to like it forced other countries to start looking for alternatives now a growing list of countries sees throwing off the shackles of the us dollar as a strategic goal russia and china use the ruble and the yuan for their expanding trade iran sells oil to india for rupees saudi arabia has started to accept the yuan for its oil this change has many knock on effects if the dollar is no longer needed to conduct international trade other nations no longer have hold large quantities of it in reserve consequently there is no longer a need to buy up large quantities of us treasury notes therefore it becomes unnecessary to run large trade surpluses with the us essentially conducting trade at a loss further the attractiveness of the us as an export market drops and the cost of imports to the us rises thereby driving up cost inflation a vicious spiral ensues in which the ability of the us government to borrow internationally to finance the gaping chasm of its various deficits becomes impaired sovereign default of the us government and national bankruptcy then follow the us may still look mighty but its dire fiscal predicament coupled with its denial of the inevitability of bankruptcy makes it into something of a blanche dubois from the tennessee williams play a streetcar named desire she was always dependent on the kindness of strangers but was tragically unable to tell the difference between kindness and desire in this case the desire is for national advantage and security and to minimize risk by getting rid of an unreliable trading partner how quickly or slowly this comes to pass is difficult to guess at and impossible to calculate it is possible to think of the financial system in terms of a physical analogue with masses of funds traveling at some velocity having a certain inertia p mv and with forces acting on that mass to accelerate it along a different trajectory f ma it is also possible to think of it in terms of hordes of stampeding animals who can change course abruptly when panicked the recent abrupt moves in the financial markets where trillions of dollars of notional purely speculative value have been wiped out within weeks are more in line with the latter model stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost within the us there is really no other alternative than the market there are a few rustic enclaves mostly religious communities that can feed themselves but that s a rarity for everyone else there is no choice but to be a consumer consumers who are broke are called bums but they are still consumers to the extent that the us has a culture it is a commercial culture in which the goodness of a person is based on the goodly sums of money in their possession such a culture can die by becoming irrelevant when everyone is dead broke but by then most of the carriers of this culture are likely to be dead too alternatively it can be replaced by a more humane culture that isn t entirely based on the cult of mammon perhaps dare i think through a return to a pre protestant pre catholic christian ethic that values people s souls above objects of value stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost all is very murky at the moment but i would venture to guess that most people in the us are too distracted too stressed and too preoccupied with their own vices and obsessions to pay much attention to the political realm of the ones they do pay attention a fair number of them seem clued in to the fact that the us is not a democracy at all but an elites only sandbox in which transnational corporate and oligarchic interests build and knock down each others sandcastles the extreme political polarization where two virtually identical pro capitalist pro war parties pretend to wage battle by virtue signaling may be a symptom of the extremely decrepit state of the entire political arrangement people are made to watch the billowing smoke and to listen to the deafening noise in the hopes that they won t notice that the wheels are no longer turning the fact that what amounts to palace intrigue the fracas between the white house the two houses of congress and a ghoulish grand inquisitor named mueller has taken center stage is uncannily reminiscent of various earlier political collapses such as the disintegration of the ottoman empire or of the fall and the consequent beheading of louis xvi the fact that trump like the ottoman worthies stocks his harem with east european women lends an eerie touch that said most people in the us seem blind to the nature of their overlords in a way that the french with their gilettes jaunes movement just as an example are definitely not stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost i have been saying for some years now that within the us social collapse has largely run its course although whether people actually believe that is an entire matter entirely defining your people is rather difficult the symbols are still there the flag the statue of liberty and a predilection for iced drinks and heaping plates of greasy fried foods but the melting pot seems to have suffered a meltdown and melted all the way to china at present half the households within the us speak a language other than english at home and a fair share of the rest speak dialects of english that are not mutually intelligible with the standard north american english dialect of broadcast television and university lecturers throughout its history as a british colony and as a nation the us has been dominated by the anglo ethnos the designation ethnos is not an ethnic label it is not strictly based on genealogy language culture habitat form of government or any other single factor or group of factors these may all be important to one extent or another but the viability of an ethnos is based solely on its cohesion and the mutual inclusivity and common purpose of its members the anglo ethnos reached its zenith in the wake of world war ii during which many social groups were intermixed in the military and their more intelligent members fantastic potential was unleashed when privilege the curse of the anglo ethnos since its inception was temporarily replaced with merit and the more talented demobilized men of whatever extraction were given a chance at education and social advancement by the gi bill speaking a new sort of american english based on the ohio dialect as a lingua franca these yanks male racist sexist and chauvinistic and at least in their own minds victorious were ready to remake the entire world in their own image they proceeded to flood the entire world with oil us oil production was in full flush then and with machines that burned it such passionate acts of ethnogenesis are rare but not unusual the romans who conquered the entire mediterranean basin the barbarians who then sacked rome the mongols who later conquered most of eurasia and the germans who for a very brief moment possessed an outsized lebensraum are other examples and now it is time to ask what remains of this proud conquering anglo ethnos today we hear shrill feminist cries about toxic masculinity and minorities of every stripe railing against whitesplaining and in response we hear a few whimpers but mostly silence those proud conquering virile yanks who met and fraternized with the red army at the river elbe on april 25 1945 where are they haven t they devolved into a sad little subethnos of effeminate porn addicted overgrown boys who shave their pubic hair and need written permission to have sex without fear of being charged with rape will the anglo ethnos persist as a relict similar to how the english have managed to hold onto their royals who are technically no longer even aristocrats since they now practice exogamy with commoners or will it get wiped out in a wave of depression mental illness and opiate abuse its glorious history of rapine plunder and genocide erased and the statues of its war heros criminals knocked down only time will tell stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost the term culture means many things to many people but it is more productive to observe cultures than to argue about them cultures are expressed through people s stereotypical behaviors that are readily observable in public these are not the negative stereotypes often used to identify and reject outsiders but the positive stereotypes cultural standards of behavior really that serve as requirements for social adequacy and inclusion we can readily assess the viability of a culture by observing the stereotypical behaviors of its members do people exist as a single continuous inclusive sovereign realm or as a set of exclusive potentially warring enclaves segregated by income ethnicity education level political affiliation and so on do you see a lot of walls gates checkpoints security cameras and no trespassing signs is the law of the land enforced uniformly or are there good neighborhoods bad neighborhoods and no go zones where even the police fear to tread do random people thrown together in public spontaneously enter into conversation with each other and are comfortable with being crowded together or are they aloof and fearful and prefer to hide their face in the little glowing rectangle of their smartphone jealously guarding their personal space and ready to regard any encroachment on it as an assault do people remain good natured and tolerant toward each other even when hard pressed or do they hide behind a façade of tense superficial politeness and fly into a rage at the slightest provocation is conversation soft in tone gracious and respectful or is it loud shrill rude and polluted with foul language do people dress well out of respect for each other or to show off or are they all just déclassé slobs even the ones with money observe how their children behave are they fearful of strangers and trapped in a tiny world of their own or are they open to the world and ready to treat any stranger as a surrogate brother or sister aunt or uncle grandmother or grandfather without requiring any special introduction do the adults studiously ignore each others children or do they spontaneously act as a single family if there is a wreck on the road do they spontaneously rush to each others rescue and pull people out before the wreck explodes or do they in the immortal words of frank zappa get on the phone and call up some flakes who rush on over and wreck it some more if there is a flood or a fire do the neighbors take in the people who are rendered homeless or do they allow them to wait for the authorities to show up and bus them to some makeshift government shelter it is possible to quote statistics or to provide anecdotal evidence to assess the state and the viability of a culture but your own eyes and other senses can provide all the evidence you need to make that determination for yourself and to decide how much faith to put in the goodness of humanity that is evident in the people around you dmity concluded his reply by summarizing his view like this cultural and social collapse are very far along financial collapse is waiting for a trigger commercial collapse will happen in stages some of which food deserts for instance have already happened in many places political collapse will only become visible once the political class gives up it s not as simple as saying which stage we are at they are all happening in parallel to one extent or another my own totally subjective opinion is that the us has already reached stages 1 through 4 and that there are signs that stage 5 has begun mainly in big cities as us small towns and rural areas trump s power base by the way are still struggling to maintain the norms and behaviors one could observe in the us of the 1980s when i have visitors from europe they always comment how friendly and welcoming us americans are true i live in small town in east central florida not in miami these are the communities which voted for trump because they said we want our country back alas instead of giving them their country back trump gifted it to the neocons conclusion connecting the dots or not frankly the dots are all over the place it is really hard to miss them however for the doubleplusgoodthinking ideological drone they remain largely invisible and this is not due to any eyesight problem but due to that drone s total inability to connect the dots these are the kind of folks who danced on the deck of the titanic while it was sinking for them when the inevitable catastrophe comes it will be a total mind blowing surprise but until that moment they will keep on denying the obvious no matter how obvious that obvious has become don t expect these two losers to fix anything they will only make things worse in the meantime the us ruling elites are locked into an ugly internal struggle which only further weakens the us what is so telling is that the democrats are still stuck with their same clueless incompetent and infinitely arrogant leadership in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the democratic party is in deep crisis and that new faces are desperately needed but no they are still completely stuck in their old ways and the same gang of gerontocrats continues to rule the party apparatus that is another surefire sign of degeneracy when a regime can only produce incompetent often old leaders who are completely out of touch with reality and who blame their own failures on internal deplorables and external the russians factors again think of the soviet union under brezhnev the apartheid regime in south africa under f w de klerk or the kerensky regime in 1917 russia as for the republicans they are basically a subsidiary of the israeli likud party just take a look at the long list of losers the likud produced at home and you will get a sense of what they can do in its us colony eventually the us will rebound i have no doubts about that at all this is a big country with millions of immensely talented people immense natural resources and no credible threat to it s territory but that can only happen after a real regime change as opposed to a change in presidential administration which itself is only going to happen after an e2 catastrophe collapse until then we will all be waiting for godot

protesting brutal neoliberal policies which resulted in more than 300 people being killed by regime forces since april 2018 is just one of the reasons why different leftist social movements have condemned the nicaraguan regime led by president daniel ortega and vice president rosario murillo the left has many more reasons to denounce the policies of the regime to understand this we must go back to 1979 the sandinista revolution 1979 saw the victory of an authentic revolution in nicaragua that combined a popular uprising self organization of cities and neighborhoods in rebellion and the action of the sandinista national liberation front in spanish frente sandinista de liberación nacional fsln a political military organization inspired by a marxist guevarist castrist model the revolution put an end to the 42 year long authoritarian rule of the somoza dynasty which had appropriated the state its armed forces administration and significant parts of its economic assets and established a strong alliance with the united states the somoza dictatorship proving to be an effective bulwark against progressive political forces whose multinationals could maintain and increase their plundering of nicaragua s national resources in exchange for commissions which added to the increasingly important wealth of the somozas the fsln was founded in the 1960s as a leftist group opposing the government mainly through guerilla warfare it was not until some of its guerillas spectacularly took high ranking members of the nicaraguan ruling classes as hostages in december 1974 that it was considered a potentially serious threat to the somocista dictatorship earlier that year liberal fractions of the bourgeoisie opposing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the somoza ruling clique had already formed the democratic union of liberation in spanish unión democrática de liberación udel under the leadership of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal editor of the liberal newspaper la prensa to try and gather political momentum in favor of the liberalization of the regime after the stunt of the sandinista guerillas the regime declared a state of emergency increased its repressive grip over the nicaraguan society and hunted down the fsln faced with increasing difficulties the fsln eventually split into three factions the prolonged people s war faction stayed loyal to the strategy of accumulating forces in the remote areas until they would have enough strength to liberate entire regions of the country and launch a final assault against somoza s army the proletarian tendency emerged in order to challenge the prolonged people s war strategy considered not to be adequate given the absence of a permanent occupying army hence the rural populations would not directly witness the imperialist endeavor and would not massively join the guerilla and the development of a capitalist mode of production in the country the economic development of the 1950s and 1960s had given rise to an agricultural and an industrial proletariat which constituted respectively 40 and 10 of the active population by 1978 the proletarian tendency therefore focused on organizing mass working class organizations in urban areas and gaining the support of industrial workers with the perspective of launching a swift insurrection when the conditions to do so would be met finally the terceristas whose main figures included daniel ortega and his brother humberto also advocated for an insurrectional strategy but were open to tactical alliances with the liberal fractions of the bourgeoisie opposing somoza while the proletarian tendency stressed the need for a mass uprising and for self organization the terceristas displayed substitutist tendencies which implied that an armed insurrection led by organized guerillas without a simultaneous mass uprising would be sufficient to overthrow the regime and take power eventually the regime lifted the state of emergency in 1977 thinking the guerilla war was defeated and the conditions for entering negotiations with the liberal opposition were met but fsln groups were prompt to resume their armed actions in urban areas in january 1978 the murder of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal by the regime s soldiers was caught on video and sparked anger among the liberal opposition as well as among the toiling masses a general strike supported by the liberal bourgeoisie was launched while fsln groups staged armed actions against somoza s national guard in august another general strike was called while sandinista guerillas staged an assault against the national palace where a joint session of both chambers of the parliament was taking place taking hundreds hostage which successfully resulted in the liberation of several political prisoners from somoza s jails more importantly spontaneous uprisings took place against the regime enabling the left to gain momentum over the liberal opposition this culminated in several urban uprisings in september 1978 after the fsln called for insurrection while these uprisings were severely defeated by the national guard they scared away the liberal opposition whose representatives sought to enter negotiations with the regime mediated by the u s dominated organization of american states oas the terceristas denounced it and withdrew from the broad liberation front in spanish frente amplio opositor fao which they had constituted together with the liberal opposition paving the way for the reunification of the three sandinista currents in january 1979 somoza turned down the proposals of the liberal opposition the momentum was then with the sandinistas who dominated the new patriotic national front in spanish frente patriótico nacional fpn created in february 1979 and in which the liberal opposition was marginalized after reuniting the fsln called for a general strike to be held in june and prepared a broad military offensive to be launched at the same time the population effectively accompanied these actions through mass urban uprisings as the armed insurrection quickly liberated areas of the country one after the other somoza s army largely decomposed and when its last stronghold in the capital was finally liberated on july 19 1979 its last remnants had no choice but to flee abroad in particular to the neighboring country of honduras now in the government the revolutionary political forces among which the fsln was dominant pledged to install a democratic regime to guarantee a non alignment of nicaragua s foreign policy thus putting an end to the alliance with the united states and to develop a mixed economy in which the development of cooperatives and state owned enterprises would be encouraged while the existence of private capital would not be fundamentally threatened as long as it was perceived as patriotic that is loyal to the sandinista revolution rather than to the overthrown somocista regime or to u s imperialism during the first two years following the revolutionary victory several developments made the case of nicaragua different from other cases in which the left has come to power through elections in latin america including chile in 1970 venezuela in 1998 99 brazil in 2002 03 bolivia in 2005 06 and ecuador in 2006 07 due to the destruction of anastasio somoza s army and the flight of the dictator the fsln not only assumed governmental power which the other cases cited did via the electoral process it also replaced the somocista army with a new army that was put at the service of the people took over total control of the banks and decreed a public monopoly on foreign trade weapons were distributed to the population for their self defense due to risks of outside aggression and an attempted coup coming from the right these are fundamental changes that did not take place in the aforementioned countries they did take place in cuba between 1959 and 1961 and were extended during the 1960s in the 1980s major social progress was made in nicaragua in the areas of healthcare education improving housing conditions even if they remained rudimentary fuller rights to organization and protest access to credit for small producers thanks to nationalization of the banking system and more these represented undeniable progress however throughout the 1980s the fsln government had to fight a decade long war against the counter revolutionary forces known as the contras heavily supported by the united states which could never satisfy its ambition of direct military intervention to topple the sandinistas but settled for a low intensity conflict which would strangle nicaragua economically and isolate the fsln politically u s imperialism and its vassals such as the regime of carlos andrès perez in venezuela or dictatorships as in honduras found it necessary to contain the spreading of this extraordinary experiment in social liberation and renewal of national dignity in fact social revolt was rampant in the region in particular in salvador and guatemala where revolutionary forces close to the sandinistas had been active for decades in 1990 the fsln lost the general election to the right with violeta chamorro the widow of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal being elected president under chamorro nicaragua was to fully embrace the neoliberal austerity promoted by the washington consensus which was to result by the end of the decade in nicaragua becoming the second poorest country in the americas after haiti change society without taking power in the 1990s as a result of disappointed hopes there were those who were saying that what is needed is to try to change society without taking power one aspect of their approach was quite pertinent it is absolutely vital to promote processes of change that take place at the base of society and which presuppose self organization by citizens freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate and organize but the idea that power must not be taken is not valid because it is not possible to really change society unless the people take power at the level of the state the question is rather how to build an authentic democracy in the original sense of the word that is power exercised directly by the people for the purpose of emancipation in other words power of the people by the people and for the people we feel that it was necessary to overthrow the somoza dictatorship through the combined action of a popular uprising and the intervention of a political military organization and as such the victory of july 1979 remains a popular triumph worthy of celebration it must be stressed that without the ingenuity and tenacity of the people during the struggle the fsln would not have succeeded in striking the decisive blow against the somoza dictatorship the fsln leadership did not go far enough in radicalization for the benefit of the people several questions arise did the fsln go too far in the changes it made in the society did it take the wrong direction or are the disappointing subsequent developments the result of aggression by north american imperialism and its allies in nicaragua and elsewhere in the region here we will highlight errors made in two main areas first the fsln leadership did not go far enough in taking radical measures in favor of the segments of the population who were most exploited and oppressed beginning with the poor rural population but also factory workers and healthcare and education workers who were generally underpaid it made too many concessions to agrarian and urban capitalists second the leadership of the fsln with its slogan national directorate give us your orders did not provide sufficient support for self organization and worker control it placed limits that were highly detrimental to the revolutionary process of course responsibility for the outbreak of the war lies exclusively with the enemies of the sandinista government the latter of which had no choice but to confront the aggression nevertheless errors were made in the means of waging the war humberto ortega the head of the army formed a regular army equipped with expensive heavy tanks unsuitable against the guerrilla methods of the contras and the conscription of the country s youth in order to reinforce the army was also badly perceived by the population this combined with the errors made in the area of agrarian reform had damaging consequences in a recent interview henry ruiz one of the nine members of the national leadership in the 1980s underlines the fact in these terms the campesinos were not favored on the contrary they were affected by the war the war waged by the contra and the war waged by us errors made by the sandinista leadership what errors were made here is a summary presentation of a question that deserves long discussion the agrarian question was not dealt with properly agrarian reform was seriously insufficient and the contras took full advantage of that fact much more land should have been distributed to rural families giving them title to the property because expectations were enormous among a large part of the population who needed land and were struggling to have the arable land in the large private estates including but not only those belonging to the somoza clan distributed to those who wanted to work it the orientation that won out among the sandinista leadership was to target the major somoza estates but to spare the interests of major capitalist groups and powerful families whom certain sandinista leaders wanted to turn into allies or fellow travelers another error was made the fsln wanted to quickly create a state agrarian sector and cooperatives to replace the large somocista estates which was not in line with the attitudes of the rural population priority should have been given to small and medium private farms distributing titles to the property and providing material and technical aid to the new campesino owners priority also should have been given to support for production for the domestic market which was already substantial but could have been improved and increased and the regional market making maximum use of organic agriculture methods to sum up the leadership of the fsln combined two serious errors on the one hand it made too many concessions to the bourgeois who were considered allies in the change then in progress and on the other hand it engaged in excessive statism or artificial cooperativism the result was not long in coming a part of the population disappointed by the decisions of the sandinista government was attracted by the contra the latter had the intelligence to adopt a discourse that was aimed at the disillusioned campesinos telling them that they would help them overthrow the fsln resulting in a truly fair distribution of land and true agrarian reform this was deceitful propaganda but it was widely disseminated that is corroborated by a series of studies in the field which éric toussaint one of the authors of this article had access to from 1986 1987 after several trips made to nicaragua to provide internationalist solidarity in particular studies led in rural regions where the contra had gained popular support certain entities within the sandinista movement itself conducted very serious surveys on the ground and alerted the sandinista leadership about what was happening these included the work coordinated by orlando nuñez whose later political evolution led him to remain loyal to ortega despite his initial left wing sandinista stance work done by other entities independent of the government and related to liberation theology came to the same conclusions a number of rural organizations linked to sandinism unag atc etc were also aware of the problems but engaged in self censorship and internationalist experts specialized in the rural world also sounded the alarm concerning self organization and worker control the fsln inherited the cuban tradition which promotes popular organization but within a very controlled and limited framework cuba which at the start of the 1960s had experienced a broad movement toward self organization gradually moved toward a model in which there is much greater control from above starting with the increase in soviet influence in the late 1960s 1970s and part of the fsln leadership was trained in cuba at that time the decade after 1970 has been defined as the grey period by an entire generation of cuban marxists in short the sandinista leadership inherited a tradition that was strongly influenced by the bureaucratic degeneration of the soviet union and its destructive impact on a large part of the left internationally including in cuba similarly the application starting in 1988 of a structural adjustment program that strongly resembled the programs dictated to other countries by the imf and the world bank is another error made by the sandinista government regarding this question sandinista members have made their criticism of the orientation that was taken by their leadership very clear they expressed their point of view both internally and publicly but unfortunately no correction of the errors ensued the government extended a policy that was leading the process straight into a wall and would result in popular rejection at the polls and a victory of the right in the election of february 1990 it was not overly radical policies that weakened the sandinista revolution what prevented it from advancing sufficiently with the support of a majority of the population was its failure to put the people at the core of the transition that followed the overthrow of the somoza dictatorship in short the government maintained an economic orientation that was compatible with the interests of nicaragua s wealthy bourgeoisie and major private foreign corporations that is an economy oriented toward export and based on low wages in order to remain competitive on the worldwide market this was not doomed to happen alternative policies could have been implemented the government should have paid more attention to the needs and aspirations of the people in rural as well as urban areas it should have redistributed land for the benefit of the campesinos developing and or strengthening small landholding and to the extent possible forms of voluntary cooperatives the government should have promoted wage increases for workers both in the private and public sectors if the sandinistas had really wanted to break away from the export oriented extractivist model that depends on competitiveness on the international market they should have gone against the interests of the capitalists that still dominated the export oriented extractivist industry they should have done more to gradually implement policies in favor of the small and medium sized producers who supplied the domestic market such as protectionist measures in order to limit importations this would have allowed the peasants and small and medium enterprises not to have to make sacrifices for the sake of competitiveness on the international market instead of encouraging the masses to follow orders given from the top of the fsln self organization by citizens should have been promoted at all levels and citizens should have been given control over the public administration as well as over the accounts of private companies the political institutions that were installed by the fsln did not fundamentally differ from the ones of a parliamentary democracy with a strong presidential role something which would impede the capacity of the masses to constitute a counter power when the right would be elected in 1990 concessions were made to local big capital which was wrongly perceived as being patriotic and an ally of the people the increases in wages were limited fiscal incentives in the form of lower taxation were given to the bosses any such alliance should have been rejected at each important stage criticism from within the fsln emerged the magazine envio for instance was founded in 1981 as a publication that provided critical support to nicaragua s revolutionary process from the perspective of liberation theology s option for the poor but such criticism was not actually taken into account by the leadership which was more and more dominated by daniel ortega his brother humberto and víctor tirado lópez all three of whom supported the tercerista faction which as was explained above did not have a full understanding of the necessity of self organization and was inclined to alliances with the bourgeoisie and were joined by tomas borge and bayardo arce of the prolonged people s war faction further the four other members of the national leadership did not form a bloc to oppose the continuation and deepening of the errors that were made it is very important to point out that proposals for alternative policies were formulated both inside the fsln and from outside from political groups who wanted to further the revolutionary process that was underway constructive critical voices did not wait for the electoral failure of february 1990 to propose new directions but they received only a limited hearing and remained relatively isolated illegitimate and odious debt the leadership of the fsln should also have questioned repayment of the public debt inherited from the somoza dictatorship and should have broken with the world bank and the imf as a dependent country aligned on the united states somoza s nicaragua had been a receiver of booming foreign lending in the 1970s by multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the imf as well as by international private banks while the loans were officially intended for development they benefitted the strengthening of an authoritarian regime and the increase in wealth of somoza and his clique after the latter left the country with most of their assets the new sandinista rulers of nicaragua were in dire need of funding in order to implement progressive policies and to encourage the industrialization of the country somoza s debt would soon be a burden and impede the implementation of such policies when the fsln took power the foreign debt stood at 1 5 billion and in 1981 its servicing represented 28 of the country s export revenue the sandinistas should have conducted an audit of the debt with broad citizen participation this is a fundamental point the sandinista government s agreeing to continue repaying the debt was in keeping with its defense of the interests of a part of nicaragua s bourgeoisie who had invested in the debt issued by somoza and borrowed money from u s banks for the sandinista government this was also a way of avoiding a confrontation with the world bank and the imf despite the fact that they had financed the dictatorship despite the government s efforts to maintain collaboration with the two institutions the latter decided to suspend financial relations with the new nicaraguan authorities this shows that it was useless to make concessions to them admittedly it was not easy for the government of a country like nicaragua to face its creditors alone but it could have begun by questioning the legitimacy of the debts claimed by the world bank the imf and the states and private banks that had financed the dictatorship the government could have launched an audit of these debts by calling for citizen participation and could have gained support for a demand for abolition of those debts by the broad international movement in support of the nicaraguan people instead in 1988 after the external debt had reached 7 billion the government went as far as implementing a structural adjustment plan that degraded the conditions of the poor without affecting the rich very much resembling the usual conditions imposed by the imf and world bank while these institutions had still not resumed their financial relations with nicaragua it can never be repeated often enough that a refusal to stand up to creditors who demand repayment of an illegitimate debt is generally the beginning of the abandonment of the program of change if the burden of illegitimate debt is not denounced the people are condemned to bear that burden in 1979 two months after the overthrow of somoza fidel castro said in a speech before the general assembly of the united nations the developing countries debt has already reached 335 billion it is estimated that the total payment for servicing the foreign debt amounts to more than 40 billion each year which represents more than 20 per cent of their annual exports furthermore the average per capita income in the developed countries is now 14 times greater than that of the underdeveloped countries this situation is already unbearable at the continental dialogue on the foreign debt held at havana s palace of conventions on august 3rd 1985 he said the debts of the countries with less relative development in a disadvantaged situation are unbearable and do not have a solution and they should be cancelled as part of a major international campaign for the abolition of illegitimate debt castro made a series of arguments at that conference that are quite applicable to nicaragua s case to all these moral political and economic reasons we can add many legal reasons who signed the contracts who is sovereign on the basis of what concept can it be said that the people committed themselves to paying and that they signed for the credits and received the credits most of those credits were secured by repressive military dictatorships that did not consult the people do the debts and the commitments of the peoples oppressors have to be paid by the oppressed this is the moral and philosophical basis of this idea the parliaments were not consulted the principle of sovereignty was violated what parliament participated in this debt signing process and knew about it we stress the issue of illegitimate debt because should the oppressive regime of daniel ortega and rosario murillo be overthrown it would be essential for a popular government to call repayment of the debt demanded of nicaragua into question should the right take leadership of the overthrow of the regime we can be certain that it will not call the debt repayment demanded of nicaragua into question after the defeat in the election of february 1990 daniel ortega extended a policy of class collaboration in 1989 the fsln government reached an agreement with the contras that put an end to fighting which was of course a positive development it was presented as the victorious outcome of the strategy that had been adopted yet it was a pyrrhic victory the sandinista leadership called a general election in february 1990 and felt certain it would win election results struck the sandinista leadership with an amazed wave of panic the right had won partly by threatening that fighting would resume if the fsln won many people wanted to avoid further bloodshed and thus reluctantly voted for the right hoping for an end to war for good some were also disappointed by the fsln government s policies in the countryside deficient agrarian reform and in cities negative consequences of the austerity measures enforced by the structural adjustment program begun in 1988 though sandinista organizations could still rely on a lot of support among young people workers and civil servants as well as among a significant number of farm labourers the sandinista leadership expected to reap 70 of the votes in the elections so it was flabbergasted as it hadn t perceived the growing discontent in a large portion of the population this illustrates the gap between the majority of the people and a leadership that had become used to giving orders after the defeat in the election of february 1990 daniel ortega adopted an attitude that swung back and forth between compromise with the government and confrontation the sandinista leadership with daniel and humberto ortega at its head negotiated the transition with violeta chamorro s new government humberto was still general in chief of a starkly reduced army the most left wing members of the army had been dismissed under the pretext that they had supplied missiles to the farabundo martí national liberation front fmln which was still attempting to bring about a general uprising in salvador in the context of presidents gorbachev and bush coming closer together soviet authorities had denounced the fact that sam 7 and sam 14 missiles that had been supplied by the ussr to the sandinistas had been passed on to the fmln and used to shoot down u s army helicopters operating in el salvador four sandinista officers were imprisoned on an order from humberto ortega with the following explanation blinded by their political passion and guided by extremist arguments this small group of officers flouted military honor and the institution s and military command s loyalty which is the same as flouting the sacred patriotic and revolutionary interests of nicaragua this led to strong criticism from the workers national front which included sandinista trade union organizations from the sandinista youth as well as from a number of fsln activists moreover a left wing group of former members of the prolonged people s war faction that published the bulletin nicaragua desde adentro disapproved of humberto ortega s decision to remain head of the army under a right wing presidency instead of leaving his position to his deputy who was also a member of the fsln so that humberto ortega could remain in the fsln leadership and join the political opposition to the new regime a few months after violeta chamorro started her mandate as president a massive movement spread throughout the country in july 1990 protesting massive layoffs planned in the public services as well as other issues linked with the implementation of a market oriented economic policy managua and other cities were covered with sandinista barricades and the trade unions launched a general strike this resulted in a compromise with violeta chamorro s government which was forced to withdraw some measures but the sandinista grassroots was disgruntled at the fsln leadership having halted protest actions later the front s leadership gradually made concessions to chamorro accepting the dismantling of the public banking sector the reduction of the public sector in both agriculture and manufacturing the end of the state s monopoly on foreign trade chamorro also organized the cleansing of the police force and incorporated former contras into it it must be said that after the victory of the right a significant part of the estates formerly expropriated from the somocistas after the 1979 victory were appropriated by a few sandinista leaders who consequently accessed to the role of capitalists this process was called piñata those who organized it accounted for it as meeting the need to secure assets for the fsln against a government that might want to confiscate the party s assets despite a radicalization of some elements of the fsln throughout 1990 and 1991 others such as former sandinista minister alejandro martinez cuenca openly mentioned the need for a co gobierno a kind of conditional external support to violeta chamorro s government and supported the policy enforced by the international monetary fund which to some extent could be perceived as in line with the policy followed by the sandinista government from 1988 éric toussaint was a first hand eyewitness to such class collaborationist policies advocated for by daniel ortega and other flsn leaders in 1992 as a participant in the 3rd forum of são paulo in managua in 1992 éric toussaint accompanied ernest mandel a leader of the fourth international who had been invited to deliver the inaugural speech at the 3rd forum of são paulo the forum launched in 1990 by brazil s workers party in portuguese partido dos trabalhadores pt under lula da silva s leadership brought together a broad spectrum of the latin american left from the cuban cp to the frente amplio of uruguay and including guerrilla organizations like the fmln in el salvador ernest mandel entitled his speech socialism and the future beginning with an observation of the great difficulties facing the forces of the radical left worldwide he stated that priority had to be given to emphasizing demands aimed at attaining fundamental human rights while at the same time maintaining the perspective of socialism in his conclusion he stressed that this socialism must be self managing feminist ecological radical pacifist pluralistic it must qualitatively extend democracy and be internationalist and pluralist including in terms of multiparty system the emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves it cannot be done by states governments parties supposedly infallible leaders or experts of any kind during the forum víctor tirado lópez one of the commandants who were closest to daniel ortega at that time asked to have a private meeting with ernest mandel who asked éric toussaint to accompany him víctor tirado lópez began by saying that he had much admiration for ernest mandel s work and in particular his marxist economic theory then the commandant expounded his analysis of the international situation according to him the capitalist system had reached maturity and would undergo no further crises and would lead to socialism without the need for further revolutions this was totally absurd and ernest mandel said so very clearly and with emotion when mandel then responded that crises would indeed continue and that in certain parts of latin america such as brazil s northeast living conditions were clearly worsening for the most exploited populations tirado lópez answered that those regions had not yet been reached by the civilization that had been brought by christopher columbus five centuries earlier ernest mandel and éric toussaint then put an abrupt end to this preposterous conversation the following day daniel ortega expressed the desire to meet in private with mandel to present the proposed alternative program he wanted to defend publicly as the fsln against the rightist government of violeta chamorro after reading it we realized that the program did not meet the minimum conditions for constituting an alternative to put it simply it was compatible with the reforms undertaken by the rightist government and would not enable the offensive against the right to be resumed mandel said so very clearly to daniel ortega who was not at all pleased these two discussions show how profoundly certain fsln leaders had gone astray the subsequent evolution of daniel ortega and those who accompanied him on his path back to power was already clearly perceptible in the early 1990s daniel ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln a large part of the sandinista militants from the revolutionary period rejected that orientation in the years that followed it took time and daniel ortega took advantage of the slow dawning of awareness of the danger to consolidate his influence within the fsln and marginalize or exclude those who defended a different orientation simultaneously daniel ortega succeeded in maintaining privileged relations with a number of leaders of popular sandinista organizations who felt that in the absence of anyone else he was the leader most likely to defend the series of gains made during the 1980s that explains in part why in 2018 the ortega regime still has the support of part of the population and the popular movement despite its use of extremely brutal methods of repression ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln in the 1990s is best summed up by mónica baltodano former guerilla commander former member of the fsln leadership and now a member of the movement for the rescue of sandinismo in spanish movimiento por el rescate del sandinismo mprs the dispute within the fsln between 1993 and 1995 persuaded ortega and his iron circle of the importance of controlling the party apparatus that became more concretized precisely in the fsln s 1998 congress in which what remained of the national directorate i e the sandinista assembly and the fsln congress itself were replaced with an assembly whose participants were mainly the leaders of the grassroots organizations loyal to ortega little by little even that assembly stopped meeting at that point an important rupture occurred by then it was already evident that ortega was increasingly distancing himself from leftist positions and centering his strategy on how to expand his power his emphasis was power for power s sake mónica baltodano goes on to explain the building of alliances that ultimately led to daniel ortega s coming back to the presidential office an alliance building process started then to increase his power the first was with president arnoldo alemán which produced the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 ortega s central aims in that alliance were to reduce the percentage needed to win the presidential elections on the first round divvy up between their two parties the top posts in all state institutions and guarantee security to the fsln leaders personal properties and businesses in exchange he guaranteed alemán governability by putting a stop to strikes and other struggles for grassroots demands the fsln stopped opposing the neoliberal policies in the following years the main leaders of the party s once mass organizations became national assembly representatives or were brought into the structures of ortega s circle of power with that they obviously stopped resisting and struggling for all the things they had once believed in those years also saw the forming of ties i wouldn t call it an alliance with the head of the catholic church cardinal obando the main purpose of that linkage was control of the electoral branch of government through obando s personal intimate relation with roberto rivas who had been heading the electoral branch since 2000 it also bought ortega increased influence with both the catholic faithful and the church hierarchy after alemán was charged with corruption and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment the agreement he had concluded with ortega proved to be profitable ortega saw to it that the men he had placed in the judicial system arranged preferential treatment for alemán allowing him to serve out his sentence in house arrest later in 2009 two years after his election as president of nicaragua daniel ortega gave his support to the supreme court s decision to quash alemán s conviction and release him a few days later alemán returned the favor by ensuring that the parliamentary group of the liberal party he led voted for the election of a sandinista at the head of the national assembly the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 reduced the percentage needed to win the presidential election on the first round to 35 of the votes if the candidate has a 5 margin over the candidate coming in second ortega was elected with 38 07 of the votes in november 2006 and took office in january 2007 he was re elected in november 2011 and in november 2016 after what rosario murillo whom he had married in the church with cardinal obando as officiant and who had been spokesperson of the government since 2007 became vice president the revolution betrayed since 2007 the policies which have been implemented by ortega and murillo have looked more like a continuation of the policies pursued by the three right wing governments that succeeded one another between 1990 and 2007 than like a continuation of the sandinista experience from 1979 1990 in this respect the article by mónica baltodano published in january 2014 and quoted above deserves a full reading in the last eleven years daniel ortega s government did not carry out any structural reform no socialization of the banks no new agrarian reform despite the very important concentration of land in the hands of big landowners no urban reform in favor of the toiling classes no tax reform in favor of more social justice free trade zone regimes have been expanded the contracting of internal and external debt has been pursued under the same conditions that favor the creditors through the interest payments they receive and that allow them to impose policies in their favor through blackmail in 2006 the sandinista parliamentary group voted hand in hand with the right wing mps in favor of a law totally prohibiting abortion it was under the presidency of daniel ortega who refused to call the measure into question that the prohibition was included in the new criminal code that entered into force in july 2008 there are no exceptions whatsoever to the prohibition including cases of danger to the health or the life of the pregnant woman or pregnancy resulting from rape this retrograde legislation was accompanied by serious attacks on organizations defending women s rights who have been among the most active in the opposition to the ortega government in another very troubling development references to the catholic religion have been systematically used by the regime in particular by rosario murillo who has made a point of denouncing women s rights organizations and the support they receive from abroad in their struggle for the right to abortion as being the devil s work nicaragua can still be characterized by its very low wages pronicaragua the official agency promoting foreign investment in the country brags about he minimum wage the most competitive at the regional level which makes nicaragua an ideal country to set up labour intensive operations over the recent years labour insecurity starkly increased informal economy represented 60 of the total employment in 2009 a figure which stood at 80 in 2017 no progress was made toward a diminution of social inequalities and the number of millionaires increased the growth in wealth produced was not distributed to the toiling classes but benefitted the big national and international capital with the help of daniel ortega s government furthermore the latter and his family also became richer the main trigger of the social protests that started in april 2018 was the announcement by ortega s government of neoliberal measures to be taken concerning social security in particular pension reform these measures were advocated for by the imf with which ortega had maintained excellent relations since he took office in 2007 in a statement published in february 2018 the imf congratulated the government for its achievements economic performance in 2017 was above expectations and the 2018 outlook is favorable staff recommends that the inss reform plan secures its long term viability and corrects the inequities within the system staff welcomes the authorities efforts to alleviate inss financing needs the most unpopular measures were a 5 decrease of the pensions meant to finance medical expenses and a limitation of the annual indexation of these pensions over the inflation rate future pension benefits for the close to one million workers affiliated to the pension system were meant to be based on a less favorable calculation which would have resulted in cuts in pension benefits that could have been as high as 13 these measures sparked a mass protest movement at first mainly composed of students and young people the movement quickly joined with other protests in particular with the mainly peasant and indigenous based movement against the construction of a transoceanic canal meant as an alternative to the panama canal that would endanger large parts of the environment and livelihoods eventually ortega gave up on these reforms this was not before he had initiated a criminal spiral of repression which resulted in more than 300 protesters being killed by security forces and pro regime militiamen now joined by parts of the population horrified by the government s repressive response the protests radicalized eventually demanding the fall of the regime the government accused the protesters of being right wing golpistas and terrorists working toward regime change with the support of u s imperialism the government was however unable to provide any non fabricated evidence to support such claims in fact the united states which has little to say about ortega s neoliberal economic policies took rather timid sanctions in reaction to the repression so far similarly the examination by the u s senate of the nicaraguan investment conditionality act nica of 2017 which deserves to be denounced as an imperialist policy impinging on nicaragua s national sovereignty was not sped up by recent events furthermore ortega and murillo strengthened their use of religious fundamentalist references and denounced the protesters as having satanic rituals and practices as opposed to the rest of the nicaraguan people because the nicaraguan people are god s people on 19 july 2018 during the rally organized on the anniversary of the sandinista revolution to try and strengthen his legitimacy ortega repeated these absurd claims and called on the catholic bishops to exorcize the protesters and chase out the devil which supposedly had taken possession of them by the middle of july the policy of terror led by the government allowed the latter to regain control of the streets since then massive arrests have taken place and several hundreds of people labelled as terrorists by the government are still imprisoned human rights associations are not permitted to enter the prisons nor are the lawyers of some of the detainees some of them were tortured and forced to give false confessions supporting the claim according to which the regime faces a foreign led plot aimed at removing it by force by means of conclusion the sandinista revolution started as an extraordinary experience of social liberation and renewal of national dignity in a dependent country whose status as a backyard for u s imperialism had been accepted by its authoritarian dynastic rulers for decades the achievements of the sandinista government between 1979 and 1990 however did not go far enough while they allowed for significant improvements of the living conditions of most of the nicaraguans they did not break with the export oriented extractivist model which was dominated by the big capital nor did they significantly promote the active participation of the masses in the economic and political decision making processes the political institutions and the internal organization of the fsln were not developed as tools that could have empowered the masses an error which allowed for the fsln degeneration during ortega s road back to power this understanding of the nicaraguan revolution and its degeneration stresses the need for revolutionaries and socialist activists to encourage the broadest possible participation of the masses in the fight for their emancipation as well as to help ensure their self organization a corollary to this idea is the need for revolutionaries to struggle against the bureaucratization of their organizations leadership which begins with building organizations that respect internal democracy this was strongly underestimated by the fsln which remained a political military organization after it had seized power and waited until 1991 before it organized its first congress as a political organization while the sandinista leadership made the right choice when it recognized the victory of the right in 1990 the subsequent steps taken by the fsln leadership under daniel ortega were clearly meant for him to come back to power for power s sake the left wing of the fsln which organized as critical currents during the 1990s was too timid in its opposition to these moves finally the international left needs to have a materialist analysis of social and political processes and shall not cling to fantasized ideas of experiences of really existing socialism the evolution of the fsln and the policies led in nicaragua since 2007 should be analyzed for what they are rather than on the basis of what daniel ortega and rosario murillo presumably stood for as fsln activists during the 1970s and 1980s in this sense ortega and murillo s deepening of the neoliberal policies pursued by their right wing predecessors as well as their total ban of abortion should be denounced by the international left furthermore the left should strongly denounce the criminal repression currently organized by the regime against protesters and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners when adopting such a stance the left should in no way compromise itself by supporting a right wing pro imperialist opposition on the contrary this stance should be accompanied by an effort to link with and reinforce the critical sandinistas and other members of the progressive opposition to ortega and murillo in particular the youth who mobilized strongly since april 2018 the feminist movement and the peasant and indigenous movement who opposed the project of transoceanic canal and other destructive projects linked with the export led capitalist model related link digg this del icio us furl reddit technorati facebook twitter back to newswire english italiano deutsch this page can be viewed in
the west is rotting yes maybe but what a nice smell old soviet joke the word catastrophe has several meanings but in its original meaning in greek the word means a sudden downturn in greek katastrophē overturning sudden turn from kata down strophē turning as for the word superpower it also has several possible definitions but my preferred one is this one superpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position which is characterized by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale this is done through the combined means of economic military technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence traditionally superpowers are preeminent among the great powers this one an extremely powerful nation especially one capable of influencing international events and the acts and policies of less powerful nations or this one an international governing body able to enforce its will upon the most powerful states i have mentioned the very visible decline of the us and its associated empire in many of my articles already so i won t repeat it here other than to say that the ability to exert influence and impose its will is probably the best criteria to measure the magnitude of the fall of the us since trump came to power the process was already started by dubya and obama but it sure accelerated with the donald but i do want to use a metaphor to revisit the concept of catastrophe if you place an object in the middle of a table and then push it right to the edge you will exert some amount of energy we can call e1 then if the edge of the table is smooth and you just push the object over the edge you exercise a much smaller amount of energy we can call e2 and in most cases if the table is big enough you will also find that e1 is much bigger than e2 yet e2 coming after e1 took place triggered a much more dramatic event instead of smoothly gliding over the table top the object suddenly falls down and shatters that sudden fall can also be called a catastrophe this is also something which happens in history take the example of the soviet union the fate of all empires some readers might recall how alexander solzhenitsyn repeatedly declared in the 1980s that he was sure that the soviet regime would collapse and that he would return to russia he was of course vitriolically ridiculed by all the specialists and experts after all why would anybody want to listen to some weird russian exile with politically suspicious ideas there were rumors of monarchism and anti semitism when the soviet union was an immense superpower armed to the teeth with weapons with an immense security service with political allies and supporters worldwide not only that but all the respectable specialists and experts were unanimous that while the soviet regime had various problems it was very far from collapse the notion that nato would soon replace the soviet military not only in eastern europe but even in part of the soviet union was absolutely unthinkable and yet it all happened very very fast i would argue that the soviet union completely collapsed in the span of less than 4 short years 1990 1993 how and why this happened is beyond the scope of this article but what is undeniable is that in 1989 the soviet union was still an apparently powerful entity while by the end of 1993 it was gone smashed into pieces by the very nomenklatura which used to rule over it how did almost everybody miss that because ideologically poisoned analysis leads to intellectual complacence a failure of imagination and generally an almost total inability to even hypothetically look at possible outcomes this is how almost all the soviet specialists got it wrong the kgb by the way had predicted this outcome and warned the politburo but the soviet gerontocrats were ideologically paralyzed and were both unable and often unwilling to take any preventative action the kerensky masonic regime in 1917 russia the monarchy in iran or the apartheid regime in south africa also collapsed very fast once the self destruction mechanism was in place and launched you can think of that regime self destruction mechanism as our e1 phase in our metaphor above as for e2 you can think of it as whatever small push like event which precipitates the quick and final collapse apparently with great ease and minimum energy spent at this point it is important to explain what exactly a final collapse looks like some people are under the very mistaken assumption that a collapsed society or country looks like a mad max world this is not so the ukraine has been a failed state for several years already but it still exists on the map people live there work most people still have electricity albeit not 24 7 a government exists and at least officially law and order is maintained this kind of collapsed society can go on for years maybe decades but it is in a state of collapse nonetheless as it has reached all the 5 stages of collapse as defined by dmitry orlov in his seminal book the five stages of collapse survivors toolkit where he mentions the following 5 stages of collapse stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost having personally visited argentina in the 1970s and 1980s and seen the russia of the early 1990s i can attest that a society can completely collapse while maintaining a lot of the external appearances of a normal still functioning society unlike the titanic most collapsed regimes don t fully sink they remain about half under water and half above possibly with an orchestra still playing joyful music and in the most expensive top deck cabins a pretty luxurious lifestyle can be maintained by the elites but for most of the passengers such a collapse results in poverty insecurity political instability and a huge loss in welfare furthermore in terms of motion a half sunk ship is no ship at all here is the crucial thing as long as the ship s pa systems keep announcing great weather and buffet brunches and as long as most of the passengers remain in their cabins and watch tv instead of looking out of the window the illusion of normalcy can be maintained for a fairly long while even after a collapse during the e1 phase outlined above most passengers will be kept in total ignorance lest they riot or protest and only when e2 strikes totally unexpectedly for most passengers does reality eventually destroy the ignorance and illusions of the brainwashed passengers obama was truly the beginning of the end i have lived in the us from 1986 1991 and from 2002 to today and there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the country has undergone a huge decline over the past decades in fact i would argue that the us has been living under e1 condition since at least dubya and that this process dramatically accelerated under obama and trump i believe that we reached the e2 edge of the table moment in 2018 and that from now on even a relatively minor incident can result in a sudden downturn i e a catastrophe still i decided to check with the undisputed specialist of this issue and so i emailed dmitry orlov and asked him the following question in your recent article the year the planet flipped over you paint a devastating picture of the state of the empire it is already safe to declare trump s plan to make america great again maga a failure beneath the rosy statistics of us economic growth hides the hideous fact that it is the result of a tax holiday granted to transnational corporations to entice them to repatriate their profits while this hasn t helped them their stocks are currently cratering it has been a disaster for the us government as well as for the economic system as whole tax receipts have shrunk the budget deficit for 2018 exceeds 779 billion meanwhile the trade wars which trump initiated have caused the trade deficit to increase by 17 from the year before plans to repatriate industrial production from low cost countries remain vaporous because the three key elements which china had as it industrialized cheap energy cheap labor and low cost of doing business are altogether missing government debt is already beyond reasonable and its expansion is still accelerating with just the interest payments set to exceed half a trillion a year within a decade this trajectory does not bode well for the continued existence of the united states as a going concern nobody either in the united states or beyond has the power to significantly alter this trajectory trump s thrashing about may have moved things along faster than they otherwise would have at least in the sense of helping convince the entire world that the us is selfish feckless ultimately self destructive and generally unreliable as a partner in the end it won t matter who was president of the us it never has among those the us president has succeeded in hurting most are his european allies his attacks on russian energy exports to europe on european car manufacturers and on europe s trade with iran have caused a fair amount of damage both political and economic without compensating for it with any perceived or actual benefits meanwhile as the globalist world order which much of europe s population appears ready to declare a failure begins to unravel the european union is rapidly becoming ungovernable with established political parties unable to form coalitions with ever more numerous populist upstarts it is too early to say that the eu has already failed altogether but it already seems safe to predict that within a decade it will no longer remain as a serious international factor although the disastrous quality and the ruinous mistakes of europe s own leadership deserve a lot of the blame some of it should rest with the erratic destructive behavior of their transoceanic big brother the eu has already morphed into a strictly regional affair unable to project power or entertain any global geopolitical ambitions same goes for washington which is going to either depart voluntarily due to lack of funds or get chased out from much of the world the departure from syria is inevitable whether trump under relentless pressure from his bipartisan warmongers backtracks on this commitment or not now that syria has been armed with russia s up to date air defense weapons the us no longer maintains air superiority there and without air superiority the us military is unable to do anything afghanistan is next there it seems outlandish to think that the washingtonians will be able to achieve any sort of reasonable accommodation with the taliban their departure will spell the end of kabul as a center of corruption where foreigners steal humanitarian aid and other resources somewhere along the way the remaining us troops will also be pulled out of iraq where the parliament angered by trump s impromptu visit to a us base recently voted to expel them and that will put paid to the entire us adventure in the middle east since 9 11 4 704 439 588 308 has been squandered to be precise or 14 444 for every man woman and child in the us the biggest winners in all of this are obviously the people of the entire region because they will no longer be subjected to indiscriminate us harassment and bombardment followed by russia china and iran with russia solidifying its position as the ultimate arbiter of international security arrangements thanks to its unmatched military capabilities and demonstrated knowhow for coercion to peace syria s fate will be decided by russia iran and turkey with the us not even invited to the talks afghanistan will fall into the sphere of the shanghai cooperation organization and the biggest losers will be former us regional allies first and foremost israel followed by saudi arabia my question for you is this where would you place the us or the empire on your 5 stages of decline and do you believe that the us or the empire can reverse that trend here is dmitry s reply collapse at each stage is a historical process that takes time to run its course as the system adapts to changing circumstances compensates for its weaknesses and finds ways to continue functioning at some level but what changes rather suddenly is faith or to put it in more businesslike terms sentiment a large segment of the population or an entire political class within a country or the entire world can function based on a certain set of assumptions for much longer than the situation warrants but then over a very short period of time switch to a different set of assumptions all that sustains the status quo beyond that point is institutional inertia it imposes limits on how fast systems can change without collapsing entirely beyond that point people will tolerate the older practices only until replacements for them can be found stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost internationally the major change in sentiment in the world has to do with the role of the us dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and the yen the other two reserve currencies of the three legged globalist central banker stool the world is transitioning to the use of local currencies currency swaps and commodities markets backed by gold the catalyst for this change of sentiment was provided by the us administration itself which sawed through its own perch by its use of unilateral sanctions by using its control over dollar based transactions to block international transactions it doesn t happen to like it forced other countries to start looking for alternatives now a growing list of countries sees throwing off the shackles of the us dollar as a strategic goal russia and china use the ruble and the yuan for their expanding trade iran sells oil to india for rupees saudi arabia has started to accept the yuan for its oil this change has many knock on effects if the dollar is no longer needed to conduct international trade other nations no longer have hold large quantities of it in reserve consequently there is no longer a need to buy up large quantities of us treasury notes therefore it becomes unnecessary to run large trade surpluses with the us essentially conducting trade at a loss further the attractiveness of the us as an export market drops and the cost of imports to the us rises thereby driving up cost inflation a vicious spiral ensues in which the ability of the us government to borrow internationally to finance the gaping chasm of its various deficits becomes impaired sovereign default of the us government and national bankruptcy then follow the us may still look mighty but its dire fiscal predicament coupled with its denial of the inevitability of bankruptcy makes it into something of a blanche dubois from the tennessee williams play a streetcar named desire she was always dependent on the kindness of strangers but was tragically unable to tell the difference between kindness and desire in this case the desire is for national advantage and security and to minimize risk by getting rid of an unreliable trading partner how quickly or slowly this comes to pass is difficult to guess at and impossible to calculate it is possible to think of the financial system in terms of a physical analogue with masses of funds traveling at some velocity having a certain inertia p mv and with forces acting on that mass to accelerate it along a different trajectory f ma it is also possible to think of it in terms of hordes of stampeding animals who can change course abruptly when panicked the recent abrupt moves in the financial markets where trillions of dollars of notional purely speculative value have been wiped out within weeks are more in line with the latter model stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost within the us there is really no other alternative than the market there are a few rustic enclaves mostly religious communities that can feed themselves but that s a rarity for everyone else there is no choice but to be a consumer consumers who are broke are called bums but they are still consumers to the extent that the us has a culture it is a commercial culture in which the goodness of a person is based on the goodly sums of money in their possession such a culture can die by becoming irrelevant when everyone is dead broke but by then most of the carriers of this culture are likely to be dead too alternatively it can be replaced by a more humane culture that isn t entirely based on the cult of mammon perhaps dare i think through a return to a pre protestant pre catholic christian ethic that values people s souls above objects of value stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost all is very murky at the moment but i would venture to guess that most people in the us are too distracted too stressed and too preoccupied with their own vices and obsessions to pay much attention to the political realm of the ones they do pay attention a fair number of them seem clued in to the fact that the us is not a democracy at all but an elites only sandbox in which transnational corporate and oligarchic interests build and knock down each others sandcastles the extreme political polarization where two virtually identical pro capitalist pro war parties pretend to wage battle by virtue signaling may be a symptom of the extremely decrepit state of the entire political arrangement people are made to watch the billowing smoke and to listen to the deafening noise in the hopes that they won t notice that the wheels are no longer turning the fact that what amounts to palace intrigue the fracas between the white house the two houses of congress and a ghoulish grand inquisitor named mueller has taken center stage is uncannily reminiscent of various earlier political collapses such as the disintegration of the ottoman empire or of the fall and the consequent beheading of louis xvi the fact that trump like the ottoman worthies stocks his harem with east european women lends an eerie touch that said most people in the us seem blind to the nature of their overlords in a way that the french with their gilettes jaunes movement just as an example are definitely not stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost i have been saying for some years now that within the us social collapse has largely run its course although whether people actually believe that is an entire matter entirely defining your people is rather difficult the symbols are still there the flag the statue of liberty and a predilection for iced drinks and heaping plates of greasy fried foods but the melting pot seems to have suffered a meltdown and melted all the way to china at present half the households within the us speak a language other than english at home and a fair share of the rest speak dialects of english that are not mutually intelligible with the standard north american english dialect of broadcast television and university lecturers throughout its history as a british colony and as a nation the us has been dominated by the anglo ethnos the designation ethnos is not an ethnic label it is not strictly based on genealogy language culture habitat form of government or any other single factor or group of factors these may all be important to one extent or another but the viability of an ethnos is based solely on its cohesion and the mutual inclusivity and common purpose of its members the anglo ethnos reached its zenith in the wake of world war ii during which many social groups were intermixed in the military and their more intelligent members fantastic potential was unleashed when privilege the curse of the anglo ethnos since its inception was temporarily replaced with merit and the more talented demobilized men of whatever extraction were given a chance at education and social advancement by the gi bill speaking a new sort of american english based on the ohio dialect as a lingua franca these yanks male racist sexist and chauvinistic and at least in their own minds victorious were ready to remake the entire world in their own image they proceeded to flood the entire world with oil us oil production was in full flush then and with machines that burned it such passionate acts of ethnogenesis are rare but not unusual the romans who conquered the entire mediterranean basin the barbarians who then sacked rome the mongols who later conquered most of eurasia and the germans who for a very brief moment possessed an outsized lebensraum are other examples and now it is time to ask what remains of this proud conquering anglo ethnos today we hear shrill feminist cries about toxic masculinity and minorities of every stripe railing against whitesplaining and in response we hear a few whimpers but mostly silence those proud conquering virile yanks who met and fraternized with the red army at the river elbe on april 25 1945 where are they haven t they devolved into a sad little subethnos of effeminate porn addicted overgrown boys who shave their pubic hair and need written permission to have sex without fear of being charged with rape will the anglo ethnos persist as a relict similar to how the english have managed to hold onto their royals who are technically no longer even aristocrats since they now practice exogamy with commoners or will it get wiped out in a wave of depression mental illness and opiate abuse its glorious history of rapine plunder and genocide erased and the statues of its war heros criminals knocked down only time will tell stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost the term culture means many things to many people but it is more productive to observe cultures than to argue about them cultures are expressed through people s stereotypical behaviors that are readily observable in public these are not the negative stereotypes often used to identify and reject outsiders but the positive stereotypes cultural standards of behavior really that serve as requirements for social adequacy and inclusion we can readily assess the viability of a culture by observing the stereotypical behaviors of its members do people exist as a single continuous inclusive sovereign realm or as a set of exclusive potentially warring enclaves segregated by income ethnicity education level political affiliation and so on do you see a lot of walls gates checkpoints security cameras and no trespassing signs is the law of the land enforced uniformly or are there good neighborhoods bad neighborhoods and no go zones where even the police fear to tread do random people thrown together in public spontaneously enter into conversation with each other and are comfortable with being crowded together or are they aloof and fearful and prefer to hide their face in the little glowing rectangle of their smartphone jealously guarding their personal space and ready to regard any encroachment on it as an assault do people remain good natured and tolerant toward each other even when hard pressed or do they hide behind a façade of tense superficial politeness and fly into a rage at the slightest provocation is conversation soft in tone gracious and respectful or is it loud shrill rude and polluted with foul language do people dress well out of respect for each other or to show off or are they all just déclassé slobs even the ones with money observe how their children behave are they fearful of strangers and trapped in a tiny world of their own or are they open to the world and ready to treat any stranger as a surrogate brother or sister aunt or uncle grandmother or grandfather without requiring any special introduction do the adults studiously ignore each others children or do they spontaneously act as a single family if there is a wreck on the road do they spontaneously rush to each others rescue and pull people out before the wreck explodes or do they in the immortal words of frank zappa get on the phone and call up some flakes who rush on over and wreck it some more if there is a flood or a fire do the neighbors take in the people who are rendered homeless or do they allow them to wait for the authorities to show up and bus them to some makeshift government shelter it is possible to quote statistics or to provide anecdotal evidence to assess the state and the viability of a culture but your own eyes and other senses can provide all the evidence you need to make that determination for yourself and to decide how much faith to put in the goodness of humanity that is evident in the people around you dmity concluded his reply by summarizing his view like this cultural and social collapse are very far along financial collapse is waiting for a trigger commercial collapse will happen in stages some of which food deserts for instance have already happened in many places political collapse will only become visible once the political class gives up it s not as simple as saying which stage we are at they are all happening in parallel to one extent or another my own totally subjective opinion is that the us has already reached stages 1 through 4 and that there are signs that stage 5 has begun mainly in big cities as us small towns and rural areas trump s power base by the way are still struggling to maintain the norms and behaviors one could observe in the us of the 1980s when i have visitors from europe they always comment how friendly and welcoming us americans are true i live in small town in east central florida not in miami these are the communities which voted for trump because they said we want our country back alas instead of giving them their country back trump gifted it to the neocons conclusion connecting the dots or not frankly the dots are all over the place it is really hard to miss them however for the doubleplusgoodthinking ideological drone they remain largely invisible and this is not due to any eyesight problem but due to that drone s total inability to connect the dots these are the kind of folks who danced on the deck of the titanic while it was sinking for them when the inevitable catastrophe comes it will be a total mind blowing surprise but until that moment they will keep on denying the obvious no matter how obvious that obvious has become don t expect these two losers to fix anything they will only make things worse in the meantime the us ruling elites are locked into an ugly internal struggle which only further weakens the us what is so telling is that the democrats are still stuck with their same clueless incompetent and infinitely arrogant leadership in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the democratic party is in deep crisis and that new faces are desperately needed but no they are still completely stuck in their old ways and the same gang of gerontocrats continues to rule the party apparatus that is another surefire sign of degeneracy when a regime can only produce incompetent often old leaders who are completely out of touch with reality and who blame their own failures on internal deplorables and external the russians factors again think of the soviet union under brezhnev the apartheid regime in south africa under f w de klerk or the kerensky regime in 1917 russia as for the republicans they are basically a subsidiary of the israeli likud party just take a look at the long list of losers the likud produced at home and you will get a sense of what they can do in its us colony eventually the us will rebound i have no doubts about that at all this is a big country with millions of immensely talented people immense natural resources and no credible threat to it s territory but that can only happen after a real regime change as opposed to a change in presidential administration which itself is only going to happen after an e2 catastrophe collapse until then we will all be waiting for godot
furthermore according to alexander rasuvayev director of alpari s analytical department reserve currency or not there s little point of holding a currency with a country you don t trade with unlike europe and china we do almost no trade with the us therefore it s necessary to have a volume of reserves in the european and chinese currencies comparable to trade in order to maintain foreign trade turnover the analyst said us market weakness there s another purely economic risk to holding dollars too analysts warn and that is the threat that the us stock market which faced its worst decline since the great depression last month may collapse again according to sputnik contributor natalya dembinskaya if the fed managed to stamp out the 2008 financial crisis by flooding it with dollars under president obama it s unclear whether it will do so again under president trump in that case the world may well break up into several currency zones one of which will be the yuan she wrote in that sense the cbr is acting proactively displacing the dollar and increasing its share of yuan based reserves according to dembinskaya

combined means of economic military technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence traditionally superpowers are preeminent among the great powers this one an extremely powerful nation especially one capable of influencing international events and the acts and policies of less powerful nations or this one an international governing body able to enforce its will upon the most powerful states i have mentioned the very visible decline of the us and its associated empire in many of my articles already so i won t repeat it here other than to say that the ability to exert influence and impose its will is probably the best criteria to measure the magnitude of the fall of the us since trump came to power the process was already started by dubya and obama but it sure accelerated with the donald but i do want to use a metaphor to revisit the concept of catastrophe if you place an object in the middle of a table and then push it right to the edge you will exert some amount of energy we can call e1 then if the edge of the table is smooth and you just push the object over the edge you exercise a much smaller amount of energy we can call e2 and in most cases if the table is big enough you will also find that e1 is much bigger than e2 yet e2 coming after e1 took place triggered a much more dramatic event instead of smoothly gliding over the table top the object suddenly falls down and shatters that sudden fall can also be called a catastrophe this is also something which happens in history take the example of the soviet union the fate of all empires some readers might recall how alexander solzhenitsyn repeatedly declared in the 1980s that he was sure that the soviet regime would collapse and that he would return to russia he was of course vitriolically ridiculed by all the specialists and experts after all why would anybody want to listen to some weird russian exile with politically suspicious ideas there were rumors of monarchism and anti semitism when the soviet union was an immense superpower armed to the teeth with weapons with an immense security service with political allies and supporters worldwide not only that but all the respectable specialists and experts were unanimous that while the soviet regime had various problems it was very far from collapse the notion that nato would soon replace the soviet military not only in eastern europe but even in part of the soviet union was absolutely unthinkable and yet it all happened very very fast i would argue that the soviet union completely collapsed in the span of less than 4 short years 1990 1993 how and why this happened is beyond the scope of this article but what is undeniable is that in 1989 the soviet union was still an apparently powerful entity while by the end of 1993 it was gone smashed into pieces by the very nomenklatura which used to rule over it how did almost everybody miss that because ideologically poisoned analysis leads to intellectual complacence a failure of imagination and generally an almost total inability to even hypothetically look at possible outcomes this is how almost all the soviet specialists got it wrong the kgb by the way had predicted this outcome and warned the politburo but the soviet gerontocrats were ideologically paralyzed and were both unable and often unwilling to take any preventative action the kerensky masonic regime in 1917 russia the monarchy in iran or the apartheid regime in south africa also collapsed very fast once the self destruction mechanism was in place and launched you can think of that regime self destruction mechanism as our e1 phase in our metaphor above as for e2 you can think of it as whatever small push like event which precipitates the quick and final collapse apparently with great ease and minimum energy spent at this point it is important to explain what exactly a final collapse looks like some people are under the very mistaken assumption that a collapsed society or country looks like a mad max world this is not so the ukraine has been a failed state for several years already but it still exists on the map people live there work most people still have electricity albeit not 24 7 a government exists and at least officially law and order is maintained this kind of collapsed society can go on for years maybe decades but it is in a state of collapse nonetheless as it has reached all the 5 stages of collapse as defined by dmitry orlov in his seminal book the five stages of collapse survivors toolkit where he mentions the following 5 stages of collapse stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost having personally visited argentina in the 1970s and 1980s and seen the russia of the early 1990s i can attest that a society can completely collapse while maintaining a lot of the external appearances of a normal still functioning society unlike the titanic most collapsed regimes don t fully sink they remain about half under water and half above possibly with an orchestra still playing joyful music and in the most expensive top deck cabins a pretty luxurious lifestyle can be maintained by the elites but for most of the passengers such a collapse results in poverty insecurity political instability and a huge loss in welfare furthermore in terms of motion a half sunk ship is no ship at all here is the crucial thing as long as the ship s pa systems keep announcing great weather and buffet brunches and as long as most of the passengers remain in their cabins and watch tv instead of looking out of the window the illusion of normalcy can be maintained for a fairly long while even after a collapse during the e1 phase outlined above most passengers will be kept in total ignorance lest they riot or protest and only when e2 strikes totally unexpectedly for most passengers does reality eventually destroy the ignorance and illusions of the brainwashed passengers obama was truly the beginning of the end i have lived in the us from 1986 1991 and from 2002 to today and there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the country has undergone a huge decline over the past decades in fact i would argue that the us has been living under e1 condition since at least dubya and that this process dramatically accelerated under obama and trump i believe that we reached the e2 edge of the table moment in 2018 and that from now on even a relatively minor incident can result in a sudden downturn i e a catastrophe still i decided to check with the undisputed specialist of this issue and so i emailed dmitry orlov and asked him the following question in your recent article the year the planet flipped over you paint a devastating picture of the state of the empire it is already safe to declare trump s plan to make america great again maga a failure beneath the rosy statistics of us economic growth hides the hideous fact that it is the result of a tax holiday granted to transnational corporations to entice them to repatriate their profits while this hasn t helped them their stocks are currently cratering it has been a disaster for the us government as well as for the economic system as whole tax receipts have shrunk the budget deficit for 2018 exceeds 779 billion meanwhile the trade wars which trump initiated have caused the trade deficit to increase by 17 from the year before plans to repatriate industrial production from low cost countries remain vaporous because the three key elements which china had as it industrialized cheap energy cheap labor and low cost of doing business are altogether missing government debt is already beyond reasonable and its expansion is still accelerating with just the interest payments set to exceed half a trillion a year within a decade this trajectory does not bode well for the continued existence of the united states as a going concern nobody either in the united states or beyond has the power to significantly alter this trajectory trump s thrashing about may have moved things along faster than they otherwise would have at least in the sense of helping convince the entire world that the us is selfish feckless ultimately self destructive and generally unreliable as a partner in the end it won t matter who was president of the us it never has among those the us president has succeeded in hurting most are his european allies his attacks on russian energy exports to europe on european car manufacturers and on europe s trade with iran have caused a fair amount of damage both political and economic without compensating for it with any perceived or actual benefits meanwhile as the globalist world order which much of europe s population appears ready to declare a failure begins to unravel the european union is rapidly becoming ungovernable with established political parties unable to form coalitions with ever more numerous populist upstarts it is too early to say that the eu has already failed altogether but it already seems safe to predict that within a decade it will no longer remain as a serious international factor although the disastrous quality and the ruinous mistakes of europe s own leadership deserve a lot of the blame some of it should rest with the erratic destructive behavior of their transoceanic big brother the eu has already morphed into a strictly regional affair unable to project power or entertain any global geopolitical ambitions same goes for washington which is going to either depart voluntarily due to lack of funds or get chased out from much of the world the departure from syria is inevitable whether trump under relentless pressure from his bipartisan warmongers backtracks on this commitment or not now that syria has been armed with russia s up to date air defense weapons the us no longer maintains air superiority there and without air superiority the us military is unable to do anything afghanistan is next there it seems outlandish to think that the washingtonians will be able to achieve any sort of reasonable accommodation with the taliban their departure will spell the end of kabul as a center of corruption where foreigners steal humanitarian aid and other resources somewhere along the way the remaining us troops will also be pulled out of iraq where the parliament angered by trump s impromptu visit to a us base recently voted to expel them and that will put paid to the entire us adventure in the middle east since 9 11 4 704 439 588 308 has been squandered to be precise or 14 444 for every man woman and child in the us the biggest winners in all of this are obviously the people of the entire region because they will no longer be subjected to indiscriminate us harassment and bombardment followed by russia china and iran with russia solidifying its position as the ultimate arbiter of international security arrangements thanks to its unmatched military capabilities and demonstrated knowhow for coercion to peace syria s fate will be decided by russia iran and turkey with the us not even invited to the talks afghanistan will fall into the sphere of the shanghai cooperation organization and the biggest losers will be former us regional allies first and foremost israel followed by saudi arabia my question for you is this where would you place the us or the empire on your 5 stages of decline and do you believe that the us or the empire can reverse that trend here is dmitry s reply collapse at each stage is a historical process that takes time to run its course as the system adapts to changing circumstances compensates for its weaknesses and finds ways to continue functioning at some level but what changes rather suddenly is faith or to put it in more businesslike terms sentiment a large segment of the population or an entire political class within a country or the entire world can function based on a certain set of assumptions for much longer than the situation warrants but then over a very short period of time switch to a different set of assumptions all that sustains the status quo beyond that point is institutional inertia it imposes limits on how fast systems can change without collapsing entirely beyond that point people will tolerate the older practices only until replacements for them can be found native advertising stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost internationally the major change in sentiment in the world has to do with the role of the us dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and the yen the other two reserve currencies of the three legged globalist central banker stool the world is transitioning to the use of local currencies currency swaps and commodities markets backed by gold the catalyst for this change of sentiment was provided by the us administration itself which sawed through its own perch by its use of unilateral sanctions by using its control over dollar based transactions to block international transactions it doesn t happen to like it forced other countries to start looking for alternatives now a growing list of countries sees throwing off the shackles of the us dollar as a strategic goal russia and china use the ruble and the yuan for their expanding trade iran sells oil to india for rupees saudi arabia has started to accept the yuan for its oil this change has many knock on effects if the dollar is no longer needed to conduct international trade other nations no longer have hold large quantities of it in reserve consequently there is no longer a need to buy up large quantities of us treasury notes therefore it becomes unnecessary to run large trade surpluses with the us essentially conducting trade at a loss further the attractiveness of the us as an export market drops and the cost of imports to the us rises thereby driving up cost inflation a vicious spiral ensues in which the ability of the us government to borrow internationally to finance the gaping chasm of its various deficits becomes impaired sovereign default of the us government and national bankruptcy then follow the us may still look mighty but its dire fiscal predicament coupled with its denial of the inevitability of bankruptcy makes it into something of a blanche dubois from the tennessee williams play a streetcar named desire she was always dependent on the kindness of strangers but was tragically unable to tell the difference between kindness and desire in this case the desire is for national advantage and security and to minimize risk by getting rid of an unreliable trading partner how quickly or slowly this comes to pass is difficult to guess at and impossible to calculate it is possible to think of the financial system in terms of a physical analogue with masses of funds traveling at some velocity having a certain inertia p mv and with forces acting on that mass to accelerate it along a different trajectory f ma it is also possible to think of it in terms of hordes of stampeding animals who can change course abruptly when panicked the recent abrupt moves in the financial markets where trillions of dollars of notional purely speculative value have been wiped out within weeks are more in line with the latter model stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost within the us there is really no other alternative than the market there are a few rustic enclaves mostly religious communities that can feed themselves but that s a rarity for everyone else there is no choice but to be a consumer consumers who are broke are called bums but they are still consumers to the extent that the us has a culture it is a commercial culture in which the goodness of a person is based on the goodly sums of money in their possession such a culture can die by becoming irrelevant when everyone is dead broke but by then most of the carriers of this culture are likely to be dead too alternatively it can be replaced by a more humane culture that isn t entirely based on the cult of mammon perhaps dare i think through a return to a pre protestant pre catholic christian ethic that values people s souls above objects of value stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost all is very murky at the moment but i would venture to guess that most people in the us are too distracted too stressed and too preoccupied with their own vices and obsessions to pay much attention to the political realm of the ones they do pay attention a fair number of them seem clued in to the fact that the us is not a democracy at all but an elites only sandbox in which transnational corporate and oligarchic interests build and knock down each others sandcastles the extreme political polarization where two virtually identical pro capitalist pro war parties pretend to wage battle by virtue signaling may be a symptom of the extremely decrepit state of the entire political arrangement people are made to watch the billowing smoke and to listen to the deafening noise in the hopes that they won t notice that the wheels are no longer turning the fact that what amounts to palace intrigue the fracas between the white house the two houses of congress and a ghoulish grand inquisitor named mueller has taken center stage is uncannily reminiscent of various earlier political collapses such as the disintegration of the ottoman empire or of the fall and the consequent beheading of louis xvi the fact that trump like the ottoman worthies stocks his harem with east european women lends an eerie touch that said most people in the us seem blind to the nature of their overlords in a way that the french with their gilettes jaunesmovement just as an example are definitely not stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost i have been saying for some years now that within the us social collapse has largely run its course although whether people actually believe that is an entire matter entirely defining your people is rather difficult the symbols are still there the flag the statue of liberty and a predilection for iced drinks and heaping plates of greasy fried foods but the melting pot seems to have suffered a meltdown and melted all the way to china at present half the households within the us speak a language other than english at home and a fair share of the rest speak dialects of english that are not mutually intelligible with the standard north american english dialect of broadcast television and university lecturers throughout its history as a british colony and as a nation the us has been dominated by the anglo ethnos the designation ethnos is not an ethnic label it is not strictly based on genealogy language culture habitat form of government or any other single factor or group of factors these may all be important to one extent or another but the viability of an ethnos is based solely on its cohesion and the mutual inclusivity and common purpose of its members the anglo ethnos reached its zenith in the wake of world war ii during which many social groups were intermixed in the military and their more intelligent members fantastic potential was unleashed when privilege the curse of the anglo ethnos since its inception was temporarily replaced with merit and the more talented demobilized men of whatever extraction were given a chance at education and social advancement by the gi bill speaking a new sort of american english based on the ohio dialect as a lingua franca these yanks male racist sexist and chauvinistic and at least in their own minds victorious were ready to remake the entire world in their own image they proceeded to flood the entire world with oil us oil production was in full flush then and with machines that burned it such passionate acts of ethnogenesis are rare but not unusual the romans who conquered the entire mediterranean basin the barbarians who then sacked rome the mongols who later conquered most of eurasia and the germans who for a very brief moment possessed an outsized lebensraum are other examples and now it is time to ask what remains of this proud conquering anglo ethnos today we hear shrill feminist cries about toxic masculinity and minorities of every stripe railing against whitesplaining and in response we hear a few whimpers but mostly silence those proud conquering virile yanks who met and fraternized with the red army at the river elbe on april 25 1945 where are they haven t they devolved into a sad little subethnos of effeminate porn addicted overgrown boys who shave their pubic hair and need written permission to have sex without fear of being charged with rape will the anglo ethnos persist as a relict similar to how the english have managed to hold onto their royals who are technically no longer even aristocrats since they now practice exogamy with commoners or will it get wiped out in a wave of depression mental illness and opiate abuse its glorious history of rapine plunder and genocide erased and the statues of its war heros criminals knocked down only time will tell stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost the term culture means many things to many people but it is more productive to observe cultures than to argue about them cultures are expressed through people s stereotypical behaviors that are readily observable in public these are not the negative stereotypes often used to identify and reject outsiders but the positive stereotypes cultural standards of behavior really that serve as requirements for social adequacy and inclusion we can readily assess the viability of a culture by observing the stereotypical behaviors of its members do people exist as a single continuous inclusive sovereign realm or as a set of exclusive potentially warring enclaves segregated by income ethnicity education level political affiliation and so on do you see a lot of walls gates checkpoints security cameras and no trespassing signs is the law of the land enforced uniformly or are there good neighborhoods bad neighborhoods and no go zones where even the police fear to tread do random people thrown together in public spontaneously enter into conversation with each other and are comfortable with being crowded together or are they aloof and fearful and prefer to hide their face in the little glowing rectangle of their smartphone jealously guarding their personal space and ready to regard any encroachment on it as an assault do people remain good natured and tolerant toward each other even when hard pressed or do they hide behind a façade of tense superficial politeness and fly into a rage at the slightest provocation is conversation soft in tone gracious and respectful or is it loud shrill rude and polluted with foul language do people dress well out of respect for each other or to show off or are they all just déclassé slobs even the ones with money observe how their children behave are they fearful of strangers and trapped in a tiny world of their own or are they open to the world and ready to treat any stranger as a surrogate brother or sister aunt or uncle grandmother or grandfather without requiring any special introduction do the adults studiously ignore each others children or do they spontaneously act as a single family if there is a wreck on the road do they spontaneously rush to each others rescue and pull people out before the wreck explodes or do they in the immortal words of frank zappa get on the phone and call up some flakes who rush on over and wreck it some more if there is a flood or a fire do the neighbors take in the people who are rendered homeless or do they allow them to wait for the authorities to show up and bus them to some makeshift government shelter it is possible to quote statistics or to provide anecdotal evidence to assess the state and the viability of a culture but your own eyes and other senses can provide all the evidence you need to make that determination for yourself and to decide how much faith to put in the goodness of humanity that is evident in the people around you dmity concluded his reply by summarizing his view like this cultural and social collapse are very far along financial collapse is waiting for a trigger commercial collapse will happen in stages some of which food deserts for instance have already happened in many places political collapse will only become visible once the political class gives up it s not as simple as saying which stage we are at they are all happening in parallel to one extent or another my own totally subjective opinion is that the us has already reached stages 1 through 4 and that there are signs that stage 5 has begun mainly in big cities as us small towns and rural areas trump s power base by the way are still struggling to maintain the norms and behaviors one could observe in the us of the 1980s when i have visitors from europe they always comment how friendly and welcoming us americans are true i live in small town in east central florida not in miami these are the communities which voted for trump because they said we want our country back alas instead of giving them their country back trump gifted it to the neocons conclusion connecting the dots or not frankly the dots are all over the place it is really hard to miss them however for the doubleplusgoodthinking ideological drone they remain largely invisible and this is not due to any eyesight problem but due to that drone s total inability to connect the dots these are the kind of folks who danced on the deck of the titanic while it was sinking for them when the inevitable catastrophe comes it will be a total mind blowing surprise but until that moment they will keep on denying the obvious no matter how obvious that obvious has become don t expect these two losers to fix anything they will only make things worse in the meantime the us ruling elites are locked into an ugly internal struggle which only further weakens the us what is so telling is that the democrats are still stuck with their same clueless incompetent and infinitely arrogant leadership in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the democratic party is in deep crisis and that new faces are desperately needed but no they are still completely stuck in their old ways and the same gang of gerontocrats continues to rule the party apparatus that is another surefire sign of degeneracy when a regime can only produce incompetent often old leaders who are completely out of touch with reality and who blame their own failures on internal deplorables and external the russians factors again think of the soviet union under brezhnev the apartheid regime in south africa under f w de klerk or the kerensky regime in 1917 russia as for the republicans they are basically a subsidiary of the israeli likud party just take a look at the long list of losers the likud produced at home and you will get a sense of what they can do in its us colony eventually the us will rebound i have no doubts about that at all this is a big country with millions of immensely talented people immense natural resources and no credible threat to it s territory but that can only happen after a real regime change as opposed to a change in presidential administration which itself is only going to happen after an e2 catastrophe collapse until then we will all be waiting for godot click to visit the tbp store for great tbp merchandise
risk sentiments continued to recover last week as fed officials indicated they would be patient before making the next rate move positive developments of us china trade talks also helped one notable development was the rebound in us treasury yields as 10 year yield reclaimed 2 7 while 30 year yield is back above 3 0 japan 10 year jgb yield also turned positive these are signs of stabilization in the financial markets the recording setting government shutdown in the us is so far having little impact on the markets too as a result yen ended as the weakest one for the week followed by dollar and then swiss franc new zealand dollar was the strongest followed by australian dollar this is a rather reasonable result of return of risk appetite sterling ended as the third strongest as the brexit parliamentary vote is approaching and the chance of no brexit is rising canadian dollar was also strong but it suffered some setback as oil prices pullback quite notably on friday brexit is set to be the major focus this week government shutdown sets new record no emergency no end in sight as of saturday the us government shutdown has stretched into its 22nd consecutive days surpassing the 21 day record set in 1995 96 trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders as his request for funding for the border wall of any form was rejected bluntly by democrats on friday trump said the easy solution is for me to call a national emergency i have the absolute right to do it but he added i m not going to do it so fast because this is something congress should do the is no end in sight for the shutdown some 800k government employees missed their first paycheck on friday around 380k workers have been furloughed and should there is no breakthrough next week the furloughed workers could be counted as unemployed the would result in a big contraction of employment to be shown in the january non farm payroll report with a surge in unemployment rate probably back above 4 for now there is little impact on the financial markets but investors might start to feeling something as it extends into uncharted territory dow s rebound continues setting sight on 55 day ema us stocks extended the post christmas rebound last week dow reached as high as 24014 78 and broke 38 2 retracement of 26951 81 to 21712 53 at 23864 30 the slightly stronger than expected rebound is now raising the chance that price action from 26951 81 are merely developing into a sideway pattern rather than a deeper correction the next hurdle will be 55 day ema now at 24289 58 sustained break will affirm this case and target 61 8 retracement at 24943 09 however rejection from there followed by break of 23413 48 support will turn focus back to 21712 53 low instead futures suggest fed to stand pat for 2019 but less pessimistic after patient fedspeaks the messages from fed officials as well as the fomc minutes were very clear last week with inflation low and under control fed has the room to be patient to wait and see the developments in the economy before raising interest rate again officials including chair jerome powell want that patience too the december fomc minutes also noted that many participants preferred to be patient about further policy firming amidst muted inflation pressures and participants expressed that recent developments including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier more in fomc minutes reveal dovish notes which were hidden in december for december 2019 meeting fed funds futures are pricing in 71 8 chance of interesting rate being unchanged at 2 25 2 50 it s slightly higher than last week s 69 7 chance of a rate cut dropped notably to around 12 5 down from last week s 26 it s also now lower than chance of a hike at 14 5 up from less than 4 a week ago that is investors are now slightly less pessimistic on the rate path dollar index in medium term correction towards 93 81 94 09 dollar index s choppy decline from 97 71 extended to as low as 95 02 last week the development suggests that 97 71 is a medium term on bearish divergence condition in daily macd after rejection by 61 8 retracement of 103 82 to 88 25 at 97 87 fall from 97 71 is corrective the five wave sequence from 88 25 deeper decline would likely be seen to 93 81 support which is closed to 38 2 retracement of 88 25 to 97 71 at 94 09 though we d expect strong support from there to bring rebound rise from 88 25 is in still in favor to resume at a later stage chinese yuan rebounded remarkably after trade talks with us in beijing the vice ministerial level us china trade talks ended in beijing with one day extension the extension itself was seen as a positive sign chinese mofcom later said there extensive in depth and meticulous exchanges on trade issues and structural issues of common concern which enhanced mutual understanding and laid the foundation for resolving mutual concerns ustr s statement was more neutral and just described what were being discussed nevertheless the us team raised the need for any agreement to provide for complete implementation subject to ongoing verification and effective enforcement this is a legitimate concern based on china s history of failing promising china vice premier liu he is planning a visit to washington later this month and we ll see if liu would bring something promising the chinese yuan staged a remarkable come back last week and that s the most concrete indication of positive development in trade negotiations current development suggests medium topping at 6 9804 in usd cnh offshore yuan on bearish divergence condition in daily macd 7 handle was also safely defended there for now usd cnh should drop to 38 2 retracement of 6 2359 to 6 9804 at 6 6959 firm break there will pave the way to 6 5202 sterling lifted as chance of no brexit rises uk will definitely be the center of focus ahead as the meaningful vote of prime minister theresa may s brexit deal looms while may might still be spending her last effort to secure approval of the commons it s just remotely likely for it to happen as the deal is voted down the government should have a plan b ready within days may s office was quite to deny reports regarding article 50 extension but no matter what route the plan b paves it s unlikely to match the march 29 deadline and brexit would be delayed there are basically three options just leave without a deal general election or a second referendum there should be enough opposition to no deal brexit in the parliament and there is no sign of campaigning for no deal seen so this route is rather unlikely labour leader jeremy corbyn is pushing for a general election but we can t see how a change in leadership would prompt eu to re open negotiation though it s still possible pro eu groups are pushing for second referendum in the roadmap to a people s vote the group is pushing for a binary referendum either the government s deal vs staying in the eu or an alternative deliverable form of brexit vs staying in but they do not entirely rule out a referendum with three options including no deal brexit there are a lot of uncertainties ahead and chance of no brexit at all is rising that together with the inevitable delay in brexit has pushed up the pound last week for now we re seeing a second referendum as the most likely outcome but the result could be highly dependent on how it s structured if it s a binary referendum more britons may opt for respecting the result of the 2016 referendum and choose may s deal however if there are three options votes maybe piled towards no brexit just for the sake of avoiding a hard brexit it s not quite predictable for now position trading strategy our strategy to buy usd chf on break of 0 9965 last week was not filled eur chf did stage a strong rebound as anticipated and swiss franc was the third weakest over the week however dollar was even weaker after fed officials comments usd chf thus went the other direction the development now suggests usd chf s choppy fall from 1 0128 is a correction of larger degree that is prospect of further decline to 0 9541 support before bottoming we ll cancel the order first on new strategy sterling long is rather tempting but we d prefer to continue to avoid it due to brexit uncertainties stocks and yen crosses seemed to be losing momentum towards the end of the week but there is no clear indication of topping yet similar wti crude oil also looks like it s topping ahead of 54 61 resistance but there is no confirmation dollar s decline looks set to extend but it s seen as in a correction that could end any time in particular fortune of dollar and yen could have a turn should stocks and oil top soon overall we don t see any compelling trading opportunity for now we ll stand aside first and wait and see patiently gbp usd weekly outlook gbp usd s rebound from 1 2391 extended to as high as 1 2865 last week and broke a 2814 resistance the development now suggests that such rebound is correcting whole down trend from 1 4376 initial bias remains on the upside this week for 1 3174 resistance which is close to 38 2 retracement of 1 4376 to 1 2391 at 1 3149 we d expect strong resistance from there to limit upside at least on first attempt on the downside break of 1 2709 minor support will argue that such rebound is completed and turn bias back to the downside for retesting 1 2391 low in the bigger picture whole medium term rebound from 1 1946 2016 low should have completed at 1 4376 already after rejection from 55 month ema the structure and momentum of the fall from 1 4376 argues that it s resuming long term down trend from 2 1161 2007 high and this will now remain the preferred case as long as 1 3174 structural resistance holds gbp usd should target a test on 1 1946 first decisive break there will confirm our bearish view however sustained break of 1 3174 will invalidate this case and turn outlook bullish in the longer term picture outlook in gbp usd remains bearish rebound from 1 1946 was rejected solidly by falling 55 month ema the pair was limited well below 38 2 retracement of 2 1161 2007 high to 1 1946 as well as the decade long falling trend line on break of 1 1946 next target will be 61 8 projection of 1 7190 to 1 1946 from 1 4376 at 1 1135
news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by failure by government to address the unrelenting currency crisis has come back to haunt the country as evidenced by widespread unrest triggered by the rising cost of living finance minister mthuli ncube s maiden budget statement presented under the theme austerity for prosperity in november last year introduced a number of cost saving measures such as the slashing of salaries of senior government officials by 5 the retirement of more than 2 000 youth officers and the reduction of foreign embassies he was however silent on measures to address currency volatility which has wreaked havoc on the economy ncube indicated that he left currency reforms untouched because he wanted to first fix macro economic fundamentals and critical issues like the budget and current account deficits money supply and inflation through austerity measures and fiscal consolidation before tackling the currency crisis we only need to do currency reforms when economic fundamentals are strong this means the budget deficit should be under control current account deficit is under control inflation is under control and so forth ncube said so this is the roadmap however ncube s remarks in the budget that the united states dollar remains at 1 1 to real time gross settlements rtgs and bond notes despite announcing measures that are contrary to that notion have had devastating repercussions for not only business but also for the economy at large the failure to address the currency crisis which worsened after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz announced the separation of rtgs and forex accounts on october 1 last year has resulted in the depreciation of the value of the local currency as well as the shortage and skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities it has also seriously eroded the salaries of the majority of zimbabweans who are paid in rtgs and bond notes this also resulted in a crippling 40 day strike by doctors which ended yesterday the doctors had listed payment in us dollars as one of their demands to go back to work which the government baulked at the strike which threw the health sector into turmoil and endangered the lives of thousands of patients forced president emmerson mnangagwa to abort his annual leave after acting president constantino chiwenga failed to resolve the impasse government held a meeting with its restive workforce this week in a desperate bid to avert a strike over salaries government revealed that it had an offer ready for civil servants that will be tabled at the national joint negotiating council teachers like doctors also want to be paid in the greenback or at least 3 000 in the surrogate bond currency the failure by government to address the currency crisis has put it in fire fighting mode this is evidenced by the panic created by the decision by beverage giant delta corporation to price its products in foreign currency in order to sustain our operations the company advises the retail and wholesale customers that its products will be charged in hard currency with effect from friday january 4 2019 part of the circular by delta management read the new fiscal and monetary policy framework in place since october 2018 does not provide for easy access to foreign currency by non exporters the company has only received limited foreign currency allocations from banking channels which have not been adequate to fund the import requirements this resulted in government hastily arranging a meeting with delta management the beverage manufacturer rescinded its decision to sell in forex after receiving assurances from the central bank that the listed company will receive adequate foreign currency allocations for its operations government s efforts to address the current economic decline will remain futile as long as it does not address the issue of currency reforms according to business consultant simon kayereka the government can skip around issues but what is needed are currency reforms kayereka said without currency reforms 2019 is going to be a very tough year kayereka s fears that the year will be difficult are not without foundation as evidenced by the continued shortage of fuel which has resulted in long winding queues at service stations countrywide as a result of government s inability to address the currency conundrum motorists are spending several hours queueing for either diesel or petrol an increasing number of fuel stations are now selling fuel in the greenback with others rejecting payment in rtgs and swipe this has resulted in the hike in public transport fares in some cases threefold further whittling the disposable income of the commuting public the currency crisis has resulted in drugs being sold in foreign currency at pharmacies or in the rtgs bond equivalent a pricing structure which has made life saving drugs unaffordable to the majority of zimbabweans the fiction that the local currency is equal to the unites states dollar has also rendered useless medical aid cards as the prices of medicines have rocketed beyond the reach of medical aid societies government has failed to instill confidence through its continued failure to address the currency crisis according to economist john robertson the confidence needed to make the forex stay in the country or to bring it in the country has not been created by government robertson noted it is hard to predict what happens next he said 2019 will be a difficult year with no solution to the currency crisis giving rise to a rising tide of anger by the generality of the population

big silver move foreshadowed as industrial panic looms welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up we ll hear one of the more important interviews we ve ever done on the broken nature of the precious metals futures exchanges and what might be the driving force that ultimately destroys the confidence in these markets paving the way to true price discovery mining analyst and precious metals expert david jensen joins me to talk about how palladium might just be the straw that breaks the back of the paper market don t miss this must hear interview coming up after this week s market update as the government shutdown persists and a declaration of national emergency by president donald trump looms financial markets are unfazed the dow jones industrials have swung approximately 500 points higher so far this week however the u s dollar index did hit a 3 month low on wednesday that helped boost oil prices in a big way crude climbed 10 to 53 a barrel the price action in precious metal markets is more subdued gold shows a modest gain of 0 4 this week to bring spot prices to 1 291 per ounce the yellow metal flirted with the 1 300 level last friday more backing and filling may be needed before the market is ready to push through that resistance turning to silver the white metal currently trades at 15 68 per ounce down 0 4 on the week platinum is off 1 0 to come in at 820 and finally palladium is registering a slight weekly gain of 1 5 to trade at a lofty 1 328 an ounce as of this friday morning recording metals markets don t appear to be getting much of a boost due to investor fears over the government shutdown so far the standoff between trump and democrat leaders has been perceived by investors as more of a sideshow than a genuine threat to the economy but the longer the shutdown drags on without a resolution the more restless those furloughed government employees will become about the delays they face in being paid people who are dependent on government programs such as food stamps may also start getting nervous the government says funding could run out for some welfare programs after next month if congress and the white house fail to come to terms on a deal to reopen the federal bureaucracy it s unlikely the government will actually stop paying out benefits as a result of the present political stalemate but the risk of a default on government promises will grow in the years to come as the government s financial condition steadily worsens a deeply divided and polarized political system that cannot find the will or the way to compromise on a modest allocation to border fencing cannot be expected to get a handle on the rapidly growing 22 trillion national debt the masses have been placated in recent years by a strong stock market relatively tame inflation and a seemingly strong economy but the good times won t last forever they may even now be behind us the federal reserve is concerned enough about a potential bear market in stocks and slowdown in the economy that is likely to end its rate hiking campaign elsewhere in the world the natives are growing restless france is now on the brink of revolution its yellow vest protestors refuse to back down until unpopular french leader emmanuel macron steps down from power yellow vest leaders are now calling for organized bank runs here s a brief rundown of the situation from an independent geopolitical analyst known on the internet as black pigeon speaks black pigeon speaks the fortunes of president emmanuel macron have gone from dim to bleak we are now more than eight weeks into what could be called an anti government rebellion by what have been dubbed the yellow vest movement reports are now emerging that the yellow vest movement has the banks squarely in their sights and in what is perhaps the first ever planned and voluntary bank run the idea was first floated on social media as a legal and nonviolent way to rebel against the state the post in part read we all know that the powers of the country are not in the hands of the government but in those of the banks if the banks weaken the state weakens immediately the fractional reserve banking system is inherently vulnerable to an abnormally large scale of withdrawals at any given time banks are only able to pay out a fraction of what customers hold in their accounts as deposits in effect account balances represent nothing more than unsecured claims on banks that are technically insolvent in a financial crisis the banking system could become functionally insolvent meaning customers would be unable to withdraw funds they might even find themselves in the position of having to bail in failing banks by taking losses on their accounts this happened a few years ago during the financial panic that hit cyprus cypriot account holders learned a tough lesson in counterparty risk investors can mitigate that risk by holding assets outside of the banking system and not depending on promises from bankers brokers or politicians assets that entail zero counterparty risk include physical gold and silver bullion products that you can hold in your hand and own free and clear coming up now our discussion on another type of fractional reserve system that being the metals futures markets yes it s looking like the futures markets are losing some control over the pricing of the metals so let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in david jensen of jensen strategic a highly studied mining analyst in precious metals expert with close to two decades of experience in the mining industry and it s great to have him on david thanks so much for the time today and nice to finally talk to you david jensen my pleasure mike it s good to touch base with you mike gleason well david you ve been closely following the palladium market and that s where i wanted to focus much of our conversation today because that s obviously where most of the fireworks are happening in the metals these days now for the most part over the last few years gold and silver prices have been bouncing around and have been basically in trading ranges but palladium has been a different story however the metal has been climbing steadily for most of the past three years things got off to a rough start in 2018 but since the middle of august prices have rallied more than 30 and we re back to all time highs you have been watching the palladium market closely and you have some important insights so let s get started by talking a little bit about palladium supply you have some background in mining and metals can you first talk briefly about where palladium is produced and why supply could become a serious issue david jensen yeah sure the world palladium market globally is about in round numbers about ten million ounces a year and of that about eight and half million ounces comes from mine supply and recycling and then if you drill it down a little bit more it s about six and a half million that comes directly from mine supply versus the ten million ounce total consumption and of that six and a half million ounces about 40 comes from russia and about another 40 comes from south africa and then the other nations canada the united states and other places fill out the last 20 so it s a very concentrated supply from two primary sources mike gleason the market for palladium is relatively tiny compared to gold and silver as you just laid out but what s happening there could have major implications for precious metals markets generally the bullion banks have a bad habit of selling vast amounts of paper metal that will essentially create fresh new contracts for any buyer who shows up wanting one sopping almost any amount of demand without prices being forced higher as many would expect they never seem to get called on it but the bullion markets are essentially fractional reserve and the fraction of physical metal backing all of this paper seems to just keep diminishing however the palladium market may represent a serious problem for the bullion banks if you would explain what a palladium lease is what sorts of people or institutions lease metal and why david jensen okay well the leasing of metal is typically a stop gap measure to secure physical metal if you can t get it from a refinery or from a mining supply source so it s usually a stop gap measure and we ve seen that leasing cost and by the way the leasing rate is a percentage and has to be paid with metal not with fiat money or paper money at the end of the lease and because you have to store and insure precious metals typically when the market is flush you see a negative rate so that the holders of the metal are actually paying you to take the metal off their hands and what we ve seen now is over the last oh about 18 months is that the palladium has gone from a negative lease rate it spiked a couple of weeks ago to about 30 for a one month lease and it s around 21 today so what that signals to us it signals that you can t get adequate physical metal in the market right now and that there s a dearth of supply now that shortage has not been quick to arise the ceo of johnson matthey which is one of the world s largest refiners of platinum group metals he warned the market in 2017 he said that there had been a decade of ingrained or structural deficit where they had burnt down the above ground inventories through a supply deficit and he said that the stockpiles are not all gone now but if we continue along this path that they certainly will be and sure enough now we see these very very large lease rates signaling that there s a real problem with supply and the shortage mike it can t be addressed very quickly it takes a decade from expiration through development into production for a mine typically what we ve had is several decades of pricing metal in london which is the primary pricing market for precious metals for the miners they have been using these unallocated contracts which is really trading promissory notes between the bullion banks to set the price on a daily level so what happens is you don t have to have the metal to trade it and the trading has been dominated by these bullion banks who have been able to really just set the price where they wish but the problem is that they ve set the price too low which happens and this is really a form of central planning when these interventions take place and what you have then is you have a systematic over consumption and under production of the metal when the price is set too low so where we re at right now it s a situation which has developed over decades there s no quick solution and palladium with the smallest above ground inventories is the first to signal a problem but really we can see a very quick change in the market for platinum silver and gold as well because of the similar let s call it leveraged positions or leveraged trading which goes on in the market that you have unallocated contracts with no metal behind them and the holders of these contracts many of them are commercial users for silver and platinum as well especially and with palladium 80 of the consumption is for catalytic converters in automobiles you can t use the contracts in these catalytic converters so those who need the metal are saying we want metal give us metal now and that really takes away or binds the hands of these bullion banks who have been really trading just the paper promissory notes so i m expecting a contagion to happen into silver and into platinum initially and ultimately into gold gold has the largest above ground inventories relative to annual demand but it s still very tightly held mike gleason if you don t mind tell our listeners what the term backwardation means in the metals markets david jensen yeah backwardation structure is where the spot market has a higher price than the forward or the future price the opposite of that is called contango where the future price is a higher price and it reflects the cost if you buy a contract in the futures market it reflects partially the cost of storage and insuring the material for that period of time and when you have a backwardation structure what that means is that the demand is so high in the spot market for immediate delivery that it overwhelms those forward held costs and it really signals that there s so little metal in the market that those who have the metal are not able to meet the need with a guaranteed profit in fiat dollars if you sell spot and buy a future contract you re notionally guaranteed to get the metal back or have a high likelihood of getting the metal back and you should be able to net a very handy profit in a very short period of time so when you see these sustained backwardations as you re seeing in palladium it s really a further signal of the problem in the market that even offering a guaranteed profit that you can t source enough metal to drive that metal price structure back into the normal contango where the future price is higher than the spot or immediate delivery market mike gleason if we see defaults on delivery in palladium what do you think the ramifications will be for gold and silver will all of these apathetic traders make the connection between what s happening there and what could happen in gold and silver and will regulators wake up and take action how would you guess this will play out david jensen well i think mike the potential is there for a knock on or a contagion effect into the markets the lbma and i m still very skeptical of the lbma given that it was created by the bank of england in 1987 and that ever since for multiple decades during that period we ve seen from the work of dmitri speck that the price has been drilled down at the fixes that occur each day the a m and the p m fix so i mean in london they claim that there s about 1 7 billion ounces of silver positions in the various contract forms and the industrial users of silver also just like the catalytic converter manufacturers who buy physical palladium can t use these unallocated contracts in their industrial processes they actually need physical metal so what i see happening here is that palladium is drawing attention in the market to the problem really the mal structuring in the market after decades of price suppression using unallocated contracts and i see the potential here with that large number of positions in the silver market especially we don t know what it is in platinum they don t release the numbers but i certainly see the potential here for silver and have an outsized move as those who need the metal say we would like to have delivery now to ensure the supply given that we can see in the palladium market the signal of the problem of these unallocated contracts and leverage in silver gold and platinum is there as well you only need a small percentage of the holders to really cause an outsized move in the market mike gleason yeah as people need to remember palladium and silver as well there s a huge amount of industrial users for these metals that s really what those metals are for primarily especially palladium and as we saw i think it was back in 2000 where the automotive manufacturers were worried about getting that physical supply out of russia and they started hoarding the metal and the price of palladium spiked as a result you think that sort of thing could happen if some of these industrial users start to worry about what s going to happen if i can t get the physical metal for raw material then i can t make my products they re not going to be putting themselves in that position they re going to get that metal at whatever cost it takes right david jensen yeah it s usually a relatively small percentage of the cost of manufactured goods is represented by these precious metals and i think that as prudent supply chain managers look at these situations and say you know we re seeing problems with unallocated contracts the signal has been sent and we do not want to be in a position where we are unable to ship goods because of a cost component with representing a small percentage of the actual finished price where we can t secure these small elements and are thus bound i mean cell phone manufacturers come to mind and others solar panels and electronics and so i really see this starting to spread the awareness spreading in the market to the point where you get away from just in time delivery and holding of relatively large spot contracts and it gets reflected into more of a secure holding of several months of supply to ensure that you ve got continuity of material flows because of the leverage in the market as i alluded to earlier i really see that that can have an outside impact where you ve got many more claims in the market than you actually have metal so you need a small number of these claim holders to convert to physical metal to start to see a disorderly market or a disrupted market take effect mike gleason yeah shortages beget more shortages as they always say and it could be just a frenzy as people try to get their hands on it now we talked about broken markets here when it comes to these futures exchanges getting back to say a dozen years ago we had obviously the financial crisis of 2008 2009 and you sounded the alarm before all that began talk about that and then i want to kind of relate it to today and maybe get your thoughts on how maybe what we re seeing right now with a lot of uncertainty a lot of gyrations and volatility in the stock markets and how that could potentially set up for maybe the next financial collapse give us a little bit of your insights on that if you would david jensen sure in 2007 i reconnected with the governor of the bank of canada david dodge who had been a former lecturer at my university when i was doing my mba in 1998 and 99 and i had talked to him he had just given a speech here at the vancouver board of trade in vancouver and said that the disruptions that we saw in the asset backed commercial paper market was just a signal of an adjustment of risks and that things would be fine i had a totally different view i viewed the systematic suppression of precious metals and it might sound like an obscure concept to listeners but when you look at the fact that in 1980 they had to raise interest rates to 9 above the inflation rate to get people out of gold which had run from 45 in 1970 to 850 in 1980 they had to raise interest rates to 9 above the inflation rate which was running 10 so 19 at that time thereafter the central bank the bank of england created the lbma trading paper substitute for gold and i mentioned this to him afterwards and he said i don t have time to get into this in great detail but here s my card and please forward me the information so i sent him two letters that are now posted on safehaven com you can look at my letters to david dodge but the view was that we had entered into this market where we had basically shut off the warning system for inflationary monetary policy which is gold it warns people when they re printing too much money as we saw in 1980 and that we had really blown a succession of bubbles in the financial markets which would come unwound and what we ve seen since that crash ten years ago the great financial crisis as they call it has been more leveraged more than 70 trillion of more debt around the world and they solved what was a debt problem caused by the suppression of precious metals and the printing of money to more printing of money it really goes unabated now and i don t see a good end to this mike the fed is really choking off liquidity in the markets and we re heading to another crisis now and i think that this next crisis there s going to be really a hamstrung ability of the central banks to lower interest rates further and to run the zero interest rate policies when the markets see that kind of behavior i think it s going to spike a panic in the market or fear that they ve tried to solve a debt problem with more debt and here they go again and it s very visible this time i think to people that the green shoots as ben bernanke was really deceptively telling people about are nonexistent and that you can t solve a debt problem with a debt problem and i think at that point we re going to have a serious problem we re going to have to write down the debt and restructure i think our monetary system as well which really points its finger back at gold and silver which are historical monetary instruments with a four thousand year history as money mike gleason well finally david as we begin to wrap up what kind of year do you envision it will be for metals in 2019 might it finally be one where we see them truly act as a safe haven asset class that sees the masses flock toward it to protect themselves or is that day still a ways off basically how do you see 2019 shaping up for metals investors and metals prices david jensen well i think if you take a long view and look at metals they ve risen from 250 u s dollars an ounce gold in the year 2000 to the 1 300 level now and i know that is lower than the 1 900 dollars we saw seven years ago but i do think that they have performed somewhat even though the performance has been muted even with the trading of these unallocated contracts but i do see a year ahead of us here due to the leverage in the markets due to the really chronic underproduction over consumption of the precious metals due to the mal pricing by the bullion banks we re now at the point now where it s very difficult to hide these problems mike so i really see this year here as being a hinge point an inflection point for these markets and i think that we re going to see the physical market start to really assert itself i think we re already seeing it in palladium there are indications now that platinum the lease rate is starting to creep up and the knock on i think to silver is going to accelerate the process so i do think that we re in a position now where really i don t see these as investments i see them as insurance policies and i see them as monetary instruments and i think that really the deception of central banking and the concept that you can create wealth by creating more debt that you can create real organic wealth by printing money and creating debt is going to be shown the fallacy that it is so i feel very strongly about the physical metals having a positive turn here and i think it s really rooted or anchored in what we re seeing in the palladium market and that the limits are clearly being reached in this market we ve had more than 18 months now of increasingly high lease rates on the metal and i don t think this is a problem that s going to go away i think we re going to see an accelerated demand for palladium now as people realize the problems and then ultimately it ll terminate the paper pricing system that we have in london and new york mike gleason very well put and that s exactly why we wanted to have you on here today and talk more about this palladium story because it might seem like a little obscure metal to a lot of folks but it can have some major implications on these other markets the bigger markets gold and silver namely and i t was great to discuss that with you i hope we can talk to you again as this all unfolds i really enjoyed it all the best to you in 2019 thanks

purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they also are an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it s scored positively if it s within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it s not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the yoy change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it is less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there s an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it s scored neutral if it s moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports the december ism non manufacturing report declined but was still very positive december consumer prices entered deflation

ultimately making new expansion highs during summer they declined through neutral to negative then rose into positive before turning negative again in the last month applications have risen to positive yoy which is enough to bring this indicator back up to neutral if it goes above 3 year over year on a four week basis it will be a positive with the re benchmarking of the last year the

but returned to a positive since then for several months very positive although in the last month it has backed off if the yoy comparison falls below 1 5 considering the comparison was over 4 recently

tax cut down 7 6 b or down 3 1 with the exception of the month of august and late november this was positive for almost all of 2017 it has generally been negative since the effects of the recent tax cuts started in february i have discontinued the intra month metric for the remainder of this year since the kludge to guesstimate the impact of the recent tax cuts makes it too noisy to be of real use i have been adjusting based on treasury department estimates of a decline of roughly 4 billion over a 20 day period until we have yoy comparisons we have to take this measure with a big grain of salt oil prices and usage from the e i a oil unchanged at 48 27 w w down 21 8 yoy gas prices down 03 to 2 24 w w down 0 28 yoy usage four week average down 1 1 yoy the price of gas bottomed almost three years ago at 1 69 generally prices went sideways with a slight increasing trend in 2017 in the last two months however prices have plummeted this is a negative for the oil patch but a positive for consumers so the rating changes from neutral to positive usage turned negative in the first half of 2017 then turned positive but turned negative again in the last two months bank lending rates 0 442 ted spread up 0 002 w w 2 514 libor up 0 001 w w both ted and libor rose in 2016 to the point where both were usually negatives with lots of fluctuation of importance is that ted was above 0 50 before both the 2001 and 2008 recessions the ted spread was generally increasingly positive in 2017 while libor was increasingly negative earlier this year the ted spread has whipsawed between being positive or negative but more recently was very positive it has risen again recently but is still positive coincident indicators consumer spending johnson redbook up 8 9 yoy retail economist up 0 1 w w up 2 6 yoy both the retail economist and johnson redbook indexes generally improved from weak to moderate or strong positives during 2017 and have remained positive this year a few months ago both

shipping transport harpex down 7 to 478 440 678 baltic dry index down 82 to 1189 700 1775 rail was generally positive since november 2016 and remained so during all of 2017 with the exception of a period during autumn when it was mixed after some weakness in january and february this year rail had been positive ever since until about three months ago it weakened precipitously probably due to tariffs until the last three weeks harpex made multi year lows in early 2017 and after oscillating improved to new multi year highs earlier this year but has now fallen enough to rate negative bdi traced a similar trajectory and made three year highs near the end of 2017 and at mid year hit multi year highs but has since declined all the way to negative now i m wary of reading too much into price indexes like this since they are heavily influenced by supply as in a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade as well as demand steel production from the american iron and steel institute down 1 2 w w up 10 1 yoy steel production improved from negative to less bad to positive in 2016 and with the exception of early summer remained generally positive in 2017 it turned negative in january and early february but with the exception of three weeks recently has been positive since then summary and conclusion among the long leading indexes real m1 and m2 the chicago fed adjusted financial conditions index and the leverage subindex are positives real estate loans also turned positive this week the yield curve purchase mortgage applications and mortgage rates are neutral treasuries corporate bonds and refinance applications are negative among the short leading indicators the regional fed new orders indexes the chicago national conditions index jobless claims staffing and oil and gas prices are all positive note that i am weighting the benefit to consumers more than the distress to the oil patch for the first time both measures of the us dollar along with both commodities indexes and the spread between corporate and treasury bonds gas usage and stock prices are negative among the coincident indicators consumer spending steel rail and the ted spread are positive the bdi is neutral tax withholding libor and harpex are negatives while the nowcast remains positive there are changes in both the long and short leading forecasts the bad news is that the short term forecast roughly through summer moved from neutral to negative this week the good news is that the long term forecast for the first time in many months moved back to slightly positive

the people s bank of china lowers the reserve requirement ratio for most banks by 1 percentage point on october 15 vcg on october 15 the reserve requirement ratio rrr for most banks in china went down by 1 percentage point the fourth such cut in 2018 the people s bank of china pbc the country s central bank announced the decision on october 7 saying the measure is mainly aimed at optimizing the structure of liquidity in commercial banks and the financial market so that the financial sector can better serve the real economy some of the liquidity unleashed by the reduction was used to pay back 450 billion yuan 65 22 billion of medium term lending facility mlf due on october 15 in addition the rrr cut also released another 750 billion yuan 108 7 billion of incremental capital according to pbc statistics the cut applied to the renminbi deposits of large commercial banks joint stock commercial banks city commercial banks non county rural commercial banks as well as foreign funded banks serving real economy better as more credit is granted financial institutions demand for medium and long term liquidity is also increasing moderately cutting the reserve requirement the amount of deposits that a bank must keep on hand at all times has stabilized funds within the banking system besides improving the liquidity structure in commercial banks and the financial market it will also allow financial institutions to access long term funds steadily and subsequently reduce corporations financing costs the 750 billion yuan incremental capital to be freed will enable financial institutions to better support small and micro sized enterprises private companies and innovation driven firms all this will enhance the innovative vigor and resilience of the economy and boost sound development of the real economy said a pbc statement on the rrr cut this time of rrr reduction conforms to the changes in the chinese economy lian ping chief economist of bank of communications one of china s largest commercial banks said in an interview with china national radio according to him china s prudent monetary policy remains neutral and the adjustments target specific circumstances in the banking system growth of debts has been slow for some time and compared with the increase of loans that of deposits has been slower the market demand for liquidity has been growing steadily considering the debt changes in the banking system and the fact that the rrr is still at a comparatively high level making appropriate adjustments is a targeted policy that can help commercial banks better support small and micro sized businesses private companies and innovation driven firms this was the second time that the central bank cut rrr to replace mlf operation this year this will expand the maturity structure of funds ultimately helping improve financing conditions of corporations said lu zhengwei chief economist of industrial bank in an interview with china national radio lu said previously both open market operations and mlf matured within one year but this rrr cut unleashed long term capitals which would make the maturity of assets and debts in commercial banks better matched this would encourage commercial banks to grant more loans and buy more medium and long term corporate bonds which would improve the financing conditions of private enterprises he added monetary policy unchanged according to the pbc statement the rrr cut is still a measure of targeted control with liquidity in the banking system as well as money supply staying stable and the orientation of monetary policy remaining unchanged some of the liquidity released by the rrr cut was used to pay back mlf which is a kind of replacement of two liquidity tools therefore while the liquidity structure is optimized the total amount of liquidity in the banking system remains unchanged the pbc will continue the prudent and neutral monetary policy refrain from using a deluge of stimulus and focus on targeted control in order to maintain sound and sufficient liquidity according to the statement the policy is also intended to promote reasonable growth of monetary credit and the total financing amount in addition it will create a suitable monetary and financial environment for quality development and supply side structural reform will the rrr reduction intensify the depreciation pressure on the renminbi the pbc said as the interest rate remains stable and the growth of broad money and total financing amount is suited to the nominal gdp growth the rrr reduction will not impose depreciation pressure on the renminbi instead it will facilitate economic restructuring boost high quality development and make economic conditions better support the renminbi exchange rate as a large developing economy china is very competitive in exports and its economic growth mainly relies on domestic demand with complete categories of manufacturing industries and a well developed industrial system the statement added there are sufficient conditions for the renminbi exchange rate to remain basically stable the pbc will continue to take necessary measures to stabilize market expectations and keep the foreign exchange market running smoothly it said however zhang ming a researcher with the chinese academy of social sciences and chief economist of ping an securities told economic information daily that given the backdrop of several interest rate hikes by the u s federal reserve the rrr cut will help narrow the interest rate spread between china and the united states bringing depreciation pressure to the renminbi against the u s dollar zhang added that the pbc statement shows the central bank is putting domestic targets before foreign related targets and is willing and able to keep the renminbi exchange rate at a certain level new counter cyclical factors have enabled the central bank to better influence the yuan s standard price zhang said adding with enhanced administration of cross border capital flows the pbc still has the ability to intervene in foreign exchange reserves and the offshore renminbi market copyedited by sudeshna sarkar
do you remember the winter of debt in late 2010 and early 2011 the u s economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed long term unemployment was especially severe with more than 6 million americans having been out of work for six months or more you might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion but no washington was obsessed with debt the simpson bowles report was the talk of the town paul ryan s impassioned and of course hypocritical denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards and between the capital s debt obsession the republican takeover of the house and a hard right turn in state governments america was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment some of us protested bitterly against this policy turn arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity in fact it is becoming increasingly doubtful whether there is any right time for fiscal austerity the obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment that is the message i take from olivier blanchard s presidential address to the american economic association to be fair blanchard one of the world s leading macroeconomists formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the international monetary fund was cautious in his pronouncements and certainly did not say that debt never matters but his analysis nonetheless makes the fix the debt fixation yes they are still out there look even worse than before

mthuli ncube mess up again as prematurely says zim to re introduce zim dollar in less than 12 months spread the love finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube yesterday said the country will have its own currency within the next 12 months as government is frantically working on raising enough foreign currency to anchor it addressing delegates at a road to davos townhall meeting held in the capital yesterday prof ncube said adopting the united states dollar or the south african rand would not solve the country s macro economic problems on the issue of raising enough foreign currency to introduce the new currency we are on our way already give us months not years he said asked to give a timeline on when currency reforms would be implemented prof ncube said it would be done in less than 12 months he said separating the parity between the real time gross settlement accounts rtgs and foreign currency accounts fca was the beginning of currency reforms which are necessary for pushing the country s economy in the right direction there is a balance between preservation of value and removing price distortions said prof ncube the separation of accounts between the fca and rtgs accounts was the beginning of currency reform prof ncube said he was no longer in favour of adopting the rand as that would still depend on the availability of us dollars i also hear that the citizens are pushing towards adopting the rand i even argued for it years ago and there was a reason you know if we are going to assume the rand as our currency we first of all have to acquire the rand and we need us dollars first to purchase the rand in the long term zimbabwe needs its own currency he said our job is to introduce a currency that will be stable and less volatile dealing with the fiscal side is the first order to move towards a stable currency after all what we have now is fiscal policy and now monetary policy and we have to tighten the belt on the currency volatility adopting the united states dollar as the country s sole legal tender is not the way to solve zimbabwe s macro economic challenges said prof ncube this comes as different companies and individuals have been pushing for the re dollarisation of the country s economy with claims that the shortage of hard currency is choking business operations recently beverages giant delta corporation announced that it would start selling its products in hard currency citing that operations were being adversely affected by foreign currency shortages the decision was later reversed after consultations with government instead prof ncube said zimbabwe s solution lay in currency reforms the issue is shortage of forex with the corporates the silver bullet is about currency reform if we get that right the corporates can access foreign currency whenever they need it the currency reform agenda is also impeding foreign investment if investors cannot take their money out of the country then we cannot attract investors he said a long term solution to the crisis is currency reforms currency reforms and currency reforms and ending arbitrage opportunities in the market accepting the us dollar as the only legal tender is not currency reform its submission as a nation if we accept us dollar as our sole currency then it means that we are afraid of currency reform and that s capitulation this also comes at a time when industry has also raised a red flag towards re dollarisation confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe is on record saying re dollarising the economy is counter productive as it stifles growth and could halve the size of the economy we see more companies wanting to sell in us dollars but the issue is that we don t need dollarisation as an economy said mr jabangwe the economy will shrink by as much as 50 percent if we dollarise so for me it is not the right way to go we have seen it with us dollars in the past that we won t be competitive when using the us dollar an economist with a local commercial bank joseph mverecha has on countless times weighed in disapproving the re dollarisation of the zimbabwean economy re dollarisation will sustain disintermediation and dislocation in the economy to the extent that foreign exchange access is non existent for the vast majority of zimbabweans who are non exporters and constitute the largest segment of the population said dr mverecha chronicle share this post like this like loading

some years ago i faced up to the futility of reporting true things about america s disastrous wars and so i left afghanistan for another remote mountainous country far away it was the polar opposite of afghanistan a peaceful prosperous land where nearly everybody seemed to enjoy a good life on the job and in the family it s true that they didn t work much not by american standards anyway in the u s full time salaried workers supposedly laboring 40 hours a week actually average 49 with almost 20 clocking more than 60 these people on the other hand workedonly about 37 hours a week when they weren t away on long paid vacations at the end of the work day about four in the afternoon perhaps three in the summer they had time to enjoy a hike in the forest or a swim with the kids or a beer with friends which helps explain why unlike so many americans they are pleased with their jobs often i was invited to go along i found it refreshing to hike and ski in a country with no land mines and to hang out in cafã s unlikely to be bombed gradually i lost my warzone jitters and settled into the slow calm pleasantly uneventful stream of life there four years on thinking i should settle down i returned to the united states it felt quite a lot like stepping back into that other violent impoverished world where anxiety runs high and people are quarrelsome i had in fact come back to the flip side of afghanistan and iraq to what america s wars have done to america where i live now in the homeland there are not enough shelters for the homeless most people are either overworked or hurting for jobs housing is overpriced hospitals crowded and understaffed schools largely segregated and not so good opioid or heroin overdose is a popular form of death and men in the street threaten women wearing hijab did the american soldiers i covered in afghanistan know they were fighting for this ducking the subject one night i tuned in to the democrats presidential debate to see if they had any plans to restore the america i used to know to my amazement i heard the name of my peaceful mountain hideaway norway bernie sanders was denouncing america s crooked version of casino capitalism that floats the already rich ever higher and flushes the working class he said that we ought to look to countries like denmark like sweden and norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people he believes he added in a society where all people do well not just a handful of billionaires that certainly sounds like norway for ages they ve worked at producing things for the use of everyone not the profit of a few so i was all ears waiting for sanders to spell it out for americans but hillary clinton quickly countered we are not denmark smiling she said i love denmark and then delivered a patriotic punch line we are the united states of america well there s no denying that she praised capitalism and all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families she didn t seem to know that danes swedes and norwegians do that too and with much higher rates of success the truth is that almost a quarter of american startups are not founded on brilliant new ideas but on the desperation of men or women who can t get a decent job the majority of all american enterprises are solo ventures having zero payrolls employing no one but the entrepreneur and often quickly wasting away sanders said that he was all for small business too but that meant nothing if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent as george carlin said the reason they call it the american dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it in that debate no more was heard of denmark sweden or norway the audience was left in the dark later in a speech at georgetown university sanders tried to clarify his identity as a democratic socialist he said he s not the kind of socialist with a capital s who favors state ownership of anything like the means of production the norwegian government on the other hand owns the means of producing lots of public assets and is the major stockholder in many a vital private enterprise i was dumbfounded norway denmark and sweden practice variations of a system that works much better than ours yet even the democratic presidential candidates who say they love or want to learn from those countries don t seem to know how they actually work why we re not denmark proof that they do work is delivered every year in data rich evaluations by the u n and other international bodies the organization for economic cooperation and development s annual report on international well being for example measures 11 factors ranging from material conditions like affordable housing and employment to quality of life matters like education health life expectancy voter participation and overall citizen satisfaction year after year all the nordic countries cluster at the top while the united states lags far behind in addition norway ranked first on the u n development program s human development index for 12 of the last 15 years and it consistently tops international comparisons of such matters as democracy civil and political rights and freedom of expression and the press what is it though that makes the scandinavians so different since the democrats can t tell you and the republicans wouldn t want you to know let me offer you a quick introduction what scandinavians call the nordic model is a smart and simple system that starts with a deep commitment to equality and democracy that s two concepts combined in a single goal because as far as they are concerned you can t have one without the other right there they part company with capitalist america now the most unequal of all the developed nations and consequently a democracy no more political scientists say it has become an oligarchy a country run at the expense of its citizenry by and for the super rich perhaps you noticed that in the last century scandinavians aiming for their egalitarian goal refused to settle solely for any of the ideologies competing for power not capitalism or fascism not marxist socialism or communism geographically stuck between powerful nations waging hot and cold wars for such doctrines scandinavians set out to find a path in between that path was contested by socialist inspired workers on the one hand and capitalist owners and their elite cronies on the other but it led in the end to a mixed economy thanks largely to the solidarity and savvy of organized labor and the political parties it backed the long struggle produced a system that makes capitalism more or less cooperative and then redistributes equitably the wealth it helps to produce struggles like this took place around the world in the twentieth century but the scandinavians alone managed to combine the best ideas of both camps while chucking out the worst in 1936 the popular u s journalist marquis childs first described the result to americans in the book sweden the middle way since then all the scandinavian countries and their nordic neighbors finland and iceland have been improving upon that hybrid system today in norway negotiations between the confederation of trade unions and the confederation of norwegian enterprise determine the wages and working conditions of most capitalist enterprises public and private that create wealth while high but fair progressive income taxes fund the state s universal welfare system benefitting everyone in addition those confederations work together to minimize the disparity between high wage and lower wage jobs as a result norway ranks with sweden denmark and finland among the most income equal countries in the world and its standard of living tops the charts so here s the big difference in norway capitalism serves the people the government elected by the people sees to that all eight of the parties that won parliamentary seats in the last national election including the conservative hã yreparty now leading the government are committed to maintaining the welfare state in the u s however neoliberal politics put the foxes in charge of the henhouse and capitalists have used the wealth generated by their enterprises as well as financial and political manipulations to capture the state and pluck the chickens they ve done a masterful job of chewing up organized labor today only 11 of american workers belong to a union in norway that number is 52 in denmark 67 in sweden 70 in the u s oligarchs maximize their wealth and keep it using the democratically elected government to shape policies and laws favorable to the interests of their foxy class they bamboozle the people by insisting as hillary clinton did at that debate that all of us have the freedom to create a business in the free marketplace which implies that being hard up is our own fault in the nordic countries on the other hand democratically elected governments give their populations freedom from the market by using capitalism as a tool to benefit everyone that liberates their people from the tyranny of the mighty profit motive that warps so many american lives leaving them freer to follow their own dreams to become poets or philosophers bartenders or business owners as they please family matters maybe our politicians don t want to talk about the nordic model because it shows so clearly that capitalism can be put to work for the many not just the few consider the norwegian welfare state it s universal in other words aid to the sick or the elderly is not charity grudgingly donated by elites to those in need it is the rightof every individual citizen that includes every woman whether or not she is somebody s wife and every child no matter its parentage treating every person as a citizen affirms the individuality of each and the equality of all it frees every person from being legally possessed by another a husband for example or a tyrannical father which brings us to the heart of scandinavian democracy the equality of women and men in the 1970s norwegian feminists marched into politics and picked up the pace of democratic change norway needed a larger labor force and women were the answer housewives moved into paid work on an equal footing with men nearly doubling the tax base that has in fact meant more to norwegian prosperity than the coincidental discovery of north atlantic oil reserves the ministry of finance recently calculated that those additional working mothers add to norway s net national wealth a value equivalent to the country s total petroleum wealth currently held in the world s largest sovereign wealth fund worth more than 873 billion by 1981 women were sitting in parliament in the prime minister s chair and in her cabinet american feminists also marched for such goals in the 1970s but the big boys busy with their own white house intrigues initiated a war on women that set the country back and still rages today in brutal attacks on women s basic civil rights health care and reproductive freedom in 1971 thanks to the hard work of organized feminists congress passed the bipartisancomprehensive child development bill to establish a multi billion dollar national day care system for the children of working parents in 1972 president richard nixon vetoed it and that was that in 1972 congress also passed a bill first proposed in 1923 to amend the constitution to grant equal rights of citizenship to women ratified by only 35 states three short of the required 38 that equal rights amendment or era was declared dead in 1982 leaving american women in legal limbo in 1996 president bill clinton signed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act obliterating six decades of federal social welfare policy as we know it ending federal cash payments to the nation s poor and consigning millions of female heads of household and their children to poverty where many still dwell 20 years later today nearly half a century after nixon trashed national child care even privileged women torn between their underpaid work and their kids are overwhelmed things happened very differently in norway there feminists and sociologists pushed hard against the biggest obstacle still standing in the path to full democracy the nuclear family in the 1950s the world famous american sociologist talcott parsons had pronounced that arrangement with hubby at work and the little wife at home the ideal setup in which to socialize children but in the 1970s the norwegian state began to deconstruct that undemocratic ideal by taking upon itself the traditional unpaid household duties of women caring for the children the elderly the sick and the disabled became the basic responsibilities of the universal welfare state freeing women in the workforce to enjoy both their jobs and their families that s another thing american politicians still boringly mostly odiously boastful men surely don t want you to think about that patriarchy can be demolished and everyone be the better for it paradoxically setting women free made family life more genuine many in norway say it has made both men and women more themselves and more alike more understanding and happier it also helped kids slip from the shadow of helicopter parents in norway mother and father in turn take paid parental leave from work to see a newborn through its first year or more at age one however children start attending a neighborhood barnehage kindergarten for schooling spent largelyoutdoors by the time kids enter free primary school at age six they are remarkably self sufficient confident and good natured they know their way around town and if caught in a snowstorm in the forest how to build a fire and find the makings of a meal one kindergarten teacher explained we teach them early to use an axe so they understand it s a tool not a weapon to americans the notion of a school taking away your child to make her an axe wielder is monstrous in fact norwegian kids who are well acquainted in early childhood with many different adults and children know how to get along with grown ups and look after one another more to the point though it s hard to measure it s likely that scandinavian children spend more quality time with their work isn t everything parents than does a typical middle class american child being driven by a stressed out mother from music lessons to karate practice for all these reasons and more the international organization save the children cites norway as the best country on earth in which to raise kids while the u s finishes far down the list in 33rd place don t take my word for it this little summary just scratches the surface of scandinavia so i urge curious readers to google away but be forewarned you ll find much criticism of all the nordic model countries the structural matters i ve described of governance and family are not the sort of things visible to tourists or visiting journalists so their comments are often obtuse take the american tourist blogger who complained that he hadn t been shown the slums of oslo there are none or the british journalist who wrote that norwegian petrol is too expensive though not for norwegians who are in any case leading the world in switching to electric cars neoliberal pundits especially the brits are always beating up on the scandinavians in books magazines newspapers and blogs predicting the imminent demise of their social democracies and bullying them to forsake the best political economy on the planet self styled experts still in thrall to margaret thatcher tell norwegians they must liberalize their economy and privatize everything short of the royal palace mostly the norwegian government does the opposite or nothing at all and social democracy keeps on ticking it s not perfect of course it has always been a carefully considered work in progress governance by consensus takes time and effort you might think of it as slow democracy but it s light years ahead of us to stay on top of important

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer prices fell for the first time in nine months in december amid a plunge in gasoline prices but underlying inflation pressures remained firm as rental housing and healthcare costs rose steadily overall the report from the labor department on friday painted a picture of inflation that was under control with increases in some categories offset by declines elsewhere this likely supports recent statements by federal reserve officials pledging patience in raising interest rates this year the fed will take this as further proof that price pressures are building more slowly than some have feared based on the strong growth of late and tight labor market said james mccann senior global economist at aberdeen standard investments in boston it certainly seems to justify the fed s message about being more patient on rate increases the consumer price index dipped 0 1 percent last month the first drop and weakest reading since march after being unchanged in november in the 12 months through december the cpi rose 1 9 percent slowing from november s 2 2 percent gain excluding the volatile food and energy components the cpi increased 0 2 percent advancing by the same margin for a third straight month in the 12 months through december the so called core cpi rose 2 2 percent matching november s increase december s inflation readings were in line with economists expectations the cpi rose 1 9 percent in 2018 slowing from a 2 1 percent increase in 2017 but the core cpi jumped 2 2 percent up from 1 8 percent in 2017 the fed which has a 2 percent inflation target tracks a different measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index for monetary policy the core pce price index increased 1 9 percent year on year in november after rising 1 8 percent in october it hit 2 percent in march for the first time since april 2012 the u s central bank has forecast two interest rate hikes this year but several policymakers including chairman jerome powell have said they would be cautious about tightening monetary policy powell reiterated that view on thursday saying especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully while the central bank monitored economic data and financial markets for risks to growth minutes of the u s central bank s dec 18 19 policy meeting published on wednesday showed many officials were of the view that the fed could afford to be patient about further policy firming but with core inflation remaining firm despite a strong dollar and slowing global growth economists say further rate increases this year cannot be ruled out in addition a tighter labor market is boosting wage growth if core inflation holds firm the fed will continue to consider additional rate hikes this year said sam bullard a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina the fed lifted borrowing costs four times in 2018 the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading lower after a five day rally boost to purchasing power low inflation

vote in parliament on tuesday and for sterling moves below 1 25 or above 1 30 are both on the table graphic sterling volatility 2 price pressure the fed reckons the world s biggest economy is continuing to motor ahead but markets seem to think otherwise their fears for the growth outlook knocking equity prices off record highs more recently though they have cheered fed chairman jerome powell s comment that the u s central bank can be patient in approving any further rate increases powell said that especially with inflation low and under control the fed can be patient and watch patiently to figure out which of the two competing narratives unfolds in 2019 so whose view is correct it s true labour markets are robust and wage inflation has been on the rise average earnings rose in december by 3 2 percent on an annual basis matching october s rise which was a 9 1 2 year high but workers wage gains are also being eroded by inflation with core cpi seen above the fed s 2 percent target in coming months powell s newly dovish sounding rhetoric has prompted money markets to price out fed rate rises in 2019 but the producer price index due jan 15 could be key if it shows inflationary pressures cooling there could be a further reprieve from markets rate hike concerns graphic can powell s fed afford to be patient 3 earn baby earn global stock markets have suffered in

upcoming elections and haphazard monetary policy on the positive side the lira s near 30 percent tumble in 2018 had got rebalancing off to a fast start turkey is now posting large current account

gov elect j b pritzker takes office next week on the heels of the most decisive election victory in a generation and he ll be working to pass his agenda through the biggest democratic majorities in the general assembly since the 1960s that raises a question what precisely does that agenda consist of brian mackey discusses the pritzker agenda with host sean crawford watching campaign ads on tv one could get the impression he promised little more than fighting for the state of illinois and similar pap but more substantive proposals are out there early in his tenure gov bruce rauner produced the turnaround agenda it included 44 bullet points of things he wanted to get done but some of that was not what rauner emphasized in his campaign particularly his drive to weaken labor unions and their allies in the democratic party so we though it d be useful to enumerate the pritzker agenda at least as it existed when he was trying to convince illinoisans to elect him we pulled the following list from primary and general election debates speeches and news conferences before and after the election and 21 separate j b on the issues pages from pritzker s campaign website taken together those pages comprise more than 19 000 words much of that consists of principles and priorities vague ideas rather than specific initiatives but to observers who judged him primarily on the platitudes heard in ads and debates there is a surprising amount of detail this list will focus on the concrete proposals things that can be enacted through legislation or through the executive branch of government and may be more representative than comprehensive the campaign cautions that these are priorities and principles not demands that s in contrast with how rauner asked legislators to approach his turnaround agenda in 2015 we should consider it as a whole not as a list of individual initiatives whether in five months after pritzker s first legislative session or in four years should he choose to run for reelection this checklist can be used to judge pritzker s progress toward enacting his agenda and that of his opponents in trying to block him pritzker made several promises in the area of health care including the creation of a state public health insurance option the plan called illinoiscares would let people buy into the state s medicaid program his campaign says based on current medicaid spending figures that annual cost would be in the range of 3 350 per adult and 2 108 per child because people would have to buy in he says the plan would have no cost to taxpayers by my informal and likely erroneous tally pritzker s campaign pronouncements included the word jobs in every other sentence never mind that economists say governors don t have much influence on job creation this is what modern politicians are compelled to say pritzker says he would raise the illinois minimum wage to 15 an hour pass a big infrastructure spending bill money used to build and repair highways bridges ports public transpiration and government buildings make high speed internet access available everywhere in illinois upgrading the locks and dams on the mississippi and illinois rivers update lead pipes in water systems make microloans more widely available pass a truth in lending act aimed at protecting small business owners increase funding for small business development centers review the enterprise zone program to make sure the state is stimulating growth in the most economically distressed communities promote wind and solar power while also supporting the advanced coal and energy research center at southern illinois university carbondale he s also pledged to set illinois on a path toward 100 clean renewable energy make more money available to farms for investment in technology force net neutrality on internet service providers that have state contracts pursue legislation that prevents employers from asking about salary history support construction of a third chicago airport near peotone in the far south suburbs on the condition it doesn t take jobs away from o hare or midway airports pritzker outlined a number of policies intended to increase business opportunities for women and people of color increase the aspirational goal for the share of state contracts going to women and minority owners businesses to 30 percent create a cabinet level position to make sure that aspiration becomes a reality have a loan program that helps minority business owners compete for state contracts start minority and women owned business accelerators to provide mentoring financing and other help fund pre apprenticeship programs to help people from disadvantaged communities get jobs in the building trades both union and non union expand employment programs for disadvantaged youth help unbanked communities by encouraging financial institutions to provide services in libraries and other public spaces cap rates for check cashing broadly speaking pritzker says he wants to put the state back on firm financial footing to that end he says he would support a graduated or progressive income tax where higher amounts of income are subject to higher tax rates such a change would have to be passed by the legislature and ratified by voters at a general election add progressively to the flat tax while waiting for the progressive tax by increasing the earned income tax credit and raising the overall tax rate that was during the campaign after winning he backed off from this proposal not in favor of increases in the gas tax expanding the sales tax to cover services or ending the tax exemption for so called retirement income all three topics were presented at debates those who supported the ideas were asked to raise their hands pritzker kept his down every time support fair maps to stop legislators from gerrymandering their own district boundaries support term limits for leadership roles in the general assembly though not for legislators in general change annual state pension payments so they re level every year putting more money in up front rather than trying to cut benefits thus fulfilling what he calls both a moral and legal obligation to workers and retirees lower property taxes especially on lower income households as part of shifting the main funding burden for education from local government onto the state oppose the private school tax credit program or anything else that s siphoning off money from public schools lowering the mandatory school enrollment age from 6 to 5 incrementally enroll more 3 and 4 year olds in preschool about 12 500 a year for eight years increase access to state child care subsidies to 200 percent of the federal poverty level from the current 185 percent and let people gradually wind down participation as their income approaches 300 percent of the poverty level the campaign says 200 percent threshold would be about 40 000 in annual salary for a family of three add more preschool teachers and classrooms i m going to establish new financial incentives for people to earn the appropriate credentials and enter the state s early learning workforce expand birth to three home visit services and create a family engagement portal to educate new parents on child development create a single shared application for every state university in illinois increase financial aid for low income college students known as monetary award program or map grants by 50 percent create a state run program to help people refinance student loan debt restore funding for state universities and

two warnings by global financial firms about the precarious state of the australian economy in the face of the us china trade war and global financial turmoil have underscored the ruling elite s deepening economic and political predicaments this week s reports one by the fitch ratings company and the other by morgan stanley the american multinational investment bank raise the spectre of a financial crisis that would blow up the pre election claims of both the liberal national coalition government and the labor party opposition they also point to the possibility of prime minister scott morrison who was installed via a backroom liberal party coup in august calling a snap election to try to scrape back into office before the economic storm fully hits last november with the government wracked by electoral defeats and ongoing factional warfare morrison sought to hold it together for a few more months he announced that treasurer josh frydenberg would produce an early surplus budget in april effectively paving the way for a federal election in may which is the latest possible month however this week s reports expose the unreal assumptions behind the government s claim to be ready to produce the first budget surplus since the 2008 global financial breakdown they also indicate deep concerns in the ruling capitalist class that a sharp deterioration in economic conditions will intensify the discontent in the working class over decades of worsening social inequality and declining living standards particularly since the last global crash in 2008 according to fitch a slowdown in the world economy will cut anticipated government revenues stopping the coalition from reaching a budget surplus fitch forecast a relatively small budget deficit of 0 1 percent of gross domestic product gdp for 2019 20 doubting frydenberg s december mid year budget update which predicted a surplus of 4 1 billion 0 2 percent of gdp in 2019 20 fitch expected australia s economic growth to slow to 2 5 percent in 2019 from 3 percent in 2018 due to weaker corporate investment and exports it said the chinese government s bid to diversify its economy away from heavy industries combined with china s ongoing economic growth deceleration would bode poorly for australia s mining exports gloomier economic growth prospects would also slow hiring and wage growth undercutting the government s extraordinary revenue growth projection of 8 1 percent in fiscal year 2019 fitch s predictions themselves understate australian capitalism s exposure to the fallout from the trump administration s economic confrontation with china the australian corporate elite is becoming collateral damage in the offensive launched by the us ruling class its largest source of foreign investment to assert america s post world war ii global supremacy signs are emerging already of the impact on china which has become australia s largest export market over the past 15 years the fitch warning ignited speculation of a possible early election as the economy slows in certain respects and global headwinds grow stronger the option of a march election remains open to scott morrison the australian broadcasting corporation abc reported interviewed on abc radio on january 10 frydenberg played down talk of an early poll nevertheless he acknowledged some cold headwinds in the global economy particularly some of the trade tensions we ve seen he also admitted that rising us and global interest rates could affect the credit dynamic in the domestic economy this was a veiled reference to rising mortgage interest rates and falling real estate prices which are threatening to cause widespread mortgage defaults already an estimated one million households are suffering mortgage stress with their household income insufficient to cover living expenses asked again on abc television s 7 30 program that night whether he could guarantee there would be no election before april frydenberg was evasive well the prime minister has been very clear that i ll be delivering a budget on april the 2nd this will be an important economic document he replied on the same day the london based financial times a voice of global capital published an article headlined australia s house price slide prompts worries about economy it reported the latest warning issued by morgan stanley of an accelerating reversal in the housing market bubble that largely underpinned australian capitalism after a decades long mining boom began to implode in 2012 national house prices fell 1 3 percent in december the largest monthly fall since 1983 which resulted in an annual decline of 6 1 percent last year the newspaper reported prices in sydney the country s biggest property market are down 11 1 percent from their peak according to morgan stanley which warned this week the slump could torpedo australia s run of 27 years without a recession a modern global record daniel blake lead author of the morgan stanley report told the financial times our models show that australian households are most exposed of any g10 country to a housing slump and face a period of deleveraging leaving growth heavily reliant on public spending on health education and infrastructure after years of sky rocketing dwelling prices which have enriched a host of billionaire developers and speculators total australian household liabilities have increased to more than 2 5 trillion according to the australian bureau of statistics household debt has burgeoned from about 60 percent of disposable income in 1998 to around 200 percent one of the highest levels in the world morgan stanley s report followed a similar warning by core logic which tracks property prices a wider financial crisis could result because mortgage debt accounts for over 60 percent of the assets of most major australian banks the labor party s response to fitch s report was just as duplicitous as the government s labor s shadow treasurer chris bowen said the report was concerning but made no mention of how the economic reversal would affect his party s own pledges to the financial markets to produce bigger budget surpluses than the coalition if labor were to regain office by exploiting the widespread hostility to the unravelling coalition it would again form a pro business government as it did from 1983 to 1996 and 2007 to 2013 working closely with the trade unions to suppress workers opposition sections of big business are looking to labor to protect their interests as the coalition s most right wing elements orbiting around home affairs minister peter dutton and ex prime minister tony abbott strive to refashion the liberal and national parties into a trump style populist and semi fascistic movement to divert the social discontent in nationalist directions at labor s national conference last month the labor and union leaders warned repeatedly of rising working class unrest they said a labor led government was essential to prevent the disaffection with the parliamentary order from boiling over labor leader bill shorten warned of mounting distrust and disengagement scepticism and cynicism toward the entire political system while australian council of trade unions secretary sally mcmanus warned of a tidal wave of discontent over casualised employment and falling wages the truth is that whichever party heads the next government it will seek to make the working class pay for the emerging crisis by further gutting social spending driving down real wages and breaking up working conditions at the same time it will boost military spending to meet washington s demand for australia to remain unconditionally behind the aggressive us offensive against china the author also

with equities slumping exchange rate volatility increasing and political risks intensifying financial markets around the world have hit a rough patch during times like these international investors generally grow cautious and prioritize safety over returns so money flees to safe havens that can provide secure liquid investment grade assets on a sufficiently large scale but there are no obvious safe havens today for the first time in living memory investors lack a quiet port where they can find shelter from the storm historically the safe haven par excellence was the united states in the form of treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as one investment strategist put it back in 2012 when people are worried all road lead to treasuries the bursting of the us real estate bubble in 2007 offers a case in point no one doubted that the us was the epicenter of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the us capital actually flooded into it in the last three months of 2008 net purchases of us assets reached a half trillion dollars three times more than that of the preceding nine months combined to be sure some of these dollar claims were due to the fact that foreign banks and institutional investors needed greenbacks to cover their funding needs after interbank and other wholesale short term markets seized up but that was hardly the only reason why portfolio managers piled into the us much of the increased demand was due to sheer fear at a time when nobody knew how bad things might get the us was widely seen as the safest bet but this was before the arrival us president donald trump who has managed to undermine confidence in the dollar to an unprecedented degree in addition to abandoning any notion of fiscal responsibility trump has spent his first two years in office attacking international institutions and picking fights with us allies to be sure even before trump confidence in the dollar suffered a blow in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded treasury securities by one notch in response to a near shutdown of the us government that episode was triggered by a standoff between then president barack obama and congressional republicans over a routine proposal to raise the federal debt ceiling today however investors have even more reason to worry about the us government s credit rating in 2018 alone the us government was shut down three times and it remains in a partial shutdown to this day owing to trump s demand for funds to build a big beautiful wall on the border with mexico where can investors go if not the us the eurozone might seem like a logical alternative after the dollar the euro is the world s most widely used currency and taken together the capital markets of the eurozone s 19 member states are close in size to the us market but europe has troubles of its own economic growth is slowing not least in germany and the risk of a banking crisis in italy the eurozone s fourth largest economy looms on the horizon worse still is the uncertainty over brexit which could prove highly disruptive if the united kingdom crashes out of the european union without a divorce agreement needless to say britain too can be ruled out as a safe haven at least until the brexit fiasco is resolved what about the swiss franc though its attractions are obvious switzerland s financial markets are simply too small to serve as an adequate substitute for the us that leaves japan with its abundant supply of government bonds it is the biggest single market for public debt outside the us the question for portfolio managers though is whether it is really safe to invest in a country where government debt exceeds 230 per cent of gdp for comparison the public debt to gdp ratio in the us is around 88 per cent and even in troubled italy it is no more than 130 per cent admittedly the market for japanese government debt is more stable than most owing to the fact that much of it is held by domestic savers which is to say it is safely tucked under the mattress but japan is an aging country with an economy that has remained almost stagnant for a quarter century investors would be right to wonder where it will find the resources to continue servicing its massive debt overhang and then there is china with the world s third largest national market for public debt certainly the supply of assets in china is ample but the chinese market is so tightly controlled that it is essentially the opposite of a safe haven it will be a long time before global investors even consider putting much faith in chinese securities with secure ports becoming scarce investors will become increasingly jittery they will be inclined to move funds at the slightest sign of danger which will add substantially to market volatility today s rough patch is probably here to stay project syndicate

updated january 12 2019 08 56 am edt contradictions continue to plague morocco s development goals jean r abinader jean r abinader january 12 2019 unrest in many regions of morocco during 2018 and the ongoing strikes in 2019 called by the labor unions and joined by moroccans of all classes are emblematic of the contradictions at the core of the country s uneven development among issues raised by the unions are the need to restart the country s national social dialogue the government s alleged failure to exercise sufficient efforts to address unemployment and labor rights and the growing disparity between classes a recent labor market report featured in morocco world news identifies major problems that have not been effectively addressed by the government the lede was the moroccan economy is still suffering from chronic lack of employment prospects defying the government s repeated promises to increase employment which highlighted the low level of progress in meeting employment targets its assessment was based on an article in the economic news outlet les inspirations eco which noted that even in urban areas where employment is highest the overall unemployment rate is 14 27 5 for youth without a university degree and 17 1 for university graduates instead of reaching its goal of 200 000 new jobs a year the economy only produced 122 000 in 2017 unfortunately to some labor experts the government s job creation efforts are misdirected in that it is relying on boosting public employment to meet its goals rather than building better partnerships with the private sector to create sustainable employment while there are a number of conditions that affect the current lack of dynamic employment growth key constraints in 2018 included a weak jobs picture and the boycott of consumer goods produced by several of the country s leading companies as an article in the arab weekly noted the feeling of social inequality among moroccans was backed by figures released by the government the national survey of household consumption and expenditure said large disparities between layers of society persist the top 10 of the richest spend about 12 times more than 10 of the poorest while the standard of living of 5 of the richest is 20 times that of 5 of the most disadvantaged in a widely reported address last year ahmed lahlimi alami high commissioner for planning called for acceleration and adaptation of structural reforms economic growth remains rather weak still subject to rainfall risks with a low technology and export capacity offer little job creation and little contribution to the reduction of social and territorial inequalities he said king mohammed vi added his criticism as well shuffling several ministers and firing officials responsible for the lack of progress on projects in different regions of the country another area of concern is the increase in morocco s public debt which impacts public funds available for capital investments in infrastructure and other tools of economic growth according to trading economics morocco held more than 50 billion in external debt in mid 2018 with the treasury s total debt representing 67 3 of the 2017 gdp as reported in morocco world news the national debt was expected to increase by the end of 2018 as the trade deficit and government expenditures continue to rise driss jettou president of the court of auditors called on the government to raise taxes and cut spending to accelerate growth to reduce debt and to ensure that morocco can meet its debt obligations over the medium and long term foreign direct investment fdi rose again in 2018 to close to 3 5 billion vs 2 4 billion in the previous year the increased fdi flows helped offset morocco s worsening trade deficit which increased 7 7 during the same period the widening deficit was due to a larger increase of imports 45 8 billion over exports 26 2 billion although the rate of export growth up 9 7 was higher than that of imports up 8 8 other main factors behind the worsening deficit are declining tourism revenues which dropped 1 8 to 5 2 billion and remittances from moroccan expatriates which declined 1 7 to 6 2 billion detailed the arab weekly in contrast to these discouraging statistics morocco continues to receive positive news in external quarters for example abdellatif jouahri was named central banker of the year in africa by the banker magazine based in the uk which celebrates officials that have best managed to stimulate growth and stabilize their economy noting his strong monetary policies that helped shape morocco s economic growth forbes has ranked morocco as the 62nd best country for business for 2019 a drop from 55thin 2017 among 153 countries morocco was cited for its proximity to europe and relatively low labor costs and that it is working towards building a diverse open market oriented economy and the magazine highlighted agriculture tourism aerospace automotive and phosphates as key growth sectors morocco has increased investment in its port transportation and industrial infrastructure to position itself as a center and broker for business throughout africa regionally tunisia ranked 82nd and algeria 114th whether or not the country can weather the current protests through some combination of security measures and short term remedies morocco is running out of options for taking steps that will change the basic contours of the economy so that it is freed to generate jobs and revenue from an empowered private sector morocco shares these deficiencies with other african

craig zeng an executive at finance portal lexinfintech told a harvard business school conference that in the past the most common question a chinese company like his received from us investors was who is your counterpart in the us it meant who did you copy from the us but things have started to change last year over 10 chinese companies were listed in the us and only a few of them could answer that

most of his time making robots he came to shenzhen in 2012 with the idea to make robotics easy shenzhen was a magnet not only because it had easy access to all of the hardware components or robot bits he needed but it was easy to find good engineers with so many software companies there and while the shanzhai or copycat bandits have largely cleared out of shenzhen wang says they have left behind a useful resource there are so many factories several years ago these factories were creating fake phones but now we can use their supply chains to make innovative products we can use their people to quickly manufacture our product china still lags the us on basic fundamental technology such as microchip design he says but chinese companies have become very good at applying technology in new ways

new york u s stock indexes nestled a hair lower on friday after the falling price of oil weighed on energy companies but the s p 500 nevertheless closed out its third straight winning week following a brutal stretch in december it was a day full of broken streaks oil fell for the first time in two weeks and the yield on the 10 year treasury note sank to its first loss in more than a week but the market remained calm through it gradual moves for markets in recent days have offered a respite following the tumultuous trading that rocked investors in late 2018 after some of the initial gains we saw earlier in the week i think it s just a rally looking tired said willie delwiche investment strategist at baird i think it s probably not much more than a chance for people to digest the move and try to get a sense of whether we ve had a bounce and this is it or maybe a pause as we continue to move higher the s p 500 edged down by 0 38 points or less than 0 1 percent to 2 596 26 last month a typical day for the index was a swing 10 times that the dow jones industrial average dipped 5 97 points or less than 0 1 percent to 23 995 95 the nasdaq composite lost 14 59 or 0 2 percent to 6 971 48 and the russell 2000 index of smaller stocks ticked up by 1 95 or 0 1 percent to 1 447 38 it was the first loss for the s p 500 in six days and much of the reason for it was the falling price of oil benchmark u s crude lost 1 9 percent to settle at 51 59 per barrel and brent crude the international standard sank 1 9 percent to 60 48 a barrel advertisement that helped pull energy stock in the s p 500 down 0 6 percent the largest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the index conocophillips marathon oil and hess all fell more than 1 percent big gains earlier in the week meant the s p 500 was still hanging onto a 2 5 percent rise for the last five days the three week winning streak for the s p 500 is its longest since august not only that the last three weeks of gains have all been of more than 1 8 percent the last time that happened was in 2001 the s p 500 has been clawing back gains since running to the edge of what traders call a bear market when it dropped 19 8 percent between setting a record in september and a low on christmas eve stocks have climbed on soothing words from the federal reserve about the future path of interest rates plus hopes that the u s china trade dispute may ease that s helped to at least paper over worries about slowing growth for corporate earnings and the possibility of a looming recession companies across the country are gearing up to report how much profit they made in the last three months of 2018 and expectations are for a fifth straight quarter of growth topping 10 percent general motors gave an encouraging sign friday when it gave better than expected profit forecasts for both 2018 and 2019 that helped the automaker surge to the biggest gain in the s p 500 and it jumped 2 45 or 7 1 percent to 37 18 other big name companies have recently offered a more discouraging picture of revenue trends due to slowing growth in china and elsewhere advertisement that s why analysts say this upcoming earnings reporting season which kicks off in earnest next week could be the next trigger for volatility in the market delwiche said he wants to hear how optimistic ceos are given all the uncertainties about the economy we ve seen some retrenchment in business confidence delwiche said is it a blip or evidence that those animal spirits that we saw are starting to dissipate in overseas markets japan s nikkei 225 index jumped 1 percent the kospi in south korea rose 0 6 percent and the hang seng in hong kong gained 0 5 percent in europe france s cac 40 dropped 0 5 percent and germany s dax lost 0 3 percent the ftse 100 in london fell 0 4 percent the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell to 2 69 percent from 2 73 percent late thursday in the commodities markets gold rose 0 2 percent to 1 289 50 per ounce silver edged up 0 1 percent to 15 66 per ounce and copper rose 0 9 percent to 2 66 per pound natural gas gained 4 4 percent to 3 10 per 1 000 cubic feet heating oil lost 1 4 percent to 1 88 per gallon and wholesale gasoline slipped 2 1 percent to 1 40 per gallon the dollar rose to 108 50 japanese yen from 108 42 yen late thursday the euro slipped to 1 1465 from 1 1500 and the british pound rose to 1 2845 from 1 2746 send questions comments to the editors
the direction of china in 2019 is a source of concern it remains to be seen how much downward pressure gdp growth is going to face authorities however will continue to roll out policies in support of the private sector with the commercial property industry being a beneficiary david hand ceo for the asia pacific at colliers says that the trade dispute between the united states and china remains a risk that weighs down investor s confidence causing delays in decisions about property investment in this interview he shares his views on the trends that will shape this year s property story maurits elen will china s commercial property market face a tough year in 2019 david hand 2019 is likely to prove more challenging than 2018 as financial market risks policy uncertainty and trade tensions weigh on the chinese commercial property market nevertheless we remain cautiously optimistic about prospects for the chinese commercial property market since more relaxed monetary policies encouraging private sector investment look set to continue in 2019 the chinese government has already taken steps to counter the negative effects of the trade dispute since policies are now aimed at encouraging domestic consumption to stimulate gdp growth as china transforms itself from an export oriented economy to a market driven by domestic consumption policies such as lower import tariffs and disposable income tax cuts should boost private sector investment this trend should particularly support the office and logistics sectors of the commercial property market what policy adjustments can be made to support the market since early 2018 china has been trying to reduce financial leverage especially in property this theme will continue in 2019 and perhaps 2020 however taking account of recent cuts to banks reserve rate requirements and ample money supply in the chinese financial system it seems clear that the government aims to encourage private sector investment besides policies such as lower import tariffs and further reserve rate requirement cuts intended to boost consumption the government may take further steps to support infrastructure investment such measures should support commercial property what property sectors and cities are attractive to invest in first tier cities in china still represent attractive investment targets given firm medium term growth prospects we think the office and logistics sectors offer the best opportunities together with smaller market sectors like business parks with investment yields typically higher for logistics and business parks than for offices economic growth is highest in south china especially shenzhen which is one of asia s key hubs for technology development and is profiting from government driven infrastructure investment through the greater bay area plan solid demand for leased space from technology occupiers in south china should drive rent growth over time compensating for near term oversupply of offices in certain areas and near term negative impacts from the trade dispute among all property sectors reflecting a likely increase in domestic consumption leading to higher online retail sales we expect logistics to perform best in china in 2019 with rent and capital values rising further however tradable logistics assets in first tier cities are scarce hence we expect investors to pay more attention to logistics assets in the second tier cities surrounding the first tier cities in 2019 and 2020 this is true in all china s key regions to what extent has the trade war affected foreign investment into china s property market in 2018 the trade dispute between the united states and china represents an important risk that is affecting chinese exports as well as investment in manufacturing and general confidence chinese financial markets are now in subdued mood with real gdp growth ticking down to its lowest rate in 10 years at just over 6 percent chinese stock markets down by around a quarter from their highs in early 2018 and the chinese renminbi down by almost 10 percent against the u s dollar since april mirroring the slowdown in economic growth aggregate inward foreign direct investment fdi to china dropped by 26 percent year on year in q3 2018 to 24 3 billion according to oxford economics information from the national bureau of statistics suggests that foreign investment in enterprises for real estate development dropped by 36 percent yoy over the first ten months of 2018 the u s china trade dispute will probably continue to affect investors confidence resulting in delays in decisions about property investment what are important sources of foreign investment into china based on data from real capital analytics we estimate that aggregate transactions of income producing properties in china reached 213 billion between 2012 and h1 2018 cross border funding was involved in 27 percent of these transactions by region the asia pacific excluding china accounted for 75 percent of the cross border deals the americas for 18 percent and europe for 7 percent the fact that a high proportion of investment comes from the asia pacific should help mitigate the impact of possible reduced interest from investors in the americas how are regional investors likely to approach the china market in the context of regional property investment we see the large mainland chinese cities as too large to ignore even if other asian urban markets such as tokyo singapore bangalore and hong kong also present attractive opportunities given the impact of deleveraging policies and tight liquidity in china over the past few years despite recent signs of easing certain domestic investors have come under pressure and so fund managers based outside china may be hoping to acquire assets at discounted prices searching for distressed assets will probably be one strategy for foreign investors in chinese commercial property in 2019 in addition owing to the prevailing modest investment yields for core office assets in china global and regional investors may also focus on value added property investment in the first tier cities value added approaches include the acquisition of underperforming assets for upgrade or conversion focusing on providing greater flexibility better user experience and improvements through better design and technology the most successful investors will be those who select the right property assets requiring detailed knowledge of local markets and are able to demonstrate a high level of asset management expertise this

opinion hey there time traveller this article was published 11 01 2019 1912 days ago so information in it may no longer be current investors have had few bright spots in their portfolios as markets have see sawed between fear and greed but one asset class that has steadily been on the rise is gold since august the world s most sought after precious metal has climbed by almost 10 per cent that s hardly meteoric yet it s a return all the same in a marketplace where decent returns on your money are difficult to find gold s slow rise over the last few months is likely the result of concerns that the longest bull market at least for the s p 500 which is the broadest equity index in the world has come to an end so as uncertainty and fear have ramped up over the last few months interest in gold as measured by its price has been on the rise which might leave you asking should i own gold most people fit into two camps in this respect says peter hodgson portfolio manager with hodgson group at bmo nesbitt burns in collingwood ont one group often holds a small allocation of gold in their portfolios for diversification reasons if you want to build a diversified portfolio gold is one asset to consider he adds that s because gold is an alternative asset that often behaves differently price wise from stocks so when equities are down in value gold often goes in the opposite direction though not always then you have the segment who own gold because these investors think the fiat currency and stability of government balance sheets are really suspect he says and if things really come apart at the seams like this group fears gold is important to own this segment of investors are sometimes referred to as gold bugs because they are often bullish on gold soaring in value at some point because they believe the central banking system based on fiat currency will eventually fail and in turn gold will return to its former place as the world s reserve currency until the bretton woods agreement in 1944 gold was just that then a handful of nations those being the allies agreed to make the u s dollar the reserve currency of choice against which all others would be measured and the greenback remains the world s reserve currency today it wasn t until the early 1970s however that most of the world s largest free market economies chose to fully untether their currencies from gold allowing their governments to create money in sums that far exceeded what could be backed by the gold reserves held in their central banks yet the precious metal has always remained a shadow reserve currency reacting to economic cycles for example during runaway inflation in the 1970s and 1980s gold s price skyrocketed to more than us 2 100 per ounce in today s dollars but when central banks started to manage inflation as a primary objective as they do today its price then fell and continued to do so over a 20 year span eventually hitting a low of about us 271 per ounce in 2001 then gold s price started to climb again reaching more than us 1 700 in 2011 largely due to fear regarding the inflationary policies of central banks since gold has been a flat performing asset at best says karl cheong head of exchange traded funds etfs for first trust portfolios canada i ve held gold for 10 years he adds i ve been long suffering with that trade but cheong says he owns the asset all the same for diversification purposes like many experts in the industry he adds a small allocation in the portfolio to gold is fairly standard yet many portfolio managers do not own any gold at all for their clients including hodgson there are a lot of alternatives for gold that can perform the same diversification role these include real estate which can also do well in inflationary environments additionally real estate often produces a yield a steady return and gold does not the fact is gold hasn t been much better than cash over the last 10 years hodgson says what s more is its price doesn t always surge when markets are plunging hodgson points to its performance during late 2008 and early 2009 when equity markets were halved in price it wasn t until the latter half of 2009 into 2011 that its price shot up after investors started worrying about the government debt loads and their effect on currency long term those fears subsided as markets recovered and gold s price fell significantly and then stabilized gold now has been out of favour for so long that no one has talked about it forever cheong says so if you re a contrarian investor seeking to buy when everyone else is not now may be a good opportunity to take a reasonable position in the asset i believe everyone should have an allocation to gold of about five to 10 per cent of their portfolio says will rhind ceo of graniteshares a commodity etf provider in new york he adds commodities gold included generally do well in an inflationary environment like we may be facing today yet gold is unlike other commodities because very little of it is used for industrial purposes rhind notes even other precious metals silver palladium and platinum have much stronger demand for industrial uses by contrast gold is widely held for investment purposes and the reason most people own it is because it s uncorrelated to anything else he says as we move into what appears to be a more uncertain economic environment than we ve experienced in some time gold is worth considering hodgson adds i would never say that someone shouldn t do it but you need to be aware of how it will perform in the scenario that you re trying to insure against because that s in essence what you re doing buying a kind of portfolio insurance

have see sawed between fear and greed but one asset class that has steadily been on the rise is gold since august the world s most sought after precious metal has climbed by almost 10 per cent that s hardly meteoric yet it s a return all the same in a marketplace where decent returns on your money are difficult to find gold s slow rise over the last few months is likely the result of concerns that

parts of the federal government have been shut down since late december it s created a spate of risks in the largest economy in the world for example employment could fall for the first time since 2010 a partial shutdown of the federal government entered its fourth week saturday making it the longest on record from jobs to food stamps an impasse over border security has put large swaths of the economy in jeopardy a short term shutdown does not usually have a big economic effect said donald moynihan chair of the mccourt school of public policy at georgetown university but at this point we are looking at the longest shutdown in the modern era we should be worried growth is expected to slip business activity was already expected to expand at a slower rate in coming months but economists have further lowered estimates for quarterly gross domestic product or the total value of the nation s goods and services since the shutdown began federal workers missed paychecks that were due this week a development that will complicate the lives of more than 800 000 and that threatens to weigh on gross domestic product congress approved a bill friday that ensures back pay for furloughed employees but it must still be signed into law and would not be distributed until after the shutdown ends in the meantime reduced income will weigh on consumer spending which accounts for about 70 of economic activity maybe you can make up for one missed paycheck said brad setser who served as a white house and treasury department economist in the obama administration but the longer the shutdown goes on the harder it is for the government workforce to keep up with spending lower consumption will also hit the private sector which faces its own direct risks from the shutdown uncertainty can delay investment a lack of regulatory oversight can chip away at consumer confidence and those who rely on federal services can lose customers hotels may start seeing fewer customers who don t want to spend their time in trash strewn national parks or dealing with long lines at airports moynihan said if you shut down one sector of the economy you quickly learn how connected it is to other parts employment could fall for the first time since 2010 with about 380 000 workers placed on unpaid leave while a series of government agencies are closed the wall street journal reported the shutdown could upend the longest stretch of continuous job growth in history since monthly payroll growth has averaged at about 215 000 over the past five years the shutdown could in january cause overall employment to fall for the first time in 99 months the disruption is also making it more difficult to keep an eye on the labor market for instance economists don t know why applications for unemployment benefits fell significantly more than expected this week we don t know if the consensus was high because forecasters believe that the trend in claims has risen or because they feared a big hit from the government shutdown ian sheperdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics said in an email the uncertainty means that it probably would be sensible to view these numbers as an unreliable guide to the underlying pace of layoffs a lapse in data has created uncertainty with large portions of the department of commerce closed some information on the state of the economy won t be released during the shutdown many economists have forecast a recession could begin within the next two years and a lack of data could fan fears about the possibility of a crisis it will also become more difficult for americans to understand what s happening in the economy putting businesses at a disadvantage farmers who have already been reeling from the us china trade war for instance are working without key figures on monthly international shipments trade statistics weren t going to turn things said william tyner an agricultural economist at purdue university but data is certainly better than no data what farmers are going to have to do now is place bets on trade negotiations understanding the economy has become more difficult the federal reserve could have trouble getting an accurate reading of business conditions as the shutdown threatens to distort key economic figures that comes at an already uncertain time for officials there whose rate path has been shifting in light of stock market turbulence a global trade war and fading stimulus the tricky thing will be figuring out whether the dips in the numbers are just transitory effects of the shutdown or portend a more persistent deceleration in the pace of economic activity said ken kuttner a former staff economist at the central bank and making that distinction is especially important right now since there were already some hints of a slowdown us creditworthiness has been called into question a prolonged shutdown could lead to a credit downgrade for the us making it more expensive for americans to borrow with mounting doubt about the government s ability to resolve short and long term challenges major credit rating agency fitch ratings warned this week that the us could lose its aaa status if lawmakers fail to pass a budget and manage the debt ceiling the more the dysfunctional the us government looks the more likely it is that bond agencies will become tempted to downgrade its creditworthiness moynihan said the housing market could falter an already soft spot in an otherwise robust economy additional obstacles in the housing market would likely leave economists concerned residential real estate activity has been cooling off as tax laws reduced construction activity and higher interest rates compound housing shortages across the country the longer this shutdown lasts the more the momentum be extracted from the spring market the annual super bowl of the housing market said jonathan miller a real estate appraiser at miller samuel inc housing is already showing weakness in a growing number of regions and this uncertainty only accelerates the trend mortgage applicants could also face longer wait times especially for loans that require income verification through the internal revenue service according to a national association of realtors analysis of a 16 day government shutdown in 2013 nearly a fifth of home loan deals were affected since the current shutdown is longer we could see more loans impacted due to bigger backlogs said mark fleming chief economist at first american inequality could get worse disadvantaged americans who rely on federal programs risk losing benefits during a government shutdown potentially aggravating large gaps in wealth across the country millions of low income households in the us receive some form of federal rental assistance with many of them providing for children the elderly or those with disabilities federal contracts for more than 1 000 government funded properties for these renters have expired due to the shutdown nbc news reported this week should the shutdown continue landlords may move to evict tenants and the most vulnerable households in the country will suffer ingrid gould ellen a professor of urban policy and planning at new york university moreover even if they don t evict tenants in the longer run landlords may be less willing to participate in federal rental subsidy programs if they don t think the federal government is a reliable partner food stamps will be distributed through next month according to the trump administration but it is unclear if that would be the case if the shutdown were to continue into march now read wall streeters fled to silicon valley to chase riches influence and a better life now they re bouncing back to banking recession watch

oh how far the democratic party has fallen in recent days we ve seen the new darling of the democrats u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez crusading for a 70 percent income tax rate for high earners now according to a washington times report on thursday several prominent democratic presidential wannabes including sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts are arguing for tax rates of more than 50 percent texan julian castro an obama cabinet member who is testing the waters says approvingly that there was a time when the top marginal tax rate was 90 percent it s almost like a race among the presidential aspirants to see who s willing to raise tax rates the most what is so disheartening about this cheery talk of returning to confiscatory tax rates is that it was just a little more than 30 years ago that democrats were carrying the torch for much lower tax rates than we have even today after the tax cuts under president donald trump then democratic stars sen bill bradley of new jersey and house majority leader dick gephardt sponsored a tax reform bill with the late great jack kemp to slash tax rates to 28 percent they worked with president ronald reagan to get the top tax rate down from 50 percent to 28 percent by closing gaping tax loopholes amazingly the bradley bill to cut the highest marginal rate to 27 percent passed in the senate are you ready for this by a vote 97 3 even the most liberal democrats such as ted kennedy howard metzenbaum and al gore supported the revenue neutral tax reform movement of trading low tax rates for ending tax shelters for the very rich the tax reform act of 1986 was a great bipartisan achievement that helped spur many years of strong economic growth advertisement where did all the pro growth democrats go advertisement castro seems to long for the return to 90 percent tax rates does he know any of the history here it was president john f kennedy who called for a 30 percent across the board reduction in tax rates that ended the tyranny of a government that could take 90 cents in taxes out of a dollar of earnings kennedy argued correctly that the lower tax rates would raise revenues in the long run he was right the lower tax rates spurred a burst of prosperity after he was tragically assassinated opinion get smart opinions on the topics north texans care about sign up or with google facebook by signing up you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy when reagan entered office he picked up where kennedy left off during his presidency the top tax rate fell from 70 percent down to below 30 percent federal tax receipts even with these lower tax rates doubled from 500 billion in 1980 to just over 1 trillion by 1990 or roughly 50 percent higher after accounting for inflation president george w bush s chief economists proved in a famous study of the reagan tax cuts that the biggest increase in tax revenue came from the wealthiest americans so much for reagan cutting taxes on the rich now we skip forward to the democratic party of 2019 and almost all of the leaders are endorsing tax deform ocasio cortez and warren keep touting a return to the tradition of the democratic party of higher tax rates to restore fairness for the middle class and promote social justice have any of them even noticed that in the wake of the trump tax rate reductions to 37 percent for individuals and 21 percent for businesses which every democrat in the house and senate voted against we have the best job market for the middle class in 50 years and wage gains that are larger for the lower and middle income groups than for the rich trump has created 1 million new construction manufacturing and mining jobs middle class occupations that had been flat or shrinking under president barack obama after nearly two decades of income stagnation the middle class is getting ahead again advertisement since democrats are now talking about the good old days of sky high tax rates they might want to look at the evidence of what was actually going on back then irs data confirms that almost no rich people paid those 70 and 80 and 90 percent tax rates they hired lawyers and lobbyists to escape paying the taxes or they stashed their money away in exotic tax exempt shelters or bought tax free municipal bonds to avoid forking over the majority of their income to the irs when the top tax rate was 70 percent in 1980 the richest 1 percent paid about 20 percent of all income taxes in 2016 the most recent year we have good data with a top tax rate of 39 6 percent the top 1 percent paid almost 40 percent of income taxes this suggests that if ocasio cortez or warren were to have their way the rich would pay less not more of the burden of the taxes a 70 percent tax rate would mean that the u s would suddenly have the highest tax rates in the world on our small businesses jobs would leave and the economy would so tank that the incomes and tax payments of the wealthy would shrink the modern day democrats may not even care if that happened when obama was asked in 2008 why he supported a capital gains tax hike even though history proves that this would lower federal revenue he said he would still favor the policy because it was the fair thing to do i suspect the left s obsession with raising tax rates is not about helping the poor or middle class or about lowering the budget deficit but about tearing down the rich the modern left is not driven by fairness it is guided by an ideology of greed and envy those are vices not virtues stephen moore is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an

the partial closure of the us government has become the country s longest ever shutdown the federal reserve says its immediate impact on the economy is negligible but an extended shutdown could prove a drag the united states partial government shutdown entered its twenty second day on saturday beating the 21 day shutdown during the clinton administration to become the country s longest ever about 800 000 federal workers are affected by the shutdown and many have missed their first paychecks of the year but apart from the personal hardship the wider impact of the shutdown on the us economy seems limited speaking at the economic club of washington on thursday us federal reserve chairman jerome powell said that past government shutdowns didn t last long and hence hadn t left a mark on the economy a longer shutdown is something we have not had powell however also said if we have an extended shutdown i do think that it would show up in the data pretty clearly powell noted that for the time being the us central bank would have only limited data available to make predictions on the economy especially about monetary policy decisions about one quarter of the federal government has been shut down since december 22 because of a dispute over 5 7 billion 4 95 billion in funding for president donald trump s us mexico border wall trump s dispute with democrats is showing no signs of ending after the president walked out of a negotiating session with democratic leaders who continue to reject his demand for funding only peanuts meanwhile data coming out of the white house suggest that the shutdown could reduce the united states total economic output by an estimated tenth of a percentage point every two weeks for context the us economy is forecast to have grown by about 2 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisors believes that the us unemployment figures could also rise this month because federal employees furloughed during the shutdown are considered unemployed so when we see the january jobs number it could be a big negative hassett told reporters earlier this month adding that those workers would however ultimately get paid some economists also expect to see a big pullback in spending if government employees can t receive their paychecks on balance though they echo the fed s view that the shutdown so far has had a minor impact on the economy according to goldman sachs analysts the ongoing shutdown will affect gross domestic product gdp by about 0 07 percentage points each week we do not expect the partial shutdown to have substantial effects on financial markets we note that the shutdown is unrelated to the debt limit and has no implications for treasury financing the us investment bank said in a note robert dye chairman of the economic advisory committee of the american bankers association said it was still difficult to put a number on the cost of the shutdown the shutdown that we ve had so far particularly because it was over the holidays is a fairly minor drag on the overall economy he said adding that if it were to extend into another paycheck or two it would exert a meaningful drag on the economy already the shutdown is affecting projections for us growth this year on thursday jpmorgan chase s chief us economist michael feroli cut his first quarter growth forecast to a 2 percent annualized pace from 2 25 percent citing the shutdown no recession fears despite the uncertainty surrounding the government shutdown fed chair jerome powell doesn t expect the us economy to slip into a recession in 2019 i don t see a recession he told the washington club gathering explaining further that two key risk factors for recession which were inflationary overheating and asset bubbles didn t exist the principal worry i would have is global growth he said it s a tightly integrated global economy and financial markets and we will feel that the fed which is self funded is not affected by the partial shutdown but the us department of commerce which produces some important economic reports has been hit the shutdown already has delayed the release of the monthly foreign trade statistics which were due out on tuesday and more key data on the state of the us economy such as fourth quarter economic growth consumer spending and personal income are also unlikely to be released emergency powers meanwhile donald trump is planning to declare a national emergency saying he would be absolutely right to resort to the measure in order to break the impasse with the congressional democrats the move could trigger a backlash among lawmakers as well as court challenges but trump told reporters the lawyers have so advised me i m not prepared to do that yet but if i have to i will in a sign that the american president might soon make a decision on that he canceled a trip to the world economic forum gathering in davos switzerland which was planned for later this month because of the democrats intransigence on border security and the great importance of safety for our nation i am respectfully cancelling my very important trip trump wrote on social

story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content these developments are occurring in the context of a canadian economy that has been performing well overall said the bank meanwhile consumption spending and housing investment have been weaker than expected as housing markets adjust to municipal and provincial measures changes to mortgage guidelines and higher interest rates household spending will be dampened further by slow growth in oil producing provinces craig alexander deloitte canada s chief economist told several hundred housing executives at a bild calgary region dinner last week that he expected the bank s decision this came as no surprise because financial markets had priced out any rate hike in january in the wake of the tumble in oil and in light of the volatility of the stock market in december said alexander the bank of canada said it still believes that they will ultimately need to move interest rates back to what they consider to be neutral i would argue that the neutral for canada is actually the bottom of that range most forecasters were forecasting the bank of canada would take the overnight rate up to two and a half percent in 2019 and i don t think they re going to get there i think ultimately by the time we get towards the end of this year i think they re going to realize the economy isn t as strong and i think we re going to get a half of a point increase in interest rates this year and i think there s a growing case that they remain on hold advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content a small increase or keeping the rate on hold is good news for prospective home buyers because rising rates make the mortgage stress test more severe alexander expects the national economy to level out we are going to see businesses outside the energy patch investing more because capacity utilization is running at very high levels he said i think we are going to see exports benefitting from a weak canadian dollar but fundamentally the exports and investment can t pick up the slack in the moderation in housing and consumer spending and that s why economic growth drops down to less than two percent last fall alexander had high expectations for the alberta economy as december unfolded i got less enthused he said my forecast for alberta was for growth of 2 3 percent basically neck and neck with b c for the fastest rate of economic growth but now alberta is below the middle of the pack of provinces in terms of growth advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content alexander updated his forecast because of oil the drop in oil prices and oil production curtailment knocks alberta s economic growth rate down from 2 3 percent to about 1 3 percent he said the production curtailment has had the desired impact in narrowing the spread between west texas intermediate wti crude and western canada select wcs prices however what we re talking about is real gross domestic product gross domestic product is the value of all the goods and services we produce the real gdp strips off prices if you put in place an oil production curtailment you reduce the production in order to lose the crisis when you boost the prices but you cut the production you lower your real gdp because it doesn t capture price affects so ultimately the curtailment combined with lower oil prices will constrain investment in the energy patch that is going to lead to weaker economic growth advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and an effect on housing the real estate market is directly a function of how the economy is doing and so i think we are going to see a weaker pace of construction but well above what we had in 2015 2016 said alexander i think prices have already started to dip but one thing that limits the impact of prices is what will be happening to listings as listings drop it will constrain new supply and constraining new supply will limit the impact on pricing i think we ll see single digit price declines in calgary this year reflected by a weaker economy and then in 2020 i think we ll see some price growth but again i think it will be in the low single digits article content share this article in your social network read next latest national stories
photo jim allen freightwaves a weekly look at what occurred in the oil markets of the u s and the world this past week oil markets thursday completed a nine day stretch of rising prices before reversing course friday but consider that on friday the business media was getting all excited about the s p 500 having posted five consecutive days of gains the nine day run was the first of that length in nine years almost to the day it brought wti prices up from a december 27 settle of 44 61 per barrel to settle thursday at 52 59 b before pulling back to 51 59 friday what pushed prices higher you can take your pick among these possible reasons opec cut its output in december by anywhere from 460 000 barrels per day to a whopping 630 000 b d in december the latter figure being reported by s p global platts after earlier reports by reuters and bloomberg put the cuts at lesser levels if the platts numbers are closer to reality it means that opec is already more than 75 of the way toward its output reduction goal of 800 000 b d agreed to at its early december meeting but that isn t the right way to look at it as platts noted if you take out qatar which has quite the group and assume no reductions from iran libya and venezuela which were exempted from the reductions the output level of 26 89 million b d is still about 1 million b d more than the 25 94 million b d ceiling that is part of the agreement which went into effect january 1 however that s a big if venezuelan output continues to fall because of chaos libya s biggest oil field is shut down because it was captured by a rebel group and iran continues to labor under u s sanctions though exemptions granted to eight countries by washington means that its reductions in production have not been anywhere near what some market analysts expected the opec cutbacks combined with strong statements from saudi officials were viewed as key factors in the rising market the dollar is weaker there is an inverse relationship between the strength of the dollar and the price of oil since oil is priced in dollars worldwide a weaker dollar tends to boost the price of oil it is not an absolute direct correlation but it is a factor between december 14 and january 10 the value of the dollar relative to the euro declined to 86 4 cts per euro from 89 1 cts per euro on december 14 for the japanese yen a dollar could buy you 114 yen on november 28 but at its low on january 10 would only bring 104 8 yen hedging reversed as has been noted previously the enormous amount of hedging that needs to be done by u s exploration and production companies has introduced volatility in the market in a falling market the financial institutions that sold the put options to the e p companies need to start selling futures to keep themselves balanced or what is known in the options world as delta neutral when the price starts rising it can bring in additional selling the bottom line is that the huge amount of hedging that is going on out there means that any move up or down tends to be exacerbated in the short run but to the downside the question is why prices are moving higher when the fundamentals are showing weakness there were two statistical points that emerged during the week that pointed to a weaker market first for the second consecutive week the weekly inventory report of the american petroleum institute and the energy information administration of the department of energy showed enormous builds in u s stocks of gasoline and diesel stocks of all distillates are soaring including ultra low sulfur diesel which in the latest report was about 88 of the total distillate pool at 124 3 million barrels in the latest eia report inventories have caught up to their five year average for this time of year according to the eia data they ve tacked on 20 million barrels in just two weeks after being considerably below then 5 year average meanwhile crude oil stocks have been declining as u s refiners have been running in excess of 95 of capacity since the end of november what looked like a crude glut is turning into the makings of a product glut the other key bearish number in the diesel market was the eia s weekly estimate of products supplied essentially demand for all forms of distillate at 2 955 million b d for the week ending january 4 it was the first time in about three years it was less than 3 million b d it could be an aberration and a warm winter in the northeast is certainly keeping heating oil demand weak heating oil like diesel is a distillate but when combined with the high operating rates of refineries and bulging stocks the possibility that demand is faltering makes a lot of sense the price of diesel on the cme is for product a month hence but in the physical market what gets traded is generally barge or pipeline lots for delivery in a far shorter time frame that market is showing signs of that inventory overhang platts reported that gulf coast diesel was 9 5 cts less than the cme ulsd price which is much more than the usual differential of a few cents and that jet fuel in the gulf which like diesel is a distillate now is priced higher than diesel that s a reversal of the normal relationship between the two the deepwater horizon blowout in the gulf of mexico threatened the very existence of bp this past week more than eight years later it announced an enormous discovery in the gulf the company said that using new technology it has identified an additional 1 billion barrels of oil in place at thunder horse which already is a significant producer for bp the thunder horse system can process 250 000 b d of oil now bp gave no timeline on adding to current production given the fact that these are only reserves but the key takeaway here is that what bp said is cutting edge technology allowed it to process seismic data and make its conclusions in a matter of weeks in the past it would have taken a year

municipal administrations have been handwringing in public about the maintenance deficit and promising to invest historic sums to overcome it no administration has ever spent what was needed or done the work that s required to bring montreal roads up to acceptable standards despite the proliferation of orange cones every mayor s promise to catch up on the maintenance deficit has been more myth than reality if you consider the gap between how much money is needed for major road repair and reconstruction and how much city hall has budgeted and between what city hall has budgeted and what it has actually spent and the promise to catch up on needed roadwork has been a myth if you simply consider the state of montreal roads asphalt doesn t lie factoring in inflation montreal has spent as little and sometimes less on road repair through part of the 2000s as it did in 2001 the year before the municipal mergers on montreal island and that s without judging the quality of the work that was done advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content nevertheless the dollars spent have added up like bent rims and tire punctures on a crummy road between 2002 and 2018 the city poured more than 2 3 billion into roadwork a tally by the montreal gazette found using figures in montreal s annual audited financial statements it s just that it was less than what the city s experts urged was minimally needed each year to catch up on the deficit in repair and reconstruction work and to maintain what wasn t already broken on the 4 000 kilometre road network in its current condition besides under budgeting each year on needed roadwork montreal also has a bad habit of never spending all of those allotted funds photo by john mahoney montreal gazette one example is mayor valérie plante s announcement in early 2018 that her administration would redo 1 000 kilometres of streets over three years her 2018 2020 capital works program forecasted that in 2018 alone the city would spend 342 5 million to fix 416 kilometres under six roadwork programs that provide short medium and long term repair however as of sept 26 which was pretty much the end of the roadwork season the city had spent 264 1 million in the six programs and touched just 277 1 kilometres of road according to information provided by the city through an access to information request today s one read get the most interesting story of the day there was an error please provide a valid email address sign up by signing up you consent to

below article content and last year s completion rate was actually pretty good compared to most years now compare that to what the city actually needed to do in 2018 according to the optimal scenario that montreal s civil service presented in its most recent five year intervention plan 598 million in current dollars invested on 505 kilometres of road the upshot is that montreal hasn t made a dent in its maintenance deficit since jean doré first sounded an alarm bell about the crumbling city when he was the mayor in the 1980s it s just the opposite in fact the deficit keeps growing it may seem paradoxical but the amount of money the city claims it must spend to make up for past underinvestment and bring the road network up to acceptable standards has quadrupled since gérald tremblay the first mayor of post merger montreal proclaimed the city was embarking on massive road rehabilitation in the early 2000s montreal s latest estimate of its road maintenance deficit is 2 2 billion according to a city engineering report produced in 2016 the figure doesn t include the maintenance deficit for other infrastructure such as water mains and sewers advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in other words even after spending 2 3 billion on roadwork since the early 2000s the city as of 2016 still needed to spend another 2 2 billion to make up for past underinvestment and restore the road network to acceptable condition and that figure didn t include yearly preventive maintenance to keep newer infrastructure from prematurely wearing out but in an engineering report just five years earlier in 2011 the city had evaluated its road maintenance deficit at 543 million meanwhile a 1991 report said montreal evaluated its maintenance deficit for roads at 335 million so the maintenance deficit adjusted for inflation grew by 11 per cent in the two decades between 1991 and 2011 yet it leaped by another 400 per cent in the five years between 2011 and 2016 after the tremblay administration and its successors claimed they were investing like never before to renew montreal s aging network of local streets and arteries so what happened there was an increase in city spending on road repair under tremblay in 2004 albeit not nearly enough to chip away at the maintenance deficit it then flatlined in 2005 increased in 2006 and dropped in 2007 the spending then went up significantly in 2008 and 2009 just after the tremblay administration began outsourcing 100 per cent of roadwork to private firms following decades of the city splitting the work between municipal blue collar employees and private companies advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and then the city s spending on road repair crashed to below even the 2001 level of investment when montreal s scandals about contract rigging and collusion erupted in 2009 tremblay paused the awarding of construction contracts in november of that year while the city tightened its contract tendering rules the pause was short lived however and the city started issuing contracts again six months later in april 2010 but for some reason it took until 2016 for the city s roadwork spending to climb back to the level it had achieved in 2009 the audited numbers show by then the administration of another mayor denis coderre was midway through its four year term and while spending on roadwork has shot up since 2016 surpassing 2009 a lot of the additional money is going into cosmetic paving work rather than into major rehabilitation and reconstruction the work under the short and medium term programs that were brought in by coderre involves laying new asphalt over bad roads to make them comfortable while they await needed reconstruction in 2017 the coderre administration s capital spending plan dedicated 62 per cent of roadwork dollars to his short and medium term repair programs which plante s projet montréal party then in the opposition condemned as cosmetic and electoral paving advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content but in its first year in power in 2018 plante s administration upped the proportion of roadwork money going into the cosmetic paving programs to just over 70 per cent photo by john mahoney montreal gazette and for 2019 plante s latest capital works program forecasts more money will be spent on cosmetic work than on long lasting reconstruction and rehabilitation her administration says in its defence that it has created an additional program for 2019 that mixes roadwork with tree planting and street redesign such as sidewalk widening yet the city is planning to redo just 28 kilometres of road with this envelope at the same time the condition of the city s road network has deteriorated indeed markedly since the mid 2000s in 2005 for example the city said 14 per cent of its roads were in poor condition in 2012 that had risen to 21 per cent looking at the deterioration from the other end 61 per cent of roads were in good condition in 2006 that fell to 52 5 per cent in 2012 and then to 38 2 per cent in 2014 it plummeted further to 28 8 per cent in 2015 although that was the year the city started applying the province s more stringent criteria for evaluating a road s condition and the percentage of good roads has barely moved since then despite the substantially higher investments in cosmetic work since 2016 the proportion of good roads has hovered around 29 5 per cent for the past two years advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content so how is it possible for montreal to have a ballooning maintenance deficit and deteriorating roads even though it has invested 2 3 billion in repair for starters montreal roads like humans aren t getting any younger and 1 spent on make up and 1 spent on reconstructive surgery are not equal investments in fact the union representing montreal s municipal engineers says it s urging the city to use results such as the number of kilometres of road that are actually reconstructed from foundation to surface as year to year comparable targets rather than dollars yvan rheault president of the syndicat professionnel des scientifiques à pratique exclusive de montréal said if you make the objective to spend a dollar amount then you ll try to spend the money without trying to get value for it rheault said it s also common knowledge that postponing preventive maintenance and repairs only makes it more expensive to bring roads up to standards later it s like maintaining a house you can stop a small roof leak today with some new shingles or you can risk having to redo the whole roof and repair water damage later advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content meanwhile montreal doesn t even know how many kilometres of road it has repaired or rebuilt since 2002 the city was unable to answer a montreal gazette access to information request asking for that information the city also doesn t know or won t say how much it costs to fix a kilometre of road the city s blue collar union says hans marotte negotiator for local 301 of the canadian union of public employees says the union has repeatedly asked so it can make an economic argument for keeping some of that work in house but the the city hasn t given it an answer after the city began outsourcing all roadwork to private firms in the mid 2000s municipal employees were left with pothole filling he said but the city has since outsourced some of that work as well even though it costs more than in house marotte said the methodology how the gazette calculated roadwork spending another explanation for the mounting maintenance deficit may be in the quality of roadwork but the opportunity to investigate that angle was blown by the charbonneau commission former westmount mayor peter trent contends advertisement 10 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the commission which heard testimony from 2012 to 2014 about collusion and bid rigging on montreal construction contracts never probed the quality of the work that was done by colluding firms i ve always said if you can cheat on prices you can cheat on quality trent said of course another factor that may explain the mounting maintenance deficit is cost it costs more to do road and other construction work today than it did when montreal had the opportunity to catch up in the early 2000s indeed montreal s current assessment of something known as replacement cost suggests construction prices have exploded canadian municipal asset managers say replacement cost is based on current construction prices the capital works program puts the current replacement cost of montreal s road network at 16 billion photo by john mahoney montreal gazette however in 1991 montreal reported the replacement cost of what was then its 1 986 kilometre road network plus sidewalks bike paths overpasses tunnels and alleys was 2 5 billion even with the dollar figure doubled to reflect the expanded network in the post municipal merger era and adjusted for inflation the replacement cost would be 8 billion in today s dollars a long way from 16 billion advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and because the city is inconsistent in its presentation of roadwork figures it s impossible to peg when exactly the prices exploded for example in 2012 montreal s auditor general reported the replacement cost of montreal roads and sidewalks was 10 9 billion in 2010 that suggests a nearly 47 per cent increase in replacement cost between 2010 and 2018 even though montreal has claimed that prices on construction contracts have dropped by 20 to 30 per cent in the post charbonneau commission era but the city didn t disclose what other infrastructure such as sidewalks or tunnels it included as road network in its 2010 or 2018 figures the city said through a spokesperson that it s working on an optimal method to establish replacement costs however the city refused the montreal gazette s request to interview city engineer jean carrier the division chief who is responsible for managing the city s road network carrier also serves as chairman of a standing committee on above ground infrastructure for the centre d expertise et de recherche en infrastructures urbaines ceriu a quebec think tank on infrastructure that includes the construction industry municipalities provincial departments and universities it also declined the montreal gazette s interview request advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content one thing is apparent montreal s bad roads are good business for the construction industry in quebec more than a third of the 17 3 billion that was invested in large private and public construction projects on the island of montreal in 2017 was for roadwork and civil engineering projects figures compiled by the communauté métropolitaine de montréal for that year show in fact the 6 4 billion spent on roadwork and civil engineering in 2017 was double what was invested in residential projects according to the cmm the cmm excluded the cost of building the new champlain bridge from the figures indeed three publicly funded projects the new champlain bridge the turcot interchange redo and the city of montreal s never ending infrastructure work are driving the non residential construction sector in the greater montreal region the cmm s 2017 annual economic report says roadwork and civil engineering

lies the origin of the infrastructure maintenance deficit a term coined in the 1990s while canada was deep in recession going back to the great depression infrastructure spending has been used to create jobs and invigorate the economy just think of camillien houde s massive public works program in the 1930s which notably gave montreal its parisian style public urinals known as vespasiennes but in the 2000s the city is awarding contracts in a construction boom and what has the federal government contributed to all this not a cent for road repair though it has given grants to montreal to rehabilitate water infrastructure the provincial government contributed 98 3 million from the transfer of the federal excise tax on gasoline to montreal s road repair between 2014 and 2018 photo by allen mcinnis montreal gazette meanwhile the future of montreal s road network appears to be paved with billions more dollars in 2005 tremblay pledged the city would eliminate the road maintenance deficit in 2015 after which it would be able to spend much less per year for regular maintenance advertisement 14 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in 2016 coderre promised to eliminate the maintenance deficit for roads in five years and in 10 years for underground water and sewer infrastructure yet a five year intervention plan produced by montreal s civil service for internal use in 2016 and obtained by the montreal gazette this past november said that even if the city nearly tripled its total annual investment in its road water and sewer networks the massive spending increase would end montreal s roadwork maintenance deficit only around 2040 and it s as yet unclear what effect the shift to cosmetic paving work since then will have on montreal s maintenance deficit meanwhile the city under current mayor plante has made contradictory pronouncements about its objectives the city s 2019 2021 capital works program which plante presented with the 2019 operating budget in november states the city s investments aim to eliminate the maintenance deficit of the road aqueduct and sewer networks as well as regular maintenance and continuity of all of the water and road infrastructures to ensure an efficient level of service and sustainability of assets for future generations advertisement 15 story

administration introduced in 2006 by an average of 2 per household this year the 2019 budget justifies the hike this way investment is continually growing in recent years which will allow us to catch up on the deficit in investment in water and road infrastructure in order to maintain the momentum the revenue raised from the special water and road taxes are increased for 2019 nevertheless plante s new capital works program actually forecasts slightly lower investment in roadwork in 2019 after the city s all time high in 2018 so the city is increasing the road tax to do less roadwork apparently more is less when it comes to montreal roads one week after presenting the 2019 budget the plante administration announced the city was changing strategy it would do less repaving but said it was in an effort to focus more on redeveloping streetscapes and not add more detours it means montrealers will have to wait 10 years instead of five years as promised by coderre for the quality of the road network to reach the national average it said advertisement 16 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content however the national average for road deterioration is a neologism for a city that for decades promised to eliminate the maintenance deficit and bring roads up to acceptable standards perhaps this is montreal s tacit admission that it will carry on perpetuating the maintenance deficit it s not like the city was never warned about what it was doing montreal s auditor general lambasted the tremblay administration in his 2012 annual report for perpetually underinvesting in roadwork the budget for infrastructure repair on the arterial road system remains insufficient to meet all needs the auditor at the time jacques bergeron wrote no matter what scenario is advanced we note an underinvestment in the system and this drives the investment deficit higher every year bergeron also concluded the city had no structured preventive maintenance program as such the consequences of this underinvestment will be very serious in the years to come if the situation is not rectified because the number of roads and sidewalks in poor condition will increase and more extensive work will be required not just because of the types of work involved but also because of the costs what is more this situation is likely to have major disruptive effects for the public advertisement 17 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the chronic underinvestment bergeron

economy that has been performing well overall said the bank meanwhile consumption spending and housing investment have been weaker than expected as housing markets adjust to municipal and provincial measures changes to mortgage guidelines and higher interest rates household spending will be dampened further by slow growth in oil producing provinces craig alexander deloitte canada s chief economist told several hundred housing executives at a bild calgary region dinner last week that he expected the bank s decision this came as no surprise because financial markets had priced out any rate hike in january in the wake of the tumble in oil and in light of the volatility of the stock market in december said alexander the bank of canada said it still believes that they will ultimately need to move interest rates back to what they consider to be neutral i would argue that the neutral for canada is actually the bottom of that range most forecasters were forecasting the bank of canada would take the overnight rate up to two and a half percent in 2019 and i don t think they re going to get there i think ultimately by the time we get towards the end of this year i think they re going to realize the economy isn t as strong and i think we re going to get a half of a point increase in interest rates this year and i think there s a growing case that they remain on hold advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content a small increase or keeping the rate on hold is good news for prospective home buyers because rising rates make the mortgage stress test more severe alexander expects the national economy to level out we are going to see businesses outside the energy patch investing more because capacity utilization is running at very high levels he said i think we are going to see exports benefitting from a weak canadian dollar but fundamentally the exports and investment can t pick up the slack in the moderation in housing and consumer spending and that s why economic growth drops down to less than two percent last fall alexander had high expectations for the alberta economy as december unfolded i got less enthused he said my forecast for alberta was for growth of 2 3 percent basically neck and neck with b c for the fastest rate of economic growth but now alberta is below the middle of the pack of provinces in terms of growth advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content alexander updated his forecast because of oil the drop in oil prices and oil production curtailment knocks alberta s economic growth rate down from 2 3 percent to about 1 3 percent he said the production curtailment has had the desired impact in narrowing the spread between west texas intermediate wti crude and western canada select wcs prices however what we re talking about is real gross domestic product gross domestic product is the value of all the goods and services we produce the real gdp strips off prices if you put in place an oil production curtailment you reduce the production in order to lose the crisis when you boost the prices but you cut the production you lower your real gdp because it doesn t capture price affects so ultimately the curtailment combined with lower oil prices will constrain

in 2015 2016 said alexander i think prices have already started to dip but one thing that limits the impact of prices is what will be happening to listings as listings drop it will constrain new

of the federal government entered its fourth week saturday making it the longest on record from jobs to food stamps an impasse over border security has put large swaths of the economy in jeopardy a short term shutdown does not usually have a big economic effect said donald moynihan chair of the mccourt school of public policy at georgetown university but at this point we are looking at the longest shutdown in the modern era we should be worried growth is expected to slip business activity was already expected to expand at a slower rate in coming months but economists have further lowered estimates for quarterly gross domestic product or the total value of the nation s goods and services since the shutdown began federal workers missed paychecks that were due this week a development that will complicate the lives of more than 800 000 and that threatens to weigh on gross domestic product advertisement congress approved a bill friday that ensures back pay for furloughed employees but it must still be signed into law and would not be distributed until after the shutdown ends in the meantime reduced income will weigh on consumer spending which accounts for about 70 of economic activity maybe you can make up for one missed paycheck said brad setser who served as a white house and treasury department economist in the obama administration but the longer the shutdown goes on the harder it is for the government workforce to keep up with spending lower consumption will also hit the private sector which faces its own direct risks from the shutdown uncertainty can delay investment a lack of regulatory oversight can chip away at consumer confidence and those who rely on federal services can lose customers hotels may start seeing fewer customers who don t want to spend their time in trash strewn national parks or dealing with long lines at airports moynihan said if you shut down one sector of the economy you quickly learn how connected it is to other parts advertisement employment could fall for the first time since 2010 with about 380 000 workers placed on unpaid leave while a series of government agencies are closed the wall street journal reported the shutdown could upend the longest stretch of continuous job growth in history since monthly payroll growth has averaged at about 215 000 over the past five years the shutdown could in january cause overall employment to fall for the first time in 99 months the disruption is also making it more difficult to keep an eye on the labor market for instance economists don t know why applications for unemployment benefits fell significantly more than expected this week we don t know if the consensus was high because forecasters believe that the trend in claims has risen or because they feared a big hit from the government shutdown ian sheperdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics said in an email the uncertainty means that it probably would be sensible to view these numbers as an unreliable guide to the underlying pace of layoffs advertisement a lapse in data has created uncertainty with large portions of the department of commerce closed some information on the state of the economy won t be released during the shutdown many economists have forecast a recession could begin within the next two years and a lack of data could fan fears about the possibility of a crisis it will also become more difficult for americans to understand what s happening in the economy putting businesses at a disadvantage farmers who have already been reeling from the us china trade war for instance are working without key figures on monthly international shipments trade statistics weren t going to turn things said william tyner an agricultural economist at purdue university but data is certainly better than no data what farmers are going to have to do now is place bets on trade negotiations understanding the economy has become more difficult the federal reserve could have trouble getting an accurate reading of business conditions as the shutdown threatens to distort key economic figures that comes at an already uncertain time for officials there whose rate path has been shifting in light of stock market turbulence a global trade war and fading stimulus advertisement the tricky thing will be figuring out whether the dips in the numbers are just transitory effects of the shutdown or portend a more persistent deceleration in the pace of economic activity said ken kuttner a former staff economist at the central bank and making that distinction is especially important right now since there were already some hints of a slowdown us creditworthiness has been called into question a prolonged shutdown could lead to a credit downgrade for the us making it more expensive for americans to borrow with mounting doubt about the government s ability to resolve short and long term challenges major credit rating agency fitch ratings warned this week that the us could lose its aaa status if lawmakers fail to pass a budget and manage the debt ceiling the more the dysfunctional the us government looks the more likely it is that bond agencies will become tempted to downgrade its creditworthiness moynihan said advertisement the housing market could falter an already soft spot in an otherwise robust economy additional obstacles in the housing market would likely leave economists concerned residential real estate activity has been cooling off as tax laws reduced construction activity and higher interest rates compound housing shortages across the country the longer this shutdown lasts the more the momentum be extracted from the spring market the annual super bowl of the housing market said jonathan miller a real estate appraiser at miller samuel inc housing is already showing weakness in a growing number of regions and this uncertainty only accelerates the trend mortgage applicants could also face longer wait times especially for loans that require income verification through the internal revenue service according to a national association of realtors analysis of a 16 day government shutdown in 2013 nearly a fifth of home loan deals were affected since the current shutdown is longer we could see more loans impacted due to bigger backlogs said mark fleming chief economist at first american advertisement inequality could get worse

in the us receive some form of federal rental assistance with many of them providing for children the elderly or those with disabilities federal contracts for more than 1 000 government funded properties for these renters have expired due to the shutdown nbc news reported this week should the shutdown continue landlords may move to evict tenants and the most vulnerable households in the country will suffer ingrid gould ellen a professor of urban policy and planning at new york university moreover even if they don t evict tenants in the longer run landlords may be less willing to

a top beverage manufacturer torched a storm recently when it sought to sell its products in united states dollars the government intervened resulting in the firm reverting back to a multi currency charge lately industry has been showing a subtle appetite to charge in us dollars while civil servants are exerting pressure on government to be paid in hard currency here the herald s senior writer elliot ziwira ez speaks to zimbabwe national chamber of commerce zncc vice president for mashonaland region archie dongo ad who provided an insight into recent decisions by firms and the impact of redollarisation on the economy below are excerpts of the interview ez what is your reading of zimbabwe s economic outlook in view of some suppliers and retailers demands for payment in us dollars ad based on the reform intentions of the government as encapsulated in the tsp document there is reason for optimism as some of the fundamentals requiring attention including currency reform are highlighted we look forward to its full implementation current demands for payment in united states dollars in the absence of a legal mechanism for business entities to charge in us dollars or exchange rtgs for us dollars are negatively impacting the business sector s outlook should this be addressed the outlook is likely to improve as viability will be enhanced this has however been highlighted to regulators and we are certain measures will be put in place to facilitate trade ez sentiment is rife that the economy is self redollarising are the heightened calls for redollarisation likely to speed up the process ad it appears the market is beginning to spontaneously redollarise as there is a perception that it is more advantageous to hold us dollars rather than bond or rtgs the heightened calls are perhaps a symptom of this spontaneous redollarisation which took root soon after the separation of bank accounts into nostro and rtgs a few months ago ez considering that us dollars are not printed in zimbabwe and few companies are exporting what should be done to increase foreign currency inflows ad increased foreign currency inflows can be achieved through a sustained increase in production by the private sector in mining agriculture manufacturing tourism and services with particular attention paid to import substitution to reduce the current 50 to 60 percent import content in local products tourism is particularly interesting in this regard as we have been ranked as a must see destination in 2019 by various international destination ranking agencies and publications a major focus on increasing exports further from the current us 6 billion is also necessary one way of doing this is by shifting to the export of value added products from our mining and agricultural sectors where we have the advantage of natural resource abundance as shown by the continued discovery of new minerals such as lithium the level of reserves of the known exploitable minerals as well as our ability to grow organic produce without much hindrance can also be considered it is important that we invest the forex that we are currently earning in production which will enhance exports and increase forex inflows in the future it is also imperative that we as the business sector become outward looking in order to exploit opportunities in the region considering the existence of arrangements such as the african continental free trade area and the tripartite free trade area it is important for the business sector to engage in more trade investigations in regional countries it is in light of this that zncc continues to organise trade delegations to countries such as rwanda and mauritius that are highly ranked in africa in terms of ease of doing business ez parallel market rates are known to respond to any jitters in the market what is your reading of the unofficial market s response to calls for redollarisation ad it is difficult to fathom or predict the influences and responses of the parallel market as it is arguably a grey market whose operations are under the radar however legal regulated trading of foreign currencies will likely reduce its influence on the formal economy rendering it inconsequential ez zimra made a pronouncement that businesses charging in foreign currency should pay their taxes in forex duty especially for vehicles is also paid in us dollars what is your comment on that ad tax and forex payments in us dollars seem to contradict the multi currency policy that has obtained since 2009 however regard must be paid to the labour pressures for payment in us dollars that the government is facing this is perhaps another indicator of the process of redollarisation while the tax authority would like to collect us dollars formal business requires an enabling legal framework to charge in us dollars without falling afoul of recently promulgated laws on parallel market transactions if this is not done paying tax in us dollars may in some instances become evidence of illegality ez in your view is it sustainable for government to keep on supporting industry with foreign currency ad it is in the interest of any government to support the development of its business sector as statistics the world over indicate the success of private sector driven economies the sustainability of this support is however determined by the nature of the support and its impact on the business environment for instance subsidies that overburden the fiscus tend to backfire after some time and negatively affect the operations of the very industries that were supported ez fuel is a cost driver in business and there is sentiment that if prices are increased or petroleum products are charged in us dollars or alternatively government allows market forces to determine prices availability may improve what is your take on that ad it is a generally accepted principle that any product whose price is regarded as being low in comparison to its value will experience an increase in demand rationing that demand can be achieved through raising the price so if fuel price is raised this will improve availability for those that can afford the new price level as a nation we have to move towards market determined prices at some point ez and what is likely to happen in costs and subsequently prices regimes ad any increase in the price of fuel will need to be factored into the cost the goods being traded in proportion to how much fuel contributes to the entity s cost build up
you shouldn t worry too much about the big u s stock market sell off you should worry about china s instead indeed while it might not have gotten as much attention china s benchmark stock index was with its 25 percent drop the world s worst performing in 2018 part of this was because of the fear that president donald trump s nascent trade war might turn into something even more serious but only a part more significant than what washington d c was doing was what beijing was up to that s because in what has seemingly become an every other year tradition recently china s government has stepped on the economic brakes pretty hard in an attempt to put an end to what looks like some bubbly behavior the important thing to understand here is that in the depths of the great recession beijing unleashed a stimulus the likes of which the world hadn t seen since world war ii it amounted to some 19 percent of its gross domestic product according to columbia university historian adam tooze by point of comparison president barack obama s stimulus was only about five percent or six percent of u s gdp aside from its size what made china s stimulus unique was the way it was administered the central government didn t borrow a lot of money itself to use on infrastructure but it pushed local governments and state owned companies to do so the result was a web of debt that s been even harder to clean up than it might have been because of all the money that unregulated lenders shadow banks were frantically handing out above and beyond what beijing had been hoping for the challenge then has been for beijing to stop even more debt from turning this boom into a bust without stopping the boom in the first place in other words to navigate the economy between the scylla of a bubble and the charybdis of a severe slowdown not that this is new it s what the chinese communist party has had to do ever since it substituted ever increasing prosperity for marxist leninist ideology as the basis of its legitimacy and the good news insofar as both beijing and the world economy are concerned is that it s become exceedingly efficient at it as bloomberg news noah smith points out china has managed to avoid a recession for 25 years in large part because of the government s novel use of credit policy directing banks when and how much to lend to smooth out the usual ups and downs of the business cycle what is new though is that this isn t working quite as well as before as the international monetary fund reports china seems to have reached a point of diminishing returns with this kind of credit stimulus so much new debt is either going toward paying off old debt or toward economically questionable projects that it takes a lot more of it than it used to just to achieve the same amount of growth three times as much in fact whereas it had only taken 6 5 trillion yuan of new credit to make china s economy grow by 5 trillion yuan per year in 2008 it took 20 trillion yuan of new credit by 2016 which is why beijing has had to resort to even more old fashioned stimulus such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending in particular it recently announced a new wave of subway construction around shanghai and hangzhou to try to keep growth above the six percent that the party thinks it needs to keep people from protesting the global economy needs it too apple for one already has revised its revenue projections down because of soft sales in the middle kingdom and wall street thinks the rest of the fortune 500 won t be far behind although even that doesn t give you a true sense of how much the world has come to depend on chinese growth to get a better idea of that it helps to look at a financial times chart of crude steel production consider this between 1978 when it began its market changes and 2000 china s share of world steel production increased from 4 4 percent to 15 1 percent this was as far as economic development goes a fairly typical success story that saw china s production nearly match north america s what s happened since though has no precedent in economic history china s steel production didn t plateau like everyone else s it grew to the point that it now makes up 49 2 percent of the world s total to put that in perspective europe and north america together went from making 2 5 times more steel than china in 2000 to china making three times more steel than them in 2017 it s long been said that when the united states sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold it s been a long time since china has sneezed but with its industrial profits falling for the first time in three years and its car sales dropping for the first time in nearly 30 years we might find out just how sick it can make everyone else that s one chinese export we don t want bloomberg workers prepare to lift bundles of steel rod with a crane at a stockyard on the outskirts of shanghai in july china made three times more steel than europe and north america in 2017
we have seen a substantial flow of foreign workers remittances over the past 5 years the number is very impressive at over us 94bn and the growth trend is continuing albeit at a slower pace which is understandable as the remittance gap between the formal and informal channel is narrowing at the same time the gap between remittances and exports are also narrowing down on our external account this makes the importance of remittances more and more critical than the past the remittances growth hitherto has largely been god sent the sector needs baby sitting and pampering to ensure that this growth trend continues focusing on remittances doesn t mean that we don t address the outstanding structural issues and constraints faced by our exports sector which in fact is more important than remittances in many ways and the present government has already realized this and started taking policy decisions in extending the necessary subsidies to the exporters there s an argument on the other hand that our export sector has been behaving like trust fund baby and it s about time that they stand up on their own two feet but that s a debate for some other time in this write up we re focusing on remittances from non resident pakistanis nrps the current worker remittances have essentially been consumption driven which can be verified from their constant growth and inelasticity with both interest and exchange rates which moved in both the directions during the last 4 5 years but there has been a consistent growth in remittances while there s substantial room for improvement to attract further consumption driven remittances which are still being routed through non banking channels by mobilizing foreign banks and more so foreign operations of the large local banks capturing these enhanced flows are largely have to do with the large local banks being not focused on this business and going an extra mile in attracting these remittances from the non banking channels let s dissect the causes of preference of remittances from the non banking sector this is identified that the cost of transaction speed security of funds geographic proximity accessibility convenience in terms of familiarity and language are the primary factors which attract the remitter towards the non banking options the attractiveness of formal and informal channels varies greatly across these factors siddiqui and abrar 2003 find that costs of informal channels in bangladesh are about 45 percent of formal costs costs in the informal sector are about 2 5 percent of the amount sent while costs in the formal sector are on an average about 10 20 percent available empirical evidence also supports the second assumption the elasticity of total remittances sent or received with respect to costs is very low aggregate remittances will therefore depend on wages in the host economy income in the source economy and the total number of migrants dual fx regime and remittance costs vis a vis average size of the remittance are the two factors which drives the gulf between the informal channels and the formal channels of workers remittances cost reduction could be usefully pursued through measures to enhance competition in the banking sector promote financial development and reduce exchange rate volatility this is about time that the banks must look into the possibility of sharing passing on the benefits of direct and indirect subsidies income streams float income fx conversion spreads gop s direct rebate with the end remitter and make the overall proposition of remittances through the banking channel more attractive for both the banks and the remitter the play shall be on volumes rather than margins for the banks informal or non banking channels are typically faster and more convenient as they are not constrained by banking and foreign exchange regulations and often work in close proximity to their clients and frequently provide door to door services an element of intimidation to deal with the bankers formal set up also plays up on the minds of blue collar worker which is a large population of pakistan workers abroad particularly in ksa and gcc this is assumed that the existing consumption driven remittances could actually be doubled through the official channels within a period of 2 3 years if the foreign operations of the large local banks and the relevant government departments ministries work in close collaboration with each other a close alliance and working relationship is absolutely critical between different ministries departments of the government of pakistan gop including ministry of finance mof pakistan remittance initiative pri state bank of pakistan sbp overseas pakistani foundation opf central directorate of national savings cdns ministry of labor and manpower foreign ministry etc to enhance the consumption driven remittances following ideas could be considered 1 to begin with pri shall be given more visibility and importance pri shall be declared atleast a wing of the finance division and shall be manned with the best talent in the market 2 setting up community centers in the large ethnic pakistani populated cities including cities in ksa the uk the usa uae oman qatar etc to primarily target the blue collar workers remittances from gcc adds up to almost 2 3rd of the total worker remittances of pakistan the research says that one of the identified reasons for the blue collar workers to use the non banking channel is that they feel intimidated going to the bank and dealing with strangers or sophisticated individuals these blue collar workers find the whole ambiance of the bank overwhelming at times on the other hand the money changed hundi hawala facilitator comes to the door step of nrp to collect the money and remit it back home there are no remittance forms documentation to be filled in which is obviously a big help but poses a serious risk of fraud some cases recently been reported the local banks should be motivated to set up infrastructure develop pakistani community centers instead of full fledged branches jointly with opf and perhaps with cdns these centers should consist of restaurants foodmarts entertainment e g ethnic films tv programs musical events theater spiritual events etc opf has a specific mandate and adequate resources to set up these community centers there maybe some community centers already existing which probably are not been managed leveraged to the fullest potential and could be revived for the purpose the idea is to have a strong alliance between the banks and the opf to manage these community centers to attract pakistani blue collar worker traffic which otherwise avoid going to the bank making the whole experience of remittances for them convenient and pleasurable through these centers leveraging community infrastructure for cross sell opportunities for the local banks which can result in building nrp customer base deposit mobilization asset building e g mortgage financing against pledged remittances etc building brand image bringing a step closer to opening foreign branches is an incentive enough for the banks particularly the provincial banks to pursue this joint venture proposition with opf according to the bureau of emigration and overseas employment after punjab 58 kpk represents the 2nd biggest registered overseas work force of 32 sindh and balochistan are far behind at 9 and 1 respectively this data helps us figure out that if we mobilize our provincial banks particularly bank of punjab and bank of kyber with some specific targets than they could be most suited to attract these flows internationally 3 rolling out remitter investor education program the nrps need to be educated about the benefits of the remittances through the banking official channels overall costs benefits tax breaks in case of investments security official track record etc this education must be conducted through written literature and propagating in the media both electronic and print the above proposed community centers will also prove to be a great platform for such education 4 the gop sbp must encourage opening of smart branches of pakistani banks at the pakistani dominated populated areas globally with specific focus of enhancing the nrp remittance flows if branch es already exist then make the dedicated service desks mandatory to facilitate remittances from these international branches of local banks 5 the gop mof should seriously consider offering tax breaks fiscal incentives to the banks on the income earned through the incremental remittances this formula incentive plan must be devised in such a way that the risk of cannibalization in existing remittances amongst the local banks does not happened 6 there already an existing provincial bank in azad jammu and kashmir ajk this bank may need to be recapitalized albeit to the requisite minimum amount and rejuvenated into of a fully dedicated technology driven bank to penetrate into the remittances from the affluent ajk ethnic community based globally but particularly in the uk this bank will not only help in the economic uplift of ajk but also help in channelizing the remittances through the official channels which may currently been diverted through the non banking informal sources due to lack of dedicated banking facilities at both ends of the remittance equation origination and termination while the number of ajk expats may not be too large in number but surely they are high end in terms of amounts transaction value therefore more sophisticated remittance solution fits in well with their profile needs 7 tap into the existing nrp community groups associations and nrp owned restaurants retail centers to educate the community on the benefits of using banking official channels the nrp owned restaurants retail centers can be used as technology driven point of remittances in alliance with the large local banks primarily using phone banking internet banking etc subject to of course regulatory approvals implementation timeline each initiative consumption driven there is an immediate need is to come up with investment saving products which will provide a medium to long term sustainable foreign currency flows to the country the current government is already working on two of such options the one off pakistan banao certificate and the other is a program by national savings called overseas pakistanis savings certificates both these products will go a very long way in terms of attracting savings inflows from nrps the other investment products that the government could consider are 1 gop has already rolled out the plan for privatization they may consider secondary market offering shares of public sector entities pses in oil and gas and financial sectors in particular international investors have fairly large interest in these scripts shares the whole idea is to make these secondary market offerings dedicated for nrps these offerings will be done in small denominations to encourage small investor to participate and become the owner of their own pses the objective is to spread the holding of pses all across the masses particularly to the small investors within pakistan and outside similar instruments were issued by the uk germany and other european countries in 80s and 90s while privatizing their pses this initiative will also help in increasing the much needed depth and breadth in pakistan stock exchange 2 encourage mutual funds to arrange road shows internationally to attract investment in foreign currency through a scra account and allow them to launch foreign currency hedged funds especial incentives tax related or otherwise could be offered on the income earned from the sale of these mutual funds to the international investors nrps 3 the option of retail bond sukuk structured against the future workers remittances is always there however this option poses a very high risk of cannibalization of future savings driven inflows and additionally this kind of bond sukuk is better suited for the institutional investors while we re focusing discussing on tapping the retail investor base implementation timeline each initiative investment savings enhancement in worker remittances is the only viable option available for the government to meet its current account shortfalls in the short to medium term exports are being promoted with various policy actions however our export sector is confronted with some structural issues like lack of value addition and dependence on few sectors and products we re virtually a three product exporting country which will take some time to address at least medium to long term in the meantime worker remittances remain the most promising option to pursue to fund our chronic current account deficit and shall be given the importance accordingly author is a freelance consultant former dg national

opinion hey there time traveller this article was published 11 01 2019 1912 days ago so information in it may no longer be current the economic times they are a changing for the past two years governments in this country have enjoyed a period of relative economic stability although we haven t seen the growth and accompanying revenues experienced in the early 2000s since the 2016 election of manitoba s current progressive conservative majority government the economy has been pretty solid but that seems to be changing now most economic think tanks and bank economists are downgrading forecasts for economic growth in manitoba and across the country in the current and subsequent fiscal years manitoba premier brian pallister is holding fast to the cost containment strategy his government has employed since being elected in 2016 david lipnowski canadian press files in relative terms manitoba s economy is expected to continue to grow at about the national average which reinforces the underlying strength of a diversified economy but that average will be considerably lower in the coming years consider that in 2017 premier brian pallister s first full year in office real gdp in manitoba grew by 2 6 per cent that was a remarkable bit of good fortune which provided the premier with more revenue growth than had been seen in the previous three years when real gdp growth averaged slightly more than 1 5 per cent in dollar terms a one point difference in gdp cannot be understated according to statistics canada in 2017 the value of manitoba s economy grew to more than 71 billion an increase of 3 6 billion from 2016 that year over year increase was double the increase seen in the previous two fiscal years when the economy grew by a total of only 3 1 billion at the same time pallister received a huge annual windfall in transfer payments in the current year equalization alone is expected to go up by 218 million the previous year pallister s first in power manitoba received 217 million more compare that to the previous seven years of ndp government when equalization payments went up by a total of 67 million good times indeed but they appear to be coming to an end real gdp growth in manitoba is expected to come in at close to two per cent for the current year in the next two years it is expected to hover around 1 5 per cent transfer payment growth could continue but the loss of nearly a point of gdp growth will have significant effects on manitoba s own source revenue and thus the effectiveness of pallister s current fiscal policy as most manitobans know pallister wants to balance the budget to create the fiscal wiggle room to cut the provincial sales tax by one point a core pledge from his 2016 election campaign that one tax expenditure will cost the treasury in excess of 300 million a gargantuan reduction in own source revenues that would be challenging at any time but particularly challenging at a time when the economy and government revenue growth are stalling what has the pc government s response been to date for the most part an ever tightening belt in speeches to business forums the premier has frequently admitted that he actually keeps a running count of the number of times that news outlets one news outlet in particular use the word austerity to describe his fiscal policy of course he refutes the notion that there is anything austere about his approach to managing finances but the numbers tell a different story since the pcs came to power provincial expenditures have grown at a rate well below the dual impacts of inflation and population growth the austerity has been particularly evident in health care and education where the government has chronically underspent even on its own restrained annual funding increases last year pallister promised to increase health spending by 3 2 per cent but after all the numbers were counted the actual hike was about 0 9 per cent the winnipeg regional health authority the largest provider of health care services in the province only spent about 200 000 more than it did a year earlier a fiscal strategy that has meant modest increases in wait times for most elective surgeries the effect of austerity can also be felt in other areas of government spending including infrastructure in december the manitoba heavy construction association declared open war on the pallister government over precipitous cuts to spending on roads since coming to power the tory government has cut total spending on roads from 588 million in the last year of ndp government to just 350 million in the 2018 19 budget the drastic cut in spending on basic infrastructure is accompanied by a series of decisions to cancel or indefinitely delay other government capital projects including new consolidated headquarters for the manitoba liquor and lotteries corp and an expansion of the club regent casino pallister has made it clear that he finds projects such as this wasteful and unnecessary and it s true that none of the capital projects he has spiked fall into the category of needs for taxpayers they are wants in almost every definition of the word unless you are an architect an engineer a construction contractor or tradesperson pallister s strategy on infrastructure is particularly concerning because the biggest government funded capital projects in the history of the province the bipole iii transmission line and keeyask generating station are either completed or winding down bipole iii was actually finished last year the new north south transmission line cost 4 7 billion more than double the original 2 2 billion estimate the same goes for keeyask originally estimated to cost 3 7 billion manitoba hydro has said the project will be completed in 2020 for 8 7 billion pallister s main concern about these two projects has been the cost overruns and to that end he has hired former british columbia premier gordon campbell to conduct a review of how things got so out of control however while he seeks accountability for the blown budgets he should also be concerned about what will happen to manitoba s economy when both projects are completed economists and bond raters for years have been lauding the net positive impact of bipole iii and keeyask on gdp there is really no legitimate way to justify the inflated costs of the two projects but knowing that they will soon no longer be providing a baseline of economic activity one would think the premier might at least tweak his fiscal policy to account for the downward pressure on gdp you might think that but you would probably be wrong winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement the premier has made it clear to his caucus and staff that he is not about to abandon his course of action expenditures will continue to grow in an austere manner that is increases that are well below the joint impact of population growth and inflation to balance the budget and create the fiscal resources to cut the pst pallister will likely claim the cut in pst will in and of itself spur economic growth but it will not and all the evidence you need to prove that point can be seen in the united states where massive corporate tax cuts have essentially had no effect on the broader economy the premier has his strategy and he s going to ride it all the way through to the next election in 2020 and likely beyond given that he is the overwhelming favourite to win re election a fairly robust economy in the last two years has helped pallister move all the needles in the right direction however as the economy slows the premier may find his austere course is less part of a solution and more a net contributor to a much bigger problem dan lett freepress mb ca
this morning s key headlines from generationaldynamics com huawei plans to become world s biggest smartphone supplier as it introduce huawei p smart 2019 poland arrests huawei employee on spying allegations chinese economic expert xiang songzuo warns that economy shows signs of crashing xiang s headline statistic at most 1 67 percent gdp rate of growth china s five phases of consumption major misjudgments about china s economy huawei plans to become world s biggest smartphone supplier as it introduce huawei p smart 2019 huawei p smart 2019 huawei wha way has surpassed apple as the world s second largest smartphone supplier behind samsung but aims to become the largest with the introduction of a new low cost smartphone the huawei p smart 2019 selling for around 200 it includes a number of features that once would have appeared only in much more expensive smartphones including a dual camera array face unlocking fingerprint scanning and ai in the camera app to identify what you are shooting it uses the huawei s powerful kirin chipset giving it more power and performance than even more expensive competitive devices its only disappointment according to reviewers is that the camera isn t as powerful as those on competitive phones i have spent a part of my career as a senior software engineer developing chip level operating system software for embedded systems so i know exactly how any chip or any electronic device can be turned into a tool for espionage furthermore i can tell you that not only is it doable it is not even particularly difficult for someone with the right skills this could not be detected by tests because the chip would work normally until a backdoor is activated by receiving say a secret 1024 bit code then it will execute commands sent to it by chinese engineers thus the chinese are then in control of any devices with huawei chips and it cannot be detected until it is too late and since huawei founder ren zhengfei was previously an officer and engineer in china s people s liberation army pla there is little question that these steps have been taken china s biggest natural resource is its population of 1 4 billion china sends them overseas to work or get educated and controls them by the united front work department ufwd china s officials even call them secret weapons china s fleet of fishing boats in the south china sea and east china sea have crews that have been trained by the military for espionage and even to fight in battle this is how china works and now china s huawei is launching low cost smartphones to be purchased by the millions around the world and which can be controlled by china s military at the right time as i have written in detail in the past if huawei really wants to convince westerners that their products do not contain secret backdoors then they should invite american and western engineers to work side by side with chinese engineers in development centers in china so that american engineers can examine all the internal code and scripts just as chinese workers work in development centers in america expert reviews and idc 11 2 2018 and bloomberg related articles poland arrests huawei employee on spying allegations poland s internal security agency isa has arrested two individuals one is a chinese national going by the name weijing w or stanislaw wang who works as a sales director for huawei in poland the other is a polish national piotr d a former high ranking officer of poland s isa both were charged with spying against poland for china isa officers raided the homes of both suspects on tuesday morning they also seized documents and electronic data from the offices of huawei and mobile phone operator orange polska where piotr d had worked recently this comes after the december arrest by the canadian police at the request of the united states of ms meng wanzhou sabrina meng the chief financial officer cfo of china s huawei technologies which was founded by her father ren zhengfei according to reports china has retaliated by arresting as many 13 canadian citizens at the same time many european countries are becoming more aggressive at prohibiting the use of huawei technology since it might have backdoors that permit espionage or control this is increasingly becoming a more serious tit for tat escalation of actions that shows no sign of ending and may spiral into something much bigger related articles chinese economic expert xiang songzuo warns that economy shows signs of crashing in a speech given in early december by professor xiang songzuo deputy director and senior fellow of the center for international monetary research at china s renmin university in beijing he said you can look at the history only the wall street crash of 1929 can compare to the steep decline that the chinese stock has experienced this year many stocks are down 80 or even 90 percent in his speech xiang backed up his concerns with numerous facts and figures such speeches are normally dismissed but in this case the speech has so alarmed chinese officials that it was banned from the internet though it was translated into english and posted outside of china before it was banned furthermore a number of financial firms are taking xiang s conclusions very seriously as many problems as the u s economy has china s economy is much worse because of real estate bubbles ghost towns shadow banks and a hugely leveraged credit bubble that could crash at any time while i can make a general statement like that xiang has backed up those concerns with specifics many people believe that since china is a communist dictatorship they cannot have a recession because the chinese communist party ccp will control the economy enough to prevent it it does not work that way like every socialist economy china s economy was headed for disaster until it was opened to free markets in the 1970 80s in fact every socialist economy has either opened up to free markets to some extent or ended in disaster and massive bloodshed today only venezuela and north korea have refused to open up to free markets and both of those are disasters with bloodshed in the future china today is subject to the same market forces and the same generational forces as every other country people fool themselves into believing that politicians can actually change things in china only the politics will be different but the outcomes will be the same china change 28 dec 2018 and national interest and naked capitalism and don tai 29 dec 2018 xiang s headline statistic at most 1 67 percent gdp rate of growth the headline statistic in xiang s speech is his claim that china s gdp rate of growth is at most 1 67 percent or may even be negative china s official national bureau of statistics claims that china s rate of gdp growth is at 6 5 percent this one statistic alone could explain why the ccp felt it necessary to censor xiang s speech nobody is surprised that china lies about statistics mao zedong lied about agricultural statistics during the great leap forward in 1958 59 with the result that tens of millions of chinese died from starvation or were executed the problem is that you can lie about statistics only for a while and then reality causes a financial crisis which is what xiang is predicting since the ccp can pump money into any business at will it would seem that any financial crisis can be prevented the problem is that any business that can count on being bailed out has no motivation to become efficient and so loses money xiang says that this has happened with almost all chinese businesses look at our profit structure to put it plainly china s listed companies don t really make money then who has taken the few profits made by china s more than 3 000 listed companies two thirds have been taken by the banking sector and real estate the profits earned by 1 444 listed companies on the sme board and growth enterprise board are not even equal to one and half times the profit of the industrial and commercial bank of china how can this kind of stock market become a bull market when we buy stocks we are buying the profits of the company not hype and rumors i recently read a report comparing the profits of china s listed companies with those in the u s there are many u s public companies with tens of billions dollars in profits how many chinese tech and manufacturing companies are there that have accomplished this there is only one but it s not listed and you all know which one that is what does this tell us xiang says that there are major risks in the economy and major battles to be fought china s economic decline indicates that there is a major issue with the focus on expansion and growth it has deviated from the fundamental and moved to speculation what are our current financial risks they are hidden complex acute contagious and malevolent structural imbalance are massive and violations of law and regulations are rampant we have rampant speculations everywhere in too many aspects according to xiang basically china s economy is all built on speculation and everything is over leveraged this is significant because when a company is over leveraged then when there is an economic downturn it will not be able to meet its debt payments if every company is like that then when one company goes bankrupt it will create a chain reaction that sends every company into bankruptcy this is the basis of xiang s statement that china s stock market is facing a huge crash greater than america s 1929 crash china s five phases of consumption according to xiang in the four decades following economic reform china has undergone five phases of consumption solve the food problem the new big three short for refrigerator color tv and washing machine consumption of information automobiles real estate according to xiang but these five waves have essentially all come to an end car sales have dropped sharply and real estate spending is also substantially decreasing so we are facing serious problems this is the crux of the six stabilities called for by the politburo or as some internet users have joked the six tender kisses xiang says that china made a historic mistake by relying on consumption look at these numbers that china faces a long term economic downturn is not a problem by itself but you may have noticed that the consumption and the service sectors now make up 78 5 percent of gdp going by the government s logic this should be a good thing since it means the economic transition to a consumption economy has been successful we used to rely on investment and export now we rely on consumption and the service sector this sounds reasonable but think about it in a country like china as investment slows dramatically how can we maintain economic stability by solely relying on consumption xiang says that consumption and services comprise 78 5 percent of gdp which is good news to some extent but it is far eclipsed by negative implications of low investment major misjudgments about china s economy xiang says that in the past year china has made major misjudgments about the economy the first misjudgment was vastly underestimating the negative effects of the us china trade war on china first the trade war between china and the u s did we make some inaccurate assessment did we underestimate the severity of the situation let s recall some slogans from the mainstream media at the beginning of the year in the trade war between u s and china the americans are lifting rocks only to smash them on their own feet china is sure to win china will win the trade war without a doubt be the battles big or small what s behind this kind of thinking to this day we keep suffering from a cognitive dissonance between our understanding of the sino u s trade war and the international reality this calls for deep reflection the second misjudgment has caused private businesses to lose confidence in the national leadership with the result that investment by private business owners has fallen substantially according to xiang this has occurred because the chinese media have been suggesting that the economic reforms of the past 40 years will be reversed and there will be a return to full scale socialism since the beginning of the year though all kinds of ideological statements have been thrown around statements like private property will be eliminated private ownership will eventually be abolished if not now it s time for the private enterprises to fade away or all private companies should be turned over to their workers then there was this high profile study of marx and the communist manifesto remember that line in the communist manifesto abolition of private property what kind of signal do you think this sends to private entrepreneurs with regard to the trade war xiang says that it is really a clash of value systems with no solution in sight in addition to this there are three major external challenges the first is the trade war which is in fact no longer a trade war but rather a clash between two opposed value systems it can be said with certainty that the sino u s relationship has come to a crossroads right now and faces significant historic challenges what are we to do to be honest i don t think we have really found much of a solution you are aware that huawei s cfo meng wanzhou was recently detained in vancouver in the past two days mainstream media such as bbc and cnn have been reporting on how the u s is going at huawei on all fronts what this tells us is that this issue is not simply about trade or economics unless the date is postponed china and the u s have until march 1 to reach agreement on a huge list of trade and trade secret protection issues before the u s substantially increases tariffs on chinese imports what this almost certainly means is that the can will be kicked down the road this could mean that the march 1 date will be postponed or it could mean that president trump will simply increase the pressure on china by increasing tariffs by a small amount related articles keys generational dynamics china huawei technologies ren zhengfei people s

the huddled masses will have to try again another day image credit 2013 afp what has happened since 22 december the us federal government has been in partial shutdown after congress refused to agree to 5 6bn in funding for president trump s long promised wall along the mexican border a barrier regarded by democrats as not merely a crazy waste of money but also immoral as moneyweek went to press the trump imposed shutdown had lasted 19 days the second longest in us history and if it continues until this weekend and there s every sign that it will it will be the longest shutdown ever surpassing the 21 day shutdown under bill clinton in december 1995 and january 1996 what s a partial shutdown in this case only around a quarter of federal agencies are affected and must freeze all non essential discretionary activity since the us government s fiscal year began on 1 october congress had already passed five of the 12 necessary appropriation bills that settle funding for the various federal departments and agencies before the current stand off began thus key aspects of government defence energy and water the legislative branch the departments of labour education health and human services are unaffected by the funding gap and shutdown the departments worst affected are homeland security justice and agriculture which together account for about half the 800 000 workers affected other big departments affected are housing commerce interior and treasury aren t these shutdowns quite common they are less common than they were in the 1980s but they last longer and so are potentially far more destabilising since congress passed the congressional budget and impoundment and control act in 1974 which established the current regime that governs the federal budgeting process there have been 22 occasions when funding shortfalls caused by political standoffs led to a shutdown only ten of these led to federal workers being furloughed placed on unpaid leave resulting in an actual shutdown of government services in the 1980s there were shutdowns most years but lasting just one or two days and there was a three day shutdown in 1990 but in the 28 years up to 2018 there were only three more one of five days in november 1995 the 21 day shutdown that began a few weeks later and after a gap of 18 years a 16 day shutdown over obamacare in 2013 subscribe to

newsletter sign up do they matter to the economy the prospect of the shutdown helped send us stocks falling in the run up to christmas so it hasn t exactly been a boon for investors as for the real economy there is definitely some negative impact but most analysts expect it to be marginal rather than catastrophic assuming the shutdown doesn t drag on for months economists reckon the 2013 shutdown 16 days cost the economy about 24bn shaving at least 0 2 off us gdp the negative effect comes partly from the workers in this case 800 000 not getting paid one study by scott baker and constantine yannelis found that in 2013 federal workers who were furloughed immediately cut household spending by 15 20 that s a non negligible effect but beyond the effect on household spending the shutdown damages the economy in numerous small ways from delaying business permits and visas to cutting services at innumerable agencies such as to give a few examples right now us brewers can t get approval from the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives for new beer labels holding up product launches the commerce department has stopped processing requests from car parts suppliers for example seeking an exemption from trump s metal tariffs so they don t know the price they ll be paying for key materials farmers can t get help with subsidies to counteract the effects of trump s trade war tens of thousands of federally backed mortgage applications have been delayed according to estimates from zillow the key us financial regulator the securities and exchange commission is operating with just a few hundred staff those tasked with protecting life or property rather than its usual 4 400 that means no one is reviewing initial public offering or mergers and acquisitions applications and because agencies such as the bureau of economic analysis have also shut investors businesses and policy makers are all lacking key economic data what s the worst case scenario what s different about this shutdown is that analysts don t see any obvious route to an early resolution trump says he s proud to shut down the government and this week commandeered the tv networks to declare he is digging in for the long term the democrats accused him of governing by temper tantrum according to capital economics the biggest risk to the economy for 2019 isn t a worsening of the us china trade war but that a long shutdown could develop into another debt ceiling crisis why s that so important congress has to agree at the start of march either to raise or suspend the legally mandated debt ceiling likely to be about 22trn but in the current environment such agreement could be unlikely trump s own treasury department warns that such a scenario could cause the government to default on its obligations points out gina chon on breakingviews com an unprecedented event that would almost certainly spark another financial crisis moreover other forthcoming political battles such as whether congress will approve a revamped nafta could be used to hold the debt limit hostage these would have far more scary consequences for the economy than the current shutdown
we have seen a substantial flow of foreign workers remittances over the past 5 years the number is very impressive at over us 94bn and the growth trend is continuing albeit at a slower pace which is understandable as the remittance gap between the formal and informal channel is narrowing at the same time the gap between remittances and exports are also narrowing down on our external account this makes the importance of remittances more and more critical than the past the remittances growth hitherto has largely been god sent the sector needs baby sitting and pampering to ensure that this growth trend continues focusing on remittances doesn t mean that we don t address the outstanding structural issues and constraints faced by our exports sector which in fact is more important than remittances in many ways and the present government has already realized this and started taking policy decisions in extending the necessary subsidies to the exporters there s an argument on the other hand that our export sector has been behaving like trust fund baby and it s about time that they stand up on their own two feet but that s a debate for some other time in this write up we re focusing on remittances from non resident pakistanis nrps the current worker remittances have essentially been consumption driven which can be verified from their constant growth and inelasticity with both interest and exchange rates which moved in both the directions during the last 4 5 years but there has been a consistent growth in remittances while there s substantial room for improvement to attract further consumption driven remittances which are still being routed through non banking channels by mobilizing foreign banks and more so foreign operations of the large local banks capturing these enhanced flows are largely have to do with the large local banks being not focused on this business and going an extra mile in attracting these remittances from the non banking channels let s dissect the causes of preference of remittances from the non banking sector this is identified that the cost of transaction speed security of funds geographic proximity accessibility convenience in terms of familiarity and language are the primary factors which attract the remitter towards the non banking options the attractiveness of formal and informal channels varies greatly across these factors siddiqui and abrar 2003 find that costs of informal channels in bangladesh are about 45 percent of formal costs costs in the informal sector are about 2 5 percent of the amount sent while costs in the formal sector are on an average about 10 20 percent available empirical evidence also supports the second assumption the elasticity of total remittances sent or received with respect to costs is very low aggregate remittances will therefore depend on wages in the host economy income in the source economy and the total number of migrants dual fx regime and remittance costs vis a vis average size of the remittance are the two factors which drives the gulf between the informal channels and the formal channels of workers remittances cost reduction could be usefully pursued through measures to enhance competition in the banking sector promote financial development and reduce exchange rate volatility this is about time that the banks must look into the possibility of sharing passing on the benefits of direct and indirect subsidies income streams float income fx conversion spreads gop s direct rebate with the end remitter and make the overall proposition of remittances through the banking channel more attractive for both the banks and the remitter the play shall be on volumes rather than margins for the banks informal or non banking channels are typically faster and more convenient as they are not constrained by banking and foreign exchange regulations and often work in close proximity to their clients and frequently provide door to door services an element of intimidation to deal with the bankers formal set up also plays up on the minds of blue collar worker which is a large population of pakistan workers abroad particularly in ksa and gcc this is assumed that the existing consumption driven remittances could actually be doubled through the official channels within a period of 2 3 years if the foreign operations of the large local banks and the relevant government departments ministries work in close collaboration with each other a close alliance and working relationship is absolutely critical between different ministries departments of the government of pakistan gop including ministry of finance mof pakistan remittance initiative pri state bank of pakistan sbp overseas pakistani foundation opf central directorate of national savings cdns ministry of labor and manpower foreign ministry etc to enhance the consumption driven remittances following ideas could be considered 1 to begin with pri shall be given more visibility and importance pri shall be declared atleast a wing of the finance division and shall be manned with the best talent in the market 2 setting up community centers in the large ethnic pakistani populated cities including cities in ksa the uk the usa uae oman qatar etc to primarily target the blue collar workers remittances from gcc adds up to almost 2 3rd of the total worker remittances of pakistan the research says that one of the identified reasons for the blue collar workers to use the non banking channel is that they feel intimidated going to the bank and dealing with strangers or sophisticated individuals these blue collar workers find the whole ambiance of the bank overwhelming at times on the other hand the money changed hundi hawala facilitator comes to the door step of nrp to collect the money and remit it back home there are no remittance forms documentation to be filled in which is obviously a big help but poses a serious risk of fraud some cases recently been reported the local banks should be motivated to set up infrastructure develop pakistani community centers instead of full fledged branches jointly with opf and perhaps with cdns these centers should consist of restaurants foodmarts entertainment e g ethnic films tv programs musical events theater spiritual events etc opf has a specific mandate and adequate resources to set up these community centers there maybe some community centers already existing which probably are not been managed leveraged to the fullest potential and could be revived for the purpose the idea is to have a strong alliance between the banks and the opf to manage these community centers to attract pakistani blue collar worker traffic which otherwise avoid going to the bank making the whole experience of remittances for them convenient and pleasurable through these centers leveraging community infrastructure for cross sell opportunities for the local banks which can result in building nrp customer base deposit mobilization asset building e g mortgage financing against pledged remittances etc building brand image bringing a step closer to opening foreign branches is an incentive enough for the banks particularly the provincial banks to pursue this joint venture proposition with opf according to the bureau of emigration and overseas employment after punjab 58 kpk represents the 2nd biggest registered overseas work force of 32 sindh and balochistan are far behind at 9 and 1 respectively this data helps us figure out that if we mobilize our provincial banks particularly bank of punjab and bank of kyber with some specific targets than they could be most suited to attract these flows internationally 3 rolling out remitter investor education program the nrps need to be educated about the benefits of the remittances through the banking official channels overall costs benefits tax breaks in case of investments security official track record etc this education must be conducted through written literature and propagating in the media both electronic and print the above proposed community centers will also prove to be a great platform for such education 4 the gop sbp must encourage opening of smart branches of pakistani banks at the pakistani dominated populated areas globally with specific focus of enhancing the nrp remittance flows if branch es already exist then make the dedicated service desks mandatory to facilitate remittances from these international branches of local banks 5 the gop mof should seriously consider offering tax breaks fiscal incentives to the banks on the income earned through the incremental remittances this formula incentive plan must be devised in such a way that the risk of cannibalization in existing remittances amongst the local banks does not happened 6 there already an existing provincial bank in azad jammu and kashmir ajk this bank may need to be recapitalized albeit to the requisite minimum amount and rejuvenated into of a fully dedicated technology driven bank to penetrate into the remittances from the affluent ajk ethnic community based globally but particularly in the uk this bank will not only help in the economic uplift of ajk but also help in channelizing the remittances through the official channels which may currently been diverted through the non banking informal sources due to lack of dedicated banking facilities at both ends of the remittance equation origination and termination while the number of ajk expats may not be too large in number but surely they are high end in terms of amounts transaction value therefore more sophisticated remittance solution fits in well with their profile needs 7 tap into the existing nrp community groups associations and nrp owned restaurants retail centers to educate the community on the benefits of using banking official channels the nrp owned restaurants retail centers can be used as technology driven point of remittances in alliance with the large local banks primarily using phone banking internet banking etc subject to of course regulatory approvals implementation timeline each initiative consumption driven there is an immediate need is to come up with investment saving products which will provide a medium to long term sustainable foreign currency flows to the country the current government is already working on two of such options the one off pakistan banao certificate and the other is a program by national savings called overseas pakistanis savings certificates both these products will go a very long way in terms of attracting savings inflows from nrps the other investment products that the government could consider are 1 gop has already rolled out the plan for privatization they may consider secondary market offering shares of public sector entities pses in oil and gas and financial sectors in particular international investors have fairly large interest in these scripts shares the whole idea is to make these secondary market offerings dedicated for nrps these offerings will be done in small denominations to encourage small investor to participate and become the owner of their own pses the objective is to spread the holding of pses all across the masses particularly to the small investors within pakistan and outside similar instruments were issued by the uk germany and other european countries in 80s and 90s while privatizing their pses this initiative will also help in increasing the much needed depth and breadth in pakistan stock exchange 2 encourage mutual funds to arrange road shows internationally to attract investment in foreign currency through a scra account and allow them to launch foreign currency hedged funds especial incentives tax related or otherwise could be offered on the income earned from the sale of these mutual funds to the international investors nrps 3 the option of retail bond sukuk structured against the future workers remittances is always there however this option poses a very high risk of cannibalization of future savings driven inflows and additionally this kind of bond sukuk is better suited for the institutional investors while we re focusing discussing on tapping the retail investor base implementation timeline each initiative investment savings enhancement in worker remittances is the only viable option available for the government to meet its current account shortfalls in the short to medium term exports are being promoted with various policy actions however our export sector is confronted with some structural issues like lack of value addition and dependence on few sectors and products we re virtually a three product exporting country which will take some time to address at least medium to long term in the meantime worker remittances remain the most promising option to pursue to fund our chronic current account deficit and shall be given the importance accordingly author is a freelance consultant former dg national

opinion hey there time traveller this article was published 11 01 2019 1912 days ago so information in it may no longer be current the economic times they are a changing for the past two years governments in this country have enjoyed a period of relative economic stability although we haven t seen the growth and accompanying revenues experienced in the early 2000s since the 2016 election of manitoba s current progressive conservative majority government the economy has been pretty solid but that seems to be changing now most economic think tanks and bank economists are downgrading forecasts for economic growth in manitoba and across the country in the current and subsequent fiscal years manitoba premier brian pallister is holding fast to the cost containment strategy his government has employed since being elected in 2016 david lipnowski canadian press files in relative terms manitoba s economy is expected to continue to grow at about the national average which reinforces the underlying strength of a diversified economy but that average will be considerably lower in the coming years consider that in 2017 premier brian pallister s first full year in office real gdp in manitoba grew by 2 6 per cent that was a remarkable bit of good fortune which provided the premier with more revenue growth than had been seen in the previous three years when real gdp growth averaged slightly more than 1 5 per cent in dollar terms a one point difference in gdp cannot be understated according to statistics canada in 2017 the value of manitoba s economy grew to more than 71 billion an increase of 3 6 billion from 2016 that year over year increase was double the increase seen in the previous two fiscal years when the economy grew by a total of only 3 1 billion at the same time pallister received a huge annual windfall in transfer payments in the current year equalization alone is expected to go up by 218 million the previous year pallister s first in power manitoba received 217 million more compare that to the previous seven years of ndp government when equalization payments went up by a total of 67 million good times indeed but they appear to be coming to an end real gdp growth in manitoba is expected to come in at close to two per cent for the current year in the next two years it is expected to hover around 1 5 per cent transfer payment growth could continue but the loss of nearly a point of gdp growth will have significant effects on manitoba s own source revenue and thus the effectiveness of pallister s current fiscal policy as most manitobans know pallister wants to balance the budget to create the fiscal wiggle room to cut the provincial sales tax by one point a core pledge from his 2016 election campaign that one tax expenditure will cost the treasury in excess of 300 million a gargantuan reduction in own source revenues that would be challenging at any time but particularly challenging at a time when the economy and government revenue growth are stalling what has the pc government s response been to date for the most part an ever tightening belt in speeches to business forums the premier has frequently admitted that he actually keeps a running count of the number of times that news outlets one news outlet in particular use the word austerity to describe his fiscal policy of course he refutes the notion that there is anything austere about his approach to managing finances but the numbers tell a different story since the pcs came to power provincial expenditures have grown at a rate well below the dual impacts of inflation and population growth the austerity has been particularly evident in health care and education where the government has chronically underspent even on its own restrained annual funding increases last year pallister promised to increase health spending by 3 2 per cent but after all the numbers were counted the actual hike was about 0 9 per cent the winnipeg regional health authority the largest provider of health care services in the province only spent about 200 000 more than it did a year earlier a fiscal strategy that has meant modest increases in wait times for most elective surgeries the effect of austerity can also be felt in other areas of government spending including infrastructure in december the manitoba heavy construction association declared open war on the pallister government over precipitous cuts to spending on roads since coming to power the tory government has cut total spending on roads from 588 million in the last year of ndp government to just 350 million in the 2018 19 budget the drastic cut in spending on basic infrastructure is accompanied by a series of decisions to cancel or indefinitely delay other government capital projects including new consolidated headquarters for the manitoba liquor and lotteries corp and an expansion of the club regent casino pallister has made it clear that he finds projects such as this wasteful and unnecessary and it s true that none of the capital projects he has spiked fall into the category of needs for taxpayers they are wants in almost every definition of the word unless you are an architect an engineer a construction contractor or tradesperson pallister s strategy on infrastructure is particularly concerning because the biggest government funded capital projects in the history of the province the bipole iii transmission line and keeyask generating station are either completed or winding down bipole iii was actually finished last year the new north south transmission line cost 4 7 billion more than double the original 2 2 billion estimate the same goes for keeyask originally estimated to cost 3 7 billion manitoba hydro has said the project will be completed in 2020 for 8 7 billion pallister s main concern about these two projects has been the cost overruns and to that end he has hired former british columbia premier gordon campbell to conduct a review of how things got so out of control however while he seeks accountability for the blown budgets he should also be concerned about what will happen to manitoba s economy when both projects are completed economists and bond raters for years have been lauding the net positive impact of bipole iii and keeyask on gdp there is really no legitimate way to justify the inflated costs of the two projects but knowing that they will soon no longer be providing a baseline of economic activity one would think the premier might at least tweak his fiscal policy to account for the downward pressure on gdp you might think that but you would probably be wrong winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement the premier has made it clear to his caucus and staff that he is not about to abandon his course of action expenditures will continue to grow in an austere manner that is increases that are well below the joint impact of population growth and inflation to balance the budget and create the fiscal resources to cut the pst pallister will likely claim the cut in pst will in and of itself spur economic growth but it will not and all the evidence you need to prove that point can be seen in the united states where massive corporate tax cuts have essentially had no effect on the broader economy the premier has his strategy and he s going to ride it all the way through to the next election in 2020 and likely beyond given that he is the overwhelming favourite to win re election a fairly robust economy in the last two years has helped pallister move all the needles in the right direction however as the economy slows the premier may find his austere course is less part of a solution and more a net contributor to a much bigger problem dan lett freepress mb ca

please try again later want the latest welsh news and politics updates sent straight to your email the christmas holiday season is supposed to be a joyful time for families coming together children finally receive the many gifts that they have waited for expectantly for the past year but for millions of americans this idyllic picture of the christmas holidays does not reflect reality recent census data show that about 13 of americans live in poverty but that almost a third live in poverty or near poverty and almost half the population is low income sadly my home state of california which has the fifth largest economy in the world also has the highest relative poverty rate with about 20 of residents living below the poverty line for many of these low income families the holidays are a time of struggle and worry about paying bills and fear for what the new year might bring america is supposed to be the land of opportunity perhaps many of these families living in poverty or near poverty will see their children rise to the middle class or higher on the economic ladder as children of recent immigrants and other low income groups attain an education with better paying careers unfortunately us census data and other studies show this popular idea of equal opportunity for all is a myth among most developed countries the us has the lowest relative social mobility which is lower than the united kingdom canada france germany and the scandinavian countries studies also show that this rate of social mobility has been stagnant and even falling since 1980 what are the factors that explain this startling lack of upward mobility it should be emphasised first of all that this seemingly simply question is actually quite complicated for example in the us which is more the size of the european union than the individual countries within it some regions of the country such as seattle san jose silicon valley and denver have social mobility comparable to denmark while others such as atlanta and milwaukee are lower than any other developed country in general very low social mobility is found in the south sections of the midwest and sections of the southwest a study by ram chetty and colleagues found areas with larger african american populations and greater segregation reduce social mobility which means that racial discrimination and income segregation are correlated with lack of social mobility family structure defined as areas with a disproportionate percentage of single parent families negatively affects social mobility the same is true for the quality of the k 12 school system defined as the percentage of drop out rates class size and tax revenue resources many of these single parent households are headed by women for them the chance for upward mobility might increase if pay equity became law we know that for equal work female full time workers earn just 78c for every 1 dollar earned by a male worker it is estimated that closing the gender wage gap would cut poverty in half for working women and their families the us lacks policies that support affordable child care and early childhood education these services have to be paid out of pocket for low income families who struggle to pay their weekly bills it is estimated that these costs amount to about one third of parents income the united states is also the only developed country in the western world without paid family medical leave making it difficult for millions of american families to balance work and family obligations many low income families in rural and inner city areas lack health insurance and access to quality health care services the signing of the affordable care act in 2010 was designed to alleviate this situation as well as prevent the millions of families who were suffering from high medical expenses paid out of pocket and mounting medical debts that frequently led to personal or family bankruptcies and future poverty still today however 23 states continue to refuse to expand their medicaid programs for supporting health coverage for low income residents a second major factor hindering social mobility is extreme income inequality in the united states the chetty study shows that geographic areas with the highest gini coefficients a statistical measure of inequality have less social mobility in the us the share of the top 1 of income earners had 9 of total income from about 1960 1980 today the top 1 has about 20 23 of total income in the country the highest since the great depression perhaps just as striking the top 10 of earners took home 50 of all income in 2012 which is the highest percentage in the past 100 years this kind of severe inequality also shows that even if people in the lowest quintile of income were to succeed in advancing to the second or third quintiles they still would not advance very far in earnings and wealth a recent study by the pew charitable trust on income inequality estimates that only 4 of people born into the bottom quintile make it into the top quintile as nobel economist joseph stieglitz points out this lack of social mobility among generations in the us is not inevitable but is caused by social and economic policies one key problem is the huge variation in the quality of the education system depending on where a person is born another challenge concerns social policies that fail to support women and families in the workforce and support racial discrimination and segregation by race and income the political system in the country also supports legal frameworks and tax policies that favour the rich over everyone else reinforcing economic market trends toward greater income inequality should britain feel complacent given this rather unflattering picture of social mobility and inequality is the united states the answer is a clear no britain has the second lowest social mobility among developed countries just slight more mobile than america but not nearly as mobile as canada scandinavia or even germany the uk government has also cut back on some of the social and health services on which poor families depend to be successful in the work force and in bringing up their children income inequality in the uk has also rise dramatically since 1979 to historically high levels the institute for public policy research study shows that more than a fifth of the population lives on incomes below the poverty line when housing costs are taken into account even though most of these households are at work and nearly one in three children live in poverty the author of the book hillbilly elegy rose from poverty in the appalachian mountains to attend yale law school and have a successful career thanks in part to the good fortune of having an enterprising and determined grandmother and enlisting in the us army which taught him discipline and skills throughout the book however he seems to view people who are poor as having made bad choices rather than as partial victims of circumstances and social and economic policies that severely hindered their chances for success the data on the lack of social mobility and income inequality in the united states and great britain belie his viewpoint if we want to become the land of opportunity that we idealistically aspire to be we need to support social and economic policies and legal frameworks that benefit all of us also by cherrie dr short a former race equality commissioner for wales is now associate dean of global and community initiatives and professor of practice at usc suzanne dworak school of

america s economy will continue to grow this year expanding at 2 6 per cent us chamber of commerce president and chief executive thomas donohue predicted on thursday pushing back against warnings of an impending recession but he cautioned that the economy needs skilled foreign workers and said that political parties in polarised washington needed to recreate the middle ground and fix america s broken immigration system as well as pay more attention to upgrading infrastructure a promise thus far lost in political acrimony separately however federal reserve chairman jerome powell told the economic club of washington that if the current government shutdown poised to become the longest in history continues the economy could take a dent most previous shutdowns were short and did not affect the economy in the aggregate he said while cautioning if we have an extended shutdown i think that would show up in the data pretty clearly mr donohue while optimistic also warned dysfunction saps confidence threatens growth and consequently poses a threat to opportunity in this country many of washington s troubles including dysfunction division and incivility could be helped by rebuilding the political centre and restoring responsible governing but he welcomed the new us mexico canada agreement which has replaced the north american free trade agreement and urged congress to approve it he also urged the white house to drop steel and aluminium tariffs on mexico and canada as encouragement to other trading partners also hit with the tariffs referring to trade negotiations with china he welcomed attention to what the united states saw as china s theft of intellectual property forced technology transfer and other unfair practices

how does a geographic area occupy both a physical existence and a figment of our imagination now even further tangled in wakanda fantasies what is the cultural political affective discursive space in which impression or illusion or desire takes primacy over materiality our leftist politics are as much an act of generating new futurities as they are destroying and remaking new structures and or repurposing existing ones but often in the process of dreaming that constitutes our radicalisms we retreat into ahistorical and erasing revisionisms as opposed to situating our political visions within some concrete foundation within radical politics africa often exists far more comfortably as an abstracted symbol a site of the ultimate myth making within political imaginaries a phenomenon to which those in the african diaspora are not immune than it does as a geographically bounded plexus of messy and sometimes contradictory material realities ground zero of european empire building though bloody colonial violations have been perpetrated across the globe the african continent was in many ways a ground zero for the european state and fortress making project it was a place of plunder from first contact in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the 1884 berlin conference s diplomatic distribution of land that precipitated europe s ongoing scramble for the continent to coercive liberalization policies that adjusted relatively newly independent states infant economies in response to what for many were inescapable debts king leopold ii infamously ran a slave colony in his ironically named congo free state which he was able to administer under the guise of philanthropic work and the promise of abolishing the arab slave trade in eastern africa congo has not been free since he forced the native congolese to extract rubber to meet growing western industrial demand he deployed his private army the force publique to enforce resource collection quotas with chicotte whippings kidnapping and torture village burnings and collectivized punishment and perhaps most gruesomely sadistically collecting hands and feet of congolese people so as not to waste bullets africa too was something of a drawing board for the western world s most identity making genocide this is not a reference to the slaughter of the native american first nations and arawak and other peoples of the caribbean whose murders facilitated the settlement of north america prior to the nazis slaughter of 10 million so called untermenschen jews roma blacks slavs ethnic poles physically and mentally disabled people gays and other lesser or asocial peoples that offended so called pure aryan sensibilities during world war ii imperial germany decimated the herero and nam peoples during the 1904 1908 herero wars what began as classic settler colonial migration and competition over resources and land quickly evolved into genocide after kaiser wilhelm ii instructed replacement colonial administrator lt general lothar von trotha to suppress indigenous insurgency mit allen mitteln by all means through forced labor systems starvation and dehydration in the kalahari and namib deserts prison camps and summary execution of all enemy combatants which included every herero man woman and child germany s first race war was waged at the shark island concentration camp dr eugen fischer conducted extensive experiments on the living bodies and corpses of indigenous prisoners he studied the basters the mixed race offspring of european settler men and indigenous women concluding that genetically muddied people like those should not reproduce adolf hitler praised fischer s racial hygiene work which influenced the ideas of aryan racial purities in his own infamous manifesto mein kampf fischer s 1913 work the rehoboth bastards and the problem of miscegenation among humans supported german anti miscegenation policy and provided a scientific legitimization of and justification for the 1935 nuremberg laws in 1933 fischer signed a loyalty oath to the nazi government and was appointed most senior official of the frederick william university now humboldt university of berlin in 1937 and 1938 fischer extensively experimented on and sterilized mixed race children and roma people continuing the study he had begun in namibia in 1940 he officially joined the nazi party just as frantz fanon wrote that the antisemite is inevitably a negrophobe we too can practically understand how so much structural violence in modern capitalist society is derived from anti black or specifically anti african science and other logics racialization as a displinary structure as alexander weheliye noted race and racialization comprise a disciplinary structure that govern a hierarchy of humanity into full humans not quite humans and non humans where blackness and a proximity to it clearly distinguishes those able to claim full human status from those who cannot the afterlife of slavery that we can see in the post emancipation and post jim crow united states too can be understood and analyzed on and through the continent saidiya hartman s précis that emancipation instituted indebtedness is applicable to the postcolonial continental condition british slave owners were compensated for their forfeited property after the abolishment of the trade and institution of slavery and haiti s legacy of indebtedness began after the island s slaves audaciously freed themselves from france through their 1804 revolution the african continent has similarly been in arrears to their former european masters since the release of continental colonies following these states successful struggles for independence today economists discourage debt abolition as it might motivate developing countries including many african ones to continue defaulting on their loans or refuse to make timely payments or over borrow funds it may even lead to industrialized nations altogether ceasing financial assistance to these countries because of a poor return on their investments so where debt abolition is understood as moral hazard per orthodox economics we might then understand the maintenance of indebtedness as moral as well as social political and economic necessity through the colonial process the continent has been relegated to a laboratory like zone of non being within which bio necropolitical technologies could be refined africa has been a site of pharmaceutical testing military exercise and expansion a dumping ground for both waste and the charitable donations of the team merchandise of super bowl losers a fitting metaphor it is a continent too of managerial imposition with borders sketched atop long existing nations and super sovereign administrations whether league of nations united nations mandate or separate but equal apartheid administration or proxy governance by western nation states simultaneously eroding continental governance and projecting narration of an incapacity for self governance our racialized seeing our very capability to see and humanize is contoured by anti blackness and so black african suffering is not legible as a human suffering that must be alleviated for humanity s sake rather it becomes a canvas upon which western moralizations can be articulated and acted and political values can be assessed suffering is not alleviated so that the continent might suffer less in earnest aid solutions are offered so as to further necessitate their existence a continued management and domination of space and people through a continuous provision of resources that justify continued conquest through development and charity the struggles of african people s both within nation states and beyond between them are deeply interconnected with other global struggles for autonomy and self determination the liberation of africa is also the liberation of its diaspora the freedom of the continent and the collection of peoples first burdened with the non human designation black is the freedom of the diaspora that also endures that non human subjection whose social death is foundational to the social contracts of their respective nation states an epoch marked by a true continental self sufficiency is one also marked by a considerably weakened western world as the prosperity of western capitalism is presently and has historically predicated upon a weakened africa an africa whose collective economic growth and self sufficiency is hamstringed by the exacerbation of conflict corrupt governance and market politics that devalue agricultural exports and stunt the expansion of manufacturing and industrial and other formal economic sectors beyond flattened talking points for all of these reasons for reasons also not mentioned our internationalist concerns for the continent and the one billion people living there must necessarily transcend the flattened talking points to which africa is frequently reduced in our discourses the open air slave markets in libya cannot simply become a feature in our rapid fire news cycle or ammunition in a set of taking points about hillary clinton s imperial track record the relatively recent abrupt end to former president robert mugabe s nearly forty year tenure for example is not the opportunity to flex political muscles sculpted through painstaking participation in dogmatic purity politics in the formulation of anti imperialist projects there exists the idea that a leader or party s politics begin and end with an articulated relationship to the west that anti westernness which is somehow metonymic with anti imperialism is a politics in itself these difficulties seem to come to a particular head when we seek to understand the chinese government s interactions with the different states with which it has commercial and economic and political and social interaction we revert to the politics of the little red book that contoured contemporary chinese relationships with the continent through provision of support for independence struggles but even as we might celebrate a source of economic support that contests the west s hegemonic sphere of influence we can also earnestly acknowledge the nurturing of a political co dependency and other happenings in agriculture petropolitics construction and other sectors that might call the intentions of the relationship into question a number of leaders on the continent are publicly skeptical of or hostile to the west we may remember the former president s histrionic anti western flourishes in his united nations general assembly addresses but despite these bold pronouncements mugabe s governance and economic management lacked deeply and scores of zimbabwean people suffered under his rule not even to mention the ethnic violence in matabeleland for which he and the new leader president emerson mnangagwa along others were responsible our imaginations have arrested the development of the continent it seems some of our imaginings of the continent have halted its development at the point of extraction in a way that a freed africa would necessarily return to a romanticized sometimes bordering on ahistorical pre colonial pre transatlantic slave trade state others of us know the continent solely through the wave of liberation and independence movements of the 1960s and 1970s wherein a freed africa would once again return to those moments of trans diasporic and transcontinental revolutionary politics the continent often fails to exist as a dynamic and constantly changing widely varied collection of peoples parties interests and realities while we might criticize the colonial treatments it continually receives in media portrayals or political discourse it still remains a political and historical terra nullius upon which yearnings and desires of diasporans and non afro descendant leftists alike can be projected african politics neither need to be the sole focus of our internationalism nor should they displace passion for other causes but they cannot be relegated to an afterthought after we have exhausted our solidarities with other struggles there is for example no understanding of american border imperialism without linking african extraction to a contemporary regime of biological citizenship that duly precludes foreign born africans and afro caribbeans from ever being fully understood or embraced as citizens similarly there is no robust understanding of imperial military strategy without the department of defense s africom an american government coordinated combatant command whose mandate purports to promote regional security stability and prosperity despite actively militarizing the continent in service of american security interests ones often at odds with the material needs of large swaths of the communities within the countries in which they operate the flattened dark continent is comprised of fifty four countries and over one billion people thousands of ethnic groups and languages and countless cultural expressions and material engagements with economic mobility and poverty and industrialization and agriculture and fashion and poaching and urbanism and higher education and corruption and entrepreneurship and service economies and military conflict and so many other realities our politics must accordingly be oriented around the myriad social historical political economic and discursive ways that the continent has been subjugated including the question of how our tax dollars continue to facilitate its ongoing marginalization these considerations

we have seen a substantial flow of foreign workers remittances over the past 5 years the number is very impressive at over us 94bn and the growth trend is continuing albeit at a slower pace which is understandable as the remittance gap between the formal and informal channel is narrowing at the same time the gap between remittances and exports are also narrowing down on our external account this makes the importance of remittances more and more critical than the past the remittances growth hitherto has largely been god sent the sector needs baby sitting and pampering to ensure that this growth trend continues focusing on remittances doesn t mean that we don t address the outstanding structural issues and constraints faced by our exports sector which in fact is more important than remittances in many ways and the present government has already realized this and started taking policy decisions in extending the necessary subsidies to the exporters there s an argument on the other hand that our export sector has been behaving like trust fund baby and it s about time that they stand up on their own two feet but that s a debate for some other time in this write up we re focusing on remittances from non resident pakistanis nrps the current worker remittances have essentially been consumption driven which can be verified from their constant growth and inelasticity with both interest and exchange rates which moved in both the directions during the last 4 5 years but there has been a consistent growth in remittances while there s substantial room for improvement to attract further consumption driven remittances which are still being routed through non banking channels by mobilizing foreign banks and more so foreign operations of the large local banks capturing these enhanced flows are largely have to do with the large local banks being not focused on this business and going an extra mile in attracting these remittances from the non banking channels let s dissect the causes of preference of remittances from the non banking sector this is identified that the cost of transaction speed security of funds geographic proximity accessibility convenience in terms of familiarity and language are the primary factors which attract the remitter towards the non banking options the attractiveness of formal and informal channels varies greatly across these factors siddiqui and abrar 2003 find that costs of informal channels in bangladesh are about 45 percent of formal costs costs in the informal sector are about 2 5 percent of the amount sent while costs in the formal sector are on an average about 10 20 percent available empirical evidence also supports the second assumption the elasticity of total remittances sent or received with respect to costs is very low aggregate remittances will therefore depend on wages in the host economy income in the source economy and the total number of migrants dual fx regime and remittance costs vis a vis average size of the remittance are the two factors which drives the gulf between the informal channels and the formal channels of workers remittances cost reduction could be usefully pursued through measures to enhance competition in the banking sector promote financial development and reduce exchange rate volatility this is about time that the banks must look into the possibility of sharing passing on the benefits of direct and indirect subsidies income streams float income fx conversion spreads gop s direct rebate with the end remitter and make the overall proposition of remittances through the banking channel more attractive for both the banks and the remitter the play shall be on volumes rather than margins for the banks informal or non banking channels are typically faster and more convenient as they are not constrained by banking and foreign exchange regulations and often work in close proximity to their clients and frequently provide door to door services an element of intimidation to deal with the bankers formal set up also plays up on the minds of blue collar worker which is a large population of pakistan workers abroad particularly in ksa and gcc this is assumed that the existing consumption driven remittances could actually be doubled through the official channels within a period of 2 3 years if the foreign operations of the large local banks and the relevant government departments ministries work in close collaboration with each other a close alliance and working relationship is absolutely critical between different ministries departments of the government of pakistan gop including ministry of finance mof pakistan remittance initiative pri state bank of pakistan sbp overseas pakistani foundation opf central directorate of national savings cdns ministry of labor and manpower foreign ministry etc to enhance the consumption driven remittances following ideas could be considered 1 to begin with pri shall be given more visibility and importance pri shall be declared atleast a wing of the finance division and shall be manned with the best talent in the market 2 setting up community centers in the large ethnic pakistani populated cities including cities in ksa the uk the usa uae oman qatar etc to primarily target the blue collar workers remittances from gcc adds up to almost 2 3rd of the total worker remittances of pakistan the research says that one of the identified reasons for the blue collar workers to use the non banking channel is that they feel intimidated going to the bank and dealing with strangers or sophisticated individuals these blue collar workers find the whole ambiance of the bank overwhelming at times on the other hand the money changed hundi hawala facilitator comes to the door step of nrp to collect the money and remit it back home there are no remittance forms documentation to be filled in which is obviously a big help but poses a serious risk of fraud some cases recently been reported the local banks should be motivated to set up infrastructure develop pakistani community centers instead of full fledged branches jointly with opf and perhaps with cdns these centers should consist of restaurants foodmarts entertainment e g ethnic films tv programs musical events theater spiritual events etc opf has a specific mandate and adequate resources to set up these community centers there maybe some community centers already existing which probably are not been managed leveraged to the fullest potential and could be revived for the purpose the idea is to have a strong alliance between the banks and the opf to manage these community centers to attract pakistani blue collar worker traffic which otherwise avoid going to the bank making the whole experience of remittances for them convenient and pleasurable through these centers leveraging community infrastructure for cross sell opportunities for the local banks which can result in building nrp customer base deposit mobilization asset building e g mortgage financing against pledged remittances etc building brand image bringing a step closer to opening foreign branches is an incentive enough for the banks particularly the provincial banks to pursue this joint venture proposition with opf according to the bureau of emigration and overseas employment after punjab 58 kpk represents the 2nd biggest registered overseas work force of 32 sindh and balochistan are far behind at 9 and 1 respectively this data helps us figure out that if we mobilize our provincial banks particularly bank of punjab and bank of kyber with some specific targets than they could be most suited to attract these flows internationally 3 rolling out remitter investor education program the nrps need to be educated about the benefits of the remittances through the banking official channels overall costs benefits tax breaks in case of investments security official track record etc this education must be conducted through written literature and propagating in the media both electronic and print the above proposed community centers will also prove to be a great platform for such education 4 the gop sbp must encourage opening of smart branches of pakistani banks at the pakistani dominated populated areas globally with specific focus of enhancing the nrp remittance flows if branch es already exist then make the dedicated service desks mandatory to facilitate remittances from these international branches of local banks 5 the gop mof should seriously consider offering tax breaks fiscal incentives to the banks on the income earned through the incremental remittances this formula incentive plan must be devised in such a way that the risk of cannibalization in existing remittances amongst the local banks does not happened 6 there already an existing provincial bank in azad jammu and kashmir ajk this bank may need to be recapitalized albeit to the requisite minimum amount and rejuvenated into of a fully dedicated technology driven bank to penetrate into the remittances from the affluent ajk ethnic community based globally but particularly in the uk this bank will not only help in the economic uplift of ajk but also help in channelizing the remittances through the official channels which may currently been diverted through the non banking informal sources due to lack of dedicated banking facilities at both ends of the remittance equation origination and termination while the number of ajk expats may not be too large in number but surely they are high end in terms of amounts transaction value therefore more sophisticated remittance solution fits in well with their profile needs 7 tap into the existing nrp community groups associations and nrp owned restaurants retail centers to educate the community on the benefits of using banking official channels the nrp owned restaurants retail centers can be used as technology driven point of remittances in alliance with the large local banks primarily using phone banking internet banking etc subject to of course regulatory approvals implementation timeline each initiative consumption driven there is an immediate need is to come up with investment saving products which will provide a medium to long term sustainable foreign currency flows to the country the current government is already working on two of such options the one off pakistan banao certificate and the other is a program by national savings called overseas pakistanis savings certificates both these products will go a very long way in terms of attracting savings inflows from nrps the other investment products that the government could consider are 1 gop has already rolled out the plan for privatization they may consider secondary market offering shares of public sector entities pses in oil and gas and financial sectors in particular international investors have fairly large interest in these scripts shares the whole idea is to make these secondary market offerings dedicated for nrps these offerings will be done in small denominations to encourage small investor to participate and become the owner of their own pses the objective is to spread the holding of pses all across the masses particularly to the small investors within pakistan and outside similar instruments were issued by the uk germany and other european countries in 80s and 90s while privatizing their pses this initiative will also help in increasing the much needed depth and breadth in pakistan stock exchange 2 encourage mutual funds to arrange road shows internationally to attract investment in foreign currency through a scra account and allow them to launch foreign currency hedged funds especial incentives tax related or otherwise could be offered on the income earned from the sale of these mutual funds to the international investors nrps 3 the option of retail bond sukuk structured against the future workers remittances is always there however this option poses a very high risk of cannibalization of future savings driven inflows and additionally this kind of bond sukuk is better suited for the institutional investors while we re focusing discussing on tapping the retail investor base implementation timeline each initiative investment savings enhancement in worker remittances is the only viable option available for the government to meet its current account shortfalls in the short to medium term exports are being promoted with various policy actions however our export sector is confronted with some structural issues like lack of value addition and dependence on few sectors and products we re virtually a three product exporting country which will take some time to address at least medium to long term in the meantime worker remittances remain the most promising option to pursue to fund our chronic current account deficit and shall be given the importance accordingly author is a freelance consultant former dg national

mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador commonly referred to by his initials amlo won a landslide election in july 2018 and took office in december as the country s first president from the independent left over the past few months lópez obrador has been constructing his new government and recently put forward an ambitious policy agenda to help grow mexico s economy after decades of free trade and increased economic integration with the united states lópez obrador s pro market critics have openly worried that he would bring a return to the heavy handed statist policies and fiery economic nationalism that characterized mexican political economy for the better part of the mid 20th century advertisement related how mexico s border plan aims to spur investment economic growth related why economic border plan could be costly for mexico however amlo s new economic agenda appears to offer a little something for everyone to encourage domestic and foreign private sector investment and help create jobs his new government plans to cut individual and corporate income taxes from 30 to 20 percent and cut value added taxes on imports from 16 to 8 percent in the six states along the northern border by doing so amlo hopes to boost cross border commerce production and trade at the same time to help address the higher than average costs of living for mexican border residents lópez obrador has also promised to boost the minimum wage and peg fuel costs to prices on the u s side advertisement combined this set of policies is being described as a new free zone for northern mexico one of mexico s most important engines of economic growth this is an idea that has roots as far back as the mid 19th century when the ideas of economic liberals like adam smith and david ricard were taking hold around the world during that era duty free zones were established in amlo s home state of tamaulipas and along mexico s southern border starting in the 1850s similar free zones were introduced in the then territory baja california beginning in the 1930s with experimental free perimeters in tijuana and ensenada for importing duty free foreign goods given the relative isolation of the baja california peninsula from the mainland mexican economy the practice was almost a necessity to facilitate industry and commerce the practice was gradually extended to the entire state of baja california baja california sur and much of the rest of mexico s northern border region during the 1960s the policy helped ensure that migrant workers or braceros returning from the united states could find jobs near the border without disrupting communities in the mexican interior and also laid the groundwork for a thriving in bond assembly or maquiladora sector the policy was finally discontinued in the early 1990s when free trade became the norm throughout the country with the adoption of the north american free trade agreement nafta advertisement since nafta u s and mexican free traders have promoted general economic openness and greater cross border integration as a way to facilitate trade and economic growth on both sides today the united states and mexico now regularly exchange over half a trillion dollars in cross border trade with as much as 40 percent of content involving production sharing among companies on either side of the border in this sense lópez obrador understands something that donald trump does not the u s mexican border is an asset not a liability investing in the border region offers real potential not only for mexico to improve living standards and promote economic growth but for u s companies workers and consumers to benefit from the dramatic increases in production sharing that have made the two countries increasingly interdependent over the last quarter century the downside of mr lópez obrador s economic plan is that other parts of mexico may lose out as mexican businesses and workers flock to the border to take advantage of newfound economic incentives at the same time firms along the border may wind up paying more but demanding greater productivity and tougher working conditions as they try to squeeze more from individual workers to balance out the costs from a fiscal standpoint amlo has yet to clarify how the federal government will make up lost tax revenue while simultaneously subsidizing fuel costs in the border region advertisement still mexico s new president deserves credit for viewing the border as an opportunity and for trying to build bridges not walls shirk is a professor of political science and international relations at the university of san diego

by carolina mandl sao paulo reuters at bm multimarcas a used car dealer on the outskirts of sao paulo owner santel de abreu bernardo can show you jalopies that most big banks would not touch there is a faded blue 2003 renault hatchback with 195 000 kilometers on the dial and a volkswagen gol turbo so old that it could vote but when he needs to seal a deal bernardo has a go to option for financing the brazilian unit of spain s banco santander it has grabbed 25 percent of the market for car loans in latin america s largest country in part by extending credit to borrowers shunned by other mainstream banks that means financing working class customers in need of cheap motorcycles and cars up to two decades old that business helped power madrid based santander through brazil s recent deep recession even as domestic rivals itau unibanco holding sa and banco bradesco sa hit the brakes and other foreign banks such as london based hsbc plc and u s citigroup sold their struggling brazilian retail businesses there are risks to santander s strategy as any used car veteran will tell you when an old car breaks down its owner prefers spending money to fix it rather than paying down debt said bernardo of bm multimarcas that s why many banks don t like financing old cars yet santander brazil s third largest private sector bank is cruising its 90 day default ratio is the lowest among brazil s largest private banks at 2 9 percent in september year over year consumer loan growth in brazil hit 22 6 percent in september more than triple the industry average of 7 percent brazil unit profitability which for years has lagged peers jumped to 19 4 percent from 16 3 percent in the same period that beat bradesco the country s second largest private lender and narrowed the gap with industry leading itau santander s increasing reliance on brazil shows how emerging markets can still provide a jolt of growth the brazilian unit contributed 26 percent of group profits in the first nine months of 2018 up from 19 percent four years ago santander brasil s stock price has surged more than two thirds in the last 12 months vastly outperforming the shares of its parent company as well as those of itau and bradesco still santander brasil s outsized auto loan portfolio and its willingness to bet on borrowers and vehicles avoided by competitors could presage a bumpier road ahead in a country with a history of economic volatility certainly santander s growth strategy is a success story so far said andre martins an analyst at xp investimentos but the bank will be the one most exposed to defaults if the brazilian economy turns down for a graphic on santander brasil s share of auto loans in brazil see risk management for now brazil s economy appears to be on the upswing and santander executives say their strategy is battle tested around 80 percent of the brazil unit s auto loans are on cars aged four years or less and down payments are hefty averaging 36 percent if santander s loan book were problematic it would already have popped after a 3 year historic recession said angel santodomingo chief financial officer for santander brasil our success in credit quality is related to our ability to analyze and price individuals risk santodomingo would not reveal santander s secret sauce but the bank is harnessing big data to glean information beyond borrower income and savings and brazil risk officers are using company tools that have proven successful elsewhere including the united states where santander is a major subprime auto lender the bank has also embraced the internet to grow its business leveraging online sales generated through webmotors a top car selling website that it owns two years ago it launched an app that allows dealers to arrange car loans within minutes for buyers who provide eight pieces of information an innovation that is now being copied by other brazilian banks that process had previously taken at least a day and required car buyers to provide reams of documentation if a loan is approved clients sign the contract digitally it saves a lot of time said eduardo de jesus a salesman at basile center car located in a middle class neighborhood on sao paulo s northwest side santander plans to use that model to grow its consumer finance business in brazil with loans for vacations building materials and solar panels according to andre novaes head of santander s consumer finance unit many brazilian banks have avoided such lending because of the high default risk and shaky collateral to safeguard its portfolio santander said it has encouraged highly indebted clients to refinance and consolidate different types of loans in arrears into a single loan with more amicable terms some bankers however view the practice as a way to mask santander s default ratio severe losses in 2011 forced itau and bradesco to stop financing low end motorcycles and to ban cars aged ten years and older from their portfolios they also increased down payments and shortened loan maturities which had stretched as long as 70 months rial at the helm santander has been in brazil since 1982 it has made a few good sized acquisitions including the purchase of the brazil unit of amsterdam based abn amro in 2007 but most of its organic growth spurt has come under sergio rial who took the ceo job at santander brasil in january 2016 a lawyer and economist rial served a stint as chief financial officer at the grains trader cargill inc and as a board member at abn amro he was chief executive of the brazilian meatpacker marfrig when ana botin the executive chairman of santander group tapped him for the top job in brazil santander brasil share s outperform rivals while car loans have juiced growth rial has also bet on safer credit lines including payroll loans and mortgages as well as credit cards overall rial has been strengthening santander s retail arm to the detriment of corporate loans consumer loans comprise 70 percent of the bank s loan book up 12 percentage points from when rial took the ceo post to engage the bank s employees rial has tied more of their compensation to performance variable compensation increased 16 percent from 2015 to 2017 even as the bank s payroll shrunk roughly 7 percent the number of clients has increased for 40 straight months reaching 23 4 million in september still the auto loan business remains the bank s standout in terms of growth de jesus the car salesman at basile center car said santander s rivals are paying attention when clients come to a store they want to know exactly if the down payment suits their pockets and santander s tools show it immediately he said other banks are copying it now reporting by carolina mandl editing by christian plumb and marla

on thursday there was a screaming headline on drudge saying doomsday the article was from nbc news and the source of the doomsday report was the ever reliable mark zandi of moody s the purpose of the report was not to be objective news because anyone with a brain knows that the shutdown will end soon the purpose was to scare the public tamp down economic growth and destroy trump the country would face an economic hellscape if the government shutdown lasts months or even years as the president has suggested it might experts tell nbc news the doomsday scenario might be unlikely the longest the federal government has ever shut down is 21 days a record that will fall if the current closure lasts until saturday but it is chilling we ll be in no man s land mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics told nbc news zandi was always one of the independent economists who supported obama as zandi was rooting actively against trump and rooting for and donating to hillary cnn used moody s as the source to attack trump and his policies zandi predicted that 3 5 million jobs would be lost and unemployment would go up 7 when trump took office he was 100 wrong during trump s first two years there are around 4 8 million new jobs and the current unemployment rate is 3 9 zandi said the policies would help only the super rich and the rest of us would be worse off again he was 100 wrong as all races both sexes people of all education levels and all classes have been helped why do the media continue to use the clearly partisan economist mark zandi who has been 100 wrong on so much as an expert and call him independent the answer is because he provides them with garbage to attack trump and republican policies which is also their goal how many times have the media yelled doomsday since 2016 when they were supporting hillary for president they said the economy would collapse if trump s policies took effect they were 100 wrong on election night when trump won paul krugman and others said the stock market and the economy would collapse they were 100 wrong when trump was talking tough on north korea there were predictions of doom and world war iii they were 100 wrong as kim has started talking with south korea and is not currently threatening japan or other neighbors when trump pulled out of the iran agreement we were told it would be a disaster they were wrong as deaths from terrorism worldwide were down in both 2017 and 2018 the media should have predicted doom when obama built up the tyrants in the terrorist sponsoring iran that still pledges death to america and israel but instead they ignorantly cheered when trump threatened to pull out of nafta if we didn t get a better deal we heard how bad that was the predictions of doom were 100 wrong when trump pulled out of the tpp we were told that trade would be harmed they were 100 wrong as exports and imports are both up substantially since we pulled out when trump slapped tariffs on china we were told how harmful it would be to our economy and how inflationary the tariffs would be to the overall economy the predictions of doom and inflation have been 100 wrong when trump kept his word to move the embassy to jerusalem we were told how dangerous it would be it appears the predictions of danger were 100 wrong when trump and republicans repealed the individual mandate penalty of obamacare we were told rates would skyrocket the predictions were 100 wrong as rates have stabilized isn t it amazing how freedom of choice and competition work the biggest prediction of doom was of when trump pulled out of the idiotic paris climate accord we were told how damaging that would be how many times over the last 120 years have the doomsters gone back and forth predicting disaster from either cooling or warming how many times were we running out of food how many times did we have only a few years left to solve the problem how many times have the oceans and species died every prediction of doom so far has been 100 wrong yet they keep predicting them hoping that someday they will be right what we should have learned from this shutdown is that the government is too big and powerful obviously too many people work for government or are dependent on government if closing 25 of it for a short time causes so many problems what we have learned is that we have two petulant children pelosi and schumer throwing a temper tantrum by refusing to vote for something they have voted for more than once before to block trump from keeping a promise these spoiled brats have willingly put so many out to work strictly to please their left wing base these same brats threatened to close government in 2013 and 2015 if they didn t get their way and because of almost universal support from the media republicans caved now we have a president who actually cares about making america safer and more secure and that has confused the little children and their supporting stenographers pretending to be journalists the thing these children want is more power and more people being dependent on government and we have a president who wants to give the power and purse back to the people i am astonished about the dire predictions about federal employees who on average make more than most americans haven t they saved any money or are the dire predictions exaggerated maybe we can start to understand why they are such bad stewards of our money and why they always want more the greatest threat to our prosperity our freedom and our republic is journalists who continually repeat democrat talking points as if that were news and seek to make the economy collapse by continuously predicting doom for the sole purpose of destroying trump and electing democrats these journalists certainly aren t interested in lifting up the economy as a whole and that is a shame
devastating investment losses are coming what is your advisor doing about it i hold financial professionals who recommend monetary gold to their clients in the highest esteem it is their sage advice that will protect investors from the unprecedented dangers they face today in the markets however many advisors are no longer permitted to recommend physical gold or precious metals in client portfolios as a result of the new rules defining risk in mutual funds many clients who had been holding gold for years were forced to reduce their positions last year by their investment advisor s dealer the timing for this couldn t have been worse as the resulting rise in their gold holdings would have reduced the losses in their portfolios from the market carnage we have witnessed since late september the equity selloff that began in october is intensifying and threatens advisors mfda dealers and investors with a high probability of a 50 70 loss of capital and a corresponding loss of income in 2019 a decline of this magnitude will have devastating effects on retirement portfolios many investors will not recover in their lifetimes this could snowball into advisors and investment dealers no longer being viable the everything bubble appears to be bursting and as history has shown investors fears can easily grow into a panic the final quarter in 2018 is a textbook display of why investors must own gold there is no liquid asset more negatively correlated to the financial markets investors who do not own monetary gold may find themselves dangerously exposed to market volatility without the much needed diversification portfolio insurance that gold offers if the current downturn in the market continues as the world s leading financial experts predict this asset may be the only form of wealth preservation that works experienced financial professionals understand that gold bullion is an alternative to cash ray dalio chairman of the largest hedge fund in the world bridgewater associates once stated that if you don t own gold there is no sensible reason other than you don t know history or you don t know the economics of it referencing the above metrics securities regulators have made a grave mistake in re rating monetary gold to a medium high risk relative to know your client kyc forms these regulators fund dealers and by extension their various compliance enforcement departments have ignored the fact that the bank for international settlements bis that sets the rules for central banks and commercial banks has stated that monetary gold is a risk free asset on par with us treasuries and us dollars they have also hamstrung investment professionals and their clients from protecting themselves with an asset that has done just that for over 3 000 years in spite of nothing having changed in bmg funds the new rules mandated by the provincial regulators across the country raised our official risk rating making bmg funds unsuitable to many clients who have held these funds for years an investor in a typical balanced portfolio should be concerned with not being properly diversified for example an equity portfolio can be diversified by style capitalization and sector but all equities are categorized as the same asset class gold however is an asset class unto itself with no substitute no counterparty risk no management risk and no default risk therefore concentration limits in the traditional sense do not apply to monetary gold there is no issue if a client chooses to hold 100 of his or her portfolio in a money market fund it should be equally risk rated for an investor to hold 100 of their portfolio in the bmg gold fund bmg230 currently investors would be prevented from holding more than 20 in their mfda portfolio the only choice investors would have is to move their account to a discount brokerage account and purchase class d units class d units have a 1 5 management fee instead of the retail fee of 2 25 which includes a 1 trailer fee to the advisor investors that require additional investment information can go to the bmg diy investor site financial advisors are under the microscope for the unpalatable commission fees they receive many investors have already left their advisors due to this and switched to a do it yourself diy discount brokerage account they switched into fund classes i e d class where they aren t paying high commissions to an advisor when an investor is told that they cannot hold the investments they want because of obtuse rules and are compelled to pay high fees to an advisor for financial products they don t want or alternatively should have a greater allocation to it leaves the investor wondering why they have an advisor in the first place in addition the last year has been infuriating for investors and financial professionals due to the arbitrary misguided and potentially disastrous rule changes relating to measuring investment risk essentially many investors were told they were no longer in control of their own wealth and were barred from holding monetary gold in summary the regulators mandated that the sole criterion for measuring an investment s level of risk was standard deviation this elementary investment tool measures both upside and downside moves over a ten year period and finds an average of the two the irony is of course that investors do not consider positive returns as risk that is the objective investors only worry about downside risk investors are now being penalized for above average returns even if the downside risk is extremely low i am not alone in holding the view that downside risk is the best way to gauge the level of risk in an investment gold has a very low risk when measured this way this presents an irreconcilable paradox for an advisor who had recommended this asset for years as an essential component of a balanced and diversified approach to wealth preservation gold s ability to off set losses in traditional asset classes i e stocks and bonds in times of uncertainty like we see today is a key reason to own it these rules were implemented with protecting the investor but are actually the exact opposite and now put the investor at risk the unfortunate timing of last year s rule change flies in the face of reason as we witnessed an equity bull market achieve three times the size of the last two bull markets and global debt reach an alarming 241 trillion over three times global gdp mean reversion is inevitable and the magnitude of an unwind is unthinkable to the average investor today financial professionals were told that if they did not comply with the new risk rating rules that they could be terminated meaning that they would lose their clients and livelihood in many instances this was the case in conjunction with the financial professional s dilemma many investors were livid upon being told that they had to reduce or redeem all of their physical precious metals investments some investors who were forced to switch to another advisor or a discount brokerage account after theirs had been forcibly terminated had their entire gold position liquidated these activities have the makings of class action lawsuit as investors portfolios were made less diversified and left investors more exposed to market risks and losses the advisor s position and rightly so was that one of the tenets of modern portfolio theory is predicated on the notion of diversification i e a blend of assets that move in different directions investors who were forced to sell their gold remained in overvalued stocks and bonds which studies suggest are more positively correlated now than ever gold is well known as a safe haven asset during times of uncertainty since late september it has outperformed all traditional asset classes this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future as the world s central banks seek to unwind the effects of their unprecedented and deleterious monetary policies introduced after the last financial crisis those who ignore what is happening right now are placing their financial well being in harm s way if your financial advisor in addition to recommending monetary gold for diversification purposes continues to advise on estate planning tax planning insurance options and other financial recommendations then you are being guided by a true financial professional and they are worth their trailing commission compensation if you don t feel like your advisor offers you any real value then why do you continue to pay them out of your fund s management fee investors need to be very wary of financial advice that does not follow or runs contrary to these empirically proven risk management practices you have a choice if your investment advisor as a result of these new restrictions cannot implement an effective risk management strategy or fails to grasp the basics of modern portfolio theory then i strongly recommend that you contact us about do it yourself diy

california here s what gavin newsom had to say at his inauguration gavin newsom was sworn in monday as california s 40th governor on the steps of the capitol here s what newsom said in his inaugural remarks as provided to the media prior to the ceremony so deep does the california dream run in the history and character of our state that it can feel as enduring as our primeval forests or our majestic mountain ranges but there is nothing inevitable about it every dream depends on the dreamers it is up to us to renew the california dream for a new generation and now more than ever it is up to us to defend it and thankfully we have our champion speaker nancy pelosi but there is an administration in washington hostile to california s values and interests california has always helped write america s future and we know the decisions we make would be important at any time but what we do today is even more consequential because of what s happening in our country people s lives freedom security the water we drink the air we breathe they all hang in the balance the country is watching us the world is waiting on us the future depends on us and we will seize this moment california is a giant engine of commerce the most creative and entrepreneurial in the world we have the resources to ensure a decent standard of living for all it s not a question of whether we can do this but whether we will at a time when so much of america is divided we are united our people are big hearted and fair minded when those qualities are more vital than ever i ve seen that again in just the past few weeks i visited paradise after the fires swept through and met people who literally lost everything they owned but were still reaching out to help others i went to san diego and met volunteers providing relief to desperate migrants who others treat like criminals like the 3 year old girl just a year older than my youngest at a shelter who captured my heart i spent time with farmers in fresno who rise and grind before the sun comes up to feed the world there are everyday heroes all over our state who work hard then come home and care for aging parents or new born children or who open their homes to foster kids like my mother tessa did she was a single mom raising two children and working three jobs and she still had room in her heart for more that s the california i know that s the california i love and that s why i am so confident in our future incompetence in the white house make no mistake there are powerful forces arrayed against us not just politicians in washington but drug companies that gouge californians with sky high prices a gun lobby willing to sacrifice the lives of our children to line their pockets polluters who threaten our coastline and pay day lenders who target our most vulnerable in other places interests like these still have a tight grip on power but here in california we have the power to stand up to them and we will we face serious challenges some that have been deferred for too long even in a booming economy there is a disquieting sense that things are not as predictable as they once were that we must now run faster just to stay in place stagnant wages costs that keep rising rent utilities visiting the doctor the basics are increasingly out of reach we face a gulf between the rich and everyone else and it s not just inequality of wealth it s inequality of opportunity a homeless epidemic that should keep each and every one of us up at night an achievement gap in our schools and a readiness gap that holds back millions of our kids and too many of our children know the ache of chronic hunger i ve met families across the state who have to improvise where to tuck their babies in at night making nests out of blankets on the floor or turning dresser drawers into makeshift cradles because they cannot afford a crib these aren t merely policy problems they are moral imperatives so long as they persist we are all diminished we are all touched by the human condition whether we ourselves are homeless or jobless whether we ourselves can pay the bills or have safe drinking water at home we all have our own frailties and vulnerabilities we re all susceptible to suffering and disaster so let us resolve to follow the example of rescuers and rebuilders in paradise and malibu and santa rosa and ventura and make sure our fellow californians share in the compassion and empathy that connect us and make our burdens and anxieties easier to bear our politics doesn t always reward taking on the hardest problems the results of our work may not be evident for a long time but that cannot be our concern we will prepare for uncertain times ahead we will be prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars pay down debt and meet our future obligations and we will build and safeguard the largest fiscal reserve of any state in american history but let me be clear we will be bold we will aim high and we will work like hell to get there here in california we will prove that people of good faith and firm will can still come together to achieve big things we will offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the white house our government will be progressive principled and always on the side of the people california for all this will take courage that s a word that means different things to different people to me courage means doing what is right even when it is hard that will be the mission of our administration we will be a california for all we will not be divided between rural and urban or north and south or coastal and inland we will strive for solidarity and face our most threatening problems together it is with deep faith in our state and our future that i ask you to join me in the work ahead let us be pioneering optimists who look to the future not with trepidation but with creativity and boundless energy this is a time for courage and we will rise to meet it our state has been on a journey together since the worst of the great recession back then we were 27 billion in debt unemployment above 12 percent the worst credit rating of any state in our nation today our economy is larger than all but four nations in the world we ve created nearly 3 million jobs and put away billions for a rainy day where washington failed on the epochal challenge of climate change california led extending our cap and trade system and setting bold targets for lowering greenhouse gas emissions then beating them so much of this progress has happened under the leadership of governor jerry brown it has been an honor to serve with him these past eight years and to learn from him not just as his lieutenant governor but throughout my lifetime when jerry last took the oath of office he reflected on a parable from the sermon on the mount it tells of a foolish man who built his house on sand a storm washed it away but a wise man sought a sounder foundation and when the floods came and the winds blew and beat on the house he built it did not fall for it was founded upon a rock for eight years california has built a foundation of rock our job now is not to rest on that foundation it is to build our house upon it now more than ever we californians know how much a house matters as so many of our neighbors have lost theirs together let us build a house stronger than the coming storms yet open to the world a house that provides shelter to all who need it and sanctuary to all who seek it where opportunity abounds for all who will work for it a true california house sun kissed dream soaked and built with the sweat of honest work we will not have one house for the rich and one for the poor or one for the native born and one for the rest we will build one house for one california because what is a house but a home and california is our home a wall that should never be built in our home every child should be loved fed and safe my wife jennifer and i have four children and there is nothing more important to us than giving them a good and happy life but all kids not just the children of a governor and a filmmaker should have a good life in california not ripped away from their parents at the border not left hungry while politicians seek to pour billions into a wall that should never be built we will support parents so they can give their kids the love and care they need especially in those critical early years when so much development occurs in our home no one should live in constant fear of eviction or spend their whole paycheck to keep a roof overhead we will launch a marshall plan for affordable housing and lift up the fight against homelessness from a local matter to a state wide mission in our home every person should have access to quality affordable health care far away judges and politicians may try to turn back our progress but we will never waver in our pursuit of guaranteed health care for all californians we will use both our market power and our moral power to demand fairer prices for prescription drugs we will stop stigmatizing mental health and start supporting it and in california we will always protect a woman s right to choose in our home we believe in justice for all we will defend the progress we ve made to reform our criminal justice system we will continue the fight against over incarceration and over crowding in our prisons and we will end the outrage of private prisons once and for all in our home working people deserve fair pay the right to join a union and the chance at a middle class life for themselves and their families we will fight not just for growth at any cost but for inclusive sustainable growth we will shape the future of work and connect higher education and skills training to the next generation of middle class jobs because in this time of swift and unsettling change all californians should be able to count on a measure of security and a real shot at opportunity and those who dream of building something of their own a restaurant a bookstore a family farm they will get our support our small businesses help explain why we have one of the biggest economies on earth for me this is personal i will never forget the day i got a 20 tip bussing tables at ramona s restaurant in san rafael i was 16 years old trust me busboys don t get tips like that i know it sounds strange but it changed my life it meant that my hard work mattered and it motivated me to keep going eight years later i started my own business so i know how much hard work and sacrifice is behind every small business in this state and how good it feels when that hard work pays off california must never turn its back on the entrepreneurial spirit that has always defined us and in our home when trouble comes we will stand together when fires strike or the earth shakes we will be there for each other open door for local leaders as a former mayor i learned the wisdom of the african proverb if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together to my friends in the legislature democrats and republicans alike i promise you an open door and an open mind californians didn t send us here to bicker or sulk they get enough of that from washington and let s not forget that it is not only in the corridors of the capitol that change is being forged i will partner with mayors sheriffs and supervisors all over this state i know the pressures you face i ve been there the only way to fix our problems is if you are empowered to lead the way i intend to represent all californians not only those who voted for me i will be a governor for the dock worker in long beach and the farm worker in lost hills the small business owner in corona and the teacher in compton i recognize that many in our rural communities believe that sacramento doesn t care about them doesn t even really see them well i see you i care about you and i will represent you with pride that notion that we re all in this together is a powerful one it s also how i was raised some of you may know that i lost my father just before christmas he was a judge justice bill newsom for him justice was more than a title it was in his bones he believed to his core that all people should be treated fairly and with respect that s always been a bedrock california value to me so 15 years ago when i was a new mayor and i heard politicians in washington sneering at california values and attacking our lgbt community i remembered what my father taught me it s never the wrong time to do the right thing and that s what we did in san francisco phyllis lyon and del martin two women who had been in love for nearly 50 years had the courage to stand up and say those two powerful words i do thousands more followed in their footsteps it took a long time but love won just like fifteen years ago this is a time for courage we will stand up for what s right and we will defend our people my pledge to every californian is this no matter what comes at us i will have your back if we do this right the progress we make will never be unmade as cesar chavez said you cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read you cannot humiliate the person who feels pride you cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore there is a story we tell about our history from sutter s mill to steve jobs s garage about how this is the place where anything is possible this is the coast of dreams and that s true but you shouldn t have to find gold or make it in the movies or create a billion dollar start up to live the california dream it is for everyone everyone in california should have a good job with fair pay every child should have a great school and a teacher who is supported and respected every young person should be able to go to college without crushing debt or to get the training they need to compete and succeed and every senior should be able to retire with security and live at home with dignity that is the california dream not to get rich quick or star on the big screen but to work hard and share in the rewards to leave a better future for our kids the work we have spoken of today cannot be the job of a governor alone or a legislature or even the entire government it will only be achieved if all of us share the spirit of the young dreamer from los angeles i heard recently she said i wasn t born in california but california was born in me there s a spark of california hope and california courage born in all of us it s up to us what we do with it the eyes of the world are upon us now more than ever america needs california it needs the guiding light of our values and the progress they make possible this is where america s future is made this is our charge that is our calling let s get to work thank you and may god bless california this story was originally published january 7 2019 11 58 am

transportation and machinery companies climbed after the u s trade representative said china agreed to buy more agricultural and manufactured products macy s said its sales over the holidays were worse than expected and slashed its annual profit and sales forecasts kohl s and l brands also posted disappointing results and a wide variety of retailers plunged as investors worried that the stock market s december plunge stopped some shoppers from spending as much as they had planned high end consumers even though they re making decent money and the economy is going on relatively strong it may

holiday sales slowed in the middle of december and the department store cut its annual profit and sales forecasts its stock plunged 17 7 percent to 26 11 in heavy trading macy s went public in february 1992 and reached an all time high of almost 73 a share in mid 2015 but four of the five biggest one day plunges in its history have come in the last three years macy s announcement came as a

the stock market fell sharply in october and then took a dramatic drop over the first three weeks of december shortly afterward the federal government went into a partial shutdown that is still ongoing while large numbers retailers took steep losses thursday perkins said the market turmoil is a much bigger problem for companies like macy s because most stocks are owned by relatively wealthy people that means big box stores and companies that sell less expensive goods won t be affected as much as shown by target s stronger sales report perkins added that said amazon likely had a stellar

closely watched barometer of the economy after that though the economy remains healthy in most respects there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months the trade war between the united states and china which has helped depress global growth is likely slowing business investment the stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts is expected to fade and borrowing costs have risen since the federal reserve raised short term interest rates four times last year before rebounding this week stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 percent from their peak oct 2 many economists increasingly see the shutdown should it persist as a drag on the economy michael feroli of j p morgan has downgraded his forecast for growth in the first three months of 2019 because of the shutdown he now expects the economy to grow at a 2 percent annual rate down from his previous estimate of 2 25 percent the shutdown is costing the economy about 1 2 billion a week according to standard poor s some of that loss will be regained after federal workers eventually receive back pay for the time they missed but many government contractors won t be made whole and lost business such as scheduled hotel stays from trips to national parks that won t be taken may not be made up fed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes emphasizing that they will be patient and their policy data dependent by this the fed means that the government s latest readings on hiring inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions yet much of that data will now be unavailable to the fed or anyone else for us one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data raphael bostic president of the fed s atlanta regional bank said wednesday we re worrying about that even some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown for example the january jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure that s because up to 380 000 federal employees who aren t working or being paid during the shutdown but who will return to work afterward could be counted as unemployed for january if so that would raise the unemployment rate by 0 2 percentage point estimated ben herzon an economist at macroeconomic advisers a forecasting firm and the monthly job count could decline by 380 000 if the shutdown continues through the end of january herzon said that could push the monthly job figure into negative territory if all the federal workers eventually receive back pay as occurred after previous shutdowns then the january jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380 000 jobs according to the labor department s bureau of labor statistics future jobs reports could be jeopardized too if the government remains shut down the census bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the bls uses to calculate the unemployment rate census is part of the commerce department which remains closed during the shutdown the bls wouldn t say whether data collection will continue beyond january if the shutdown continues a business journalists organization on friday urged all parties to end the shutdown saying it is deeply troubled by delays in release of the economic reports timely access to data about the united states economy is critical to decision making by our nation s businesses and consumers the society for advancing business editing and writing said in a statement the continued partial shutdown is disrupting the vital flow of information some economic reports have already been missed they include a monthly report on factory orders that was scheduled for monday that report typically provides insights into how much u s companies are spending on large equipment inflation data will also be affected the consumer price index was released friday morning as scheduled because it was prepared by the labor department but the fed s preferred inflation gauge is published by commerce s bureau of economic analysis which is closed and because the agriculture department is closed future reports on wholesale prices and import prices won t include farm related data the bls said thursday a report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits considered a nearly real time reflection of layoffs is still being published but it could be distorted by the shutdown nearly 5 000 federal employees sought benefits two weeks ago according to the latest data available roughly five times the usual figure and only a portion of the government s report on productivity or output per hour worked will be released feb 6 the labor department said that s because that report requires data on the growth of gdp the broadest measure of the economy even after the government fully reopens weeks will likely be needed before all the postponed reports can be prepared and released it may take some time to get a clean read on the economy economists at bank of america merrill lynch said thursday

for investors looking for signs of china s slowing economy and falling consumer confidence cook s warning could not be more definitive ten years on from those heady days the announcement by apple ceo tim cook this month that his company would slash its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in 15 years blaming china s economic deceleration has rattled world markets and dragged down tech stocks in the early years overnight queues formed every time an upgraded model was launched with the product s appeal illustrated by reports that some muddle headed youth had sold their kidneys to get their hands on one this year marks the 10th anniversary of the official launch of apple s iphones in china but it seems like only yesterday the wildly popular smartphones with their revolutionary designs and innovative features caught the imagination of chinese consumers but laying the blame for apple s woes squarely on the chinese economy is misleading for one thing while apple sales may have slowed in china the sales of the locally manufactured huawei xiaomi and oppo brands rose strongly in many ways apple s woes in china are more a result of market competition its annually upgraded models in the past few years have contained fewer new and exciting features making users hold on to their current models for much longer but they are still almost twice as expensive as the locally manufactured brands that boast similar and sometimes even better features still cook did everybody a favour by focusing the international spotlight on the state of the chinese economy particularly its consumer spending at first glance official data also paints a gloomy picture echoing his warning customers at an apple store in beijing china photo ap auto sales for 2018 in china the world s largest automobile market are expected to post their first decline in at least two decades the property market remains sluggish and stock markets are in the doldrums the traditional growth engines of investment and exports appear to have run out of steam in the face of growing uncertainties at home and abroad exacerbated by the ongoing trade war between china and the united states as a result at the annual economic work conference last month chinese leaders vowed to boost consumption this year promising more investment in education childcare elderly care medical care culture and tourism judging by the latest official data and anecdotal evidence it will be an uphill battle in november china s retail sales rose by 8 1 per cent year on year down from 8 6 per cent in october and missing market expectations of 8 8 per cent the smallest rise since may 2003 on social media anecdotes about people cutting their spending have gone viral citing soaring sales of pickles and cheap rice liquor and the share prices of those firms that manufacture them all told chinese consumers are surely getting thrifty in the face of economic uncertainties but there is good reason to believe china s consumer power is not as depressed as widely assumed one notable example is that while they may be getting thrifty at home when they are abroad chinese consumers are as spendthrift as ever chinese tourists have a reputation as big spenders abroad photo alamy almost every chinese consumer becomes a big spender once they are overseas crowding department stores and supermarkets and splashing out on goods ranging from luxury items to daily necessities in sydney the locals have long complained about milk powder being snapped up by chinese tourists and agents acting for companies exporting the product to china research shows chinese tourists made 130 million overseas trips in 2017 a rise of 7 per cent over the year before and spent a total of us 115 29 billion and the latest official data shows chinese citizens registered 340 million trips leaving and coming back to china last year for the chinese government figuring out why chinese consumers are spendthrift abroad is one of the keys to unlocking their spending potential at home of course there are many reasons for chinese consumers big spending ways abroad but quality and more importantly reasonable prices are two of the most important for china s vast middle class many quality consumer goods particularly imported ones are far too expensive at home because of china s import tariffs and restrictions as well as various taxes and fees expanding imports removing those import tariffs and restrictions and reducing those taxes and fees would greatly encourage chinese consumers to loosen their purse strings and spend at home us president donald trump an unlikely champion for the chinese consumer photo bloomberg in that regard the chinese consumers have found an unlikely champion of their cause us president donald trump thanks to us pressure china lowered import tariffs on a wide range of industrial and consumer products three times last year as chinese and american officials work towards a comprehensive deal to defuse the trade war the chinese government is expected to further lower tariffs on and widen market access to foreign imports and services but the chinese government can and should do more to boost spending for one thing it should further reform its tax code by making bigger cuts in personal income tax and value added tax vat in october china raised the threshold for personal income tax from 3 500 yuan to 5 000 yuan per month from us 515 to us 736 but decided not to change the tax brackets which can go as high as 45 per cent such high tax rates have proved a major hindrance to consumption and should be brought down to the level of corporate income tax at 25 per cent meanwhile china should also further streamline the vat which has forced producers to transfer costs to consumers in may beijing reduced the 17 per cent vat tax bracket to 16 per cent and the 11 per cent bracket to 10 per cent now the pressure is on the chinese government to announce further cuts to vat in march when premier li keqiang presents his annual government work report

big move higher in cny the tide has turned for the chinese currency trade talks on track liu he set to go to washington later this month stimulus is coming for consumers and small businesses producer price inflation is heading for deflation territory big move lower in usd cny the tide has turned usd cny moved sharply lower this week to 6 74 after flirting with the 7 level only two months ago we see two main drivers behind the stronger cny 1 rising optimism about a trade deal with the us and 2 an overall weakening of the usd on the back of more dovish speeches by federal reserve members that suggest it will be on hold for a while comment we believe the tide has turned for the cny and the significant depreciation pressure is turning into a moderate strengthening trend a halt to the weakening of the cny is also likely to be part of a trade deal with the us if we are right that they strike a trade deal and the chinese economy recovers gradually from q2 then the cny should see more tailwind ahead we plan to publish our latest forecasts in fx forecast update january 2019 on monday trade talks on track top level negotiations later this month the us and china wrapped up another round of trade negotiations in beijing this week with the mid level talks being extended by one day the extension is seen as a sign of a commitment on both sides to push forward as needed to reach a deal donald trump tweeted during the talks that talks with china are going very well china stated that the meetings were extensive in depth and detailed and laid the foundation for a resolution of the conflict see bloomberg 9 january the talks seemed to be mostly on technical issues such as chinese purchases of us products within agriculture energy and some manufacturing products while the bigger hurdles are left for higher level officials china s head of the negotiations economic tsar and vice president liu he is scheduled to meet with us trade representative robert lighthizer in washington later in january some reports suggest 30 31 january see the straits times 11 january surprisingly liu he showed up shortly at the negotiations in beijing which added to the sentiment that talks were constructive as there was no official at the same level from the us delegation north korea s leader kim jong un visited china this week on his birthday it was seen by some as putting pressure on trump to make a deal see new york times 8 january kim jong un and xi jinping discussed a summit between kim and trump expected to take place soon see reuters 8 january according to state media in north korea xi jinping accepted an invitation to visit the country see scmp 10 january china gave the long awaited approval of us exports of five genetically modified crops this week see reuters 8 january

after china has opened up further for investments in the financial area see reuters 8 january comment we continue to look for a trade deal within three to six months it should be positive for equities and pave the way for a gradual chinese economic recovery so far talks do not seem to have met any big bumps in the road there are still some hurdles to be sorted out when it comes to chinese subsidies and industrial policy which could delay a deal beyond the ceasefire deadline of 1 march however both trump and xi seem keen on getting a deal and ending the trade war and we believe they can reach a compromise on the thorny issues trump is set to get important gifts for key voters in several swing states as china is set to buy more agriculture products and keep the lower 15 tariff rate on cars

private economy as consumers and private sector companies have reduced spending due to higher uncertainty and tight credit availability we are not likely to see a big fiscal stimulus plan as in 2008 09 but more measures on a step by step basis we are still awaiting an announcement on tax cuts for consumers the monetary easing has fuelled a big decline in bond yields see chart on previous page we

territory in coming months due to the fall in commodity prices see bottom chart xi jinping may be readying for a long awaited plenum meeting of the central committee of the communist party this month
