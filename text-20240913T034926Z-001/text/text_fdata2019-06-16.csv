programme tsp october 2018 2020 are beginning to show positive developments as the twin deficit challenge of the fiscal and the current account are coming under control 9 government has started realising a budget surplus this is being achieved through containing expenditures by reducing the wage bill and plugging revenue leakages through improving the zimbabwe revenue authority zimra s tax management revenue system and revenue enhancement measures such as a 2 intermediate money transfer tax among others 10 furthermore the 2019 budget primarily targets macro economic and fiscal stabilisation and implementation of quick win flagship and high impact projects and programmes which will lay a solid foundation for private sector led growth 11 on the other hand with regards to prices fiscal consolidation measures reinforced with a tight monetary stance together with liberalisation of the exchange rate are containing inflationary pressures which are expected to slow down in the third quarter 12 however the 2019 gdp growth rate is expected to be weighed down due to unfavourable el nino induced drought the devastating cyclone idai foreign currency shortages and constrained spending being imposed by fiscal reforms 13 in addition challenges in fuel and electricity availability are also a factor weighing down economic performance cyclone idai 14 the 2019 annual meetings come at a time when southern africa as you might be aware is in the aftermath of the devastating tropical cyclone idai that hit three countries namely malawi mozambique and zimbabwe 15 cyclone idai left a trail of destruction in its wake in the three countries where lives and livelihoods were lost and infrastructure was damaged among others 16 in zimbabwe cyclone idai hit the four provinces of manicaland masvingo midlands and mashonaland east with the most affected areas being chimanimani and chipinge districts where approximately 344 people lost their lives 17 on behalf of the government of zimbabwe his excellency the president of the republic of zimbabwe and on my own behalf i would like to acknowledge the support from the international community and also in particular the heartfelt condolences from the bank group extended by president dr adesina on his behalf and that of the bank group towards the victims of the devastating cyclone 18 the support from various development partners including the bank s swift response towards the disaster is highly commendable and appreciated 19 to this end the bank instituted a three party multi pronged disaster mitigation relief and reconstruction effort to assist zimbabwe mozambique and malawi through establishment of a special relief fund amounting to us 400 000 for zimbabwe specifically set aside for aid efforts in some worst affected areas which will be administered by the united nations children fund unicef setting up of an economic recovery funding by the bank s transitional support facility tsf to help disburse us 100 million this quarter to assist the three countries and leading global efforts for the beira regional corridor reconstruction plan given the vital importance of this critically needed economic route for zimbabwe and its neighbours 20 mention should also be made of the bank s participation at the cyclone idai response round table co hosted by the united kingdom and portugal on the side lines of the imf wb spring meetings in april 2019 which is well appreciated regional integration for africa s economic prosperity 21 this year s theme regional integration for africa s economic prosperity resonates well with the thrust of the african union to make africa a borderless continent 22 let s not forget that african regional integration was a dream of the continent s leaders which gave impetus to the creation of the organisation of african unity in 1963 the forerunner to the current african union 23 the theme is also in tandem with the bank s high 5 priorities of which one of them is integrate africa 24 to date many regional groupings are characterised by uncoordinated initiatives political conflicts and low levels of intra regional trade research by the african development bank shows that intra african trade is the lowest of all global regions at approximately 15 as compared to 54 in the north america free trade area 70 within the european union and 60 in asia 25 integration is essential for africa s development as it brings with it a lot of benefits to individual countries and the continent as a whole in that it strengthens competitiveness and trading capacity market expansion and upgrading of value chains as integration particularly creates an appropriate enabling environment for private sector development lower transaction costs lower investment risks markets develops infrastructure programmes in support of economic growth development and regional integration provides a framework for coordinating policies and regulations develops strong public sector institutions and good governance reduces social exclusion and develops an inclusive civil society promotes regional peace and security and political engagement among members builds environmental programmes at the regional level strengthens the region s interaction with other regions of the world improves intra state connectivity and enhances and solidifies domestic reforms 26 africa therefore must unite not simply to enhance the continent s weight in global affairs but to meet the very basic needs of its population for if we build for ourselves then others will come 27 thus it is pertinent to note that in grappling with challenges facing regional integration efforts in africa proponents for greater unity identified the following as pre requisites for success in integrating africa involving business groups professionals and other sectors of society more actively in all integration issues achieving an appropriate balance between public and private economic initiatives reconciling the sometimes conflicting interests of countries with diverse sizes natural resources and economic performances pursuing a pace of integration that is simultaneously ambitious and realistic and rationalising africa s many different regional institutions in order to reduce overlap and inefficiency leveraging on such comparative advantage by promoting region building and regional integration which is a pre requisite for sustainable development exploiting africa s huge infrastructure gap necessitating african policy makers in their pursuit of greater integration to advance their efforts towards promoting peace security and socio economic development strengthening the capacities of institutional frameworks for intra african trade including improved coordination between the african union and sub regional bodies putting in place effective domestic mechanisms for monitoring the consistency of national policies with regional frameworks need to be put in place inclusive development where no one is left behind especially the private sector and the informal trading networks is the way to go zimfund 28 as you might be aware the current four year mandate for the zimbabwe multi donor trust fund zimfund will expire in october 2019 government notes that the implementation of certain approved activities is expected to go beyond the mandate of the current zimfund programme 29 to this end government is of the view that there is need to extend the mandate of zimfund by a year to enable completion of the project activities 30 therefore government wants to acknowledge the afdb for managing the zimfund the zimfund has seen tremendous improvement in power and water sanitation projects with state of the art equipment being installed 31 this impact was witnessed by outgoing executive director dr heinrich gaomab ii who visited during the first quarter of 2019 bank support 32 government would like to re assure the bank of its commitment to project implementation as evidenced by the improved progress across all projects being supported under the african development fund adf 33 we pledge our support to continue instituting measures that will

held regularly as stated in the protocols of agreement regular portfolio review meetings are held reported challenges are acted upon timeously government continues to review internal processes that

flexible instrument agreement staff monitored programme in april 2019 on macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that will underpin dialogue on the country s economic policies 41 the smp will be

a dovish tone in a bid to temper euro appreciation ahead of a potential shift towards looser monetary policy as growth and inflation headwinds prevail two weeks ago the market bought eur usd as fed officials hinted rate cuts could be coming and the ecb revealed a reluctance to follow the fed down the road of monetary easing today draghi will get a second chance to talk down the eur when he speaks at sintra wrote danske bank senior trading desk strategist vladimir miklashevsky adding he will have to come up big i e signal rate cuts and or that qe is coming to convince the market to sell eur usd before the fed likely makes a dovish shift tomorrow it is crunch time for the ecb and the fed and we stick to our call for eur usd to rise to 1 15 in 3m as the fed is set to out ease the ecb

conditions index plummeted twenty six points its largest monthly decline on record to 8 6 new orders receded while shipments increased modestly with investors focused on this week s fed releases are likely to be interpreted for their impact thereto with misses fuelling rate cut bets and above forecast deliveries tempering expectations for imminently lower us interest rates advertisement despite fed easing being expected to yield a bearish dollar narrative a lack of euro appeal could offset any support gained from narrowing policy differentials we doubt eur usd is able to take advantage of the soft dollar environment wrote ing economists adding the ecb looks very close to easing again potentially in september with a deposit rate cut and re starting asset purchases geared more towards corporate debt brexit and italian politics suggest eur usd may remain trapped in a 1 10 15 range until year end eur usd forecast update the euro to us dollar exchange rate kicked off the weekly

pairing plummeted on wednesday despite data revealing the us consumer price index cpi barely rose in may on thursday industrial production in the eurozone slumped by 0 5 in april after slumping in march by 0 4 this weighed on the single currency as it likely put further pressure on the european central bank ecb meanwhile last week also saw the european union step up pressure to bring italy into

the country s debt is the utmost importance for growth for the stability of the eurozone the pairing continued to slump at the end last week as washington blamed iran for thursday s attacks in the gulf of oman this likely provided the safe haven us dollar with an upswing of support as risk appetite slumped and concerns of a us iran confrontation arose meanwhile on friday us retail sales control

crown prince mohammed bin salman deputy prime minister and minister of defense said that saudi arabia does not want a war in the region but stressed that it will not hesitate in dealing with any threat against our people sovereignty and vital interests in an interview the crown prince said that the kingdom supported the re imposition of us sanctions on iran out of our belief that the international community needed to take a decisive stance against iran he hoped that the iranian regime would opt to become a normal state and cease its malign behavior the crown prince said that the attacks on oil tankers in the gulf oil facilities in the kingdom and abha airport underscore the importance of our demands for the international community to take a decisive stance against an expansionist regime that has supported terrorism and spread death and destruction over the past decades not only in the region but the whole world he criticized iran for using the nuclear deal s economic benefits to support its hostile activities in the region through its tools of chaos and destruction while stressing that the kingdom s hand is always extended for peace he said that the iranian regime did not respect the japanese prime minister as a guest in iran during his visit and in effect responded to his efforts by attacking the two oil tankers in the gulf one of which was apparently japanese it also employed its militias to carry out a heinous attack against abha airport this is clear evidence of the iranian regime s policy and intentions to target the security and stability of the region the crown prince said that saudi arabia places great importance on the strategic ties with the us considering it a main factor in achieving regional security and stability he also expressed confidence that our strategic relations with the us will not be affected by media campaigns or arbitrary stances the kingdom constantly seeks to clarify facts and misconceptions by some parties in the us and other countries we listen to various views and we welcome constructive and rational advise but ultimately our priority is our national interest he said saudi arabia backed all efforts to reach a political solution to the yemeni crisis but the houthi militias prioritize iran s agenda over the interests of yemen and its people the kingdom cannot accept the presence of militias operating outside the apparatus of states on our borders he said adding we not only seek to liberate yemen from the iranian militias but achieve prosperity and stability for all of the people of yemen the crown prince said in the interview that his country is greatly concerned with the security and stability of sudan not only due to the strategic importance of its location and danger of the collapse of its state institutions but also the strong brotherly ties that bind us he pledged to continue to support our brothers in all fields until sudan achieves what it deserves in prosperity and progress on the syrian crisis he said riyadh is working with its allies to achieve its objectives including defeating isis preventing the re emergence of terrorist organizations dealing with the destabilizing iranian influence in syria and using all possible means to achieve political transition in line with resolution 2254 in a manner that preserves syria s unity the crown prince described the murder of saudi citizen jamal khashoggi as a very painful crime the kingdom is seeking to achieve full justice and accountability without getting distracted by positions taken by some for their own domestic considerations that are known to everyone he said any party seeking to politically exploit the case must cease doing so and present whatever evidence it has to the courts in the kingdom to help achieve justice he also pledged to continue to forge forward in our unwavering approach in confronting all forms of extremism and sectarianism and the policies that support them we will not waste our time in offering partial solutions to extremism as history has proven the futility of such efforts said the crown prince on the economy he expressed commitment to the initial public offering of saudi aramco given it is under the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner but said setting the location of the ipo now is premature and he noted the completion of several preliminary measures in preparation for the offering he said that saudi vision 2030 has moved from planning and design to implementation on all levels and started finding results what is happening in the kingdom is not simply a set of financial and economic reforms aiming to realize specific figures but a comprehensive restructuring of the kingdom s economy aimed at transforming economic and development performance in the medium and long terms we are now shifting from a rentier economy to one that is characterized by productivity and global competitiveness he said he expressed that vision 2030 and its programs like all strategic plans has to be reviewed and updated according to circumstances that may arise during implementation without compromising its foundation or objectives i am proud that saudi citizens are driving change at a time many feared the vision will face resistance due to the size of the change it entails he added here is the full text of the interview the region has recently witnessed dangerous developments that threaten the security and stability of the region and world what is saudi arabia s stance towards these developments and how does the kingdom deal with this escalation saudi arabia s stance is clear as stipulated in its official statements it does not want a war in the region but we will not hesitate in dealing with any threat against our people sovereignty and vital interests our priority is our national interest and achieving the aspirations of our people through the economic and social goals of the kingdom s vision 2030 and through development and economic and social reform this demands a stable and enabling environment within the kingdom and region this is why you will find that the role of the kingdom whether in the arabian gulf north africa horn of africa or other regions is supporting stability and peace this is a policy that the kingdom has adopted since its establishment whereby it has always sought to shun division sectarianism and extremism and instead preserve unity and stability in the region and international peace the kingdom also plays an important role in the international community through its efforts to ensure that oil supplies pass through vital routes that surround it with the aim of protecting the stability of the global economy the world witnessed how we dealt with the iranian tanker in the red sea it was handled based on what our morals and principles and what international treaties and norms demand in return we see how the iranian regime and its proxies have carried out sabotage operations against four oil tankers near fujairah port two of the tankers were saudi this confirms the approach followed by this regime in the region and entire world plenty of evidence supports this and which has accumulated over many years we must not forget that this regime had openly declared since 1979 that its priority and main goal is to export the revolution it seeks to achieve this at the expense of the aspirations of its people and the peoples of the region this explains the behavior of the iranian regime the export of the revolution and wilayat al faqih principle demand the destabilization of countries and the region stoking sectarianism spreading extremism and dedicating the resources of the iranian people towards financing and arming terrorist militias despite this the kingdom has constantly extended its hand for peace with iran to avoid the horrors of wars and destruction on the region and its people saudi arabia even supported the nuclear deal with iran because the kingdom has throughout history never spared an effort to resolve any crisis through diplomatic and peaceful means we had hoped that the iranian regime would have taken advantage of this initiative to change its behavior towards the countries in the region and see it as a first step towards iran s return to the international community as a normal state unfortunately iran misused the economic benefits of this deal to support its hostile acts in the region it continued to violate international resolutions it was better off dedicating the economic benefits in improving the lives of the iranian people developing infrastructure and achieving economic development instead of continuing its destructive behavior in the region iran s recklessness has reached unprecedented levels after the nuclear pact the iranian revolutionary guards corps budget increased and it intensified its support for sectarian militias in the region and even the whole world we have all seen how terrorist and hostile iranian operations were recently thwarted in europe this is why the kingdom supported the re imposition of us sanctions on iran it did so out of our belief that the international community needed to take a decisive stance against iran it must also take the necessary measures to limit the regime s ability to spread chaos and destruction in the whole world recent developments in the region including the targeting of aramco oil pumping stations by the iran backed houthi militias underscores the importance of our demand for the international community to take a decisive stance against an expansionist regime that has supported terrorism and spread death and destruction over the past decades not only in the region but the whole world the choice is clear before iran does it want to be a normal country that plays a constructive role in the international community or does it want to be a rogue state we hope that the iranian regime would opt to become a normal country and cease its malign behavior you have pointed to the american stance on iran which coincides with the saudi stance as is the case with the majority of strategic issues recent months have however seen criticism directed at the kingdom from within the united states over a number of issues especially the jamal khashoggi case has this criticism affected the strategic cooperation between the two countries preview_thumbnail military says the internet must be blocked the kingdom places great importance on the strategic ties with the us they are relations that extend to more than 70 years during which this strategic partnership has defeated several challenges that have targeted the security stability and sovereignty of our countries our ties with the us are important and pivotal not only for achieving joint interests whether economic on the security level or others but they are a main factor in achieving regional security and stability together with the us and in cooperation with several countries in the region and world we seek to achieve sustainable stability in the region that would establish the necessary environment to meet the aspirations of its people to live in dignity and real development we do so by confronting the forces of chaos destruction and instability embodied in terrorist organizations and their state sponsors starting with the iranian regime and confronting all forms of extremism as for media campaigns or some stances in the us they certainly do not serve the joint interests of our countries throughout the kingdom s history however we have previously faced such campaigns that are often biased and not based on accurate information we constantly seek to clarify facts and misconceptions by some parties in the us and other countries we listen to various views and we welcome constructive and rational advise but ultimately our priority is our national interest our priority is the citizen in riyadh jeddah jazan tabuk dammam and other regions in the kingdom not the beliefs or views of others about the kingdom throughout the kingdom s history we have managed to work with our main allies despite natural differences that exist between all countries by respecting the sovereignty of nations and avoiding meddling in their internal affairs we expect nothing less than reciprocal treatment when it comes to our sovereignty and internal affairs i am confident that our strategic relations with the us will not be affected by media campaigns or arbitrary stances as for the murder of citizen jamal khashoggi as i have previously said this is a very painful crime that is unprecedented in the history of the kingdom such acts are alien to our culture and contradict our principles and values the kingdom has taken the necessary measures whether through the judiciary to hold the perpetrators to account or through taking procedural measures to prevent such unfortunate crimes from taking place again in the future these measures stem first and foremost from the importance we place in the kingdom on the lives of every saudi citizen irrespective of their views these measures have not and will not be affected by any other factors we are a state governed by the rule of law and it is unacceptable for the life of a citizen to be violated in such a painful way under any circumstance unfortunately the suspects are government employees and we seek to achieve full justice any party seeking to politically exploit the case must cease doing so and present whatever evidence it has to the courts in the kingdom to help achieve justice does the agreement with the us on iran apply to the situation in syria especially in wake of the american decision to withdraw from the country we are in agreement on the objectives in syria which are the defeat of the isis preventing the re emergence of terrorist organizations dealing with the destabilizing iranian influence in syria and using all possible means to achieve political transition according to resolution 2254 in a manner that preserves syria s unity we are working with friendly countries to achieve these goals how do you interpret the japanese prime minister s recent visit to iran and his meeting with the supreme leader we thank the japanese prime minister for his good intentions and the kingdom s hand is always extended for peace to achieve security and stability of the region the iranian regime however did not respect the japanese prime minister as a guest in iran during his visit and in effect responded to his efforts by attacking the two oil tankers in the gulf one of which was apparently japanese it also employed its militias to carry out a heinous attack against abha airport this is clear evidence of the iranian regime s policy and intentions to target the security and stability of the region iran is the party that is constantly escalating tensions in the region it carries out terrorist attacks and immoral acts of aggression directly or through its militias the problem lies in tehran not anywhere else as i have previously stated iran must choose between becoming a normal country that plays a constructive role in the international community or remain a rogue state and assume the international consequences of its choice the turkish president and other turkish officials have recently escalated their rhetoric in questioning the credibility of the kingdom s judiciary and held the kingdom and its leadership responsible in khashoggi s case how do you respond to such accusations jamal khashoggi is a saudi citizen and there is no doubt that what happened to him was painful and unfortunate the kingdom has taken all measures to hold the perpetrators accountable and the accused have been referred to the judiciary the judiciary in the kingdom is an independent authority and no one can meddle in its affairs we confront any development firmly and without hesitation by taking the steps that are necessary to achieve justice rectify any flaw and prevent mistakes from taking place again while disregarding any claims and accusations as for the statements by some turkish officials towards the kingdom the kingdom as the home of the two holy mosques seeks strong ties with all islamic countries including turkey this is important for the interest of the region and joint islamic work in particular in the kingdom we work in service of the holy mosques and their visitors we work on achieving the security and stability of our nation not becoming embroiled in disputes that harm the interests of our nation and islamic world we will forge forward in achieving these goals without getting distracted by positions taken by some for their own domestic considerations that are known to everyone four years have passed since the arab coalition kicked off its operations in yemen how do you assess the political and military progress that has been achieved and what are the prospects for resolving the crisis in yemen especially in wake of the stockholm deal and terrorist houthi attacks on saudi oil pumping stations and its najran and abha airports many parties forget or claim to forget how the crisis in yemen first broke out the coalition operations began after the international community had exhausted all political solutions between yemeni parties and the houthi militias one must be reminded that the kingdom is the pioneer of the political solution it presented the gcc initiative and worked on achieving peaceful political transition in yemen in 2011 it supported the national dialogue and presented over 7 billion dollars in economic support for yemen between 2012 and 2014 since 2011 the kingdom s efforts have sought to achieve smooth political transition in a manner that preserves the country s independence and sovereignty and unity of its political and security institutions to prevent it from slipping into chaos indeed the yemeni parties met in riyadh and signed the gcc initiative and its implementation mechanism all yemeni parties including the houthis were present at the comprehensive national dialogue unfortunately iran obstructed the political process in yemen through its proxy houthi militias which started to occupy yemeni cities and seize the state s various resources and capabilities the kingdom offered all possible opportunities to resolve the situation through peaceful means but iran was following a policy of imposing a new reality in arab countries by force of arms unfortunately the international community at the time did not confront iran s expansionist and sectarian agenda iran therefore continued to try through its militias to impose its control in yemen the yemeni people and leadership however made a historic stand against this iranian interference along with our brothers in the coalition we responded immediately to the appeal of the legitimate government to protect yemen and its people and our national security the kingdom cannot accept the presence of militias operating outside the apparatus of states on our borders most yemeni territories have been liberated and we have supported all efforts to reach a political solution to the crisis unfortunately the houthi militias prioritize iran s agenda over the interests of yemen and its people we have recently witnessed the terrorist attack on oil facilities and najran airport which the houthis boasted of claiming this once again demonstrates that these militias do not care for the interests of the yemeni people or any political process to resolve the crisis their actions reflect the priorities of tehran not sanaa the arab coalition s stance is very clear about resolving the crisis we support efforts to reach a political solution based on un security council resolution 2216 the gcc initiative and its implementation mechanism and national dialogue outcomes we accept the participation of all yemeni parties in the political process but according to the three references the kingdom will not accept the militias to remain outside state control we will pursue this ultimate goal and maintain our operations and continue on offering support to the yemeni people in their effort to protect their independence and sovereignty despite our sacrifice the kingdom will also maintain its humanitarian and economic relief in yemen we not only seek to liberate yemen from the iranian militias but achieve prosperity and stability for all of the people of yemen you have spoken of a dream to transform the middle east into the new europe how do you confront obstacles in reaching this dream given the major regional political upheaval and economic and development challenges we must not become hostages of temporary conditions that prevent us from fulfilling our primary duty as leaders in the region of reviving our states today s challenges must also not prevent us from working promptly to achieve a better future for the coming generations you mentioned political upheaval this is undoubtedly taking place in the region at the same time however we must look at the overall arab region and realize that the majority of the countries are unanimous in prioritizing a dignified life for the people and achieving security and stability the people do not want to be hostages to ideological conflicts that waste their potential we are before a precedent in that everyone shares one goal competition between the majority of our countries focuses on reaching the best standard of living for the people attracting investment and achieving development in all fields the source of political upheaval is well known they are terrorist groups such as isis al qaeda the muslim brotherhood and policies of the iranian regime the top sponsor of terrorism and extremism we will not waste our time in offering partial solutions to extremism as history has proven the futility of such efforts god willing we will continue to forge forward in our unwavering approach in confronting all forms of extremism and sectarianism and the policies that support them the kingdom is the home of the two holy mosques it has been blessed with natural resources a strategic location and wise leadership since the days of its founder and until the present reign of the custodian of the two holy mosques it is also blessed with its great and innovative people today it is living in security stability and prosperity it is unbecoming for this great nation not to occupy leading positions in all fields regardless of the conditions and challenges we will not rest until we first achieve this goal for our nation and then our brothers in the region how do you assess the upheaval in sudan and the political changes we are greatly concerned with the security and stability of sudan not only due to the strategic importance of its location and danger of the collapse of its state institutions but also the strong brotherly ties that bind us our brothers and sisters in sudan have been and continue to be a part of our social fabric they have contributed greatly to our progress in all fields we will not spare any effort to achieve the security and stability for sudan and its people the kingdom has taken measures to support the brotherly people of sudan including an economic aid package and depositing 250 million dollars in its central bank we will continue to support our brothers in all fields until sudan achieves the prosperity and progress it deserves three years after launching saudi vision 2030 where are we at we moved from the planning and design phase to implementation on all levels and started seeing results on the ground on developing the financial sector for example we have seen noteworthy progress after the launching of the vision as the saudi market joined three global indices the ftse the morgan stanley msci emerging markets index and s p dow jones indices this will pump capital worth billions into the market the kingdom has seen a 40 increase in investors in investment funds a first since 2006 the kingdom has recently achieved the greatest leap among some of the world s most competitive countries in the imd world competitiveness rankings 2019 ranking 26th moving up 13 ranks compared to last year and ranking 7th among g20 member states in the telecommunications and information sector we witnessed remarkable development the contribution of the digital economy to the gdp increased both directly and indirectly with the kingdom becoming one of the top 10 fastest e commerce growing countries worldwide with a rate of 32 simultaneously internet speeds have improved fourfold to accelerate digital transformation the kingdom was also the first country in the middle east and north africa region to roll out 5g network services back in 2018 in the eastern province for trial today we have 1 000 communication towers in the kingdom that are offering this new service and expanding in the field of energy and industry non oil exports increased by 22 in 2018 compared to 2017 and we launched many industrial cities in different regions across the kingdom this confirms the keenness of the government of the custodian of the two holy mosques to achieve balanced and comprehensive development in various cities and regions including the king salman energy park spark jizan and waad al shamal where the first phase of the production of phosphates and phosphate fertilizers has been achieved laying down the foundation for the second phase which will make the kingdom god willing the second largest producer of phosphate fertilizers globally i would like to note that what is happening in the kingdom is not simply a set of financial and economic reforms aiming to realize specific figures but a comprehensive restructuring of the kingdom s macro economy aimed at improving economic and development performance in the medium and long terms we have undertaken major economic and structural reforms that contribute to fiscal balance and financial control and the diversification of income sources while maintaining a continuing macroeconomic growth sustaining public finances supporting social expenditures raising government spending efficiency and stimulating the private sector which is considered a key partner in growth and development and achieving the vision s objectives but there are claims about setbacks in some of vision 2030 s initiatives what is happening in the kingdom is a comprehensive structural change in the economy aimed at creating a shift in medium and long term economic performance the vision 2030 and its programs like all strategic plans has to be reviewed and updated according to circumstances that may arise during implementation without compromising its foundation or objectives and with the aim of achieving top results especially at a time we have gained a higher quality of decision making based on studies analyses figures facts and data responding to your question about some vision related initiatives that might be in decline we do not expect this the vision s programs are effectively contributing to the economic transformation process and we are now shifting from a rentier economy to one that is characterized by productivity and global competitiveness some may argue that the public investment fund pif is giving the private sector a run for its money with its direct investments and mega projects what role does it play in achieving the vision and how can negative effects be avoided in line with vision 2030 and in order to achieve its objectives it was important to review the role of the pif and transform it into a state sovereign fund in 2015 we re launched pif with a new vision and mission aimed at developing new sectors in saudi arabia investing in leading international partnerships and the formation of a new board of directors under my leadership between 2016 and 2018 the number of staffers increased from 40 to nearly 500 employees meanwhile pif assets have increased from sr500 billion to sr 1 trillion nearly doubling within two years the pif is now a vital state instrument for economic diversification and targets both domestic and international investments domestically it targets major project investments that the private sector alone cannot finance such as neom the red sea project and qiddiya that will offer dozens if not hundreds of good investment opportunities for the private sector for pif and the government it is of utmost importance to involve the private sector we have earmarked 13 programs for privatization giving the private sector a greater opportunity to participate in investment achieve profitable returns and improve spending efficiency and services in terms of foreign investments apart from achieving attractive returns on its assets pif will play an important role in establishing economic partnerships that will help boost knowledge exchange stimulate high efficiency investments and enhance local content generating long term returns for future generations the pif also targets new strategic sectors such as tourism and entertainment these sectors have an important dimension in stimulating foreign investment regional development creating a large number of jobs and improving overall quality of life the pif operates under an outstanding level of corporate governance and transparent investment strategy which were approved after completing its reform and governance process in 2015 it operates within a system that includes a board executive committee and investment committee that play clear roles in guaranteeing distinguished levels of professionalism in performance the pif also has investment portfolios distributed according to development priorities such as in saudi companies promising sectors and major projects what are the latest developments in the privatization program we now have an exceptional and global center specialized in privatization that is built on the best practices drawn from experiences of more than 20 countries that have undertaken privatization in the past when establishing the center it was taken into account that it contains a legal structure ensuring the rights of both the state and investors we have identified promising opportunities for privatization in 12 sectors our goal from the privatization program is for it to strengthen the effectiveness of the role of government and to maximize the contribution of the private sector to gdp in 2019 the national center for privatization ncp supported the signing of five agreements with a total value exceeding sr 12 5 billion inked by local and international companies in various fields and with 70 foreign financing from six countries these agreements include projects that focus on sewage treatment desalination plants and health services through dialysis centers the ncp is currently working on finalizing agreements totaling over sr2 billion and that cover flour mills and medical and shipping services these agreements are expected to be completed by the end of 2019 work is also underway for privatizing education sector projects expected in 2020 with investments adding up to about sr1 billion in the future the private sector will also have the largest investment share in electricity sector projects especially power generation plans and including major renewable energy projects previously announced amidst such economic transformation what is your highness s message to citizens i am proud that saudi citizens are driving change at a time many feared the vision will face resistance due to the size of the change it entails many have told me that the most difficult part i will face in realizing this strategic transformation is resistance but i saw this as a very small factor when looking at saudi youth that is now leading change i would like to pay tribute to the role of young people in the transformation currently taking place in the kingdom it is a young vision with a young spirit discussions have shifted from a change desired from the state to the change we all make together when following news about the anticipated saudi aramco s ipo in global markets we find there is a lack of information about the issue and the timeline where are matters now and what actions have been taken in this regard we are committed to the initial public offering of saudi aramco but under the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner as i mentioned previously i expect that it will happen between 2020 and the beginning of 2021 and setting the location of the ipo now is premature much of the work has been successfully completed and the timeframe for the offering will depend on several factors including market conditions for the ipo given its size and aramco s acquisition of a majority stake in sabic from pif the latter is a deal which would create a stellar transformation through establishing a fully integrated national energy and petrochemical company that will lead the global energy sector and further enhance saudi aramco s growth potential and profitability in volatile oil markets as for preparations for aramco s ipo several important actions have been taken including the issuance of the hydrocarbon tax system the re issuance of an exclusive franchise agreement the appointment of a new board of directors and the first ever releasing of aramco s annual financial report and audit of its oil reserves all these measures reinforce transparency which is a core principle of saudi vision 2030 which is committed to protecting the kingdom s interests and those of potential investors saudi aramco for its part has also logged several achievements within its internal program in preparation for the ipo one of the most important features of the program was amending internal rules and regulations the transformation into a joint stock company and releasing its financial report meeting requirements of potential financial markets for the ipo this has left investors satisfied worldwide as we have seen through the recent bond offering this article has been adapted from its original source
the week ahead is likely to provide some clarification for investors on three fronts that have been a source of uncertainty the fomc meeting with updated forecasts is center stage the credit markets are pushing the fed to be aggressive but can be disappointed in the eurozone the preliminary pmi may confirm a modest even if uneven recovery the g20 summit is the focus of much attention as many see it as the last opportunity to avoid a further escalation of trade tensions between the world s two largest economies in a repeat of the buenos aires gathering at the end of last year fomc us jobs data disappointed and prices were soft the 3 month to 10 year yield curve continues to be inverted after the may retail sales data that showed a resilient consumer the interpolated odds of a rate cut now were halved to around 15 the implied yield of the january 2020 futures contract is about 1 705 currently the effective average fed funds rate is 2 37 that implies 67 bp of easing continues to be discounted which is 100 confidence of two 25 bp moves and roughly a 2 3 chance of a third cut this year the odds of a third cut this year may be a bit exaggerated if one assumes the fed could lower the interest on reserves further away from upper end of the target range after next week s meeting there are four meetings left in the year the fomc statement will likely recognize that the slowing of jobs growth which is still sufficient to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest in the generation and new cyclical lows of the underemployment rate it will also recognize that prices pressures remain soft previously the fed maintained that the weaker inflation readings for transitory it may be too early to abandon such views the confidence in the assertion may have weakened the same crosscurrents that led the fed to shift to its current patient and wait and see stance from the previous tightening bias are likely to drive the fomc to adopt a more formal easing bias in its word cues these crosscurrents include trade tensions the slowing of global growth the risk of a disruptive uk exit from the eu as well as the fading fiscal stimulus in the us and the maturing of the expansion at the same time the fed officials have recognized that the strength of the labor market and the retail sales report points to stronger household consumption the point is that while the fed has the same information set if not a bit more than market participants it does not have the urgency to move it wants to assure the market that it can and will ease policy when the outlook warrants a more moderate position looked for the fed to take out an insurance policy as it were later in late q3 or early q4 if the crosscurrents have been lifted the economy outperformed in q1 and maybe have slowed below trend in q2 the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker for q2 rose to 2 1 from 1 4 after revising the annualized personal consumption component of gdp to a very respectable 3 9 this implies that net net the other parts of the economy government investment and net exports contracted in q2 the economic performance in early q3 and the global outlook may be more important than the current economic readings an insurance policy does not require a 50 bp move the resumption of asset purchases or the start of a monetary cycle emu flash pmi there is a certain pessimism that hangs over discussions about europe the export oriented model has been undermined by the slowing of global growth and in particular china but also turkey italy and the ec are sliding toward a confrontation the risks of no deal brexit and falling back to wto commitments are increasing and although the ineptitude of the uk is broadly recognized a failure to reach an agreement does not reflect well on the eu either and it will bear some cost to the disruption the eurozone hit a soft patch but it appears to be emerging from it even in not in a spectacular way the flash pmi readings for june are the most important and do a fairly good job of anticipating the final even though the month is barely half over the manufacturing pmi has been below the 50 boom bust level since january and averaged 49 1 in q1 it appears to have bottomed in march at 47 5 if it were to up to 48 0 as the median forecast in the bloomberg survey shows it would be a four month high the services pmi has been more resilient which also underscores the source of the shock is external it averaged 52 4 in q1 after bottoming in last december and january at 51 2 the composite put in a low in january and february 50 9 51 0 it averaged 51 5 in q1 and if it ticks up like the economists project the q2 average will be a little higher the ecb does not need to feel action is urgent it will provide new targeted refinancing loans the macro situation is at crossroads and the outcome will be considerably clear later this year two foreseeable potential shocks are a no deal brexit and trade conflict with the us the escalation of the us china trade war is not good for europe either on several different levels since draghi s term is nearly over there is an understandable reluctance to pre commit such as extending the forward guidance out much further now mid 2020 the other policy levers rates and asset purchases could come at a high price deeper negative yields and credibility issues after ending the purchases so recently as us tariffs on china will have the unintended consequence of accelerating local companies climb up the value added ladder so too will the us criticism of europe and the weaponization of access to the dollar market accelerate europe s commitment to pursue alternatives it is not just about the sanctions on iran but also the threats of sanctions on germany and companies involved with constructing the pipeline with russia and just like the us can threaten to remove the special treatment is gives goods from hong kong not subject to the tariffs on china it can threaten to exempt the uk from a tariff on european autos sun tzu taught to divided your enemies but the us appears to go out of its way to unite them just like huawei will break the us duopoly on mobile operating systems many countries want to break the us dollar clearing monopoly which allows it to project its authority where ever there are dollar payments the combination of the uk leaving the eu and the us erratic politics bush obama trump is a force that can forge a more united europe if some modus vivendi can be found on the monetary and economic union if european leaders cannot seize this opportunity it will be ill prepared for the pressure comes as the world s two largest economies simultaneously pursue import substitution strategies trade while the uk leaves and the us economic nationalism rises the eu has been securing new trade agreements canada japan and soon mercosur to secure alternative supplies to america china has reduced the tariffs it charges others what this means is that the average tariff in the us is going up while the average tariff of many other countries is falling the us has to play catch up more than setting the bar the trans pacific partnership and japan eu agreement and china s non us tariff cuts have put us farmers and factories at a disadvantage imagine that after hemming and hawing chinese president xi was going to accept the invitation to meet trump on the sidelines of the g20 meeting then an impatient trump threatens china if xi does not meet him the us will slap a 25 tariff on the remaining 300 bln of chinese goods that are not yet covered if xi meets he is bowing to trump and the tariffs could still come into effect or be used again as leverage on china if xi does not meet trump he faces tariffs and more xi is unlikely to refuse outright trump s invite despite increasing evidence that america aims to contain china s growth and development and prevent it from being the world s superpower to paraphrase the american president trump s economic adviser kudlow also reiterated that the us has no interest in a balanced deal because the us has been disadvantaged for so long it is insisting on better terms for itself it is virtually a warning that any agreement will see china lose it might be like buying a negative yielding bond trump took the initiative by threatening china xi can take it back by signaling that while he cannot meet with trump at the g20 meeting he would be happy to see the us president in china at some later date in beijing chinese officials likely assume that the tariffs on nearly all of its exports to the us will be implemented no matter way it does china went into the gunfight with trump with a knife it assumed trump was interested in a transactional trade deal that reduced the bilateral deficit substantially and this is what treasury secretary mnuchin had secured a year ago which trump summarily rejected yet it seems that it has only been since trump tweeted the end of the tariff truce and his subsequent candid comments that chinese officials recognize a rubicon has been crossed that is what the references to the long march mean there seem to be many signs that china is preparing a long sustained multifaceted and global rivalry with the us the economic hardship that cannot be offset through government policies can be blamed on the us and foster chinese nationalism china has a long history of scars that it can point to how it has been wronged by westerners in its narrative china blurs us role despite it having defended china s territorial integrity in the face of european and japanese imperialism in late19th and early 20th centuries yet now there are many points of diverging interest including not asking but telling china it can no longer purchase iranian oil the us acknowledges one china but insists on selling advanced fighter jets to one breakaway province and protests when a special administrative region considers a law that allows china to extradite people back to the mainland for breaking chinese laws the us is seen by chinese officials as trying to frustrate it at every turn like the aiib and the belt road initiative merely reducing the bilateral deficit and adhering the rules of the wto will not be sufficient to appease america many experts argue that the wto rules are not enough to manage to the cunning prc and seem to advocate ex post facto regulations designed to outlaw specific current chinese practices trump says he wants a grand deal or no deal and apparently the judgment about the security risks posed by huawei can be part of the discussion xi knows that no such grand deal is possible for a us president who seemingly does not appreciate nuance this is seen as a rejection by accepting as inevitable new tariffs on more chinese goods xi effectively neutralizes trump s thought to be leverage this calculation that xi may have more to lose than to gain by meeting trump at the g20 should inform us policymakers it should warn investors the risk of a market disturbance as they position for the g20 meeting which could mean unwinding some current exposures at the same time businesses should recognize that the one worldism since the collapse of the soviet union and the advent of the world wide web appears increasingly likely to be divided

through government policies can be blamed on the u s and foster chinese nationalism china has a long history of scars that it can point to how it has been wronged by westerners in its narrative china blurs u s role despite it having defended china s territorial integrity in the face of european and japanese imperialism in late19th and early 20th centuries yet now there are many points of diverging interest including not asking but telling china it can no longer purchase iranian the u s acknowledges one china but insists on selling advanced fighter jets to one breakaway province and protests when a special administrative region considers a law that allows china to extradite people back to the mainland for breaking chinese laws the u s is seen by chinese officials as trying to frustrate it at every turn like the aiib and the belt road initiative merely reducing the bilateral deficit and adhering the rules of the wto will not be sufficient to appease america many experts argue that the wto rules are not enough to manage to the cunning prc and seem to advocate ex post facto regulations designed to outlaw specific current chinese practices trump says he wants a grand deal or no deal and apparently the judgment about the security risks posed by huawei can be part of the discussion xi knows that no such grand deal is possible for a u s president who seemingly does not appreciate nuance this is seen as a rejection by accepting as inevitable new tariffs on more chinese goods xi effectively neutralizes trump s thought to be leverage this calculation that xi may have more to lose than to gain by meeting trump at the g20 should inform u s policymakers it should warn investors the risk of a market disturbance as they position for the g20 meeting which could mean unwinding some current exposures at the same time businesses should recognize that the one worldism since the collapse of the soviet union and the advent of the world wide web appears increasingly likely to be divided

although the central bank of nigeria has for the umpteenth time foreclosed the possibility of allowing market forces to determine the real value of the naira contrary to recent reports experts while expressing divergent views on the subject matter however emphasised managed floating of the local currency reports james emejo last week the market was again awakened to report that the cbn had allegedly indicated that it would allow the naira to weaken past its official rate as it gradually unwinds its regime of multiple exchange rates specifically bloomberg had cited data on the bank s website as suggesting a floating of the currency according to the report the cbn stopped publishing the fixed naira exchange rate on its website and stating that the rate will be market determined it further quoted the president of shippers association of lagos state jonathan nicol as alleging that the nigerian customs service had also instructed importers recently to pay for duties at a weaker rate of n326 per dollar from n306 citing a directive from the apex bank already the development had started to gather momentum and attracted accolades from a section of the public which deemed it as a right step in the right direction before the cbn later issued a statement to refute the claim that it had decided to float the naira the director corporate communications cbn mr isaac okoroafor had described the report as false stressing that the naira exchange rate remained stable okoroafor reaffirmed the bank s commitment towards ensuring stability in foreign exchange market according to him there has been no change in nigeria s exchange rate structure the cbn has not floated the naira the exchange rate remains stable speculations and reports to the contrary are false cbn governor mr godwin emefiele had at a forum with private sector operators in lagos recently restated the bank s commitment to continue to defend the naira saying that the cbn act demands that the bank defends the naira using the foreign exchange reserves he said in effect the cbn would be disobeying the law establishing it if it sits idly by and allow the naira to be determined wholly by the so called market forces second those who call for floating of the currency betray their willful ignorance of the effects of significant depreciation however short lived on inflation several empirical analyses have shown that the pass through of changes in the exchange rate on consumer prices is almost one to one this implies that for every percentage point depreciation in the naira there is almost the same rise in inflation he also said policies of the apex bank in the past five years had been focused on protecting the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable persons in the country according to emefiele the apex bank is comfortable staying on the side of the weak vulnerable and poor masses and protecting their purchasing power emefiele had also pointed out that the task of building a stronger economy was far from complete with the pace of gross domestic product gdp growth still very fragile and badly lagging behind population growth rate of 2 7 per cent however it would have come as a huge surprise if the cbn actually decided to float the naira given that emefiele had consistently foreclosed such move stressing that it was inimical to the economy this is because previous instances of naira devaluation had not solved the country s foreign exchange and economic woes notably the international monetary fund imf had been a chronic campaigner for the devaluation of the naira arguing that the cbn ought to allow the current find its real value through the interaction of market forces earlier in january during the monetary policy committee mpc emefiele had rebuked those agitating for the removal of capital controls so as to allow free importation of goods arguing that encouraging imports and free floating the currency could be damaging to the economy he said doing so could lead to a currency crisis which will result in capital flight massive depreciation and devaluation of the naira he had said first let me say there is no capital control in nigeria today because you cannot find a hand of cbn trying to intervene on the market for demand and supply of foreign exchange in nigeria today but normally cbn is an independent institution apolitical but it is also important that we should say that this matter came on the mpc meeting of yesterday and today and it is not about criticising but reassessing our position to say look is there any merit in the need to begin to say that we should look at free floating the currency or allow free import of goods that can be produced in the country into nigeria he said the mpc came to a conclusion that this was a wrong premise we cannot be talking about allowing import of items that can be produced in the country today exporting jobs in nigeria to foreign countries and we say we have the interest of nigeria at heart we don t agree with anybody it is a wrong premise to say you will allow imports to just flood the country just because you want to please anybody that is not our interest and we have always said it that we are apolitical and remain apolitical but we would not want anybody to drag the cbn into issues that are within our remit otherwise we would respond to it he said on the issue of free float the mpc reviewed it and said it is as good as saying that we should go back to the eras of structural adjustment programmes again in nigeria the implications can better be imagined as you know it will certainly lead to capital flight it will lead to massive depreciation and devaluation of our currency and ultimately lead to currency crisis in nigeria we should all know that it is a route to perdition for whoever goes in that direction in his opinion however founder chief executive global analytics consulting limited mr tope fasua who spoke to thisday before the cbn refutal argued that it may not be in the best interest of the economy for the cbn to totally surrender the management of foreign exchange rate to market forces he said i still believe that most countries in the world practice managed floating so no matter how you float the naira you still have to manage it and keep an eye on where the currency is going i do not believe that we should totally float the naira in such a way that we would lose control because again if you look at economic complexity index and i just checked one economic complexity index where nigeria is 124 out of 128 countries surveyed and in fact our complexity is in the negative so if you look at the nigerian economy against the united states economy perhaps the naira will actually be somewhere around 2000 or 3000 to the united states dollar so are we ready for that and the effect so beyond what some of the guys in the financial markets are doing which i believe some of them are turned against the naira according to him if you want to float the naira you want to actually look at what the market will determine where the value should be you also have to plan for productivity and economic complexity what the economic complexity is saying is that to a large extent is that the amount of knowledge that goes into the products we export as a country is actually so low one of the lowest in the world are we doing anything to increase that knowledge base of our exports we aren t so we are just setting ourselves up for a free fall if we are not very careful but it s good that the statement has been made that they would now float the currency and to assuage the feelings of investors but mind you we are not created to impress only investors at the end of the day we must think about the kind of life that it would give nigerians if you look at it since 1986 all we have ever done is to devalue and devalue and it seems to be a one way streak and if you look that the pre colonial times when even the colonial people left why were we left with a strong currency in that era when the colonialists managed the economy and the moment we started actually getting into our own we are forced to devalue fasua said the only way devaluation would work is if you are sure that you can actually produce the essential goods that your people would need we would like to have salutary policies to that extent otherwise you will just drive your people up the wall and they will not be able to afford basic things of life and you don t want to see them on the streets if we are not careful if we don t manage it well it is the zimbabwe or venezuela kind of situation nonetheless a credible source who pleaded anonymity because of his dealings with government welcomed a possible floating of the currency he said since 2015 there are two problems that are being micromanaged this problem of exchange rate management or multiple exchange rates which definitely creates room for round tripping and arbitrage and subsidy it is not good for the economy because the real people that will be looking for foreign exchange it will take them months to get and how do they prove their goods when they get it at official or unofficial rate they will price their goods based on replacement cost effective and replacement cost is indexed based on the black market rate according to him there is just no way you can have an economy where you have multiple exchange rate and you say there is no distortion there is no room for round tripping and arbitrage he said we have been advocating for managed floating and managed floating is very simple allow the market to determine the exchange rate if you see any attempt by the market to distort the stability of the pricing model the cbn can intervene from time to time to ensure stability that is managed floating and that is what countries do but when you have this multiple exchange rate it is not good for the economy because the real sector that will be looking for foreign exchange will never get it at the same price and even if they get it it will be after a long period of time however it ongoing policy initiatives by the cbn to boost local production some of which had not yet materialised it would be tantamount to crying for the moon to expect that the apex bank will surrender currency management to market force at this crucial point of economic rejuvenation

donald trump continues his four year long cycle of wash rinse and repeat when it comes to saying outrageous things which is followed by an outraged press then he follows that with another outrageous claim knowing the press will pounce on that forgetting his original comment this has worked for him during his campaign and the entire length of his being president that washington post reported that he is nearing 11k lies in the past three years he knows this and he is an expert on wearing people down that has happened to many americans who just don t know what to focus on as he keeps uttering new facts while also stating things that continue breaking down the norms we have grown accustomed to when it comes to our presidents according to trump he has made it so iran no longer cries out death to america while the border wall with mexico is proceeding according to his plans the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history a closer look at donald trump s facts iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main

down with u s a in english wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 estate tax aka death tax trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out

small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened

were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples

business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 higher tariffs trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back

imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated

demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of

they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase by 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past

using the nuclear deal s economic benefits to support its hostile acts in the region while stressing that the kingdom s hand is always extended for peace he said the iranian regime did not respect the japanese prime minister as a guest in iran and made during his visit an effective response to his efforts by attacking the two oil tankers in the gulf one of which was japanese it also employed its militias to carry out a shameful attack against abha airport this is clear evidence of the iranian regime s policy and intentions to target the security and stability of the region the crown prince said that saudi arabia places great importance on the strategic ties with the us considering them a main factor in achieving regional security and stability he also expressed confidence that our strategic relations with the us will not be affected by any media campaigns or arbitrary stances the kingdom constantly seeks to clarify facts and misconceptions by some parties in the us and other countries we listen to what is assumed but ultimately our priority is our national interests he said saudi arabia backed all efforts to reach a political solution to the yemeni crisis but the houthi militias prioritize iran s agenda over the interests of yemen and its people the kingdom cannot accept the presence of illegal militias on our borders he said adding we not only seek to liberate yemen from the iranian militias but achieve prosperity and stability for all of the people of yemen the crown prince said in the interview that his country is greatly concerned with the security and stability of sudan not only due to the strategic importance of its location and danger of the collapse of its state institutions but the strong fraternal ties that bind us he pledged to continue to support our brothers in all fields until sudan achieves what it deserves in prosperity and progress on the syrian crisis he said riyadh is working with its allies to achieve its objectives including defeating daesh so called is preventing the re emergence of terrorist organizations dealing with the destabilizing iranian influence in syria and using all possible means to achieve political transition in line with resolution 2254 in a manner that preserves syria s unity the crown prince described the murder of citizen jamal khashoggi as a very painful crime the kingdom is seeking to achieve full justice he said any party seeking to politically exploit the case must cease doing so and present whatever evidence it has to the kingdom to help achieve justice he also pledged to confidently forge forward in our approach in firmly confronting all forms of extremism and sectarianism we will not waste our time in offering partial solutions to extremism as history has proven the futility of such efforts said the crown prince on the economy he expressed commitment to the initial public offering of saudi aramco given it is under the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner but he said setting the location of the ipo now is premature he said that vision 2030 has moved from planning and design to implementation on all levels and started finding results what is happening in the kingdom is not simply a set of financial and economic reforms aiming to realize specific figures but a comprehensive restructuring of the kingdom s economy to make a leap forward in economic and development performance in both medium and long terms we are now shifting from a rural economy to one that is characterized by productivity and global competitiveness he said i am proud that the saudi citizen is driving change at a time many feared the vision will face resistance due to the size of the change it entails he added here is the full text of the interview q the region has recently witnessed dangerous developments that threaten the security and stability of the region and world what is saudi arabia s stance towards these developments and how does the kingdom deal with this escalation a saudi arabia s stance is clear as stipulated in its statement it does not want a war in the region but we will not hesitate in dealing with any threat against our people sovereignty and vital interests our priority is our national interest and achieving the aspirations of our people through the goals of the kingdom s 2030 economic social development and economic and social reform vision this demands a stable and competitive environment within the kingdom and region this is why you will find that the role of the kingdom whether in the region north africa horn of africa or other regions supports stability and peace this is a policy that the kingdom has adopted since its establishment whereby it constantly seeks to shun sedition sectarianism and extremism and instead preserve unity and stability in the region and international peace the kingdom also plays an important role in the international community through its efforts to ensure that oil supplies pass through vital routes that surround it with the aim of protecting the stability of the global economy the world bore witness to how we dealt with the iranian tanker in the red sea it was handled based on what our morals and principles and what international treaties and norms demand in return we see how the iranian regime and its proxies have carried out sabotage operations against four oil tankers near fujairah port two of the tankers were saudi this confirms the approach followed by this regime in the region and entire world plenty of evidence supports this and they have accumulated over several years we must not forget that this regime had openly declared since 1979 that its priority and main goal is to export the revolution it seeks to achieve this at the expense of the aspirations of its people and the peoples of the region this explains the behavior of the iranian regime the export of the revolution and wilayat al faqih principle demand the destabilization of countries and the region stoking sectarianism spreading extremism and dedicating the potential of the iranian people towards financing and arming terrorist militias despite this the kingdom has constantly extended its hand for peace with iran to avoid the horrors of wars and destruction on the region and its people saudi arabia even supported the nuclear deal with iran because the kingdom has throughout history never spared an effort to resolve any crisis through diplomatic and peaceful means we had hoped that the iranian regime would have taken advantage of this initiative to change its behavior towards the countries in the region and see it as a first step towards iran s return to the international community as a normal state unfortunately iran reaped the economic benefits of this deal in order to support its hostile acts in the region it continued to violate international resolutions it was better off dedicating the economic benefits in improving the lives of the iranian people developing infrastructure and achieving economic development instead of maintaining is destructive agenda in the region iran s recklessness has reached unprecedented levels after the nuclear pact the iranian revolutionary guards corps budget increased and it intensified its support for sectarian militias in the region and even the whole world we have all seen how terrorist and hostile iranian operations were recently thwarted in europe this is why the kingdom supported the re imposition of us sanctions on iran it did so out of our belief that the international community needed to take a decisive stance against iran it must also take the necessary measures to limit the regime s ability to spread chaos and destruction in the whole world recent developments in the region including the targeting of aramco oil pumping stations by the iran backed houthi militias underscores the importance of our demand before the international community to take a decisive stance against an expansionist regime that has supported terrorism and spread death and destruction over the past decades not only in the region but the whole world the choice is clear before iran does it want to be a normal country that plays a constructive role in the international community or does it want to be a rogue state we hope that the iranian regime would opt to become a normal country and cease its hostile policy q you have pointed to the american stance on iran which coincides with the saudi stance as is the case with the majority of strategic issues recent months have however seen criticism directed at the kingdom from within the united states over a number of issues especially the jamal khashoggi case has this criticism affected the strategic cooperation between the two countries a the kingdom places great importance on the strategic ties with the us they are relations that extend to more than 70 years during which this strategic partnership has defeated several challenges that have targeted the security stability and sovereignty of our countries our ties with the us are important and pivotal not only for achieving joint interests whether economic on the security level or others but they are a main factor in achieving regional security and stability together with the us and in cooperation with several countries in the region and world we seek to achieve sustainable stability in the region that would establish the necessary environment to meet the aspirations of the people to live in dignity and real development we do so by confronting the forces of chaos destruction and instability embodied in terrorist organizations and their state sponsors starting with the iranian regime as for the media campaigns or some american stances they certainly do not serve the joint interests of our countries throughout the kingdom s history however we have previously confronted such campaigns that are often biased and not based on accurate information we constantly seek to clarify facts and misconceptions by some parties in the us and other countries we listen to what is assumed but ultimately our priority is our national interests our priority is the citizen in riyadh jeddah jazan tabuk dammam and other regions in the kingdom not what others believe of or propose to the kingdom throughout the kingdom s history we have managed to coexist with our main allies despite natural differences that exist between all countries by respecting the sovereignty of nations and avoiding meddling in their internal affairs we accept nothing less than reciprocal treatment when it comes to our sovereignty and internal affairs i am confident that our strategic relations with the us will not be affected by any media campaigns or arbitrary stances as for the murder of citizen jamal khashoggi as i have previously said this is a very painful crime that is unprecedented in the history of the kingdom such acts are alien to our culture and contradict our principles and values the kingdom has taken the necessary measures whether through the judiciary to hold the perpetrators to account or through taking procedural measures to prevent such unfortunate crimes from taking place again in the future these measures stem first and foremost from our keenness on the lives of every saudi citizen these measures have not and will not be affected by any other factors we are a state of law and it is unacceptable for the life of a citizen to be violated in such a painful way and under any circumstance unfortunately the suspects are government employees and we seek to achieve full justice any party seeking to politically exploit the case must cease doing so and present whatever evidence it has to the kingdom to help achieve justice q does the agreement with the us on iran apply to the situation in syria especially in wake of the american decision to withdraw from the country a there is an agreement on the objectives in syria which are the defeat of the daesh group preventing the re emergence of terrorist organizations dealing with the destabilizing iranian influence in syria and using all possible means to achieve political transition according to resolution 2254 in a manner that preserves syria s unity we are working with friendly countries to achieve these goals q how do you interpret the japanese prime minister s recent visit to iran and his meeting with the supreme leader a we thank the prime minister for his good intentions and the kingdom s hand is always extended to peace in a manner that achieves the security and stability of the region the iranian regime however did not respect the prime minister as a guest and made during his visit an effective response to his efforts by attacking the two oil tankers in the gulf one of which was japanese it also employed its militias to carry out a shameful attack against abha airport this is clear evidence of the iranian regime s policy and intentions to target the security and stability of the region iran is the party that is constantly escalating tensions in the region it carries out terrorist attacks and shameful direct or indirect attacks through its militias the problem lies in tehran not anywhere else as i have previously stated iran must choose between becoming a normal country that plays a constructive role in the international community or remain a rogue state and assume the international consequences of its choice q the turkish president and other turkish officials have recently escalated their rhetoric in questioning the credibility of the kingdom s judiciary and held the kingdom and its leadership responsible in khashoggi s case how do you respond to such accusations a jamal khashoggi is a saudi citizen and there is no doubt that what happened to him was painful and unfortunate the kingdom has taken all measures to hold the perpetrators accountable and the accused have been referred to the judiciary the judiciary in the kingdom is an independent authority and no one can meddle in its affairs we confront any development firmly and without hesitation by taking the steps that are necessary to achieve justice rectify any flaw and prevent mistakes from taking place again while disregarding any claims and accusations as for the turkish statements against the kingdom the kingdom as the home of the two holy mosques seeks strong ties with all islamic countries including turkey this is important for the interest of the region and joint islamic work in particular in the kingdom we work in service of the holy mosques and their visitors we work on achieving the security and stability of our nation not becoming embroiled in disputes that harm the interests of our nation and islamic world we will forge forward in achieving these goals while ignoring statements made by some parties to conceal internal turmoil that everyone is aware of q four years have passed since the arab coalition kicked off its operations in yemen how do you assess the political and military progress that has been achieved and what are the prospects for resolving the crisis in yemen especially in wake of the stockholm deal and terrorist houthi attacks on saudi oil pumping stations and its najran and abha airports a many parties forget or claim to forget how the crisis in yemen first broke out the coalition operations began after the international community had exhausted all political solutions between yemeni parties and the houthi militias one must be reminded that the kingdom is the pioneer of the political solution it presented the gulf initiative and worked on achieving peaceful political transition in yemen in 2011 it supported the national dialogue and presented over 7 billion in economic support for yemen between 2012 and 2014 since 2011 the kingdom s efforts have sought to achieve smooth political transition in a manner that preserves the country s independence and sovereignty and unity of its political and security institutions to prevent it from slipping into chaos indeed the yemeni parties met in riyadh and signed the gulf initiative and its executive mechanism all yemeni parties including the houthis were present at the comprehensive national dialogue unfortunately iran obstructed the political process in yemen through its proxy militias it then started to occupy yemeni cities and seize the state s various capabilities the kingdom offered all possible opportunities to tackle the situation through peaceful means but iran was following a policy of imposing a status quo in arab countries through the force of arms unfortunately the international community at the time did not confront iran s expansionist and sectarian agenda iran therefore continued to try through its militias to impose its control in yemen the yemeni people and leadership however made a historic stand against this iranian interference along with our brothers in the coalition we responded to the appeal of the legitimate government to protect yemen and its people and our national security the kingdom cannot accept the presence of illegal militias on our borders most yemeni territories have been liberated and we have supported all efforts to reach a political solution to the crisis unfortunately the houthi militias prioritize iran s agenda over the interests of yemen and its people we have recently witnessed the terrorist attack on oil facilities and najran airport which the houthis boasted of claiming this once again demonstrates that these militias do not care for the interests of the yemeni people or any political process to resolve the crisis their actions reflect the priorities of tehran not sanaa the arab coalition s stance is very clear about resolving the crisis we support efforts to reach a political solution based on un security council resolution 2216 the gulf initiative and its executive mechanism and national dialogue outcomes we accept the participation of all yemeni parties in the political process but according to the three references the kingdom will not accept the militias to remain outside state control we will pursue this ultimate goal and maintain our operations and continue on offering support to the yemeni people in their effort to protect their independence and sovereignty regardless of the sacrifices the kingdom will also maintain its humanitarian and economic relief in yemen we not only seek to liberate yemen from the iranian militias but achieve prosperity and stability for all of the people of yemen q you have spoken of a dream to transform the middle east into the new europe how do you confront obstacles in reaching this dream given the major regional political upheaval and economic and development challenges a we must not become hostages of temporary conditions that prevent us from fulfilling our primary duty as leaders in the region of reviving our states today s challenges must also not prevent us from working promptly to achieve a better future for the coming generations you mentioned political upheaval this is undoubtedly taking place in the region at the same time however we must look at the overall arab region and realize that the majority of the countries are unanimous in prioritizing a dignified life for the people and achieving security and stability the people do not want to be hostages to ideological conflicts that waste their potential we are before a precedent in that everyone shares one goal competition between the majority of our countries focuses on reaching the best standard of living for the people attracting investment and achieving development in all fields the source of political upheaval is well known they are terrorist groups such as daesh al qaeda the muslim brotherhood and policies of the iranian regime the top sponsor of terrorism and extremism we will not waste our time in offering partial solutions to extremism as history has proven the futility of such efforts god willing we will confidently forge forward in our approach in firmly confronting all forms of extremism and sectarianism the kingdom is the focal point for muslims and the home of the two holy mosques it has been blessed with natural resources a strategic location and wise leaderships since the days of the founder and until the present reign of custodian of the two holy mosques today it is living in security stability and prosperity it is unbecoming for this great nation not to occupy leading positions in all fields regardless of the conditions and challenges we will not rest until we first achieve this goal for our nation and later our brothers in the region q how do you assess the upheaval in sudan and the political changes a we are greatly concerned with the security and stability of sudan not only due to the strategic importance of its location and danger of the collapse of its state institutions but the strong fraternal ties that bind us our brothers and sisters in sudan have been and continue to be a part of our social fabric we will not spare an effort to achieve the security and stability of sudan and its people the kingdom has offered an economic aid package to sudan and deposited 250 million in its central bank we will continue to support our brothers in all fields until sudan achieves what it deserves in prosperity and progress q three years after launching saudi vision 2030 where are we at a we moved from the planning and design phase to implementation on all levels and started seeing results on the ground in the financial sector for example we have spotted noteworthy progress after the launching of the vision as the saudi market joined three global indices the ftse 100 index the morgan stanley msci emerging markets index and s p dow jones indices this will pump capital worth billions into the market the kingdom has seen a 40 increase in investment in funds a first since 2006 the kingdom has recently achieved the greatest leap forward among some of the world s most competitive countries in the imd world competitiveness rankings 2019 ranking 26th moving up 13 ranks compared to last year and ranking 7th among g20 member states in the telecommunications and information sector we witnessed remarkable development the ratio of contribution of the digital economy to gdp increased both directly and indirectly with the kingdom becoming one of the top 10 fastest e commerce growing countries worldwide with a rate of 32 simultaneously internet speeds have improved fourfold to accelerate digital transformation the kingdom was also the first country in the middle east and north africa region to roll out 5g network services back in 2018 in the eastern region for trial today we have 1 000 communication towers in the kingdom that are offering this new service and expanding in the field of energy and industry non oil exports increased by 22 in 2018 compared to 2017 and we launched many industrial cities in different regions across the kingdom this confirms the keenness of the government of the custodian of the two holy mosques to uphold balanced and comprehensive development in various cities and regions including the king salman energy park spark jazan and waad al shamal where the first phase of the production of phosphates and phosphate fertilizers has been achieved laying down the foundations for the second phase which will make the kingdom god willing the second largest producer of phosphate fertilizers globally i would like to note that what is happening in the kingdom is not simply a set of financial and economic reforms aiming to realize specific figures but a comprehensive restructuring of the kingdom s macro economy aimed at moving economic and development performance in both medium and long terms we have undertaken major economic and structural reforms that contribute to fiscal balance and consolidation and the diversification of income sources while maintaining macroeconomic growth sustaining public finances supporting social expenditures raising government spending efficiency and stimulating the private sector which is considered a key partner in growth and development and achieving the vision s objectives q but some sides are speculating about ebbs in some of vision 2030 s initiatives a what is happening in the kingdom is a comprehensive structural change in the economy aimed at creating a shift in medium and long term economic performance the vision and its programs like any strategic plan must be brought up to date and modified according to arising conditions and data that come out during application but that is conducted without hindering the pillars and objectives of the vision and with the aim of achieving top results especially at a time we have gained a higher quality of decision making based on studies analyses figures facts and data responding to your question about some vision related initiatives going in decline we do not expect this the vision s programs are effectively contributing to the economic transformation process and we are now shifting from a rural economy to one that is characterized by productivity and global competitiveness q some may argue that the public investment fund pif is giving the private sector a run for its money with its direct investments and mega projects what role does it play in achieving the vision and how can negative effects be avoided a in line with vision 2030 and in order to achieve its objectives it was important to review the role of the pif and transform it into a state sovereign fund in 2015 we re launched pif with a new vision and mission aimed at developing new sectors in saudi arabia investing in leading international partnerships and the formation of a new board of directors under my leadership between 2016 and 2018 the number of staffers increased from 40 to nearly 500 employees meanwhile pif assets have increased from sr500 billion to sr1 trillion nearly doubling within two years the pif is now a vital state instrument for economic diversification and targets both domestic and international investments domestically it targets major project investments that the private sector alone cannot finance such as neom the red sea project and qiddiya which will offer dozens if not hundreds of good investment opportunities for the private sector for pif and the government it is of utmost importance to involve the private sector we have earmarked 13 programs for privatization giving the private sector a greater opportunity to participate in investment achieve profitable returns and improve spending efficiency and services in terms of foreign investments apart from achieving attractive returns on its assets pif will play an important role in establishing economic partnerships that will help boost knowledge exchange stimulate high efficiency investments and enhance local content generating long term returns for future generations the pif also targets new strategic sectors such as tourism and entertainment these sectors have an important dimension in stimulating foreign investment regional development creating a large number of jobs and improving overall quality of life the pif operates under an outstanding level of corporate governance and transparent investment strategy which were approved after completing its reform and governance process in 2015 it operates within a system that includes a board executive committee and investment committee that play clear roles in guaranteeing distinguished levels of professionalism in performance the pif portfolio also has investments distributed according to development priorities such as in saudi companies promising sectors and major projects q what are the latest developments in the privatization program a we now have an exceptional and global center specialized in privatization that is built on the best practices drawn from experiences of more than 20 countries that have undertaken privatization in the past when establishing the center it was taken into account that it contains a legislative structure ensuring the rights of both the state and investors we have identified promising opportunities for privatization in 12 sectors our goal from the privatization program is for it to strengthen the role of functioning government actors and to maximize the contribution of the private sector to gdp in 2019 the national center for privatization ncp supported the signing of five agreements with a total value exceeding sr 12 5 billion inked by local and international companies in various fields and with foreign financing from six countries at a 70 rate these agreements include projects that focus on sewage treatment desalination plants and health services namely through dialysis centers the ncp is currently working on finalizing agreements totaling over sr2 billion and that cover flour mills and medical and shipping services these agreements are expected to be completed by the end of 2019 work is also under way for privatizing education sector projects expected in 2020 with investments adding up to about sr1 billion in the future the private sector will also have the largest investment share in electricity sector projects especially power generation plans and including major renewable energy projects previously announced q amidst such economic transformation what is your highness s message to citizens a i am proud that the saudi citizen is driving change at a time many feared the vision would face resistance due to the size of the change it entails many have told me that the most difficult part i will face in realizing this strategic transformation is resistance but i saw this as a very small factor when looking at saudi youth that is now leading change i would like to pay tribute to the role of young people in the experience undertaken by the kingdom it is a young vision with a young spirit discussions have shifted from a change desired from the state to the change we all make together q when following news about the anticipated saudi aramco s ipo in global markets we find there is a lack of information about the issue and the timeline where are matters now and what actions have been taken in this regard a we are committed to the initial public offering of saudi aramco but under the appropriate circumstances and in a timely manner as i mentioned previously i expect that it will happen between 2020 and the beginning of 2021 and setting the location of the ipo now is premature much of the work has been successfully completed and the timeframe for the offering will depend on several factors including market conditions for the ipo given its size and aramco s acquisition of a majority stake in sabic from pif the latter is a deal which would impact a stellar transformation through creating a fully integrated national energy and petrochemical company that will lead the global energy sector and further enhance saudi aramco s growth potential and profitability in volatile oil markets as for preparations for aramco s ipo several important actions have been taken including the issuance of the hydrocarbon tax system the re issuance of an exclusive franchise agreement the appointment of a new board of directors and the first ever releasing of aramco s annual financial report and audit of its oil reserves all these measures reinforce transparency which is a core principle of saudi vision 2030 which is committed to protecting the kingdom s interests and those of potential investors saudi aramco for its part has also logged several achievements within its internal program in preparation for the ipo one of the most important features of the program was amending internal rules and regulations the transformation into a joint stock company and releasing its financial report meeting requirements of potential financial markets for the ipo this has left investors satisfied worldwide as we have seen through the recent bond offering spa

new period of easier monetary policy we all worry about slow growth tony crescenzi market strategist at pacific investment management co told bloomberg television on friday we would project that interest rates for central banks will stay low for at least the next five years what pimco has long dubbed the new normal is reflected in calculations by jpmorgan chase co economists their measure of the average global interest rate reached a high of 2 82 per cent in early february having once expected it to end the year at 3 per cent they now see it falling to 2 5 per cent in december led by cuts

as america and china drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is rising new york last summer my colleague brunello rosa and i identified ten potential downside risks that could trigger a us and global recession in 2020 nine of them are still in play today many involve the united states trade wars with china and other countries along with restrictions on migration foreign direct investment and technology transfers could have profound implications for global supply chains raising the threat of stagflation slowing growth alongside rising inflation and the risk of a us growth slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course meanwhile us equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary and there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt including in many emerging markets where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies with central banks ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to flash crashes and other disruptions one such disruption could come from us president donald trump who may be tempted to create a foreign policy crisis wag the dog with a country like iran that might bolster his domestic poll numbers but it could also trigger an oil shock beyond the us the fragility of growth in debt ridden china and some other emerging markets remains a concern as do economic policy financial and political risks in europe worse across the advanced economies the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today the tenth factor that we considered was the us federal reserve s interest rate policy after hiking rates in response to the trump administration s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the fed reversed course in january looking ahead the fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy while trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply side risk they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income with so much uncertainty companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 percent compared to 5 25 percent in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing qe central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and as rosa and i argued last year financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020 the sino american trade and technology war deserves special attention the conflict could escalate further in several ways the trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese exports not yet affected or prohibiting huawei and other chinese firms from using us components could trigger a full scale process of de globalization as companies scramble to secure their supply chains were that to happen china would have several options for retaliating against the us such as by closing its market to us multinationals like apple under such a scenario the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis regardless of what the major central banks do with the current tensions already denting business consumer and investor confidence and slowing global growth further escalation would tip the world into a recession and given the scale of private and public debt another financial crisis would likely follow from that both trump and chinese president xi jinping know that it is in their countries interest to avoid a global crisis so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit for tat measures trump and xi each seem to think that his country s long term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war and if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed it is possible that trump and xi will meet for talks during the g20 summit on june 28 29 in osaka but even if they do agree to restart negotiations a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off as the two sides drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is

via international man international man for many years president trump has made no apologies for trying to pay the least amount of taxes possible he s clearly stated this in many interviews his desire to minimize his taxes has brought scorn from many in the mainstream media and politicians from both sides of the aisle these people are of the opinion that paying taxes is an honorable and necessary responsibility it brings to mind the wrongheaded saying taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society which came from us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes many people believe this but if that s true how come low tax locales like singapore the cayman islands monaco aren t backward hell holes but rather sophisticated and civilized doug casey almost any lie can be accepted as truth if it s said often enough and with enough certainty that absolutely applies to what holmes said it s shameful how people don t think about its meaning but slavishly repeat it taxes aren t the price we pay for civilized society they re a sign of the fact that society is becoming uncivilized a civilized society is based on voluntarism taxes are all about coercion people don t seem to recognize or remember that before 1913 there was no income tax in the us there was no reporting of any kind to the us government it was a much more civilized and far freer country then as far as trump minimizing his taxes congratulations to him the object should be to cut the size of the us government in half and cut it in half again and again and along with it cut the tax burden that it imposes on the average american trump should be proud of himself for cutting his taxes it s your patriotic duty as an american citizen to deny revenue to the state and the kind of people that are drawn to it and populate it the fact that some people resent others for not paying taxes is just evidence that they ve been consumed by the vice of envy which is one of the worst of the vices jealousy says if you have something that i want i ll try to take it from you just because i want it envy says if you have something that i want and i can t take it from you i ll destroy it and hurt you it s speaks poorly of the ethics of the average american that they ll self righteously shame their neighbors for not paying enough taxes to the state international man we often hear from politicians and the media that some people aren t paying their fair share in taxes who gets to define what fair is and based on what justifications doug casey whenever you hear the word fair start running the other way everybody has a different idea of what s fair it s an arbitrary concept people manipulate its definition to their advantage the only way to determine what might be fair is voluntary mutual agreement that s not possible with taxes there s no voluntarism involved they are in fact a levy enforced at the point of a gun the most creative and productive people tend to have the highest incomes unless they re crony capitalists which means they re basically using the government to steal from everybody else productive people shouldn t be penalized for supplying more goods and services to their neighbors to the market the money they give to the government in taxes would have otherwise been used to create more wealth for the whole world when it s taken from them by taxes it s mostly squandered on welfare and warfare the bottom half of the us really doesn t pay any income tax they only pay social security taxes roughly a flat 15 it s theoretically a pension program although in fact it s a ponzi scheme social security is bankrupt if anyone gets it in the years to come it will be at the expense of future taxpayers not because any capital has been set aside social security is and always has been a swindle it makes it harder for people to save on their own and makes them feel they don t have to but it s not a real pension plan it s a highly politicized welfare program people have been propagandized into believing not just what isn t true but actually believing the opposite of the truth the situation is actually pretty hopeless from a philosophical point of view and it s getting worse the average american believes social security and the income tax are both moral and necessary international man doesn t this system which diverts wealth from productive use into government which is naturally unproductive make everyone worse off you would think the lower and middle classes would be clamoring for more wealth creation that would also benefit them instead many are asking for more wealth to be destroyed we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it seems this sort of thinking helps solidify a backwards system doug casey absolutely the us government and its welfare programs are actually cementing the lower classes to the bottom of society you get what you encourage when you give people free money for doing nothing that s what they ll do take personal responsibility away from a man and he ll tend to act irresponsibly the next step seems to be a guaranteed annual income for everybody where presumably where everybody can just sit around starbucks all day sipping latte and playing with their iphones and be paid for it this trend has been building almost 100 years and the curve is starting to go parabolic to use a fashionable word it s unsustainable for everyone to try living at the expense of everyone else international man another misnomer we often hear is that deficits don t matter a saying popularized by dick cheney an ostensible fiscal conservative doug casey well deficits do matter in order to become wealthy you have to produce more than you consume and save the difference saving the difference builds capital and you need capital to create more wealth countries without capital are poor places like zimbabwe cuba and mauritania the only capital they have is sticks and stones the us government is in effect training people to consume more than they produce now you can do that in basically two ways one by borrowing capital that s been saved and created in the past and consuming it or two you can do it by mortgaging your future it s not a pro survival policy to consume more than you produce it s possible for a while of course but will wind up in disaster the us government is encouraging people to do just that however directly and indirectly international man yet another misguided yet popular saying is that we shouldn t worry about the national debt because we owe it to ourselves what s your take doug doug casey it s another glib gigantic lie we don t owe it to ourselves some people owe it to some other people if it s not paid back somebody is going to walk away disappointed in fact most of the debt is owed to non americans directly in the form of the national debt and indirectly in the form of us dollars outside the us for many years the major export of the us hasn t been boeings or ibms or wheat it s been us dollars we run a trade deficit of about 800 billion every year in exchange foreigners send us electronics mercedes cocaine and other real goods this has artificially propped up the average american s standard of living those dollars circulate in other countries the us dollar is the de facto currency of 50 other countries around the world at some point since the us dollar is backed by nothing if confidence goes away those foreigners are going to want to get rid of their dollars they ll necessarily come back to the us where legal tender laws force americans to accept them there are many trillions of dollars that are now abroad are a liability someday they re going to be traded for us shares of stock us real estate us technology and us labor americans who have grown accustomed to an artificially high standard of living for many years are going to have a very real drop in their standard of living when those dollars come home we re sending dollars to the chinese and other foreigners we re also selling us government debt to the federal reserve which then credits the government s accounts at commercial banks with dollars but that s another story it s all a moving paper fantasy it s going to end badly and end soon it could easily destroy everybody s savings and that in turn could destroy the very basis of society

the plenary session of the st petersburg international economic forum commenting about huawei putin said take the situation with huawei attempts are being made not just to challenge it on the global market but to actually restrict it in an off handed manner some circles already call this the first technological war to break out in the digital era it would appear that rapid digital transformation and technologies that are quickly changing industries markets and professions are designed to expand the horizons for anyone who is willing and open to change unfortunately here too barriers are being built and direct bans on high tech asset purchases are being imposed it has come to the point where even the number of foreign students for certain specialties is limited frankly i find it hard to wrap my mind around this fact nevertheless this is all happening in reality surprising but true monopoly is invariably about concentrating revenue in the hands of a few at the expense of everyone else in this sense attempts to monopolize an innovation driven technology wave and to limit access to its fruits take the problems of global inequality between countries and regions and within states to a whole new level this as we all know is the main source of instability it is not just about the level of income or financial inequality but fundamental differences in opportunities for people in essence an attempt is being made to build two worlds the gap between which is constantly widening in this situation certain people have access to the most advanced systems of education and healthcare and modern technology while others have few prospects or even chances to break out of poverty with some people balancing on the verge of survival today we are facing two extremes two possible scenarios for further development the first is the degeneration of the universalist globalisation model and its turning into a parody a caricature of itself where common international rules are replaced with the laws administrative and judicial mechanisms of one country or a group of influential states i state with regret that this is what the us is doing today when it extends its jurisdiction to the entire world incidentally i spoke about this 12 years ago such a model not only contradicts the logic of normal interstate communication and the shaping realities of a complicated multipolar world but most importantly it does not meet the goals of the future the second scenario is a fragmentation of the global economic space by a policy of completely unlimited economic egoism and a forced breakdown but this is the road to endless conflict trade wars and maybe not just trade wars figuratively this is the road to the ultimate fight of all against all so what is the solution i am referring to a real solution rather than utopian or ephemeral one obviously new agreements will be needed for drafting a more stable and fair development model these agreements should not only be written clearly but should also be observed by all participants however i am convinced that talk about an economic world order like this will remain wishful thinking unless we return to the center of the discussion that is notions like sovereignty the unconditional right of every country to its own development road and let me add responsibility for universal sustainable development not just for one s own development kremlin ru june 7 2019 read more russia has offered huawei to consider the option of using a russian software ecosystem for various devices of the chinese corporation a source

session of the st petersburg international economic forum with regard to finance the main global institutions were created as part of the bretton woods system 75 years ago the jamaican currency system that replaced it in the 1970s confirmed the preference of the us dollar but in fact failed to resolve the key problems primarily the balance of currency relations and trade exchanges new economic centers have appeared since then the role of regional currencies has increased and the balance of forces and interests has changed clearly in the wake of these profound changes international financial organizations need to adapt and reconsider the role of the dollar which as a global reserve currency has now become an instrument of pressure exerted by the issuing country on the rest of the world incidentally i believe the us financial authorities and political centers are making a big mistake as they are undermining their own competitive edge that appeared after the creation of the bretton

economists expect debt financing to be the mainstay of china s fiscal spending after the government saw monthly income decline in may for the first time this year conflicts between moderate revenue growth and stronger expenditure may increase they said the value added tax reduction effective since april 1 became a major factor that slowed government income the vat declined to 394 2 billion yuan 56 9 billion last month down by 19 9 percent year on year according to data of the ministry of finance on friday the vat revenue growth rose to 17 5 percent in april up from 9 3 percent in march the vat rate for manufacturing wholesale and retail industries was cut to 13 percent from 16 percent benefiting businesses in these areas a lot according to a statement from the ministry for the first five months the overall fiscal revenue growth pace retreated to the year s slowest level of 3 8 percent down from 5 3 percent from january to april the fiscal spending maintained a high speed growth at 12 5 percent by the end of may the data showed the first five months fiscal income growth rate reached the lowest level since 2010 which was also much slower than the gdp growth rate in may the total fiscal income declined by 2 1 percent year on year and the total tax income declined by 7 percent year on year the financing gap between fiscal revenue and expenditure will be enlarged in the first half this year mainly due to the more aggressive tax and fee reduction and the accelerated government spending a senior official from the ministry of finance told china daily at the moment the key task is continually implementing the fiscal policies that have been announced and we will keep a close eye on the changes in the economy and the external situation he said without revealing any further policy adjustment plan economists said that the proactive fiscal policy will play an important role in offsetting external headwinds especially after the united states escalated trade tensions with china government spending can support investment in infrastructure construction and some social welfare areas such as healthcare and education some of them speculated that if the extreme scenario happens or the economic pressure increases dramatically amid external shocks chinese local governments may apply for additional quota of bond issuance and it should be approved by the country s top legislators increasing the annual bond quota in the middle of a year is rare but it is possible and advisable said robin xing morgan stanley s chief economist in china besides he said the government s deposits or some financial surplus from previous years could be used for stimulus the local government bond quota was set at 3 08 trillion yuan in 2019 and about 47 5 percent of the annual quota had been issued by may and 859 8 billion yuan of special bonds has been issued in the first five months according to the ministry of finance the tax cut policy has helped to counter economic headwinds but whether enterprises or households will use the saved money for investment and consumption will depend on their confidence for the future said xing otherwise direct fiscal stimulus could support economic growth including encouraging automobile and home appliances consumption and accelerating spending on social security and infrastructure construction he said policymakers relaxed funding restraints on local governments off budget channels encouraging the issuance of special bonds and financing through local government financing vehicles the government released a document on monday which allows funds raised by local government special bonds to be equity for infrastructure projects the authorities also encourage financial institutions to support these projects especially through bank loans and insurance funds the measures demonstrated the government s incremental efforts to counter downside risks amid renewed trade uncertainty supporting infrastructure investment in the coming months according to economists
elizabeth warren released an american jobs plan recently it includes several trade and manufacturing policies intended to benefit american workers and companies wall street responded with righteous indignation which suggests she may have hit a nerve one element of her plan most likely explains wall street s angry reaction a call to tackle america s overvalued dollar the novel idea that the united states could achieve greater domestic prosperity by revaluing the dollar sounds obscure and a little risky who would want to tinker with our currency the reality is that china and about 20 other nations are already doing so by using public capital to purchase huge quantities of united states government securities over the past two decades they have driven up the value of the dollar to make their own exports supercompetitive
menafn jordan times bogotá nobody s backyard the rise of latin america was the headline on the cover of the economist on september 11 2010 inside was a special report that presented an optimistic view of the region s future and little wonder given that high commodity prices were enabling most latin american countries to expand social programmes and significantly reduce poverty and inequality governments across the region managed to improve living standards regardless of whether they were led by left leaning presidents such as luiz inácio lula da silva in brazil and néstor kirchner in argentina or by those on the right such as álvaro uribe in colombia china s rapid growth and rising demand for latin america s minerals soybeans and oil created jobs and boosted tax revenues in addition quantitative easing by central banks in developed economies boosted global liquidity making large amounts of capital available for investment but those days are long gone today latin america is at a crossroads economic growth has decelerated living standards have stagnated and the region s social progress is at risk the emerging middle class is now vulnerable and a return to poverty is a real possibility for many to avoid this worrisome scenario latin america urgently needs to increase investment in infrastructure technology and human capital the international monetary fund expects latin america to grow at an average annual rate of just 2 5 per cent over the next five years making it the slowest growing region in the emerging and developing world well behind sub saharan africa asia and the middle east and north africa moreover average growth of 2 5 per cent would be about half the pace of latin american growth in the five years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis as a result unemployment and poverty are likely to increase throughout the region worse this does not seem to be a cyclical downturn various estimates indicate that the potential growth rate for most latin american economies is now a full percentage point lower than it was in 2010 for example colombia and peru can no longer sustain a growth rate of 4 5 per cent as they did a decade ago these days their central banks assume that 3 5 per cent is closer to potential using time series i estimate brazil s potential growth rate to have fallen from 3 per cent a decade ago to 2 per cent today and this month chile s central bank will release a new revision of potential growth which the market expects fell from 4 per cent to 3 per cent although the latin american slowdown reflects lower commodity prices this is not the only factor true oil and copper prices are well below their peaks in the early part of this decade yet they remain far above their average level in the 1990s when the region grew at a much faster pace than today and although china s slower growth and the even faster deceleration in its imports is of course having an impact the main reason for latin america s sluggishness is a lack of investment as a result of austerity measures across the region during the past few years investment rates have fallen and not recovered this is partly the result of budgetary rigidities because current expenditures such as pensions and salaries are often constitutionally protected the burden of fiscal adjustment tends to fall on more flexible capital spending for example investment rates as a share of gdp fell by 4 per cent in peru and argentina as a result of the recent shock increasing the level of investment across the region must therefore be a high priority there is also a need to raise productivity and narrow the significant gap with advanced economies in this regard but crucially measures to increase investment can produce faster results the shortfall in investment concerns not only public infrastructure but also technology and human capital for starters latin america is not investing enough in the technologies that could integrate the region into global value chains this reflects the absence of a shared regional vision barriers to entrepreneurship and inadequate financing especially for small and medium size enterprises making matters worse the region is underinvesting just when its relatively abundant unskilled labour is coming under threat from rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotisation latin america s need for more investment is not a right or left wing issue but simply a matter of urgency although the region s policy makers may differ on the details they need to agree to increase investment in the three priority areas infrastructure technology and human capital moreover this investment should come from all sources public spending private financing crowdfunding global markets and multilateral institutions latin america has not invested enough in the past few years and it is not investing enough today this must change quickly if the region is to prevent low growth and rising poverty from becoming its new

caught between muted inflation and the prospect of a trade war the federal reserve has a fine line to walk at its meeting next week wall street is growing more certain that the central bank will implement one if not more interest rate cuts this year the consumer price index ticked up just 0 1 percent in may following a 0 3 percent increase the previous month in addition to wednesday s inflation measures the department of labor said thursday that import prices for may fell by 0 3 percent a steeper drop than expected this weaker than expected inflation data gives the fed a more compelling case for a rate cut adding to the growing amount of data that indicates a softening economy this adds to the narrative that the fed is likely to begin cutting rates later this year against the backdrop of slowing economic growth said emily roland head of capital markets research at john hancock investment management the reason the cpi data matters is it reinforces in the fed s mind what s been a troubling trend of slowing inflation that s less than their target said joseph lavorgna managing director and chief economist of the americas at natixis if the fed does pivot toward a more dovish stance as many expect more accommodative monetary policy will be driven by a combination of economic metrics signaling slower growth and worry about the destabilizing effect of a potential trade war with china the median dot plot from the march meeting showed one rate hike for next year but the bond market is now pricing in three rate cuts roland said for an institution that prizes stability and balance this turnaround has come at a surprising pace it s been a remarkable shift in the posture of the fed in just the past few weeks said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america the numbers came in a little bit lighter than expected which means the fed does have some more room to consider a cut said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network but that move would be unlikely to come right away the fed has always said they are data dependent and the current data suggests they shouldn t do anything mcmillan said my guess is they ll hold off a little bit longer to get some clarity on maybe how the next payroll numbers are showing up gdp revisions maybe some progress on g 20 with trade lavorgna said the fed has a lot of reasons to cut rates it s not just the trade issues among economists though there is a growing expectation that the language used by fed chairman jerome powell will indicate that the prospect of a rate cut in july is on the table wall street always parses the minutiae of fed remarks but reading tea leaves this time around is a particularly high stakes activity at this point the fed is in a sit tight posture they re waiting to see what happens i m going to be looking for any sign that they re shifting from watchful waiting to we have to act mcmillan said they re very aware of what could go wrong the biggest unknown is the outcome of a potential china trade deal if the white house and beijing fail to meet at the g 20 summit later this month and forge a deal that will avert tariffs being levied on the entirety of chinese goods entering the u s the case for faster monetary easing grows stronger it all boils down to whether the fed is really concerned about the economic danger of the trade war mcmillan said the fed s other challenge is one of optics economists say president donald trump has frequently criticized his appointee to lead the central bank and called for lower interest rates the appearance that the central bank is acting on trump s bidding would hurt the fed s reputation and would be likely to spook investors if they continue to ease and it looks like they re doing it at the president s direction that does considerable damage to market confidence mcmillan said i actually do think that s part of the decision north said but we re also looking at weak data he said if indications of a slowdown continue to accumulate in prices consumption and job growth metrics it increases the likelihood that trump will eventually get his rate cut especially if the trade standoff is not resolved it appears that there is pressure to have a powell put on the economy north said but the fundamentals justify it as well it s not just what trump is saying
i always thought that the most complex geopolitical issue is the world was either palestine or kashmir that is until i stepped into hong kong as a tourist and absorbed the liberal environment of the city state that functions under the one country two systems norm since 1997 i had never really endeavored to understand the so called umbrella movement or the complex system and the agreement under which hong kong continues to function after 1997 when it was handed back to china on completion of the lease under which it had earlier remained under the british while in hong kong from ocean park to stanley market and the delightful kowloon diners it was wonderful to feel the environment pubs everywhere great fine dining a very efficient transport system and an air of material satisfaction among the people i enquired from my hosts how liberal practices seemed to be the norm in the city state under china and was told that till 2047 hong kong would remain under an agreement registered with the united nations that came into effect when the lease held by britain for its former colony ended in 1997 to the credit of the british negotiations for the ultimate transfer had begun as far back as 1984 that is when china was just beginning to emerge from its dark period and chairman deng s reforms were beginning to take shape how long would china remain committed to the un agreement and how would future generations of the hong kong people respond to their eventual transfer to the chinese communist system remain an unanswered question why china agreed to hong kong s one country two systems arrangement why did china agree to hong kong remaining under one country two systems quite obviously it was the commercial status of hong kong which dictated the decision the city state s foreign exchange reserves then were approximately us 85 billion and the economic norms and trade systems that existed would only add substantially to china s economy meddling with it and attempting to give it a wholly chinese colour may have proved economically disastrous for the entire region as per the economist many firms today choose hong kong because not only is it well connected with china s huge market but it also upholds the same transparent rules that govern western economies a freedom that comes from the 50 year agreement hong kong has got the world s fourth largest stock market and it exports manufactured goods from mainland china making it the world s eighth largest exporter it has its own currency the hong kong dollar hk that is pegged to the us dollar there are 1300 big ticket companies with their regional headquarters in hong kong rolling back everything and making hong kong just another chinese city without the special dispensation attached to the island as it exists today would have made many suffer perhaps china the most while it is economics that has worked wonders social dynamics invariably contributes its bit if freedom is available and relative happiness prevails sans authoritarianism economics always receives a boost even today hong kong is not a functioning democracy its chief executive is appointed by the local communist party representatives who answer to the party in beijing however despite this the system safeguards freedom from prosecution under the chinese law which is what has made hong kong a haven for fugitives who are the dissenting voices in the chinese system the british had negotiated provisions including the freedom of expression guarantee of human rights and rule of law it was agreed that these would be unchanged for 50 years until 2047 under the principle of one country two systems many left hong kong before the new arrangement could come into effect most of them were those who had risked their lives escaping from china there was a flawed western understanding that the liberal norms in place in hong kong would help influence dissent inside china however those who had witnessed the events at tiananmen square in 1989 knew well enough that this could hardly come to pass now how far is one country two systems being implemented the implementation of the agreement between britain and china has not been as per the written word and hong kong citizens have been protesting against this from the outset the prominent strategic affairs magazine foreign policy writes

iran the next american war the hand on the trigger how an american president wantonly prepares the next war the great world powers slipped into world war i without really wanting it but they had been arming themselves for years so all that was needed was but a spark such as the assassination of the austrian heir to the throne to detonate a powder keg filled to the rim a lot of explosives had accumulated not only in the arsenals of the military but in the hearts of the people in the first moment of the declaration of war many people throughout europe were seen to be overwhelmed by enthusiasm the war of 1914 was still serving a delusion the dream of a better world a world that would be just and peaceful that was why the victims went to the slaughter drunk and rejoicing crowned with flowers and wearing oak leaves on their helmets while the streets echoed with cheering and blazed with light as if it were a festival stefan zweig quite a few military men and politicians at the head of states did of course suspect the calamity that the war would bring all of them but there was no turning back for anyone without losing face the politicians more or less willingly let themselves be driven and they in their turn were the ones that drove their peoples into annihilation today the world is being driven again but nowhere in the world is the impending war greeted with enthusiasm neither by the united states nor by its rivals not even by the american president it is difficult to believe donald trump because he mixes truth and falsehood at his own discretion but we may trust that he does not want to start a war with iran because until now he has largely kept his promises to his electorate and one of these promises was the reduction of us military presence outside its borders so why is the current american president showing the world such an unpleasant face why has the us since george w bush ceased to be what it has been for so long namely a shield for europe to which it owed its freedom and prosperity during the second half of the past century after completing his ten volume history of human civilizations in 1961 arnold toynbee remarked that the american empire had two characteristics that distinguished it from its predecessor the british empire at that time already extinct for about two decades abundant military bases and an emphasis on generous economic aid for its allies in a policy unprecedented in the history of empires america was making her imperial position felt by giving economic aid to the peoples under her ascendancy instead of exploiting them economically yes the usa was by and large a milder hegemon than all previous great powers the pax americana created at the end of the second world war was soon to prove an advantage for most of its satellites in the first three to four post war decades us historian alfred mccoy notes that at the end of world war ii the united states invested all its prestige and power in forming nothing less than a new world order through permanent international institutions the united nations 1945 the international monetary fund 1945 and the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1947 predecessor to the world trade organization we should emphasize the role of the united states as a force for peace and order before we talk about its current president and the danger that he so massively and so wantonly conjures doing away with the reputation of a great nation in the eyes of world opinion immediately after taking office the new lord of the white house committed the unforgivable stupidity of counteracting almost all of his predecessor s rulings obama had gone to great lengths with the help of the allies to negotiate a treaty obliging iran to use nuclear power exclusively for civilian purposes and to submit to monitoring by the international atomic energy agency iaea trump tore the treaty apart and in this way frivolously gambled away the prestige of the united states as a contracting partner that could be relied upon how can we believe a state where each president cancels the commitments of his predecessor and still worse the incredible naivety of transferring business practices to international politics the predominant criterion when concluding commercial deals is the benefit each party derives from it no competitor even if seeing a pistol aimed at his chest will risk his life for a few dollars less so the real estate agent trump believed he could transfer this insight to politics they will give in as soon as i scare them to death and then we ll make a deal that is the simple philosophy of the currently most powerful man on earth the pistol in this case does not just consist in measures to make the iranian economy collapse the export of oil to which the country owes its modest standard of living is by now largely curtailed and any embargo breakers must expect heavy penalties that is why europe is no longer fulfilling its obligations towards iran and has largely broken off its business relations in order not to risk the us boycotting its own companies but now trump has still gone one step further it was not enough for him to choke the economy of iran since the beginning of this year he uses the military in order to ensure that his message is understood correctly two aircraft carriers have recently been stationed off the coast of iran plus strategic bombers b 52 together with stealth bombers f 35 and a rapidly growing number of us soldiers they are currently being relocated to the persian gulf only a politically blind highly egocentric businessman like trump could seriously believe that it would be enough to play with aircraft carriers and bombers off the enemy s coast to make him aware that he was no match for a man like donald trump militarily iran has become the strongest state in the near east according to experts it is quite capable of eliminating in a first strike all american military bases in the gulf with highly efficient missiles from its own production the country cannot be compared to iraq libya or syria the mullahs are now well aware of their strength especially since trump s approach is once again driving the population into their arms after having almost lost them as several previous uprisings have shown the regime has by no means enjoyed undivided support among its own people on the contrary it was only able to maintain its rule with the help of police state repression but just as donald trump knew how to drive once again the people of venezuela into the arms of their incompetent autocrat maduro he now unites the people of iran behind their leadership even though the country and its inhabitants have never been as badly off as they are today trump is a master at not making america the number one country as is his avowed intent but at making enemies all around abe shinzo the japanese prime minister is still a rare exception on june 13 he tried to putty the broken porcelain but he had no more success than heiko maas the german exterior minister ayatollah khamenei expressly declined to negotiate with the american president as long as the latter continues economic sanctions and threatens his country with military deployment now the enemies are facing each other with loaded pistols no one can retreat without losing face how is trump going to recall his aircraft carriers without being ridiculed by the world as a paper tiger and how can the regime of the ayatollahs give in without losing the support of the population and being laughed at as a weakling unlike business it is about honor and national prestige that nations are driven to war these notions have never gone out of fashion between them neither in the us nor in iran trump steered his country into this stalemate not because he wanted this war but because he makes rash decisions and is therefore unfit as a responsible leader of the world s greatest power i think that war is inevitable but that is of course no more than a personal opinion fortunately history has never allowed prophecies to become true with absolute certainty for the time being each of the two opponents is still waiting for the stupidity of the other i e for the first act of aggression so as to have a pretext for striking with unmitigated power the iranians with simultaneous rocket attacks on all american bases and ships the americans with immediate strikes by their stealth bombers on all iranian military positions and radar stations as of now acts of provocation are already occurring today on 13 june several ships were fired upon in the gulf of oman we may assume that there are quite a lot of war mongering groups that long for a conflagration and even want to bring it about at any price after all we should not forget that many people in countries like syria iraq yemen and libya which for years were exposed to terrible devastation have nothing to lose if war is inevitable let it be transferred to the rest of the world america s military will of course win the war against iran in a few weeks but donald trump will not be able to win peace up to the present day peace has neither been won in the near east nor in libya iran has left no doubt as to what will be its first measure after the outbreak of war it will immediately block the strait of hormuz which could be barred for years afterwards due to permanent terror in the region in this case the main artery for oil supplies to western countries will be severed indefinitely we should have no illusions about what is really at stake nothing less than the current prosperity of europe japan and many other countries but let s not dwell on our losses only iran like syria and iraq another country famous for some of the greatest testimonies of human civilization will sink into rubble as has already happened in large areas of the middle east and this happens for no other reason than that an ill advised american president is frivolously experimenting in big politics with business practices that may succeed among brokers trump has issued the slogan america first we may find it hard to blame him for that every statesman is obliged by his oath to benefit above all his own country true statesmen however always refrained from shouting this intention from the rooftops but wisely conceal it this is not the current president s way in fact he could do more harm to his country and the world at large than any previous one only a miracle may still prevent the fire of war from flaring up in iran the strait of hormuz from being mined and europe from plunging into chaos due to severed oil supplies miracles are not at all impossible a kind of miracle is visible even at this very moment as hardly anyone seems to suspect the demons that are ready to pounce on us indeed many will reject these lines as pure scaremongering hopefully they are right by gero jenner 2019 gero jenner all rights reserved 2005 2022 the market oracle is a

foreign direct investments are very important especially for developing economies like the philippines the country needs private funds in infrastructure power generation tourism and manufacturing to generate jobs and improve wages such investments are more desirable because these stay longer create employment and bolster economic growth in contrast short term foreign portfolio investments or hot money are pulled out of the economy easily as these are invested mainly in the local stock market and do not add much to economic production the inflow of foreign direct investments to the philippines may be improving in the past few years however compared with many of our neighbors the level still lags and remains insufficient to help propel the economy to more sustainable growth advertisement in the first quarter of 2019 for instance the net inflow of foreign direct investments reached 1 9 billion down 15 1 percent from the 2 3 billion in the same period last year in 2018 the philippines remained one of the countries with the lowest inflow of foreign direct investments according to data from the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp with only 9 8 billion in net inflow the philippines ranked seventh out of 10 asian countries that the bsp tracks it was ahead of only malaysia with 8 57 billion and taiwan with 7 billion the rest of the association of southeast asian nations asean 5 performed better singapore attracted 81 85 billion in net inflow for the year followed by indonesia s 20 17 billion and thailand s 12 46 billion the united nations conference on trade and development s unctad 2019 world investment report on special economic zones meanwhile showed that foreign direct investment flows to southeast asia last year rose 3 percent to a record 149 billion raising the group s share in global inflows to 11 percent in 2018 from 10 percent in 2017 however net inflow to the philippines economic zones slid by 25 75 percent to 6 46 billion from 8 7 billion in 2017 said the same report what is worth mentioning at this point is the case of vietnam foreign direct investments in vietnam climbed 9 1 percent in 2018 to 19 1 billion marking six straight years of increase the vietnamese government reported that industries like apparel have been moving production out of china and into vietnam to avoid higher us tariffs brought about by the ongoing us china trade dispute advertisement a prolonged trade war could accelerate this shift and vietnam would become asia s biggest beneficiary of the sino us trade war according to japan s mizuho research institute a slowdown in foreign investments here has been attributed in part to the uncertainty over the current tax incentives for foreigners the government seeks to change the structure by removing incentives to industries that have enjoyed such perks for decades this rationalization plan pending in congress has apparently forced potential foreign investors to wait and see there are also other restrictions to the entry of foreign investors enshrined in the constitution and other existing laws the duterte administration s economic managers have been calling on congress to amend the public service act to open up sectors like telecommunications to foreign ownership however the administration itself can liberalize the entry of foreign businesses by relaxing the foreign investment negative list a roster of sectors of the economy that are off limits to foreign investors the american chamber of commerce of the philippines earlier noted that the philippines and vietnam were nearly comparable in most aspects while the philippines has an important advantage as an english speaking nation it also has perceived downsides such as the considerably higher cost of key manufacturing factors like electricity and minimum wages as well as the higher number of nonworking holidays your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up if congress and the administration can get their act together and move to address decisively the obstacles and bottlenecks to the entry of more foreign investors the philippines may yet become a more attractive destination for doing business and land somewhere in the coveted upper list of beneficiaries of foreign direct investments

business units boasts of an asset base of us 2 44 billion making it one of the most powerful institutions in zimbabwe last june blessing mudavanhu bm was appointed to head one of the country s largest companies cbz holdings the group which operates a bank an insurance unit and a property concern among a number of business units boasts of an asset base of us 2 44 billion making it one of the most powerful institutions in zimbabwe our business reporter fidelity mhlanga fm spoke to mudavanhu to get insight into the company s operations and future prospects of the business fm your appointment came at a very interesting time in terms of developments in the economy let us talk about your journey since then how has the experience been bm i was appointed in june last year it s now a little over a year that was before the elections it was also before october when currencies moved a very interesting time because when i joined the bank the economy was a little bit stable certainly during that time there were no significant shortages of foreign currency even inflation at the time was single digit now it is double digit so that has really put pressure on us and for me in particular as the guy who is running the holdings in terms of recalibrating the strategy so nonetheless it s a good experience as the challenges also come with an experience fm is this what you expected bm i did not expect that things could change as quickly as they did fm what is your take on the state of corporate zimbabwe bm the corporate sector which is the mainstream of the economy is constrained because of inability to raise resources to recapitalise and improve the operational platform that is the biggest challenge think about let s say sable chemicals ziscosteel there is need for a lot of capital injection to recapitalise the operations so that is really a challenge a lot of companies are operating with substandard and inefficient equipment and what that does is it increases the cost of business fm what is your assessment of the monetary developments in the country bm i think i can speak generally in terms of constraints around foreign currency which is the biggest problem for us i mean it s anyone s guess but i think 80 of the goods are imported from south africa when we look at that what we think of as inflation is really currency fluctuations but it s not really fluctuation but it s really currency going one way as our local currency depreciates prices also go up because most of these goods are being paid for using foreign currency so that is translating into a very high inflationary environment so my assessment is it s a very difficult environment and for us as employers the biggest challenge is to look at what we pay staff whether it s enough for them to come to work the next day it creates a vicious cycle when one is working but is thinking where am i going to find fuel for the next day once productivity is low the cycle continues fm how best do you think we can deal with this situation bm we need to produce and need foreign currency to recapitalise our businesses for us my opinion is that for us as a banker what we can do is look for external lines of credit that is the role we play as bankers to be able to create a better environment for our country and seek external resources and channel them to the economy fm the group has a long history from its incorporation to listing and rebranding up to the present day what is the next chapter for cbz bm i think we are at a point where we need to rebrand again because all these brands need to be refreshed often but obviously timing is going to be key the next step really at least i would like to see in my tenure maybe for the next 3 to 5 years is to diversify business as it is right now cbz holdings is still largely a bank we have a properties business which is still very small so is insurance and asset management the objective is to create a well diversified financial services platform what we mean by that is if you look at the bank it should at least command 10 of the market share you can tick and say the bank is already there we are already at least 16 market share then you go to insurance business we want them to be at least 10 same thing for properties and asset management once you have ticked those boxes then you are closer to achieving that diversification then the next thing as part of that diversification is to look at regional assets that can also be under the cbz portfolio such that you are not only diversified in income stream but we are also in terms of geographical location we would love to diversify in all our lines of businesses if there is something that looks good in tanzania like synergies with our bank we would be happy to look at it but then we would have diversified regionally imagine if cbz had already achieved that diversification all these currency issues that we are talking about would be less of an issue because then we would have been are deriving from other lines of income with currencies that we could actually trade fm there is talk that the market has lost appetite for loans denominated in rtgs is this the correct position bm it s not true there is high appetite for loans the challenge we have in the market is good quality clients and the quality of the clientele is also related to the economy so the economy we live in unfortunately has also compromised a lot of those good quality corporates but the appetite for loans is always there we have high appetite for loans we are busy looking for good quality clients we do have a lot of rtgs and we want that money to find a home for a bank it s not profitable to sit with cash we also have appetite for usd loans but we do not have usd resources fm how are you dealing with non performing loans npls bm part of the challenge is that our underwriting has to be recalibrated to the realities of the economy so first thing is that we do adequate credit assessment historically we as cbz have had very high npls and one way we are addressing that is by improving how we manage those once they have been granted our target in the short to medium term is a npl rate of below 10 in the long term we can stabilise at 5 fm you continue to have a great deal of exposure to sovereign paper in the form of treasury bills tbs what has informed this preference bm there is a relationship between the size of our treasury bills and the size of our loan book and a lot of it has been repayments of our loans in the end sitting at the significantly higher treasury bills portfolio which is fine because it is an interest earning asset but what it means is that we also have a significant higher interest rate risk so we are also looking at ways in which we can manage risks implied by having a big tb portfolio because it s less a credit risk issue we don t think the central bank will default we also think they are our regulator so if they default it will have a wider consequence in that regard to that extent we believe the central bank is a good quality client but what we worry about is a high inflationary environment fm can you give us a breakdown of your current stock of tbs and when they fall due bm i would have those details but certainly in our annual reports but it is a high exposure they range from 1 to 10 years but it s a performing asset it earns interest and gets paid on time fm in a recent report the international monetary fund imf warned that following the currency conversion banks holding long maturity fixed interest rate tbs could also face exposure to potential maturity mismatch relative to their liabilities is this a concern for you bm banking is about managing mismatches so there is always that mismatch i don t know the specifics but if the imf is talking about mismatch that s what banking is all about you borrow money and lend to someone for 30 years and you can come and take money tomorrow so it s a mismatch business i think our treasury guys are able to manage the mismatch fm in 2017 you were slapped with a us 3 8 billion fine by the united states treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac for handling thousands of financial transactions on behalf of zb bank how would you describe the nature of your relationship with ofac bm i am not sure whether we were fined or it was an intention to fine so you will be aware that this is something we have disclosed that we have provided our arguments on why we should not be fined and this is something still sitting with our lawyers internally and externally in washington dc to seek resolution around this issue the cbz itself is not on the sanctions list there was an intention to fine on issues around facilitating transactions for sanctioned entities we are confident the issue will be resolved to our satisfaction
federal budget for the next fiscal year is under discussion in the national assembly and finance bill is yet to be tabled but national electric power regulatory authority has allowed the power distribution companies a uniform increase of rs 150 in electricity tariff it is one of the tough conditions included in the staff level international monetary fund imf agreement for the frontloaded loan programme of 6 billion this increase in power tariff is aimed at recovering rs 190 billion from electricity consumers within a period of 15 months to reduce the circular debt the prices of petroleum products have already been increased and gas tariff jacked after the critical comments of a senior official of president trump administration the international credit rating agencies see risks to the imf programme fetch has not improved pakistan rating from b negative despite the staff level agreement with the washington based multilateral lending agency the imf executive board will take up pakistan s bail out request in its meeting scheduled for 3rd july the sky high tariff of energy inputs is one of the major factors that vitiate the economic environment when the incumbent government decided to make a formal request for imf loans package a leading economist dr ashfaq ahmad khan strongly opposed it in a private tv current affairs programme because of its adverse impact on the economy which is already in the grip of stagflation he suggested ban on the import of luxury and unnecessary consumers goods and tax reforms as one of the components of home grown solution the trade bodies had also expressed reservations against the imf programme in their view every loan package of this global lending agency had hit hard the economy and particularly the export industries the power sector is plagued by rising line losses because of faulty transmission system and default of electricity bills by influential politicians businessmen and industrialists moreover nepra collusion with the owner of ipps by allowing them inflated electricity tariff by way of indexation with currency depreciation and 40 percent payments to them for idle plant capacity have made this sector a sinking ship frequent increases in electricity tariff and induction of 2000 plus megawatt of cheap hydel power in the national grid have not helped stabalise the electricity tariff and reduce the burden of rs 1 6 trillion circular debts the domestic consumers are switching over to solar energy systems and a number of industries have installed captive power plants particularly the sugar and cement industries the pti government is helplessly shifting the financial burden of shady power sector deals made by ppp and pml n governments the pml n last government made agreements with chinese companies for thermal and hydel power generation projects where high capital expenditure capex and per unit tariff were allowed capital expenditure for coal based thermal projects was 40 percent higher than the international cost and agreed electricity purchase price of 8 4 cent per unit was higher than the 5 cents per unit in many jurisdictions the hydropower projects which are being completed by chinese will alarmingly raise the electricity tariff in future a comparative data reveals that the agreed capital cost of different project vary widely when compared with dasu hydropower plant karot is 2 03 times more than the reference cost for dasu kohala 3 31 times azad pattan 3 97 times sukikinari 2 38 times and mahal 2 50 times the country needs energy but at affordable price to make its exports competitive for the overseas market and boost them by attracting foreign investment none of the two objectives can be achieved if the current trend of abnormally raising electricity tariff continues for the payment circular debt meaningful negotiations are needed with chinese government and ipps for lowering the tariff the focus should shift now on more competitive power generation projects like hydel wind and solar there is dire need of 10000 megawatts low cost electricity to significantly bring down the average tariff and reduce fuel imports for thermal power

reuters 1 the first cut with president donald trump s trade policies heightening fears of a u s recession expectations of a fed rate cut have dramatically increased in the past month money market pricing became even more aggressive after federal reserve chair jerome powell threw open the door to a cut promising on june 4 the fed would act as appropriate to address risks from the trade dispute it was the second sudden shift in the fed s tone after january when it abandoned its bias toward steady tightening so when would it be appropriate for the fed to act the federal open market committee might answer that question at its june 18 19 meeting money markets price a cut by july by end 2019 they reckon the fed will have cut twice at least the cme group s nasdaq fedwatch tool shows traders

advantages the fear is that retail sales and tourism receipts could drop as seen during the 2014 umbrella protests but a greater problem would arise if the united states decides hong kong is not

candidate after his akp party said the result was invalid the ousted mayor ekrem imamoglu who represents the main chp opposition party disagrees and calls the election a battle for democracy indeed the outcome of the vote will be a good indication of the future direction of policy in turkey a victory for the chp could bolster calls for reforms to revive the economy while proving potentially damaging for erdogan s authority but an akp win could allow erdogan to tighten his grip on power raising the stakes further is that the election takes place at a testing time tensions are running high

trade tensions have further slowed the pace of recovery since the end of the recession the economy has grown at about 2 a year in the united states and 3 worldwide both nearly a point below the average for postwar recoveries what explains the longest weakest recovery on record i blame the unintended consequences of huge government rescue programmes which have continued long after the recession passed before 2008 more open trade and better internet communications promoted strong growth by levelling the playing field inspiring author and columnist thomas friedman to declare that the world is flat once the crisis hit however governments erected barriers to protect domestic companies central banks aggressively printed money to restore high growth instead growth came back but in a sluggish new form as easy money propped up inefficient companies and gave big companies favourable access to cheap credit encouraging them to grow even bigger if the world was flat and fast before 2008 today it s fat and slow central bankers had hoped that low interest rates would spur investment increasing productivity and boosting growth but a recent paper from the national bureau of economic research shows that low rates gave big companies an incentive and means to grow bigger in the united states and europe 65 of the major business sectors are dominated by the three largest companies in that sector up from 40 in the years before 2008 as the power of dominant firms grows the share of national income that goes to workers has been shrinking fuelling inequality and anger four airlines and three rental car companies account for more than 80 of the american travel markets go into any american mall and you can buy jewellery at zales jared kay and roughly a dozen other chains all now owned by the same parent company as big companies grow bigger life gets tougher for entrepreneurs start ups represent a declining share of all companies in britain italy spain sweden the united states and many other industrialised economies the united states is generating start ups and shutting down established companies at the slowest rates since at least the 1970s these days tech insurgents aspire to be purchased by google and facebook not to replace them the bank for international settlements the global bank that serves central banks says low rates are fuelling the rise of zombie firms which don t earn enough profit to cover their interest payments and survive by repeatedly refinancing their loans zombies now account for 12 of the companies listed on stock exchanges in advanced economies and 16 in the united states up from 2 in the 1980s companies are surviving in the zombie state for longer depleting the productivity of healthy companies by competing with them for capital materials and labour these then are the trademarks of the fat and slow world easy money feeding the rise of larger corporations declining competition and fewer start ups all undermining productivity and slowing economies already hindered by falling growth in the working age population global productivity growth peaked at 3 5 a year before 2008 but has fallen by nearly a third over the same period us productivity growth has fallen by half to just over 1 the bright side of endless stimulus if there is one is that recessions have become increasingly rare only 7 of the nearly 200 countries tracked by the international monetary fund suffered negative growth last year that is half the average share since records began the imf projects that share will fall to 3 in 2020 close to a record low a global economy ruled by big indebted companies looks sluggish but in the view of many commentators also very stable even as trade wars undermine economic growth most investors assume central banks will ride to the rescue before it deteriorates into outright recession the problem however is that government stimulus programmes were conceived as a way to revive economies in recession not to keep growth alive indefinitely a world without recessions may sound like progress but recessions can be like forest fires purging the economy of dead brush so new shoots can grow lately the cycle of regeneration has been suspended as governments douse the first faint smoke of a coming recession with buckets of easy money and new spending now experiments in permanent stimulus are sapping the process of creative destruction at the heart of any capitalist system and breeding oversized zombies faster than start ups to assume that central banks can hold the next recession at bay indefinitely represents a dangerous complacency corporate debt levels continue to rise government debts and deficits continue to rise if there is a sudden break in confidence the damage will be that much greater and governments may find themselves too broke to stem the damage until then we are in a fat and slow world 2019 the new york times distributed by the new york times syndicate facebook twitter linkedin

here are eight things you might not know about the transformative power of these often small yet major contributions to sustainable development worldwide 1 about one in nine people globally are supported by funds sent home by migrant workers currently about one billion people in the world or one in seven are involved with remittances either by sending or receiving them around 800 million in the world or one in nine people are recipients of these flows of money sent by their family members who have migrated for work 2 what migrants send back home represents only 15 per cent of what they earn on average migrant workers send between us 200 and 300 home every one or two months contrary maybe to popular belief this represents only 15 per cent of what they earn the rest 85 per cent stays in the countries where they actually earn the money and is re ingested into the local economy or saved 3 remittances remain expensive to send these international money transfers tend to be costly on average globally currency conversions and fees amount to 7 per cent of the total amounts sent to ensure that the funds can be put to better purposes countries are aiming through sustainable development goal sdg 10 c to reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent by 2030 technical innovations in particular mobile technologies digitalization and blockchain can fundamentally transform the markets coupled with a more conducive regulatory environment 4 the money received is key in helping millions out of poverty although the money sent represents only 15 per cent of the money earned by migrants in the host countries it is often a major part of a household s total income in the countries of origin and as such represents a lifeline for millions of families it is not about the money being sent home it is about the impact on people s lives explains gilbert f houngbo president of the international fund for agricultural development ifad the small amounts of 200 or 300 that each migrant sends home make up about 60 per cent of the family s household income and this makes an enormous difference in their lives and the communities in which they live the small amounts of 200 or 300 that each migrant sends home make up about 60 per cent of the family s household income ifad head gilbert houngbo it is estimated that three quarters of remittances are used to cover essential things put food on the table and cover medical expenses school fees or housing expenses in addition in times of crises migrant workers tend to send more money home to cover loss of crops or family emergencies the rest about 25 per cent of remittances representing over 100 billion per year can be either saved or invested in asset building or activities that generate income jobs and transform economies in particular in rural areas 5 specifically remittances can help achieve at least seven of the 17 sdgs when migrants send money back home they contribute to several of the goals set in the 2030 sustainable development agenda in particular sdg 1 no poverty sdg 2 zero hunger sdg 3 good health and well being sdg 4 quality education sdg 6 clean water and sanitation sdg 8 decent work and economic growth and sdg 10 reduced inequality if current trends continue between 2015 and 2030 the timeframe of the 2030 agenda an estimated 8 5 trillion will be transferred by migrants to their communities of origin in developing countries of that amount more than 2 trillion a quarter will either be saved or invested a key aspect of sustainable development governments regulators and the private sector have an important role to play in leveraging the effects of these flows and in so doing helping nearly one billion people to reach their own sustainable development goals by 2030 ifad s gilbert f houngbo stressed in a statement 6 half of the money sent goes straight to rural areas where the world s poorest live around half of global remittances go to rural areas where three quarters of the world s poor and food insecure live it is estimated that globally the accumulated flows to rural areas over the next five years will reach 1 trillion 7 they are three times more important than international aid and counting remittances are a private source of capital that s over three times the amount of official development assistance oda and foreign direct investment fdi combined in 2018 over 200 million migrant workers sent 689 billion back home to remittance reliant countries of which 529 billion went to developing countries in addition the amount of money sent by international migrant workers to their families in developing countries is expected to rise to over 550 billion in 2019 up some 20 billion from 2018 according to ifad 8 the un is working to facilitate remittances worldwide it is fair to say that in poor rural areas remittances can help to make migration a choice rather than a necessity for so many young people and for future generations explained mr houngbo as such migrant contributions to development through remittances and investments is one of the objectives of the global compact on safe orderly and regular migration adopted by the un general assembly in december of last year with half of all flows going to rural areas in developing countries ifad the un s agency mandated with agricultural development is working to make the development impact of remittances even greater the organisation s financing facility for remittances programme ffr was designed to promote innovative business models in order to lower transfer costs and provide financial services for migrants and their families through partnerships across several sectors the programme runs initiatives to empower migrants and their families through financial education and inclusion as well as migrant investment and entrepreneurship over the past decade ifad has invested in over 40 countries supporting more than 60 projects aimed at leveraging the development impact of remittances for families and communities said paul winters ifad s associate vice president in an event held on friday at un headquarters in new york watch the special event held on friday 14 june at un headquarters on remittances
it s been a tough year for the federal reserve and it s only june berated in some corners for pushing up interest rates late last year the fed changed its tone in january and seemed set for a long comfortable pause then came a barrage of criticism from the white house and an unexpected escalation of global trade tensions the outlook has become murkier and riskier leading the markets to cry out for easier monetary policy we think the fed will be forced to acquiesce probably not at this month s meeting there hasn t been enough time to send the proper signals to the markets but lower rates are coming here is our take on the likely content of next week s conversations we are not forecasting a recession but the odds of one are rising trade sensitive sectors have been impaired and targeted retaliation by china against u s companies and industries will further the damage policy uncertainty is hindering business investment and as discussed below the outlook for american consumers may not be as bright as it was a few months ago the weakness of the phillips curve relationship between unemployment and inflation has occupied the attention of economists for several years now the first leg of that relationship the one between unemployment and wages still holds wage growth has risen steadily over the past five years but is nowhere near the heights achieved during the last expansion one potential explanation is that more slack remains in u s labor markets than meets the eye labor force participation for prime aged workers is still below the peak of the past cycle and the federal reserve s recently released report on the economic well being of u s households challenges the notion that america is at full employment a large fraction of workers want to work more than they are and almost half of u s workers did not receive a raise last year to be sure labor markets are tight in some areas but in others progress has been slower former fed chair janet yellen was a proponent of allowing the economy to run hot as a way to provide expanded opportunity many on the current fomc share that orientation one month does not a trend make so it is premature to call a turning point on the u s job front but persistent trade battles will put employment at risk in the months ahead for several years now the fed s models of inflation have suggested an impending return to 2 but more educated consumers and more efficient corporations have held inflation down to be fair many prominent inflation measures are close to or above 2 fed chair jerome powell among others has suggested that transitory factors are skewing results for the core pce deflator but worry over low inflation has been spreading prior to may s breakdown of talks between the u s and china the fed was primarily focused on its inflation targeting regime a series of town halls have evaluated structural changes and fed officials have debated whether it would cut rates if disinflation persisted amid an otherwise healthy expansion our view is that any alterations to the fed s targeting system are some ways off and are likely to be fairly flexible and while very low inflation should prompt central bankers to act u s inflation has not yet descended to a level that calls for an urgent response heightened trade frictions change the picture as we discussed in a recent note tariffs increase prices of the products involved but can become disinflationary if they dampen economic activity we think we have arrived at that second phase and inflation is likely to moderate further from here interpreting the yield curve has become more complicated as central banks commercial banks and foreign investors have become bigger owners of long term treasury securities but it is nonetheless a signal that we ignore out our own peril and while the fed s recent financial stability report highlights a handful of concerns about asset prices none could be considered proximate threats to the financial system with risks to the business cycle rising concern about market excesses should not be a primary concern members of the federal reserve community will certainly want to avoid the appearance of bowing to escalating pressure from the white house but alan greenspan reportedly advised jay powell to put earmuffs on and focus on the outlook that is what we think the fed will ultimately do summary a darkening outlook and increasing downside risks will eventually force the fed to respond next week s meeting will likely be too soon the blackout period for fomc participants commenced just after the disappointing job report came out but the statements and forecasts that emerge next wednesday afternoon will highlight increased uncertainty and a willingness to react the fed will be evaluating incoming economic data carefully and will watch the g 20 meeting at the end of june anxiously presidents trump and xi might certainly find enough common ground in osaka to call a temporary halt to economic hostilities and restart negotiations but recent provocations from both sides have gone so far that retreat is going to be difficult the fed probably wishes it had accumulated more dry powder by raising interest rates a bit further as the expansion continued and some fomc members may be tempted to reserve capacity until absolutely necessary but if modest rate reductions now can head off a worst case outcome later there is no compelling reason to wait some analysts are calling for a more sudden or substantial program from the fed the market currently expects three 25 basis point cuts during the balance of the year given what we know today two reductions should be enough to provide sufficient insurance and stability economists inside and outside of the fed will be monitoring events through the summer and will update expectations if conditions warrant we ll be offering immediate reflections on the fomc meeting via social media and we ll undoubtedly have much more on the fed in this space in the weeks ahead
responding to mounting speculations that south korea s central bank may soon lower the policy rate amid uncertainties treasury bond interest rates hit a record low this year market observers noted sunday gold price in contrast has remained strong and hit a new high reflecting investors increasing appetite for low risk assets the yield on three year treasury bonds closed at 1 470 percent on friday marking the first case that the figure fell under 1 5 percent since november 2016 according to the korea financial investment association the bond interest rate has remained weak throughout the first half of this year as the escalating trade war between the united states and china has been weighing upon financial markets around the world the figure dropped below the 1 75 percent mark the current policy rate set by the bank of korea on april 24 and has since then been extending its downturn in early june the korea capital market institute suggested in its report that the yield will linger narrowly above the 1 4 percent mark in the latter half of the year should the us china trade tension maintain status quo it was the bok gov lee ju yeol s latest hint at monetary easing which sped up the depreciation of the treasury bonds bank of korea gov lee ju yeol yonhap bank of korea gov lee ju yeol yonhap

gold is on a hot streak when will it cool down published sun 16 jun 2019 5 24 pm last updated sun 16 jun 2019 8 17 pm safe haven assets are off to a hot start again in june triggered by fast moving changes in market sentiment after the us federal reserve unexpectedly signalled it may be heading towards an interest rate cut over the coming months lower us interest rates appear to be warranted given concerns over the health of the global economy and the potential for another downturn in light of persistent external uncertainties and trade tensions between major economies across the world all of which are consistently adding negativity into market sentiment anxiety over issues that have weighed on market sentiment for nearly one year has now reached a boiling point the most resilient economy in the world over the past couple of years the united states is under an intense microscope that its central bank the federal reserve might need to cut interest rates several times over the second half of 2019 for context the fed paused interest rate hikes earlier this year when it became clear there were external risks connected to the possibility of a global economic slowdown because of the trade tensions drag effect on growth the decision reassured investors who became concerned about higher borrowing costs and potential dampening effects on investment at a time when trading relations between the us and china face uncertainty however the markets were not expecting hints about a rate cut so alarm bells rang when st louis fed president james bullard mentioned that one may be warranted soon the fed s renewed downbeat tone instantly revived buying interest in safe haven linked asset classes like gold which has reached a bullish streak of gains in valuation at the time of writing market uncertainty over the sudden shift in us interest rate expectations has practically in the span of just over a week added more than 50 to the price of gold as it spiked above 1 340 outrunning the us dollar which hit a brick wall as investors re evaluated their positions in the light of developments in interest rate expectations the greenback stayed true to its inverse correlation with gold this time and the dollar index hit a losing streak weakening by 1 per cent so far in june when it comes to market reactions in an atmosphere of uncertainty circumstances can change at the speed of light the us interest rate environment and linked financial instruments appear set for unexpected changes meaning that investors are likely hedging their short term bets with the zero yielding gold gold may be winning the safe haven races for the moment but for how long it depends on market moving factors like uncertainty over trade negotiations between the us and china and the economic effects of more expensive trading conditions between the two countries positive data from the us could revive interest in dollar linked financial instruments particularly if there is good news from employment and inflation benchmarks if there is bad news as seen in the disappointing non farm payroll numbers for may then gold s spurt ahead could continue in the short term based on heightened market expectations of a us interest rate cut by the end of the year by the same token if china s economy shows signs of cooling down gold may see more support because fears of a global slowdown may intensify additionally there were more risks of escalating tariff disputes between the us and mexico which generated negative investor sentiment and weighed on trade relations these risks appear to have subsided after a deal was announced during the week ending june 7 but there s always a chance that us president donald trump may bring tariff hikes back to the table judging by the course of us china negotiations looking ahead to the third quarter safe haven races appear set on a course shaped by trade tensions global slowdown fears and market expectations for a us interest rate cut for the time being gold has pulled ahead but market conditions are such that change can come at any time and the dollar may return to strong form and challenge gold s position the writer is global head of currency strategy and market research at fxtm views expressed are his own and do not reflect the newspaper s policy
this article first appeared in personal wealth the edge malaysia weekly on june 10 2019 june 16 2019 asia pacific ex japan had seen the world s strongest dividend growth since 2009 due to rising profits and expanding payout ratios according to the latest janus henderson global dividend index report released last month the region s 1q total of us 18 1 billion was up 14 7 year on year y o y on a headline basis setting a record even so the first quarter marks a seasonal low point thus one offs can distort the figures quite easily after adjusting for bhp s big special dividend and its franking credit which made up over a third of the total paid in australia as well as other factors underlying growth was a more modest 3 8 says the report the report notes that australia accounted for three quarters of the total dividend payout in 1q2019 and that the australian index has shown no dividend growth in the last five years however large dividends from commodity companies recently helped the country achieve a 1q dividend growth of 5 4 the fastest rate in almost a year the biggest contribution to growth came from woodside petroleum which is restoring its dividend after a couple of challenging years telstra cut its payout again while the largest payer commonwealth bank held its dividend flat in common with the recent trend in the wider banking sector in australia says the report in hong kong dividends rose 8 4 on an underlying basis delivering a total of us 3 1 billion this is despite seeing zero growth for the fourth year from sands china the biggest payer in hong kong meanwhile in china property developer longfor group holdings had the largest contribution to growth where the dividend increased almost 50 due to higher profits as for singapore only singapore telecoms paid a dividend holding it flat y o y in japan more companies have embraced the dividend paying culture resulting in income investors enjoying growth far ahead of the global average in the last five years dividends are 70 higher than in 2014 compared with 25 for the rest of the world this strong performance continued in 1q2019 although headline growth of 5 7 was held back by a weaker yen underlying growth was 8 7 says the report the report warns investors to be cautious of drawing too many conclusions for the full year as 1q2019 marked a seasonal low point for japanese dividends even so the fact that every company raised or held its dividend and that this was japan s best 1q on record is very positive it says adding that on the index japanese payouts score rose to 219 9 one of the highest in the world emerging market dividends were seasonally low in 1q2019 with the total falling 6 1 y o y to us 16 2 billion this was due to emerging market exchange rates which were weaker against the us dollar but dividends were 2 2 higher on an underlying basis india accounted for more than a quarter of the total and although most companies paid out less y o y the overall total jumped 12 7 on an underlying basis thanks to the payment of an extra us 700 million from oil natural gas corp it reported sharply higher profits thanks to rising product prices but also faced pressure from a cash strapped government shareholder to pay larger dividends says the report on a global level despite concerns about the macroeconomic environment corporate profits and dividends have largely met expectations so far dividends grew 7 8 on a headline basis in 1q2019 to a first quarter record of us 263 3 billion in line with the 2018 growth rate the report also states that underlying growth of 7 5 followed the same trend all time quarterly records were broken in the us and canada which are less affected by seasonal changes and new 1q records were set in eight other countries around the world growth in north america was the fastest in the world on an underlying basis and its seasonally large weighting in 1q2019 meant it made a significant contribution to global dividend growth says the report it notes that the janus henderson global dividend index rose to a record 190 1 in 1q2019 which means dividends are now almost twice the level they were at a decade ago when the index started the report says most companies in north america pay dividends every quarter which means that it accounts for more than three fifths of the global total in 1q the country s impressive headline 8 1 increase y o y to an all time record of us 133 1 billion therefore had a disproportionate influence on the overall global growth rate underlying growth was still stronger at 9 8 ahead of other parts of the world in the us dividends totalled a record us 122 5 billion which was up 8 3 on a headline basis with its underlying growth coming up better at 9 6 the us growth exceeded the global average 70 of the time over the last five years as company profits benefited from a robust economy and favourable tax changes says the report almost nine tenths of us companies in our index raised their dividends with the largest impact coming from the banking sector banking dividends jumped by a quarter adding us 1 9 billion y o y with many banks making high double digit increases the largest percentage increase came from citigroup however jp morgan made the biggest contribution to growth by paying almost us 700 million more y o y the us pharmaceutical payout was the highest and more than double that of its peers around the world with us 1 out of every us 11 of the total payouts were up 9 y o y meanwhile in canada weaker foreign exchange rates held back headline growth however dividends still reached a record us 10 7 billion up 12 in underlying terms this was the third consecutive quarter of double digit growth higher oil prices and the acquisition of spectra energy helped enbridge become canada s largest payer for the first time it increased its total payout by a third says the report as for sectors pharmaceutical dividends were the highest paying sector in 1q2019 contributing us 1 in every us 8 paid globally the report notes that novartis paid us 1 for every us 30 and roche was close behind as seen in the chart of world s biggest dividend payers the sector delivered an all time record of us 30 1 billion though its underlying growth rate was lower than the global average says the report the leisure sector delivered record payment boosted by a large special dividend from the uk s intercontinental hotels the report notes that on an underlying basis financial dividends grew the fastest thanks to us banks and real estate companies but that their growth rate was matched by utilities this is traditionally a high yielding slow growth sector and even after the strong 1q dividends are unchanged in a decade oil dividends also bounced back up by 10 y o y they are the second slowest growing sector after utilities in the last 10 years says the report save by subscribing to us for your print and or digital copy
further complicating the fed s calculations are the frequent attacks by mr trump on the central bank and regular appeals to keep the economy well juiced as he heads into his 2020 re election campaign they made a big mistake they raised interest rates far too fast mr trump told cnbc on monday in one of his sharpest diatribes yet about the fed it s more than just jay powell we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people if the fed were to cut rates it would be an insurance policy to keep ahead of the significant dislocation from the trade wars says sarah bloom raskin a former fed governor and deputy treasury secretary under barack obama and now a professor at duke university but if they leave markets and people in the economy with the idea that they caved to white house pressure they really run the risk of harming their credibility joining the dots with all of these countervailing forces at play most economists are now expecting the us central bank to keep interest rates on hold next week though they could modify the language in their statement to highlight the risks to the outlook from the trade war and shifts in economic data however fed officials will offer a major indication of whether they intend to ease policy later in the year as early as july in the economic projections they release alongside their policy statement after the meeting the forecasts include a so called dot plot graphic that maps fed officials individual interest rate expectations the dot plot doesn t give them a lot of room for ambiguity says david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution in washington people will look at the dots and the dots will either show a rate cut or they won t either way will have to explain that advertisement a move towards monetary easing in the coming months would be particularly striking because just a year ago after mr powell took office the fed had been proceeding comfortably with a series of interest rate rises to fully normalise policy in the hope it would give it more breathing room to tackle the next downturn rates had fallen to near zero after the financial crisis and the fed added more firepower to its monetary stimulus by proceeding with three rounds of bond purchases known as quantitative easing to sustain the recovery under janet yellen mr powell s predecessor the fed began to raise rates although at 2 25 2 5 per cent they are still less than half of their level in september 2007 last december the fed put the plans for further tightening on hold in what was described as mr powell s pivot towards a more patient approach to interest rate hikes after equity markets dropped sharply yet as recently as march fed officials were still expecting to resume rate rises in 2020 according to the dot plots chanelling greenspan fed officials are not however looking at the current situation through the lens of 2007 which would spook markets by signalling a looming recession but through the frame of the 1990s alan greenspan then chair cut rates in two cycles first in 1995 and then in 1998 during the asian financial crisis to help sustain the us expansion that took place under bill clinton in past episodes in the 1990s we did have insurance cuts by the fed richard clarida the fed vice chairman told cnbc earlier this month that has been in the monetary policy toolkit in the past the main factor that has soured the us outlook in recent months has been the escalation in trade tensions between the us and major trading partners in early may talks between washington and beijing to end their trade dispute unravelled leading to escalating tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods crossing the pacific ocean every day advertisement meanwhile the trump administration has threatened to slap tariffs on mexico for failing to curb immigration and is still considering levies on auto imports from the eu and japan is the most obvious and most important risk to the us economy and the world economy says joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington what the fed is wondering is if business gets worried and they cut back on investment and spending because they fear it could get even worse but predicting the course of us trade policy and its effects on the economy under such an impulsive president as mr trump is exceedingly difficult the trump factor frederic mishkin a former fed governor and a professor at columbia university says the fed needs to be cautious about changing course because the politics are so unpredictable it may just be bluster and it may go away if we get a reasonable accommodation with the chinese he says you don t want to be in a situation where you start lowering rates and then have to raise them shortly thereafter wall street is watching closely jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase this week said he hoped the fed would make the right decision based on the data adding that big cuts would be a bad sign if they are doing that means that the real economy is getting worse which is not good advertisement yet the white house continues to pile on the pressure for the earliest possible easing far be it for me to suggest it would be great if the fomc cut its target rate at the june meeting larry kudlow director of the national economic council said on thursday the fed would bristle at the notion that it could be influenced by mr trump s haranguing but one of its big challenges is that incoming economic data has not offered a crystal clear case for a particular course of action growth in gross domestic product of 3 1 per cent in the first quarter has given way to expectations collected by the atlanta fed of 2 1 per cent growth in the second quarter yet forecasters are not predicting that the us is sliding towards a recession there has been some weakening in manufacturing and consumer sentiment indicators while jobs figures showed a slowdown in hiring but retail sales data released on friday suggested that consumer spending remained solid subdued inflation one of the biggest factors that could tilt the fed towards rate cuts is that inflation has remained subdued the core personal consumption expenditures index grew by 1 6 per cent on a year on year basis in april well below the central bank s 2 per cent target while some fed officials see stubbornly low inflation as a fundamental challenge that should be tackled head on with rate cuts others see it as a more transitory factor and certainly not sufficient to justify monetary easing yet some economists warn that mr powell cannot afford to be excessively patient either and nipping any downturn in the bud is even more crucial for the fed now because low post crisis rates give it less space to ease monetary policy in the future if wanted to argue that easing should come sooner one of the arguments that he could make is that if you re at 2 5 per cent on the fed funds rate you want to get ahead of the slowdown you don t wait for it to get here says mr wessel if mr trump and xi jinping the chinese president emerge from the g20 summit in japan this month with no deal on trade or not even any signs of a new truce that might just clinch it for mr powell it s always hard to predict the economy he says it usually isn t this hard to predict the politicians financial times
those steps are aimed at demonstrating that the stated valuations of the assets can be realised and restoring confidence within a group of investors who believe the trust is carrying too much debt the move comes as the urf finds itself at the centre of an escalating controversy the fund is managed by walsh co subsidiary of dixon advisory which since has merged with evans dixon several other dixon companies also earn fees for providing services to the fund for that reason the urf is the epitome of vertical integration fee fest everyday australians hired dixon advisory to help them manage their savings dixon s advisers recommended they invest in the urf and then several of dixon s related companies charged fees for managing the fund and servicing assets advertisement since the fund listed in 2012 a staggering 272 million of fees costs and expenses have flown from the fund to dixon for context the fund s market capitalisation had gained 207 million until the end of last year while a further 84 million of distributions were paid to investors this year s 150 million slide in the market value has now put investors deeply in the red furthermore the us dollar s more than 30 per cent gain against the australian dollar has not given the fund s asset value the expected boost the most lucrative and most controversial aspect of the urf is its renovation strategy the urf hires dixon companies to buy sell and fix up properties its dixon projects unit the renovation arm has been particularly active advertisement dixon projects essentially has one client urf which is also controlled by dixon it operates on a cost plus model and adds a mark up of about 22 5 per cent on any development after it has charged architecture and design costs renovation rampage in the early years of the fund the intention was to buy distressed homes in working class parts of new jersey and ride the recovery however in 2014 the urf shifted towards buying premium properties fixing them up and renting them for higher prices the view was that few residents had the ability and finances to undertake meaningful renovations that could lift the value of properties situated in and around one of the most important commercial hubs in the world and so a renovation rampage began in five years dixon project fixed up 687 homes more than the size of its current portfolio in that period the spending on construction tallied about 263 million if the dixon charges are added the spend exceeded 360 million or about 540 000 a property advertisement those behind the strategy say the costs are standard and dixon projects could have either charged per hour for renovation or locked in a mark up the unit was managed with the aim of making 5 per cent development margin and this would be more or less depending on how efficiently a project was managed the intention also was to invest in and add value to the housing stock of the area when few were prepared to do so and there may have been a strategic rationale in the plan it is indisputable however that dixon advisory which directed investors into the urf managed the urf and charged the urf for renovations simply made more money if the urf developed more that is because in addition to margins charged by dixon projects the renovations were capitalised increasing the dollar amount of the assets which was used to calculate the percentage based management fees advertisement while urf does not dispute the renovating figures they stress that these should be considered a cost of delivery rather than outright fees debt blow out the fee structure also created an incentive to take on debt which tripled since 2014 to 850 million if the hybrid capital is included dixon projects was highly profitable the extent to which it contributed revenues to the wider dixon advisory group is evident in the accounts of laver place the previous holding company of the wealth business in fact laver place listed architecture design and construction management as its principal activities along with an array of financial services in 2015 and 2016 laver place generated 320 million of revenues but incurred 107 million of costs associated with property development advertisement this suggests that once the standard 22 5 per cent mark up for the provision of services is added dixon projects accounted for at least 40 per cent of dixon advisory s revenues the strategy has been lucrative for dixon but have urf investors benefited from the renovation splurge the evidence suggests not well not yet at least over five years the cumulative net operating cash flows of the fund have tallied to negative 154 million while the gross rental yields are relatively low the fund earned 37 million from 1 3 billion of properties although it expects it will earn a further 11 5 million once its renovated properties come online despite the huge spending and the currency tailwind the nta value has stagnated now this recent collapse in the share price means investors who were told to buy in are nursing large losses the urf however has recognised for some time that it needs to stabilise the portfolio it has waived its hefty management fee in recent years and reduced operating costs substantially this week in response to the failing share price evans dixon chief executive alan dixon stood down from that role to focus on the urf which announced it would cut its dividend from 5c to 1c and begin selling property to repay its debts advertisement hybrid headache to add to the extreme vertical integration dixon s clients the investors also provide its unsecured debt and preference share capital dixon has charged a total of 15 million in debt arranging fees since listing the stabilisation plan is to begin paying out the australian securities exchange listed urf ii and iii notes unsecured listed bonds issued to dixon advised investors with the cash generated from property sales while sales of properties used as security for a loan from wells fargo will also reduce debt but the urf also has 200 million worth of listed hybrids known as convertible preference units or cpus these securities which yield 6 25 per cent are trading at a 30 per cent discount to face value in december 2022 the interest rate will either step up to 8 75 per cent adding 5 million to debt servicing costs or convert to shares increasing the share count by about 60 per cent at current prices while it would be accretive for dixon to buy back the hybrids at the deep discount it would do little to reduce the high debt level of the fund so those in charge of the urf have their work cut out but they are confident they can manage the stabilisation dixon over its life has wound down several funds that either did not work or had run their course they say the positive for the urf is the fact there is still underlying capital growth and rental growth as properties are improved and new tenants agree to pay higher rents the urf said rents had increased about 3 per cent suggesting there is long term value in the assets advertisement the renovation strategy has reached its end and management s focus now is to deal with the debt burden and a widening discount as investors exit the management may argue that while dixon clearly benefited from the hundreds of millions of dollars outlay the strategy was well intentioned if ultimately flawed and the peak in the associated profits generated by dixon projects came at a time when the dixon business was put up for sale and valued at a multiple of those arguably unsustainable earnings this was a true renovator s delight
here are eight things you might not know about the transformative power of these often small yet major contributions to sustainable development worldwide 1 about one in nine people globally are supported by funds sent home by migrant workers currently about one billion people in the world or one in seven are involved with remittances either by sending or receiving them around 800 million in the world or one in nine people are recipients of these flows of money sent by their family members who have migrated for work 2 what migrants send back home represents only 15 per cent of what they earn on average migrant workers send between us 200 and 300 home every one or two months contrary maybe to popular belief this represents only 15 per cent of what they earn the rest 85 per cent stays in the countries where they actually earn the money and is re ingested into the local economy or saved 3 remittances remain expensive to send these international money transfers tend to be costly on average globally currency conversions and fees amount to 7 per cent of the total amounts sent to ensure that the funds can be put to better purposes countries are aiming through sustainable development goal sdg 10 c to reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent by 2030 technical innovations in particular mobile technologies digitalization and blockchain can fundamentally transform the markets coupled with a more conducive regulatory environment 4 the money received is key in helping millions out of poverty although the money sent represents only 15 per cent of the money earned by migrants in the host countries it is often a major part of a household s total income in the countries of origin and as such represents a lifeline for millions of families it is not about the money being sent home it is about the impact on people s lives explains gilbert f houngbo president of the international fund for agricultural development ifad the small amounts of 200 or 300 that each migrant sends home make up about 60 per cent of the family s household income and this makes an enormous difference in their lives and the communities in which they live the small amounts of 200 or 300 that each migrant sends home make up about 60 per cent of the family s household income ifad head gilbert houngbo it is estimated that three quarters of remittances are used to cover essential things put food on the table and cover medical expenses school fees or housing expenses in addition in times of crises migrant workers tend to send more money home to cover loss of crops or family emergencies the rest about 25 per cent of remittances representing over 100 billion per year can be either saved or invested in asset building or activities that generate income jobs and transform economies in particular in rural areas 5 specifically remittances can help achieve at least seven of the 17 sdgs when migrants send money back home they contribute to several of the goals set in the 2030 sustainable development agenda in particular sdg 1 no poverty sdg 2 zero hunger sdg 3 good health and well being sdg 4 quality education sdg 6 clean water and sanitation sdg 8 decent work and economic growth and sdg 10 reduced inequality if current trends continue between 2015 and 2030 the timeframe of the 2030 agenda an estimated 8 5 trillion will be transferred by migrants to their communities of origin in developing countries of that amount more than 2 trillion a quarter will either be saved or invested a key aspect of sustainable development governments regulators and the private sector have an important role to play in leveraging the effects of these flows and in so doing helping nearly one billion people to reach their own sustainable development goals by 2030 ifad s gilbert f houngbo stressed in a statement 6 half of the money sent goes straight to rural areas where the world s poorest live around half of global remittances go to rural areas where three quarters of the world s poor and food insecure live it is estimated that globally the accumulated flows to rural areas over the next five years will reach 1 trillion 7 they are three times more important than international aid and counting remittances are a private source of capital that s over three times the amount of official development assistance oda and foreign direct investment fdi combined in 2018 over 200 million migrant workers sent 689 billion back home to remittance reliant countries of which 529 billion went to developing countries in addition the amount of money sent by international migrant workers to their families in developing countries is expected to rise to over 550 billion in 2019 up some 20 billion from 2018 according to ifad 8 the un is working to facilitate remittances worldwide it is fair to say that in poor rural areas remittances can help to make migration a choice rather than a necessity for so many young people and for future generations explained mr houngbo as such migrant contributions to development through remittances and investments is one of the objectives of the global compact on safe orderly and regular migration adopted by the un general assembly in december of last year with half of all flows going to rural areas in developing countries ifad the un s agency mandated with agricultural development is working to make the development impact of remittances even greater the organisation s financing facility for remittances programme ffr was designed to promote innovative business models in order to lower transfer costs and provide financial services for migrants and their families through partnerships across several sectors the programme runs initiatives to empower migrants and their families through financial education and inclusion as well as migrant investment and entrepreneurship over the past decade ifad has invested in over 40 countries supporting more than 60 projects aimed at leveraging the development impact of remittances for families and communities said paul winters ifad s associate vice president in an event held on friday at un headquarters in new york source un news
maracay venezuela dozens of cars lined up alongside a gas station just after dawn on a highway in the venezuelan city of maracay in the central state of aragua drivers had been waiting for hours to buy gas partaking in an all too common ritual in the hopes that when it was their turn there would be enough gas left to fuel up luis chourio 40 spent two mornings last week at a gas station in maracay less than 80 miles from the capital of caracas waiting for hours to fill up his pickup truck but each time he made it to a pump he was told he would have to come back tomorrow what are we supposed to do the father of four said the wasted trips used up what little was left in his gas tank and last tuesday three men had to push his truck from the highway down a long hill to a pump where he was finally able to fuel up chourio said he worked from day to day as a soldier traveling to different parts of the country and if he couldn t commute i don t bring money home filling up his tank that day would give his family about two days of peace he said venezuelans described lost days of work anxiety at being unable to feed their families and endless hours waiting in lines because of a gas shortage that s hitting a country with the world s largest producible oil reserves for venezuelans who make it to a gas pump with fuel filling a tank is basically free drivers tip gas station workers a small amount but there is no real fixed price to fill your tank with the government keeping gas prices low but the shortages have made finding gas a major problem hours long lines for gas have become more and more common especially in states within the interior of venezuela but the shortages have increasingly crept closer to venezuela s capital hitting cities like maracay while caracas has been largely spared the long lines thus far venezuelans in other states are in such desperate need they ll sleep overnight outside gas stations if i don t have gas i have no way to work i have to go back home said jose diaz 50 who works for a local business that requires him to travel venezuela is facing an economic crisis with widespread shortages of basic goods and massive hyperinflation according to the government s own data the inflation rate hit 130 060 percent in 2018 critics of president nicolás maduro blame government mismanagement and corruption spanning years while the government blames u s sanctions that have frozen oil revenues cut crude oil exports and hampered the country s ability to import fuel in january the trump administration as part of its tightening sanctions banned u s exports of diluents that the venezuelan state run oil company pdvsa relied upon to process its heavy crude oil and just last week the u s government tightened restrictions on exports of diluents from international companies reuters reported data released from the united states energy information administration showed that in april venezuela s crude oil production fell down to its lowest levels since january 2003 when a countrywide strike nearly brought the state run oil company pdvsa s operations to a halt in april crude oil production averaged 830 000 barrels per day down from 1 2 million in the beginning of the year according to the data the agency said recent production declines can be attributed in part to widespread power outages mismanagement of the oil industry and u s sanctions mark weisbrot an economist and a co director of the center for economic and policy research a think tank in washington said the gas shortages were an intentional result of the u s sanctions under president donald trump it s all related to the fact that they re starving and trying to destroy the economy he said weisbrot said the underlying aim of the sanctions aim was to prevent the economy from recovering diaz and others said the real impact of the gas shortages went beyond long lines and even lost wages it was affecting everything from access to food to public transportation carlos julio rojas a community activist in caracas said the lack of gas meant needy families could not get the food or other goods they needed food is rotting in the interior of the country he said the gas shortages also meant disruptions to the once reliable public transportation system in caracas lengthening commutes and exposing venezuelans to more dangerous situations rojas said diaz also said the gas shortages were delaying the delivery of food in states in the venezuelan interior leading to rising costs and even when there is food available many families are simply unable to afford it facing hyperinflation and low wages it s monstrous the prices are going up daily diaz said from the gas station in maracay felipe garcia with his wife luisanny gonzalez and their baby arlet at a park in caracas roberto leon nbc news felipe garcia 34 a public employee in caracas said that even two years ago he and his wife were able to afford simple luxuries like buying a soda now he struggles to feed and take care of his 1 year old daughter arlet diapers and baby formula were unaffordable and the family struggles to keep enough food on the table he said many venezuelan families including garcia s rely on a government subsidized food aid program thank god his family receives the monthly box providing food and milk for arlet garcia said it isn t much but it does help our situation he said still garcia said if he could afford it he would relocate to chile to work and send back money for his family until they had enough money to leave venezuela altogether there are things that have been lost so much here in venezuela he said looking down while he and his family sat sharing a mango in a park sometimes it makes me want to cry because of everything that s happened this situation that we are living in is beyond the political he said it s like if it were a cancer we re eating ourselves
2014 bloomberg finance lp buffalo new york is seemingly the picture definition of rust belt once extraordinarily prosperous goldman sachs used to have an office there the industries that lifted it long ago are no longer relevant we generally only hear about it during the nfl s regular season or when someone tells us they re from buffalo raise your hand if you ve ever met someone who is moving to buffalo importantly the opinions offered above are hardly a speculation census statistics reported on by the new york post last week indicate that buffalo has lost an average of 51 residents per day since 2010 again we generally only meet people from buffalo ok so why is buffalo s economy so weak to believe the commentary at the moment from conservatives who surely know better and who will know better once a democrat is in the white house buffalo has a fed problem money is too tight in western new york which means the economy is sagging up front someone who hasn t bothered to consider the why behind money would say fed obsessed conservatives have a point figure that so called money supply is rather slight in buffalo except that anyone with a pulse would then deduce the actual why behind relatively scarce money supply there s very little there because there s very little production in the once prosperous city money isn t a driver of economic growth rather it s a consequence of it you can t eat money and while some have doubtless slept with it money only has a purpose insofar as it facilitates the exchange of market goods services or labor or as a way of pushing accession of goods services and labor into the future investment stating the obvious increased money supply from the central bank with an eye on stimulating economic growth is a screaming non sequitur money is again a consequence of economic growth it s abundant where there s production simply because we produce in order to get money is just an agreement about value that facilitates exchange of real things or the future accession once again investment of real things money supply is scarce in buffalo precisely because there s very little production to trade assuming the fed pumped dollars into buffalo banks through bond purchases the money would exit buffalo and its environs as quickly as it arrived since resources generally never sit idle neither does money it flows to where there are resources to exchange which brings us back to the conservative line of the moment about the u s economy supposedly it s beginning to sag and the fed is the source of the weakness to hear conservatives say it the fed is too tight ok on its own such a line of thinking is just silly credit is a global concept since resources are produced globally so any tightness allegedly created by the fed would be made up for by non u s credit sources that would desire exposure to an economy that conservatives have long claimed is amazing or one they used to claim was amazing or one they regularly claim is amazing when they re not blaming the fed for somehow making it less amazing it doesn t insult conservatives nor does it put words in their mouths to say that they ve been saying the economy has taken a sharp turn in the right direction ever since trump got into office there has been regular commentary about the u s economy being the best in a generation plus on friday in the wall street journal andy puzder relayed to readers that the economy is the best it s been in over a decade ok but if true then logic dictates that there wouldn t be a problem of credit or money supply where there s growth money and credit are everywhere indeed while there s little activity and little money supply in buffalo there s tons of each in palo alto well of course the economy is booming there does anyone seriously think particularly in consideration of how globalized is investor interest in silicon valley that the technologists and vcs out there are watching the ms that so excite the overnight monetarists in the conservative camp back to reality if you re productive you needn t worry about money supply money sources will beat a path to your door money finds growth always the idea that the fed could limit credit firstly presumes that the fed can create it it can t but also that access to resources credit is something regulated by a governmental body on constitution avenue in washington d c that s just not serious if fed tightness were the source of u s economic weakness then it would also be true that fed looseness in places like buffalo could fix what ails it no that s just silly buffalo sags because investment is the source of economic growth and investment follows people the problem is that buffalo s best and brightest keep moving from there as opposed to working there what s serious is that the fed can t alter reality not in buffalo and not in palo alto resources flow to their highest use money is once again just an agreement about value that facilitates the exchange of the fruits of productive activity extra money supply created by the fed for the u s economy will serve no purpose if the economy is weakening as conservatives occasionally speculate in much the same way that it would serve no purpose in western new york but since conservatives are convinced the fed is too tight and since they re using allegedly falling commodity prices to make this case it s worth addressing that argument while stating up front that the dollar s commodity value or its exchange value versus other currencies has never been part of the fed s portfolio second there s little correlation between alleged fed parsimony ease and the dollar s commodity and or currency value as is the dollar collapsed amid soaring fed rates in the 1970s and it revived in the 80s and 90s despite falling fed rates conservatives are strangely convinced of what s easy to disprove still let s look at the dollar price of gold when president trump entered office back then gold was trading at roughly 1 200 ounce today it trades at roughly 1 330 ounce oil it was in the low 50s then and it is now commodities certainly are an excellent signal of the dollar s condition but conservatives have blamed an overly strong dollar allegedly made strong by fed tightness for the supposedly weakening economy they ve cited gold and oil specifically but the dollar is quite a bit weaker versus gold since january of 2017 when trump entered office all of this matters when we remember that trump partisans have once again been cheering the trump economy as the greatest in a generation since not long after he entered office and while their exuberance is arguably overstated the trump economy has been good he signed a tax cut not nearly large enough too focused on middle earners not focused enough on high earners who are the source of growth he s been a ferocious deregulator and while he s gotten a weaker dollar contrary to what we re told the dollar hasn t collapsed trade policy has been bad but hopefully it doesn t get out of hand the main thing is that conservatives can t have it both ways the trump economy can t have been amazing and then suddenly bad overnight this is particularly true when they re blaming a strong dollar deflation and all of a sudden a tight fed umm it s been raising rates for years including when the trump economy was soaring on an allegedly weakening economy sorry guys the dollar is quite a bit weaker relative to when trump got into office and when the economy took off basically the conservative argument against the fed is backwards not only can the fed not stimulate economic growth not only does it not target the dollar s value the abilities ascribed to the central bank about its power to stimulate through devaluation don t stand up to the fact that the dollar has fallen versus gold not risen since trump entered office and since conservatives correlate dollar weakness with fed looseness as opposed to tightness it s time that they rethink an always easy to disprove argument and it s time they exit their devaluation stance investment is what drives growth and a weak dollar is a tax on investment in their odd jawboning of the fed conservatives inside and outside the trump administration are calling for the very dollar weakness that has a brilliant track record when it comes to bringing about the slow economic progress that

robert samuelson washington if you want a peek at the future try looking at japan it s a sobering exercise here s how economist timothy taylor managing editor of the journal of economic perspectives describes the country s outlook is facing a situation of a declining population and workforce and the share of the population that is elderly is on the rise driving up government spending on pensions and health care and together with attempts to stimulate its economy through government spending much of it on infrastructure japan has run up an enormous government debt to put it bluntly as i have argued before japan is slowly going out of business its population is shrinking and it resists immigration this cannot continue indefinitely what is significant about japan s situation is that it s shared to a greater or lesser extent by most of the world s advanced countries birth rates are depressed economies are expanding slowly if at all and debt burdens are high and often growing you may recall or not that in the late 1980s japan was widely expected to overtake the united states as the world s leading economy japanese firms also increasingly dominated old line manufacturing industries steel autos as well as new high technologies electronics what a difference a few decades make japan s economy though huge remains the world s third largest behind the united states and china but it is no longer the envy of the world many practices admired in the 1980s are less so today the biggest problem is the nation s aging a new report on japan from the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd quoted by taylor and posted on his useful blog the conversable economist reports this astounding fact half of japanese children born in 2007 are expected to live to 107 meanwhile japanese births have slumped the total fertility rate the number of children women are expected to have during their lifetimes was only 1 4 in 2016 compared with an oecd average of 1 7 a fertility rate of about 2 1 is needed for a population to replace itself deaths have exceeded births since 2007 and the population is expected to decline by 8 2 million in the 2030s the equivalent of losing tokyo naturally there are spillovers based on present trends the labor force will drop 25 by 2050 while the relationship between working age japanese 20 64 and the 65 and over population shifts sharply there are now two working age japanese for everyone 65 and over by 2050 that ratio is projected to fall to 1 3 working age japanese for each elderly person what this describes is an economic doomsday machine the increasing number of older japanese has already put enormous pressures on the government s budget since 1991 public social spending mainly for retirement pensions health care and long term care has doubled as a share of gross domestic product from 11 of gdp to 22 of gdp in 2018 the mounting deficit spending has in turn ballooned japan s government debt to 226 of gdp the highest ever recorded in the oecd area and roughly twice the u s level but efforts to reduce the deficits by cutting spending or raising taxes risk squeezing the incomes of younger workers and discouraging them from having more children of course japan s imbalanced population could be rectified through more immigration but this has never been popular in a country with such a strong sense of its own identity true the number of foreign workers doubled from 700 000 in 2013 to 1 46 million in 2018 still that was only 2 of japan s labor force the share of foreign residents was only 1 9 of japan s population in 2017 while the oecd average was 13 the ultimate cures for japan s ills are obvious women should have more children people should work longer economic growth should be accelerated despite some small improvements all have been impossible to achieve whether japan can find its way out of this box is uncertain there are good reasons politically to do nothing and weak reasons substantively to do something many advanced countries including the united states face similar though less severe problems the rest of the world will be watching says the oecd it may not like what it sees robert j samuelson is a columnist for the washington post writers group
further complicating the fed s calculations are the frequent attacks by mr trump on the central bank and regular appeals to keep the economy well juiced as he heads into his 2020 re election campaign they made a big mistake they raised interest rates far too fast mr trump told cnbc on monday in one of his sharpest diatribes yet about the fed it s more than just jay powell we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people if the fed were to cut rates it would be an insurance policy to keep ahead of the significant dislocation from the trade wars says sarah bloom raskin a former fed governor and deputy treasury secretary under barack obama and now a professor at duke university but if they leave markets and people in the economy with the idea that they caved to white house pressure they really run the risk of harming their credibility joining the dots with all of these countervailing forces at play most economists are now expecting the us central bank to keep interest rates on hold next week though they could modify the language in their statement to highlight the risks to the outlook from the trade war and shifts in economic data however fed officials will offer a major indication of whether they intend to ease policy later in the year as early as july in the economic projections they release alongside their policy statement after the meeting the forecasts include a so called dot plot graphic that maps fed officials individual interest rate expectations the dot plot doesn t give them a lot of room for ambiguity says david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution in washington people will look at the dots and the dots will either show a rate cut or they won t either way will have to explain that advertisement a move towards monetary easing in the coming months would be particularly striking because just a year ago after mr powell took office the fed had been proceeding comfortably with a series of interest rate rises to fully normalise policy in the hope it would give it more breathing room to tackle the next downturn rates had fallen to near zero after the financial crisis and the fed added more firepower to its monetary stimulus by proceeding with three rounds of bond purchases known as quantitative easing to sustain the recovery under janet yellen mr powell s predecessor the fed began to raise rates although at 2 25 2 5 per cent they are still less than half of their level in september 2007 last december the fed put the plans for further tightening on hold in what was described as mr powell s pivot towards a more patient approach to interest rate hikes after equity markets dropped sharply yet as recently as march fed officials were still expecting to resume rate rises in 2020 according to the dot plots chanelling greenspan fed officials are not however looking at the current situation through the lens of 2007 which would spook markets by signalling a looming recession but through the frame of the 1990s alan greenspan then chair cut rates in two cycles first in 1995 and then in 1998 during the asian financial crisis to help sustain the us expansion that took place under bill clinton in past episodes in the 1990s we did have insurance cuts by the fed richard clarida the fed vice chairman told cnbc earlier this month that has been in the monetary policy toolkit in the past the main factor that has soured the us outlook in recent months has been the escalation in trade tensions between the us and major trading partners in early may talks between washington and beijing to end their trade dispute unravelled leading to escalating tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods crossing the pacific ocean every day advertisement meanwhile the trump administration has threatened to slap tariffs on mexico for failing to curb immigration and is still considering levies on auto imports from the eu and japan is the most obvious and most important risk to the us economy and the world economy says joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington what the fed is wondering is if business gets worried and they cut back on investment and spending because they fear it could get even worse but predicting the course of us trade policy and its effects on the economy under such an impulsive president as mr trump is exceedingly difficult the trump factor frederic mishkin a former fed governor and a professor at columbia university says the fed needs to be cautious about changing course because the politics are so unpredictable it may just be bluster and it may go away if we get a reasonable accommodation with the chinese he says you don t want to be in a situation where you start lowering rates and then have to raise them shortly thereafter wall street is watching closely jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase this week said he hoped the fed would make the right decision based on the data adding that big cuts would be a bad sign if they are doing that means that the real economy is getting worse which is not good advertisement yet the white house continues to pile on the pressure for the earliest possible easing far be it for me to suggest it would be great if the fomc cut its target rate at the june meeting larry kudlow director of the national economic council said on thursday the fed would bristle at the notion that it could be influenced by mr trump s haranguing but one of its big challenges is that incoming economic data has not offered a crystal clear case for a particular course of action growth in gross domestic product of 3 1 per cent in the first quarter has given way to expectations collected by the atlanta fed of 2 1 per cent growth in the second quarter yet forecasters are not predicting that the us is sliding towards a recession there has been some weakening in manufacturing and consumer sentiment indicators while jobs figures showed a slowdown in hiring but retail sales data released on friday suggested that consumer spending remained solid subdued inflation one of the biggest factors that could tilt the fed towards rate cuts is that inflation has remained subdued the core personal consumption expenditures index grew by 1 6 per cent on a year on year basis in april well below the central bank s 2 per cent target while some fed officials see stubbornly low inflation as a fundamental challenge that should be tackled head on with rate cuts others see it as a more transitory factor and certainly not sufficient to justify monetary easing yet some economists warn that mr powell cannot afford to be excessively patient either and nipping any downturn in the bud is even more crucial for the fed now because low post crisis rates give it less space to ease monetary policy in the future if wanted to argue that easing should come sooner one of the arguments that he could make is that if you re at 2 5 per cent on the fed funds rate you want to get ahead of the slowdown you don t wait for it to get here says mr wessel if mr trump and xi jinping the chinese president emerge from the g20 summit in japan this month with no deal on trade or not even any signs of a new truce that might just clinch it for mr powell it s always hard to predict the economy he says it usually isn t this hard to predict the politicians financial times

june wasn t a great month for the labor market economists blame president donald trump s trade war and warn that if he follows through with his protectionist agenda he could lead america into a recession friday s announcement from the bureau of labor statistics that the economy added just 75 000 jobs well below expectations came two days after payroll processor adp s report on private sector employment reported that a mere 27 000 jobs were added in may even though the adp report earlier this week foreshadowed a possible miss for today this is even worse than the lower band of most people s expectations said chris zaccarelli chief information officer for the independent advisor alliance this is a clear warning sign that the trade war is doing serious damage to the economy said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the fingerprints of the trade war are increasingly evident in the data weakness in manufacturing jobs which were flat in may is one big clue he said job growth in manufacturing last year was averaging 20 000 to 25 000 per month this year it s barely positive may s loss of retail and transportation jobs also reflects the impact of shrinking margins and a constriction in global trade he added several labor economists highlighted manufacturing in particular although the trump presidency has been defined by an oft stated commitment to support american manufacturers the trade war is costing far more jobs than it has added and the sector s woes might only be beginning said glassdoor com senior economist daniel zhao trump s presidency has been defined by a pledge to support american manufacturers but the trade war is costing far more jobs than it has added said one economist zhao said glassdoor s own internal data also reflected a contraction we ve seen declining job openings which could signal that the slowdown in manufacturing could actually worsen in the near future with the economy on an upward trajectory for an unprecedented decade long run a slowdown was inevitable at some point labor market experts had been expecting a gradual winding down but trade tensions have thrown out the playbook for their expectations about its speed and severity economists warned that a race toward tariffs could quickly put any job gains in the rear view mirror and could send the american economy barreling into a recession if the president continues to pursue the war certainly if he escalates things i think recession risks rise zandi said trump s strategy of wielding tariffs as a catch all instrument for reshaping everything from global supply chains to geopolitical alliances could break the economy s long string of job gains sooner than expected predicted josh wright chief economist at icims next month it s definitely possible given the severity of these headlines this is a fast moving situation wright said things could get a lot worse over the course of this month wright said this will challenge the federal reserve to chart a path forward that threads the needle between inflation and growth without making a mistake it actually makes the conversation harder he said this makes it easier for the fed to make the case for rate cuts but i don t think this is enough on its own the stock markets are banking on the fed s ability to step in and save the day as it has for much of the last decade said cliff hodge director of investments for cornerstone wealth in a recovery characterized by an extended stretch of historically low interest rates though the fed s ability to ward off an economic slide may be diminished the fed has less room to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy zhao said there s still room for the fed to work with but if the economy were to slow down more dramatically that certainly would be a concern for now job growth remains in positive territory even though both the bls and adp reports on job gains turned out to be unpleasant surprises this gives market observers a measure of hope ultimately the labor market is still running hot enough to keep burning in the future zhao said this report indicates that employers are taking their foot off the gas they re not hitting the brakes quite yet but it definitely is a warning sign for the economy moving forward although the unemployment rate remained steady at 3 6 percent zhao said weaker wage growth and labor force participation were a bad sign those two signals do indicate an even weaker report than just the topline numbers imply he said downward revisions to march and april reports that shaved another combined 75 000 jobs off the total added to zandi s concern that s another indication that the economy is really turning that s when you get these downward revisions he said shutting down the multifront trade war now including trump s threats to levy tariffs on all chinese and mexican imports as well as on imported vehicles could bring the economic trajectory back to normal but that window is closing fast zandi said if he follows all the way through then we re done game over i think we have a recession
today we present a guest post written by jeffrey frankel harpel professor at harvard s kennedy school of government and formerly a member of the white house council of economic advisers remembering martin feldstein june 13 2019 here in cambridge we are reeling from the passing of martin feldstein on tuesday he was tremendously influential both as scholar and teacher he was also a major policy maker below the last section of this remembrance offers some recollections of his time as chairman of ronald reagan s council of economic advisers in addition remembrances at his funeral service today appropriately emphasized some qualities not known to those who knew of him only as a conservative economist his generosity and humanity he was greatly interested in other people especially young people a personal anecdote once leaving a conference at stockbridge vt i discovered that somebody else had taken my taxi leaving me in danger of missing my plane from the airport in lebanon nh marty and his wife kate dropped what they were doing and made the 75 mile roundtrip drive to get me to the airport on time marty and the nber martin feldstein was also remarkable as a builder of institutions particularly the national bureau of economic research when he took over the nber in 1977 it was a small sleepy outfit in new york city that researched business cycle statistics he transformed it utterly into the leading think tank for economic research by far like the advent of uber the new nber consisted of several innovations rolled into one some observers wondered how a small think tank in cambridge massachusetts could turn out thousands of important research papers the most innovative of marty s ideas was the that its members would be leading scholars in applied fields who remained employees of their universities spread throughout the country but who would simultaneously be members of the nber there they interacted with other leading scholars in their field via working papers grants program meetings and conferences one key to the success that marty had with the nber was the relentless emphasis on bringing in young scholars i refer especially to the annual process for nominating and approving new untenured faculty as a result of this visionary ever greening the bureau has avoided the eventual aging problem of some other institutions and stayed at the frontier my experience working for marty at the cea in 1983 martin feldstein asked me to work for him at the president s council of economic advisers i hadn t known him well before that having gone to mit rather than harvard but in the job interview it turned out that a paper i was writing fit in perfectly with ideas he was developing and he offered me the job on the spot the idea we shared is that even though the strong dollar of that period had an adverse effect on the us trade balance this was just a symptom which could not be sensibly addressed without tackling the root problem which was an excessive budget deficit it was a straightforward application of the mundell fleming model together with an argument that if the fiscal expansion was taken as given then it was better to spread its crowding out effects across the traded and non traded sectors of the economy than to concentrate the damage in the non traded sector alone i happily took the job as an opportunity to work with professor feldstein who was soon to become marty to me as to so many others during this period he was the first to popularize the notion of the twin deficits that the newly swollen us trade deficit was the result of a large budget deficit the analysis was an implicit rebuke to those who had foolishly predicted that the tax cuts enacted in 1981 would lead to smaller budget deficits and higher national saving rather than the reverse others in the white house and the treasury did not accept our forecast made in the february 1984 economic report of the president that the trade deficit would continue to rise let alone our diagnosis as to why it made front page headlines when treasury secretary donald regan responded to a question in congressional testimony by confirming that so far as he was concerned the erp could be thrown in the trash personally i was pleased but feldstein was under enormous pressure with regular press reports that he was about to be fired the truth is that president reagan never said a word to discourage him either in public or private and he was not pushed out of office ahead of schedule as the press thought but he was outnumbered by others in the administration and it took a lot of bravery conviction and principle to stand his ground i learned a tremendous amount from him including how to conduct oneself with integrity in washington a year later our numerical forecast for the 1984 trade deficit proved to have been right on target years later donald trump and the congress passed a large corporate tax cut in december 2017 marty actually came out in support of that tax cut but i felt confident in predicting that the us trade deficit would widen not narrow as trump had promised after all i had learned it from marty this post written by

lauren rudd today is father s day a sad reminder that it has been 17 years since you passed away i know as i have known in years past that i can never actually give you this letter however if you could read it i know you would be even more shocked and overwhelmed by what is happening in the world and in the financial markets than you were when i wrote to you a year ago as always and i know i have said it many times but i still cannot help but reminisce over the early 50s and as i always do on father s day i again take down and review my well used and underlined fourth edition of graham and dodd s classic security analysis although the text is buried deep within a compliment of investment tomes most of which bear a striking resemblance to treatises on advanced mathematics it continues to bear reviewing computer technology and sophisticated mathematics have become an integral part of the investment world yet many of the principles you taught graduate students using graham and dodd remain relevant even in today s complex world of financial engineering yes the major equity indexes have reached record levels levels that both you and i would have once thought impossible and yet a letter written by seth a klarman a billionaire recognized for his sober and meticulous analysis of the investing world to the attendees in davos switzerland last january is a dire analysis of global social tensions rising debt levels and receding american leadership klarman a 61 year old value investor who manages the 27 billion baupost group and is referred to as the oracle of boston wrote that a growing sense of political and social divide around the globe may end in economic calamity note citigroup made the same point on march 5 2006 klarman is baffled by investor acquiescence to president trump s twitter outbursts and the retreating role of america in world affairs social frictions remain a challenge for democracies around the world and we wonder when investors might take more notice of this he added that social cohesion is essential for those who have capital to invest klarman wrote meanwhile our economy has seen 10 years of growth without a recession that has happened only once before during the long expansion that ended in march 2001 so is there cause for celebration or as klarman points out are we potentially facing economic calamity nonetheless if we can make it past july 1 without a recession the current economic recovery will turn out to have been the longest in american history that proclamation comes from james poterba an m i t economics professor as president of the national bureau of economic research nber poterba s words do carry weight remember that the nonprofit research organization is the semiofficial arbiter of recessions and expansions in the united states the unfortunate fact is that the nber cannot tell if we have really made it through 10 years without a recession moreover the data is not precise enough to pin down the actual start or stop of a recession much less the total period of economic growth the nber could not declare that the last recession was underway until december 2008 a year after the economy started to decline similarly it was not until september 2010 or that there was enough evidence to declare june 2009 the end of the recession meanwhile we are currently embroiled in a trade war with several of our previously key trading partners so where does that leave us as we look ahead to the next 12 months it appears that even the fed is becoming worried st louis fed president james bullard one of the most dovish members of the fed is the first fed official to publicly suggest that the fed may need to cut interest rates soon to prop up inflation and counter the downside economic risks from slower growth abroad and an escalating trade war well dad that is all for now i continue to follow in your footsteps by teaching and writing newspaper columns with the hope that my words may one day and in some way enhance the investment life of others your loving son lauren rudd is president of rudd international an asset management firm neither lauren rudd nor his employees have plans to buy any stocks discussed herein within the next 30 days nor is there any intended inducement to buy or sell any security you can write to him at lauren rudd ruddinternational com or call him at 941 706 3449 for back columns go to www ruddinternational com lauren rudd offers commentary thursdays on snn local news during the 5 30 p m live newscast

this is fine photo spencer platt getty images some democratic presidential candidates say that america s economic system is badly broken and in need of sweeping structural change others say that the existing order is fundamentally sound even if it could use a few modest renovations the former are widely portrayed as ideologues or extremists the latter as moderates and it s certainly true that bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are ideologically extreme if our baseline is the median member of congress or the median policy agenda pursued by recent american presidents but it s not clear why these would be the appropriate metrics after all we do not equate calls for sweeping change whether from recent precedent or from current consensus with extremism in all circumstances when young people in an islamist autocracy take to the streets demanding basic civil rights we do not regard them as radicals or the regime s apologists as moderates our assessment of the dissenters ideological character does not hinge on how far their values depart from those of the status quo order but rather on how far that status quo departs from our consensus values thus whether it is truly extreme or moderate to demand sweeping changes to american capitalism depends on the degree to which the existing system aligns with common sense views of what a just or rational economic system should look like happily the federal reserve just released some data that makes the state of this alignment easier to gauge in its new distributive financial accounts data series the central bank offers a granular picture of how american capitalism has been distributing the gains of economic growth over the past three decades matt bruenig of the people s policy project took the fed s data and calculated how much the respective net worth of america s top one percent and its bottom 50 percent has changed since 1989 he found that america s superrich have grown about 21 trillion richer since taylor swift was born while those in the bottom half of the wealth distribution have grown 900 billion poorer notably this measure of wealth includes liabilities such as student debt and it does not include consumer goods such as computers or refrigerators as economists do not conventionally view such products as wealth assets but if one did include the fed s data on the distribution of consumer goods the wealth gap between the top one percent and bottom 50 would actually be even larger so is an economic system that distributes its benefits in this manner consistent with americans common sense views of economic justice if not would incremental changes be sufficient to bring it into alignment with the median american s values or would more sweeping measures be required put differently does the average american believe that over the past three decades our nation s richest one percent have contributed roughly 22 trillion more to our collective well being than the poorest 50 percent have does she think that the tens of millions of working class people who spent the past 30 years cooking other americans dinner cleaning their toilets caring for their children harvesting their crops ringing up their groceries and performing the countless other poorly remunerated forms of labor that our society demands collectively produced an infinitesimal fraction of the value that america s corporate lawyers hedge fund managers venture capitalists specialist physicians heirs and heiresses and other high paid professionals did survey data and common sense says otherwise in 2011 michael norton of harvard business school and dan ariely of duke university published a study on americans views of how wealth was distributed in their society and how they felt it should be distributed they found that in the average american s ideal world the richest 20 percent would own 32 percent of national wealth in reality the top quintile owned 84 percent as of 2011 and that share has grown in the intervening years today the one percent alone commands roughly 40 percent of all america s wealth chart slate this image comes courtesy of slate given all this any politician who insists that american capitalism is already great is clearly a far right extremist whose indifference to inequality puts him or her wildly out of step with ordinary people but is it the case that warren and sanders would take things too far in the other direction not remotely i do not have the relevant data or skills to project precisely how the full implementation of either candidate s agenda would influence america s wealth distribution but neither candidate is calling for a series of reforms that would place the united states far outside the western european norm in fact both warren and sanders have cribbed their signature policies from european nations as the 2018 world inequality report demonstrated policy choices do matter and income inequality is much lower in western europe than it is in the u s but even scandinavia s social democracies feature far more inequitable distributions of wealth than americans think to be fair according to ariely and norton s survey what s more it will take a lot of redistribution just to prevent america s current wealth gap from growing even larger the fundamental challenge in combating inequality is that wealth begets more wealth those who can afford to invest in bonds get to collect annual interest payments those who invest in stocks or real estate typically see their capital assets annually appreciate thus most years our nation s collective capital stock directs loads of passive income to america s wealthiest citizens as vox s matt yglesias observes much of the explosion in wealth inequality that the fed documents can be attributed to the fact that the one percent began 1989 owning a wildly disproportionate share of corporate equities and private businesses the passive income generated by these assets would have allowed the one percent to pull away from everyone else even in the absence of soaring wage inequality nothing short of progressively redistributing ownership of capital assets could bring our nation s wealth distribution into alignment with its values for the moment neither warren nor sanders has released a detailed plan for doing that on a large scale their current platforms would be less likely to significantly reduce wealth inequality than to merely slow its growth perhaps we should adopt redistributive policies and institutions that are common throughout western europe so as to prevent the one percent s share of national wealth from rising too far above 40 percent sounds like an extreme proposition to you but the alternative or at least the alternative s implications for wealth inequality would strike the average american as far more radical

behind tanker attacks in gulf june 14 after two more oil tankers were attacked in the middle east this brings to six the number of oil tankers attacked by iran iran is attempting to get the united states to lift its crippling economic sanctions which have severely restricted its oil shipments iran is trying to interdict oil shipments from competing countries in the region and could be trying to drive up world oil prices but this strategy runs the risk of the us and other countries taking military action against iran we and other impacted countries should put an end to the iranian attacks on the oil tankers by conducting mine sweeping operations in the gulf of oman strait of hormuz and the persian gulf impacted countries should provide naval escorts to the tankers if necessary iranian naval forces should be neutralized and while at it we could take out iran s strategic weapons systems donald moskowitzlondonderry nhregarding chief justice accuses ohana of anarchy and has ohana s attack on the court poisoned the well both june 14 at college they tried to teach us thick engineering students about humanities by asking if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it does it make a noise i consider the assertion by the israeli supreme court judges that they are upholding democracy by thwarting the will of the democratically elected government to be showing the same degree of insanity but maybe not the judges like any other despots are trying to maintain the power that they have unilaterally grasped and who is going to take that away from them in a court of law one of their common assertions is that unlike politicians judges are trained to eliminate their personal conditioning and bias and are able to deliver fair and balanced judgments that sounds good but again using engineering rather than humanities logic one has to ask if that is the case then why are those in the legal profession fighting so hard against the proposal to change who elects supreme court judges if all judges are equally unbiased believing that the law trumps democracy also shows a disregard for history judges were complicit in apartheid south africa in jim crow in the usa in nazi germany etc a good record of upholding the law but where was justice so regarding law and justice here in israel i think it s very appropriate for someone who can stand up to the power of the supreme court cabal to be called the justice minister bob knightmodi inbefore criticizing new acting justice minister amir ohana for saying that he would not always follow the judgment of the supreme court on matters relating to the security of the country perhaps one should try to understand what his argument is one may ask on what basis the court considers that its views on what is needed to protect israel can override those of the government that was the case put by ohana the classic division of powers no longer operates in the court s view as it has arrogated to itself the right on a most flimsy ground to interfere in matters of defense and security with the substitution of what it believes is reasonable for what the government on the evidence before it considers necessary have we substituted the infallibility of the court for that of the pope i can understand hayut s attack on ohana as she desires to maintain the supremacy of the court but why should the jerusalem post blindly follow the dictates of the left to castigate ohana rather than to present the matter properly m rabin llb llmjerusalemthe emphatic and emotional praise with which pastor john hagee devoted founder and chairman of christians united for israel cufi mourned rabbi yechiel eckstein founder of the international fellowship of christians and jews ifcj and lauded the immense role he played in ensuring the welfare of the state of israel and the jewish people john hagee s juggernaut may 24 is shared by many of us as a member of the board of the federation of jewish communities of the former soviet union i got to see up close the great personal sacrifice and dedication yechiel as he was lovingly known to so many applied to his work and the extraordinary results he and the fellowship subsequently achieved for countless jews from the former soviet union both in israel and the diaspora much of rabbi eckstein s work to protect our people and our land will never be known to the public achieved as they were quietly behind the scenes with the sweat and tears of rabbi yechiel zvi ben shimon leib many of us were concerned about the fate of the fellowship s support we needn t have been even while mourning her own deeply personal loss yechiel s right hand woman confidante organizational whiz and beloved daughter yael seamlessly and flawlessly picked up the baton and the devoted men and women of the fellowship responded in kind not only did the support for our work in the former soviet union not slow but some of our communities begun receiving significantly more aid than in the past yael and the fellowship similarly stepped right up to the plate after the chabad of poway shooting to procure the necessary funds to secure chabad houses as well as after the recent brush fires and the obliteration of mevo modi im to provide necessities to many families who no longer have homes and basic amenities like her heroic father of blessed memory yael fits her role and position perfectly and wears it regally and humbly whether presiding over the many complex and high stakes meetings i attend or conducting grueling travel to the distant corners of the former soviet union to evaluate up close the needs of remote jewish communities nothing seems to phase her no task appears too difficult i am certain that seeing his care compassion and dynamism continued and increased in yael s leadership of the ifcj and recognizing that it is now one of the most impactful organizations in the jewish world yechiel is smiling from his perch in gan eden and encouraging us too to be comforted in the knowledge that the strong foundations he established will be expanded on by yael s leadership well into the future shlomi pelesthe federation of jewish communities of the fsu half of israelis in favor of removing gaza blockade june 13 gives us the latest definitive survey run by the academic institute for structural reforms with such an impressive name and huge headline how can you go wrong easy they surveyed a representative sample of 608 jews and arabs and on that basis came to astounding conclusions 51 of respondents believe that israel should care about the economic and humanitarian situation in gaza really that makes about a busload and a half of the people who were surveyed here s a great quote if the israel leaders would gather their wits and urgently promote the economic rehabilitation of gaza the studies show that they will enjoy the support of sizeable portion of the israeli public who exactly the same 300 or so people the israelis i know are much too smart to fall for this sort of nonsense those of us who studied history remember the marshall plan at the end of ww2 that was to rehabilitate the wreckage of europe but it was put into place only after the wreckage had been smoldering for months and the defeated nazis knew that they had totally and spectacularly lost my favorite quote despite hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid money minimal reconstruction has been carried out could it be that the powers that be in gaza haven t been dealt a defeat yet meanwhile they can just pocket the money for themselves as they have been doing for years that same wonderful article perpetrates the old disproved theory that economic hardship leads to radicalization please many of the terrorists come from middle class and even wealthy families i am astonished that anyone would quote this stupidity as a good source of information thelma jacobsonpetah tikvaregarding 240 israeli jewish academics urge against calling bds antisemitic june 12 these individuals who have embraced bds demonstrate a view of judaism like that of their obvious historical influence gertrude stein a jew who embraced the vichy regime to call bds a legitimate and nonviolent tool of resistance is to myopically ignore the success of joseph goebbels and his brownshirts whose boycott of jewish businesses led directly to kristallnacht and auschwitz by their unconditional support of bds these academics have embraced the clarion call of bds cofounder omar barghouti who has made clear that the sole purpose of bds is the euthanasia of israel a student of history barghouti knows full well that the nazi t4 euthanasiav program was the foundation of the final solution of the jews as enacted in the wannsee protocol in january 1942 his use of the word euthanasia is further evidence that he co founded bds for the sole purpose of continuing the antisemitic eliminationist mission formalized by reinhard heydrich and adolf eichmann at the wannsee conference unfortunately history makes clear that jewish self immolation can take many forms and intellect is no bar to its fiery result from gertrude stein s embrace of vichy and velodrome d hiver to these 240 jewish israeli academics embracing omar barghouti s euthanasia of israel the antisemitic genocidal boycott of jewish businesses repeats itself nothwithstanding perverse intellectual rationalizations to the contrary richard shermanmargate floridatovah lazaroff at the un the battle for j lem is eternally waged june 4 writes correctly that following the un s admittance of israel as a member state references to the sovereignty status of jerusalem often go back to un general assembly resolution 181 in 1947 which proposed a partition of the area marked as mandate palestine into an arab state a jewish state and an international administration in jerusalem therein lies the problem since resolution 181 was a non binding resolution as was unsc 2334 in 2016 i e a recommendation it had no legal force and with the arab representatives rejecting the resolution it was rendered null and void with no rights accruing to either party israel had and still has unabrogated rights to the land inherited from the 1922 palestine mandate and from the peace treaty with jordan in 1994 having rejected the partition plan and other peace plans before and after 1947 the palestinians have convinced much of the world of their narrative that the rights to a state they are seeking were legally established by the un in 1947 this is counterfactual whatever rights the

and our guide proudly outlined the historic battle during the war of independence as we stood beside the memorial to the fallen israeli soldiers inside the park according to our guide periodic memorial ceremonies are held at the obelisk by an egyptian delegation donya meijerjerusalemambassador david friedman sidestepped the word trap set for him by david halbfinger who attempted to frame his recent interview with the ambassador around annexation the disputed territories west of the jordan river are just that disputed and israel has legitimate claims to land there in 1948 arab armies looted and razed the entire jewish quarter of jerusalem s old city in east jerusalem as well as jewish communities in judea and samaria among them beit ha arava neve yaakov atarot shaar hagolan kfar darom hebron and the etzion bloc that is one reason why un resolution 242 is not specific regarding disposition of territories taken by jordan in 1948 and returned to israel in 1967 the intent was for the parties involved to work out mutually satisfactory arrangements one reason that resolution 242 allows israel to retain parts of judea and samaria is that jewish communities were located there prior to 1948 ambassador friedman carefully chose to use the word retain when responding to manipulative misleading questions because retain accurately reflects well documented historical fact and takes fairness and the complex history into account journalistic integrity is being replaced by a thinly veiled agenda a very disturbing trend that does not bode well julia lutchdavis ca

the case for trump victor davis hanson basic books 2019 372 pp as the title suggests the case for trump balances a clinical approach to our currently incendiary politics alongside a brief for donald trump s presidency of course the success or failure of this attempt is a subjective matter though it seems to me that any reader of this book of whatever political stripe would concede that for its length it is thorough if not encyclopedic in its presentation of facts and its historical depth all of which is not surprising in that victor davis hanson occupies a unique position among the commentariat he is a classical scholar professor historian novelist political cultural commentator and farmer in california s central valley while maintaining a residence in palo alto where he is a senior fellow at the hoover institution on the stanford campus he is also a visiting professor at hillsdale college in michigan while spending appreciable time overseas one can see that his distinctly varied experiences are part of why he remains an engaging thinker and which makes all of the 372 pages of this book fly by in a word the book is a deliciously informative and an eminently readable take on the trump ship of state as it tries to navigate around the depth charges laid by the treacherous deep state armada and a giddy and obtuse paparazzi dr hanson s opening chapter is his longest wherein he demonstrates that by 2016 the traditional vision of the two americas had ossified into mere stale sloganeering as he puts it trump did not create these divides he merely found existing sectarianism politically useful and like president obama he far more adroitly leveraged it than had prior republican nominees yes the educated progressive technocracies in the costal blue states had turned their backs on america s interior and in looking overseas became increasingly smug in their cosmopolitanism while showcasing their empathy for the hapless in destitute places outside america of course this coastal blue state cult is shared by illinois and other interior states depending on issues and candidates where empathy is also on display for people of color and other victims of america s presumed institutional and incipient phobias certainly the most recent republican presidential candidates messieurs mccain and romney saw this divide but neither had the requisite body armor aka thick enough skin to expose themselves to the heavy media artillery that would be wheeled around and directed at them if they risked any association with the buchanan pitchfork branch of the party the isolationist wing the america firsters the un glamorous white working class the deplorables the smelly walmart shoppers and on and on the invective lexicon of the left being as endless as it is predictable however being partially a media creation himself as well as having extensive experience with politicians trump went full speed ahead and damned the torpedoes aimed at him thus he wasn t afraid to tailor his appeal to this disdained constituency which he now owns notwithstanding that joe biden is currently channeling joe the plumber as he tries to woo this group in the run up to 2020 hanson drills deeper by noting that trump knew that a good job was the wellspring alone from which followed a stable two parent family home ownership and a sense of confidence and pride certainly white lower middle class pathology was often known to the left in the manner of a stiff dissected frog reeking of formaldehyde in studies by intellectuals like charles murray though as hanson continues before trump few politicians saw an opening in defending the forgotten working class of the interior and few politicians knew it firsthand much less saw it as merited or even useful in the political sense were others blinded by their own predilections as hanson reveals college educated whites do not make up 36 of the electorate as analysts indicated this constituency made up only 30 and was outnumbered by non college working class whites hanson describes the cult of progressivism as driven by the white elite signaling their disgust at the white privilege of the disintegrating middle class as a means of exempting their own quite genuine white privilege of insider contacts professional degrees wealth inheritance and influence trump tapped into this lower middle class disgust provoked by such haughty virtue signaling by those in the media hollywood corporations academia and government prior to the 2012 election hanson was chauffeured through southern michigan by a retired autoworker who let loose with a stream of consciousness trashing of president obama after which hanson remarked well i guess that you ll be voting for romney the man bristled romney geez romney came to michigan wearing his wing tips with starched jeans likewise hillary s hamming it up as aunt jemima with her i don t feel no ways tired mantra also made her merely one among the many of our political actors by contrast donald trump was not a character in search of himself he unselfconsciously played himself in his trademark business suit punctuated by that long red tie resembling the extended tongue that he is always prepared to stick out at his tormentors as professor hanson writes globalization had flattened the hinterland had long ago appropriated or xeroxed america s interior wealth manufacturing and industrialization indeed economists for the last 40 years have insisted that america must adjust to a flat earth leveled by free trade while correspondingly big picture historians have some gleefully predicted the leveling of america to a position as merely one among many in the family of nations but some things change and some things don t farmer and historian hanson knows that all too well similarly as trump shows in the art of the deal he is not overly impressed by intellectuals with their unmoored free floating notions the consequences of which they invariably exempt themselves from in fact people require jobs in order to be people just as countries especially america as the world s backbone need manufacturing and agriculture as well as high tech and great universities and perhaps even think tanks in order to be a country early on hanson quotes henry kissinger s remark i think trump may be one of those figures in history who emerges from time to time to mark the end of an era and to force it to give up its old pretense whether for good or ill trump has challenged the world s status quo in which the united states is seen as the banker policeman scapegoat mother teresa uncle sam a place where wealthy third world kleptocrats send their children to be educated and their poor to be provided for and the place most everyone aspires to get into one way or another of course a transformational individual like trump will necessarily draw a diversity of detractors the last part of the book explores that great chain of beings those scampering mice like lilliputians in the media and the deep state trying to tie trump down ben rhodes for example a big shot in the obama administration is the brother of the president of cbs news and was married to a foreign policy advisor to barbara boxer ann norris who was also a high muck a muck in the state dept dr hanson reveals legions of like links what s juicy about mr rhodes is that he is not shy about revealing his contempt for his media mouthpieces as he puts it the average reporter that we talk to is twenty seven years old that s a sea change they literally know nothing we created an echo chamber so too mit s jonathan gruber openly bragged that he had hoodwinked dumb americans in getting obamacare passed no surprise then that the negative reporting by the major networks on trump reached 91 over one three month period such institutionalized megaphones can drown out the many remarkable milestones that trump has achieved and that hanson charts milestones like unprecedented 3 yearly economic growth with quarterly growth climbing as high as 4 1 major stock indexes as of the end of april at record highs highest ever recorded hispanic and black employment lowest percentage of the population ever on food stamps business investment up by 40 in the first quarter of 2018 overall 18 month economic growth faster than any comparable period during president obama s tenure other trump initiatives as popular as they may be but at this point not fully realized include nato members promise to ante up 100 billion dollars more e g germany runs up billions of dollars in trade surpluses with the us yet has not anted up her 2 for nato drawing blood from china over its thievery and shameless trade policies north korea s cessation of the firing of long range missiles in violation of the airspace of u s allies while the trump administration pressures her to abandon its nuclear arms program other actions by the president remain popular detested or at least controversial such as the attempt to rescind obamacare disentangling america from the iran deal closing the southern border with a wall appointing two conservative supreme court justices and many other like minded judges opposition to abortion opening the arctic national wildlife refuge for drilling slashing capital gains corporate and personal income taxes for a wide swath of people deregulation which led to increased oil gas and coal production recognizing jerusalem as israel s capital suspending the nuclear arms agreement with russia while intensifying sanctions against her suspending migration from five muslim majority countries and north korea and venezuela withdrawing america from the paris climate change agreement in his penultimate chapter trump the tragic hero hanson suggests that trump s cunning and mercurialness are talents suited to dealing with many of the outlaws of the global frontier such as the iranian theocracy and kim jong un ironically though that timely talent may undo him in the long run in the way that generals george patton and curtis lemay were indispensable to wwii victory yet became dispensable and even caricatures after the war as hanson notes while casting trump for a similar role the tragic hero willingly faces a societal threat knowing that this same society may ostracize him after he has destroyed the threat by whatever means as hanson soberly concludes that is the element of tragedy no solution no out in a world of bad and worse choices

reuters goldman sachs economists said on sunday they are skeptical of insurance u s interest rate decreases from the federal reserve to forestall possible slowing in u s economic growth due to global trade tensions a surprise escalation in trade tensions between washington and beijing since may together with stubbornly low inflation have spurred bets among traders the u s central bank may lower key lending rates by 0 75 percentage points by year end however we think the hurdle for such cuts is likely to be higher than widely believed goldman economists wrote in a research note published on sunday a number of primary dealers or the 24 top wall street firms that do business directly with the fed anticipate the fed would lower key borrowing costs beginning this summer goldman sachs group inc nyse and a few other primary dealers have stuck with calls that the fed would refrain from decreasing rates until there is evidence of significant deterioration in business and consumer activities goldman economists said the three quarter point in rate cuts in 1995 1996 and 1998 which some analysts point to as recent examples of pre emptive policy easing from the fed were responses to data rested at least as much on observable deterioration as on an insurance motive they said another assumption for insurance rate cuts is that fed officials could reserve the moves once the risk abates however the greater political scrutiny of fed hikes now especially with a presidential election approaching could make this harder to do in 2020 so that overly hasty insurance cuts now might increase the risk that the funds rate gets stuck at too low a level if the economy remains resilient they wrote on friday u s short term interest rates futures implied traders see about a 58 chance the fed would lower short term rates by 0 75 point by year end up from 54 a week earlier and 7 a month ago according to cme group s fedwatch too fed policy makers will meet next tuesday and wednesday where analysts widely expect they would pave the way for possible rate cuts later this year interest rates futures suggested traders priced in a 23 probability the fed would lower rates next week compared with 25 a week ago and 13 a month earlier the cme fedwatch program showed

sabena siddiqi located between the gulfs of oman and aden oman s duqm port has special importance as it lies along the strait of hormuz gulf of oman indian ocean and the arabian sea with this strategic location it is not only close to south asian countries like india and pakistan it is also easily accessible from east africa since joining the belt and road initiative bri in 2018 oman has acquired additional importance as it has emerged as china s first base station in the gulf preview_thumbnail league warns iran on the oman tanker shoot securing dependable and secure energy resources has always been a top priority for beijing and there is no better place for attaining these goals than the middle east which holds 48 of oil reserves and 40 of gas reserves globally therefore a 10 7 bn sino oman industrial city and the duqm special economic zone sezad are being developed once ready this will be the biggest sez of the mena region securing dependable and secure energy resources has always been a top priority for beijing and there is no better place for attaining these goals than the middle east which holds 48 of oil reserves and 40 of gas reserves globally as the first phase of construction approaches completion in 2020 duqm will have the capacity to link several continents with the logistics and infrastructure built with chinese investment as china s main energy corridors these middle eastern routes are the oil roads of the bri according to lu ruquan director of the strategic development department of the china national petroleum corporation cnpc notably oman will be the first energy producing country which is also a central bri node in the gulf with well located ports for successful business ventures peace is the first requirement and muscat has managed to have good ties in the region as well as with iran india china and the u s simultaneously balancing its relations oman has encouraged foreign investment from all and the rivalry between various powers makes no difference another interesting aspect about duqm port is that it can be an alternate route outside the straits of hormuz with direct access to the arabian sea considering that the strait is quite unstable due to u s iran frictions these days it seems likely that more attention will be given to duqm in the days ahead another interesting aspect about duqm port is that it can be an alternate route outside the straits of hormuz with direct access to the arabian sea considering that the strait is quite unstable due to u s iran frictions these days it seems likely that more attention will be given to duqm in the days ahead recent attacks on oil vessels near the strait of hormuz might even force shipping companies to consider duqm instead as a safer route located in oman s east it is far away from the scene of the conflict these days indirectly the u s iran conflict could even promote oman and most of all duqm port owing to its crucial location being a stable neutral state with no terrorism or war threats even though it is situated in a potentially volatile region oman could benefit from the ongoing tussle in the region having a strategic port deal with oman even washington can have better access to the gulf and an alternate route for its ships if the need arises bypassing the strait of hormuz is an important military option right now as tensions with iran show no signs of abating according to a statement from the u s embassy in oman the bilateral agreement provides access to facilities and ports in duqm and salalah and reaffirms the commitment of both countries to promoting mutual security goals being a big port duqm can even turn around an aircraft carrier according to u s officials considering the current geopolitical scenario the time has come for oman to reap the benefits of its strategic location as well as its neutral foreign policy even though duqm and other omani ports are right at the center of a global competition for influence muscat s stance continues to be neutral and it does not seem perturbed even though duqm and other omani ports are right at the center of a global competition for influence muscat s stance continues to be neutral also having an agreement with new delhi for logistics support and long term anti piracy operations oman provides maintenance facilities for indian ships at duqm the only port in the area with repair facilities for large vessels only last month joint exercises were held with the japanese navy and the port remains a supply and refueling base for the british japanese and american navies in tandem the beijing muscat alliance is on its peak and this is what makes duqm an interesting case instead of exclusively giving space to one country it gives space to other nations as well and this may be the secret of its success there are some drawbacks and just like with gwadar another bri port in pakistan observers wonder whether china could use duqm for military purposes observers wonder whether china could use duqm for military purposes according to the string of pearls sea lane strategy china requires several ports in pakistan myanmar sri lanka and bangladesh to achieve dominance however china invested to upgrade its energy security and build a large trade network to stem its slowing economic growth for now the bri has helped diversify arab economies and boosted energy activities in
