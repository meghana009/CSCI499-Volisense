relation to 2018 fourth quarter and year end results kinross once again delivered on its commitments in 2018 as we met our production cost and capital guidance for the seventh consecutive year our portfolio of mines produced solid results with standout performances from paracatu and bald mountain both of which delivered record annual production following successful completion of the tasiast phase one expansion the mine achieved record production in the fourth quarter with throughput and recoveries exceeding expectations kinross also generated approximately 790 million in operating cash flow and maintained its strong balance sheet with 1 9 billion in liquidity and no debt maturities until 2021 we expect to deliver another strong year in 2019 producing approximately 2 5 million gold equivalent ounces at costs similar to 2018 our development projects are proceeding well and we look forward to a number of milestones this year including the start of commissioning of the bald mountain vantage complex processing circuit and completion of the lobo marte scoping study in the first quarter the start of commissioning of the round mountain phase w processing circuit in the second quarter and the completion of the la coipa restart feasibility study and the start of stripping at fort knox gilmore in the third quarter at tasiast we continue to evaluate alternative approaches to further increase throughput and reduce capital while preserving the overall value of the project the project financing is progressing well and we are targeting completion mid year 2018

compared with net earnings of 445 4 million or 0 36 per share for full year 2017 this change was primarily a result of decreased operating earnings a reversal of impairment charges related to the cerro casale sale in 2017 and an increase in 2018 income tax expense capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased to 273 0 million for q4 2018 compared with 313 3 million for the same period last year capital expenditures for full year 2018 were 1 043 4 million compared with 897 6 million for 2017 primarily due to increased spending at round mountain bald mountain and tasiast partially offset by lower spending at paracatu and chirano capital expenditures were at the low end of the company s guidance balance sheet as of december 31 2018 kinross had cash and cash equivalents of 349 0 million compared with 1 025 8 million at december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to capital expenditures at the company s development projects and the acquisition of two hydroelectric power plants in brazil partially offset by net operating cash inflows the company has available credit of 1 552 9 million as of year end 2018 for total liquidity of 1 901 9 million and no scheduled debt repayments until 2021 operating results mine by mine summaries for 2018 fourth quarter and full year operating results may be found on pages 22 and 26 of this news release highlights include the following americas the americas region which represented 61 of kinross 2018 production delivered strong results during the year paracatu and bald mountain achieved record annual production while round mountain continued to perform well paracatu performed strongly in 2018 with production increasing 45 compared with full year 2017 the record annual production was mainly as a result of record recoveries in plant 2 and significant increases in tonnes of ore mined and processed production in q4 2018 was higher compared with the previous quarter mainly due to an increase in grades and higher recoveries cost of sales per ounce in 2018 was lower compared with 2017 primarily as a result of lower power costs due to the acquisition of the power plants in the third quarter and favourable foreign exchange movements higher grades also contributed to the lower cost of sales per ounce in q4 2018 versus the previous quarter at round mountain 2018 production met expectations but was lower compared with 2017 primarily due to fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads partially offset by the timing of ounces processed through the mill production in q4 2018 was largely consistent compared with the previous quarter full year cost of sales per ounce was higher year over year mainly due to lower heap leach grades and higher fuel and power costs cost of sales per ounce increased in q4 2018 compared with the previous quarter mainly due to higher processing costs bald mountain continued to perform well achieving record full year production in 2018 production in q4 2018 was lower compared with q3 2018 mainly as a result of timing of recoveries from the heap leach pads cost of sales per ounce for 2018 was lower than full year 2017 mainly as a result of less operating waste mined and the timing of gold equivalent ounces sold cost of sales per ounce in q4 2018 increased compared with the previous quarter mainly due to fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads fort knox full year production decreased year over year largely due to a decrease in grades and tonnes of ore processed in the mill and placed on the heap leach pads the pit wall failure in q1 2018 also limited access to higher grade ore and higher than average rainfall in the second half of 2018 affected geotechnical stability production in the fourth quarter was largely consistent with the third quarter of 2018 full year cost of sales per ounce was higher compared with 2017 mainly due to a decline in grades and an increase in operating waste mined cost of sales per ounce in q4 2018 was lower versus q3 2018 mainly due to lower processing costs maricunga delivered strong results during the year as production from the rinsing of heap materials placed on the pads prior to the suspension of mining activities was better than expected cost of sales per ounce for full year 2018 was higher than 2017 mainly due to timing of sales russia the region continued its strong and consistent performance as kupol and dvoinoye s combined full year production met expectations while cost of sales per ounce outperformed full year production was lower than the previous year mainly due to the expected decrease in grades and the completion of mining of the september northeast deposit at the end of 2017 production quarter over quarter was largely consistent full year cost of sales per ounce was slightly higher versus 2017 mainly due to lower grades at dvoinoye and increased maintenance costs q4 2018 cost of sales per ounce was lower quarter over quarter mainly due to less operating waste mined and lower labour costs at dvoinoye at the dvoinoye zone 1 deposit development is continuing as scheduled and production is expected to commence in mid 2019 west africa full year production at tasiast was slightly higher compared with 2017 mainly due to the completion of the phase one expansion in the third quarter the site achieved record quarterly production in q4 2018 mainly due to higher than expected throughput at the new mill and better mill grades and recoveries cost of sales per ounce for the full year was higher compared with 2017 mainly due to higher fuel and maintenance costs and an increase in operating waste mined cost of sales per ounce was lower in q4 2018 compared with q3 2018 mainly due to higher mill grades and lower operating waste mined production at chirano was slightly lower for the full year compared with 2017 mainly due to anticipated lower grades and was lower quarter over quarter primarily as a result of lower mill throughput cost of sales per ounce for full year 2018 decreased compared with 2017 mainly due to lower overhead maintenance and power costs as open pit mining was suspended in q3 2017 cost of sales per ounce was higher in q4 2018 versus q3 2018 mainly due to lower mill throughput partially offset by lower power costs and favourable foreign exchange movements organic development projects tasiast expansion update tasiast continues to perform strongly achieving record quarterly production in q4 2018 the site is currently exceeding throughput and recovery expectations the phase one expansion has been completed successfully and the new sag mill is performing very well in addition continuous improvement initiatives have been undertaken which are expected to result in meaningful cost and operational improvements the company expects tasiast to continue to deliver strong operational performance in 2019 the phase two expansion continues to be a viable option as the company completes its evaluation of alternative approaches to further increase throughput at tasiast the evaluation is seeking ways to reduce capital expenditures while preserving the overall value proposition and incorporates strong phase one performance results including throughput averaging above nameplate capacity phase two expansion considerations include among other matters results from the company s evaluation of alternative throughput approaches acceptable project financing terms capital priorities across the company s portfolio and the ongoing discussions with the government of mauritania these discussions with the government have focused on matters that arise occasionally and are generally common to the mining sector these matters include tax issues expatriate work permits and increasing opportunities for local suppliers in accordance with kinross policy and applicable laws in addition the parties have engaged in an ongoing dialogue regarding the company s exemption from importation duties on fuel under the tasiast mining convention further the company continues to seek from the government an exploitation license for tasiast sud the government has not expressed an intention to re open the tasiast mining convention and in any event kinross remains protected by its rights under the mining convention which includes international arbitration provisions the existing tasiast operation is also covered under the company s political risk insurance policy with the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga a member of the world bank group kinross continues to advance discussions to obtain the approximately 300 million in project financing for tasiast in addition to the previously signed mandate letters with export development canada edc and the international finance corporation ifc which indicated their interest in the financing subject to completing due diligence two commercial banks have also expressed interest in the financing and are now engaged in the due diligence process the financing is progressing and completion is targeted for mid 2019 round mountain phase w the round mountain phase w project continues to progress on schedule and on budget with pre stripping advancing well initial low grade phase w ore has been encountered and is being placed on the existing heap leach pads construction of the new heap leach pad is now approximately 80 complete while construction of the vertical carbon in column vcic plant is approximately 50 complete with commissioning for both expected to start in q2 2019 construction of mine infrastructure such as the truck shop warehouse wash bay and fuel island are all proceeding as planned and are approximately 35 complete fort knox gilmore project the fort knox gilmore project is progressing well on schedule and on budget with initial ore expected in early 2020 construction of the heap leach has begun and will continue during the 2019 and 2020 construction seasons expansion of the dewatering system will continue throughout the year in anticipation of stripping that is expected to commence in q3 2019 bald mountain vantage complex the bald mountain vantage complex project is proceeding well with construction of the heap leach approximately 85 complete and the vcic approximately 30 complete some challenges due to weather and a tight labour market have been encountered but commissioning of the heap leach and processing facilities remain on track to begin in late q1 2019 support infrastructure including the truck shop warehouse and wash bay is approximately 25 complete stacking of economic but previously leached ore on the new heap leach pad is underway with approximately 50 of the material moved onto a segregated portion mining activities at the vantage complex have commenced and initial ore is now being mined and stockpiled in preparation for placement on the new heap chile projects the feasibility study for the la coipa restart project and the scoping study for the lobo marte project are both proceeding well and are expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2019 respectively permitting is in place for the la coipa restart project and permitting strategy planning has begun at lobo marte outlook the following section of the news release represents forward looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary we refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the cautionary statement on forward looking information on page 37 of this news release in 2019 kinross expects to produce 2 5 million au eq oz 5 from its operations in line with 2018 production production is expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the rest of the year mainly as a result of the expected bald mountain vantage complex project ramp up and lower production from fort knox as per the operation s mining and milling strategy production cost of sales is expected to be 730 per au eq oz 5 for 2019 which is in line with full year 2018 cost of sales the company expects all in sustaining cost to be 995 5 per ounce sold on both a gold equivalent and by product basis for 2019 which is largely in line with full year

was drilled at kupol depth extension at the central zone the northeast extension and at the kupol hanging wall target areas see appendix a figure 1 during the early part of the year a review of the 2017 interpreted mineralized wireframes identified a potential down plunge extension where the premolar fault separates the northern end of the north upper domain from the southern end of the north

inferred resource additions at kupol mineralization though narrow is open at depth for which the company will continue to drill test in 2019 the northeast deeps is the direct extension of the kupol main vein outside the kupol mining lease drilling in 2018 intersected narrow quartz carbonate veinlets and breccia fill on the main structure with some high grades results from 2018 drilling indicate that the hanging wall can be traced along the length of the kupol main vein however drilling was widely spaced along the strike and it was challenging to trace the narrow but high grade veins over appreciable strike length the company plans to drill from the underground through current kupol workings to better target the high grade veins in 2019 during the latter part of 2018 drilling provided critical stratigraphic information which resulted in a new interpretation of the entire kupol far hanging wall east wedge vein now seen to consist of a 0 5 km trend directly east of kupol some of the holes confirmed northward continuation of the favourable moroshka andesite with altered zones around narrow low grade quartz veins at this stage this interpretation is mostly based on a few holes that

certain non gaap financial measures in this document these measures are not defined under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company the inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non gaap measures which determine the performance of the company excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s underlying performance for the reporting period such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses reassessment of prior year taxes and or taxes otherwise not related to the current period impairment charges reversals gains and losses and other one time costs related to acquisitions dispositions and other transactions and non hedge derivative gains and losses although some of the items are recurring the company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results management believes that these measures which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance however adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share measures are not necessarily indicative of net earnings and earnings per share measures as determined under ifrs the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings loss to adjusted net earnings loss for the periods presented adjusted net earnings in millions except per share amounts three months ended years ended december 31 december 31 2018 2017 2018

cash flow from operations excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors including the timing of tax payments and in the case of kupol a build up of inventory due to transportation logistics the company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow generating capability of the company however the adjusted operating cash flow measure is

all in sustaining costs and all in costs the wgc is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including kinross although the wgc is not a mining industry regulatory organization it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non gaap measures adoption of the all in sustaining cost and all in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard and therefore these measures presented by the company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that the all in sustaining cost and all in cost measures complement existing measures reported by kinross all in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis the value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant

most of the country s economy ground to a halt for more than a week the cities remained ghost towns as army troops continued attacking even ordinary civilians who are desperate to earn a living in what often seems to be the country s main occupation these days street vending of cheap imported commodities a national strike of 500 000 civil service workers has been called most essential commodities are now vastly overpriced or in very short supply this is what a full on capitalist crisis looks like the stresses are obvious within elite politics for as ever in harare rumours of political upheaval abound but whatever happens to the ruling party s leadership a more brutal fiscal policy plus an even tighter state squeeze on hard currency appear to be the new constants the stubbornness of president emmerson mnangagwa s leadership is partly due to the ideological fervour of his finance minister mthuli ncube an academic economist with a dubious practical track record and fast fading international credibility as cnn interviewers now openly laugh at answers to questions ncube argues that zimbabwe s problems boil down to loan repayment arrears to international creditors a high state budget deficit and a trade deficit in addition to ultra neoliberal macroeconomics mnangagwa depends on vice president constantino chiwenga s renewed authoritarian tendencies the country s crony capitalist system is being shaken by its own contradictions even more profoundly than in the darkest days before rhodesian colonizers finally gave up power in 1980 when the third world debt crisis hit hard in 1984 when deindustrialization began with a homegrown i e world bank transmitted structural adjustment programme in 1991 when foreign debt defaults began in 1998 in the lead up to several hotly contested elections especially 2000 2002 2005 and 2008 and when the local currency crashed to its death in 2009 postcoup return of the imf riot the protest was sparked by a 150 per cent overnight price increase in petrol announced on saturday 12 january at 3 31 litre this makes it the world s most expensive retail fuel with hong kong second at 2 05 litre the next day mnangagwa and a plane load of colleagues departed for russia belarus azerbaijan and kazakhstan in search of mineral investors energy deals and what the president called moscow s state of the art albeit unaffordable military equipment indeed mnangagwa was meant to continue to davos for the world economic forum but was persuaded that the country and his own leadership were in peril so instead headed home mnangagwa s first tweet after arriving back in harare was in defence of the fuel price hike not a decision we took lightly but it was the right thing to do what followed was regrettable and tragic he promised to look into army and police thuggery but hopes for a reckoning are in vain since his own background is littered with the country s most extreme post liberation repression he managed the 1980s gukurahundi massacres of more than 20 000 ndebele people and since his own spokesman inherited from mugabe told the press that the recent army attacks which included numerous rapes were a foretaste of things to come at this writing army repression continues and leading activists remain behind bars including five members of parliament the term that veteran zimbabwean social justice activist elinor sisulu uses to describe mnangagwa s dictatorial tendencies mugabesque is now very hard to refute in spite of ncube s surreal whitewash attempts in davos last week recall that mugabe had run zimbabwe since 1980 after leading the armed liberation struggle against the white racist rhodesian regime of ian smith twenty years on he was threatened with probable electoral defeat so his belated urgent and chaotic land reform against a few thousand mainly reactionary white settlers who for a century had controlled nearly all zimbabwe s good farmland gained him permanent hatred from the western establishment though land redistribution was justifiably popular in some circles mnangagwa last year admitted that the acquisitions had robbed the country of its breadbasket status given how much of the staple maize needed to be imported even while tobacco production hit record highs as a result land acquisition was now a thing of the past the new president promised riddled with corruption and dictatorial tendencies mugabe s ruling party the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanu pf had meanwhile become widely hated in the cities which were mainly governed by the liberal opposition party the movement for democratic change mdc whose constituents gave mnangagwa s 2017 coup their immediate joyful approval but the celebration was brief and the hangover long for mdc founding leader morgan tsvangirai died of cancer early last year and the mid 2018 national election witnessed mnangagwa victory s one that his mdc successor nelson chamisa considered to be rigged mnangagwa came to power in november 2017 assisted by then army commander chiwenga after a relatively non violent and then very popular weeklong coup against mugabe one re labelled a military assisted transition by opportunistic diplomats in order to avoid the legal consequences although mugabe was often abused by chiwenga and mnangagwa in prior years according to his private secretary the father of the nation was useful to the junta and he was compelled to remain in office by chiwenga after losing the first round of the 2008 election to tsvangirai in lieu of turning over power to the mdc from the plotters standpoint the crucial mistake made by the 93 year old leader in late 2017 was the excessively rapid elevation of his four decade younger wife grace mugabe she was briefly considered to be his likely successor once she managed to get mnangagwa fired as vice president a week prior to the coup the mugabes now live in politically uncomfortable and apparently careless luxury akin to house arrest despising the coup makers and endorsing last year s electoral opponent but also under their thumb the 2017 coup relied on chiwenga s joint operation command an army junta that was already controlling much of zimbabwe behind the scenes partly funded by diamond mining arranged through chinese mining joint ventures given how erratic mugabe had become how his policies discouraged investment and how he turned against the chinese firms allied with chiwenga in 2016 due to their prolific diamond looting former allies in beijing welcomed the change in power pretoria johannesburg elites and western powers especially britain were also upbeat however aside from adopting much more pro business rhetoric and initially liberalizing politics to an unprecedented degree mnangagwa and chiwenga didn t lose their taste for repression according to the progressive coalition known as crisis in zimbabwe the last week has witnessed mass trials fast tracked trials routine denial of bail routine dismissal of preliminary applications refusal of access to medical treatment and trial and detention of juveniles for nearly a week disconnections of social media and the internet were also added to the toolbox until a 21 january court order catalysed by human rights lawyers reversed the state s ether clampdown in davos last week ncube defended the chiwenga s internet disconnection as just a temporary and tactical strategy to try to manage the situation managing insurrection and managing information and dissemination speaking to cnn he bizarrely blamed last week s protests on a pre planned conspiracy and not his petrol price hike these are the facts anger at the petrol price was added on and he defended army intervention what you saw in the streets is actually a sign that the government is open democratic spaces are open two leading opposition politicians were scathing welshman ncube no relation called him a political moron for these remarks and former mdc finance minister tendai biti from 2009 13 labels ncube a fraud as if to prove it in another interview ncube said of his davos trip things are going well the theme is globalization 4 0 it resonates with what zimbabwe s trying to do in terms of global financial re engagement raising capital pushing our mantra that zimbabwe s open for business it really resonates zimbabwe is the best buy in africa under ncube much more explicitly neoliberal anti poor fiscal monetary policies prevail with no end in sight the new regime has been unable to make structural changes to an impoverished economy dependent upon primary resource exports in a time of still low world commodity prices since last september when ncube was appointed budget cutbacks and desperation currency manipulation have logically followed the society knows this feeling of despondency it appears often as a so called imf riot i e when people revolt immediately after a neoliberal shock sometimes ordered by the international monetary fund such as overnight removal of food or petrol subsidies zimbabwe s prior imf riots were caused by severe shocks in 1998 when the currency fell 74 per cent in four hours and in 1999 when mugabe felt the need to default on foreign debt in 2005 06 when mugabe authorized repayment of 200 million worth of imf loans the reserve bank officials gathered up all the hard currency they could find on the black market sparking a wicked upsurge of inflation and another set of imf riots as for the class character of last week s anger two progressive researchers from the institute for public affairs in zimbabwe tamuka chirimambowa and tinashe chimedza explain that the protests were intense in specific geographies associated with the urban poor and the barely working class is a direct consequence of the existing political economy that is systemically unequal the riotous protests were found and concentrated south of samora machel avenue contrasted to the affluent suburbs north of samora machel harare north which enjoyed a peaceful stay away in bulawayo they were concentrated in the western suburbs in mutare and masvingo in the southern suburbs the elite hob knobbed on social media or their usual social spaces with very limited threats to their security and their only major outcry was the closure of shops and the internet shutdown the protests were predictable enough and mnangagwa and ncube imposed the petrol price hike and immediately left town scheduled meetings with vladimir putin with leaders of three other repressive eastern european and central asian countries and with the world economic forum took precedent ncube s vain arrears ambitions pay won t pay or can t pay and can t get new loans zimbabwe s notorious shortage of hard currency was the proximate cause of the fuel price hike followed by rapid price increases in anything requiring transport including the staple maize in turn this squeeze reflects the priorities of a new finance minister the academic economist ncube who is considered the most neoliberal in modern zimbabwe s history exhibiting a sometimes startling self confidence and entirely comfortable within the circuits of world elites ncube is smooth and at first blush persuasive but his three most spectacular prior mistakes were first founding and chairing the harare barbican bank which launched in mid 2003 but then failed to meet obligations to the country s clearance system within seven months leading to expulsion two months later it was declared insolvent as its regulator at the reserve bank of zimbabwe explained due to serious liquidity problems as a result of imprudent banking behaviour questionable cross border foreign exchange activities which are yet to be cleared to the satisfaction of all parties a second mistake was serving as a top official well into 2018 at corruption riddled financier quantum global which ripped off angola s citizenry during his tenure there third as chief economist at the western dominated african development bank afdb in 2011 at the height of africa rising hype he declared the existence of a new african middle class of more than 330 million people hey you know what the world please wake up this is a phenomenon in africa that we ve not spent a lot of time thinking about oddly ncube included in the middle class category people who barely survive on 2 4 day a group of more than 200 million his smooth optimistic talk notwithstanding ncube s finance minister role since last september has been rocky interviewed last 3 december by richard quest on cnn ncube argued that the most serious economic problem he believes the country faces is foreign debt repayment arrears of 5 6 billion most of which date back 20 years the arrears include 1 3 billion owed to the world bank 680 million to the afdb 308 million to the european investment bank 2 8 billion to the paris club and at least 500 million to non western lenders and firms especially the chinese state and south african corporations said ncube the budget recognises that we have a twin deficit challenge which is that we have a fiscal deficit as well as a current account deficit but also we need to deal with our debt arrears in terms of debt restructuring so two things that are confounded or rather magnified by the arrears ncube then promoted his homegrown structural adjustment programme the transition stabilisation programme bragging that international financial institutions ifis just gave the plan a warm endorsement we ve sold it internationally and then we re willing to move to the next step which is to clear the debt arrears with the afdb and the world bank which is what you call the preferred creditor ifis we re determined in the next 12 months that is done and then we move on the second the third phase which is the paris club negotiations with the bilateral creditors finally he offered this extraordinary claim zimbabwe is indeed the biggest buy in africa right now on any asset you talk about the rule of law let me tell you this is about property rights at the end day property rights are secure in zimbabwe clearly zimbabwe is the biggest buy in africa right now ncube then tweeted proudly about this biggest buy status a claim he just repeated in davos but the gap between zimbabwe s local soft currency a combination of a local bond note bill and electronic payments and the main currency used in zimbabwe since 2009 the u s dollar has remained in the range of 3 5 4 times even though they are pegged as equal inflation soared to 42 per cent in december with a black market raging and only 400 million of paper u s dollars circulating in the banking system due to the physical shortage of u s notes for more than a year day long waits in bank queues to withdraw 20 has been the norm ncube has promised to introduce a proper local currency within a year but claims he must first clear arrears and end deficit spending so as to restore confidence yet with a stiff upper lip ncube appeared in davos at the world economic forum last week announcing to cnn his intention to continue upping the economic pressure including not just more fiscal discipline externally making sure we can begin to address our arrears in terms of what we owe to other nations the bretton woods institutions included but fiscal discipline is key and if you noticed what has been happening since october 2018 the premiums in the parallel market have stabilized and this is because of fiscal discipline ncube utterly overstates budget cutbacks as a solution to all problems asked by bloomberg about roaring inflation he offered a simplistic incorrect cause and solution it s being driven by the parallel market in terms of pricing that s what has pushed up the prices people speculating what we re doing about it is to just make sure that on the fiscal front we continue to make sure there is fiscal discipline cutting back on government expenditure ncube s no gain without pain logic in one of the most abused societies in africa failed to win zimbabweans confidence he erred last october when establishing foreign currency accounts within the predatory banking system in the process wiping out large amounts of savings which devalued by two thirds to black market rates instead he could have taken a predecessor s advice biti advocated ring fencing the bank accounts against their devaluation last month complained biti for the first time in modern zimbabwe history a finance minister prioritized a new york trip instead of debating his budget as scheduled in parliament in a prior parliamentary appearance last october biti asked ncube you seem to suggest that you are going to find money to clear the arrears and my question is what country is going to give you the almost 2 billion that you would require to pay off the arrears you are going to try and clear the arrears that zimbabwe has at the world bank and afdb i am saying given the quantum of that debt and given the fragility of our own situation now which country is prepared to lend us the money that zimbabwe has to use to clear in spite of ncube s regular assurances of new credit lines based on his stellar rolodex of banking contacts he answered nebulously on the issue of debt clearance and which countries are going to help us at the stage of clearing the afdb and world bank balances of course we will negotiate with the various countries who are shareholders in those institutions and of course the paris club countries we will negotiate with them the g7 there are other members of european union and in europe who are willing to talk to us about this we have had a conversation with them already so we will continue to explore with them as to whether they can give us relief but there are countries that we are speaking to but no details are ever forthcoming on the promised bailout return of the imf the most crucial bailout lender is still the much feared imf to which mugabe s regime questionably repaid all arrears in late 2016 a series of self delegitimising 21st century leaders have helped reduce its reputation rodrigo rato jailed last october for bank fraud dominique strauss kahn resigned in disgrace but demanded imf support for his 2011 rape trial and still today after a guilty verdict in 2016 for corruption negligence in france christine lagarde nevertheless the institution remains the global policeman for the entire financial world and since 1984 it has pummelled zimbabwe into austerity and structural adjustment in early 2018 imf spokesperson gerry rice endorsed the neoliberal path mnangagwa had chosen the authorities are cognizant of these challenges that they face and the economy is facing and they ve expressed their determination to address them the 2018 budget which they presented on 7 december so about a month ago stresses the government s intentions to re impose budget discipline reform and open the economy and engage with the broader international community which is on going and important in terms of arrears clearance for budget shrinkage he specifically recommended more agricultural subsidy cuts again last september as pro imf finance minister ncube took office rice made clear that his staff stand ready to help the authorities design a reform package that can help facilitate the clearance of external payment arrears to international development banks and bilateral official creditors and that they would open the way for fresh financing from the internal community including potentially the imf but again just to stress as we said before potential financial support from the fund is conditional on the clearance of those arrears to the world bank the afdb and financing assurances from bilateral official creditors we are working with the zimbabwean authorities in the meantime to provide policy advice and technical assistance that might help could help move that process forward in december rice reiterated imf support for ncube the policies of the new administration under the zimbabwe transition and stabilization programme do constitute a comprehensive stabilization and reform effort in order to address zimbabwe s macroeconomic situation and just as full reports of the most recent imf riot and army repression were filed on 17 january this year rice repeated his institution s demands in terms of the imf zimbabwe has in fact cleared its arrears to us to the fund but our rules preclude lending to a country that is still in or under arrears to other international financial situations so until that particular situation is resolved we would not be moving forward with a financial support for zimbabwe i said here the last time that the authority s economic policies we felt were headed in the right direction broadly in terms of addressing the fiscal deficit and monetary policy and so on i won t repeat what i said the last time but that s where we are on zimbabwe clearly the system needs a jolt to get out of the rut who can provide it enter biggish brother talk left about sanctions lend right about 7 million the next door neighbour south africa offers the most logical crutch a desperation visit by leading harare officials to pretoria the day after christmas last year included a request for a loan to clear the other arrears the lead treasury bureaucrat turned them down initially they wanted money 1 2 billion we don t have 1 2 billion but what we have is the will to assist them our engagements are across the system assisting from a budgeting implementation point of view and reprioritizing of public expenditure including on their behalf engaging multilateral development institutions which we have started a year ago the same official prepared the 2018 19 south african budget cutting social programmes and municipal infrastructure support to such an extent that even neoliberal business day newspaper termed it savage while allowing an extra 5 per cent of all local institutional investor wealth around 36 billion to escape the country via exchange control liberalization with this mentality prevailing in pretoria s treasury it is no wonder that at the very high point of the state s repression last week south africa s neoliberal finance minister tito mboweni endorsed ncube i think the idea of using a new currency in zimbabwe is a good one i think our colleagues there are on a good wicket when it comes to that space we are working together very well but at the end of the day it is zimbabweans who need to fix their country zimbabweans can recount a long history of the south african ruling party propping up its liberation era allies zanu pf when the latter turn most repressive this occurred most regularly when thabo mbeki was president from 1999 2008 laments veteran south african business journalist barney mthombothi what still sticks in the craw for many zimbabweans is the arrangement concocted by mbeki ten years ago to keep mugabe in power despite the fact that he had been defeated by morgan tsvangirai adding insult to injury even while activists remained in appalling prison conditions on 20 january pretoria s foreign minister lindiwe sisulu intoned protests in zimbabwe have calmed down and life in the streets of zimbabwe is returning to normal when it comes to money however the south african finance minister reverts to type a scrooge according to mboweni the existing south africa zimbabwe credit facility of a measly 7 million was in any case backed by harare s collateral in the form of its holding of sa land bank bills the extension of this facility depended on zimbabwe being able to provide further collateral the potential low level debt relief he implied would be a tokenistic sop to elite solidarity and would do nothing to change the structural economic power and financial deficits that zimbabwe faces in the region and the world however if more south africa credit materialises it is also likely that mboweni would try to get a higher repayment prioritization for south african firms more than just fraternal ideology there is also blatant national capitalist self interest at work as the sunday times reported at least 15 major south african linked companies with operations in zimbabwe were struggling to repatriate funds these include delta beverages 40 per cent owned by ab inbev multichoice owned by naspers tongaat hulett ppc and zimplats owned by impala platinum other firms such as edcon pick n pay sanlam tiger brands nedbank and alexander forbes either have units in zimbabwe or are invested in locally owned business mboweni s south african national budget will be tabled in parliament in one month s time it must make gestures to reducing parastatal agencies outsized debt so in talks with ncube he may even demand that the first repayment of arrears goes to pretoria s bankrupt national airline south african airways that firm is owed an estimated 60 million in ticket sale revenues on the vital harare johannesburg route funds which zimbabwe has lacked sufficient hard currency to repay early this month the airline s spokesperson claimed that ncube had begun to settle those arrears but provided no details there are other solidarities as well including ordinary south africans working closely with zimbabwean organizations in networks such as the united front johannesburg and the sporadic anti xenophobia movement with zimbabwe s capitalist crisis worsening from the late 1990s south africa began to host a vast immigrant pool who were not only political but also economic refugees with many more expected in coming weeks and months hence anti xenophobia politics remain crucial as an angry south african working class often takes out its frustrations on those they consider competitors for scarce jobs housing and township retail trade the two biggest potential sources of bottom up zimbabwe solidarity are the leftist economic freedom fighters eff which polls around 10 per cent of the vote and the largest trade union the national union of metalworkers of south africa numsa with 350 000 members however in neither case has a concrete strategy emerged on 23 january in contrast to the ruling party s nurturing of the neighbour s oppressors eff leader julius malema emphatically criticised zimbabwe s leaders calling mnangagwa a backward fool his behaviour is tyrannical and barbaric how do you switch off internet and kill people in 2019 we do not support brutal dictatorship mnangagwa must beware of that chiwenga is a former military general who wants to bring military dictatorship in zimbabwe but on the question of how to aid zimbabwe malema had a mixed message insofar as financing support was required at a time the xenophobia threat again looms south africa must contribute to the bailout of zimbabwe anyone who refuses that is dumb if you won t help zimbabweans the border will be flooded by them anyone who is going to block them from coming into south africa we re going to fight with that person you re always complaining that there re zimbabweans here the only way not to have them here is by helping them in their own country zimbabwe must be helped southern african development community countries need to come together we need to close ranks we must give a conditional grant dedicated to developmental programmes which will help zimbabwe to stand on its own but unasked and unanswered is the question who exactly will deliver a genuine development programme certainly not the mnangagwa chiwenga ncube regime on 25 january numsa s leader irvin jim issued a statement we salute the masses for acting with courage and for rejecting the austerity measures which have been imposed on them by the zanu pf government it is clear to them that the removal of former president robert mugabe did not result in an improvement of their conditions we stand in solidarity with the zimbabwean people and the working class majority and the poor in particular we support the demands made by workers in the public sector we are calling on all our comrades locally on the continent and around the globe to support zimbabwe in its hour of need but again the central question is how to support zimbabwe another form of south african zimbabwean elite solidarity comes from endorsing the red herring of u s and european sanctions mnangagwa claimed to sputnik during last week s moscow visit that those sanctions were able to collapse our own currency the same line of argument was taken up by mboweni interviewed by daily maverick e zine s peter fabricius politically there were two key issues to be resolved by zimbabwe mboweni said the first was for the political leadership to work hard for the lifting of the remaining international sanctions against zimbabwe while the second was to re introduce its own currency a process at least a year away consistent with pretoria s unwillingness to send material support to harare fabricius observed the idea of zimbabwe adopting the rand is clearly not on the table in the current discussions between the finance ministers and officials mboweni tweeted a news report that ncube had said that zimbabwe would not adopt the rand as it did not have adequate resources to do so does african advocacy against the u s and european sanctions against zimbabwe s elites make any difference fabricius provided a reality check though south africa and zimbabwe s other regional allies have often called on western countries to lift the few remaining sanctions against zimbabwe these countries are reluctant to do so mainly because of political considerations when zimbabwean soldiers used live ammunition on zimbabwean opposition supporters protesting against the results of the july elections western sources said mnangagwa had already blown his chances of sanctions being lifted can t borrow either thanks to u s sanctions western sanctions against zimbabwe s ruling elite have essentially been limited to financial and travel bans on individuals and their closely held firms trivially the european sanctions affect only seven elites and mnangagwa was already removed from that list in 2016 likewise a u s law the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act of 2001 zidera specifies measures against individuals responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law politically motivated violence and intimidation in zimbabwe zidera instructs the u s treasury to identify assets of those individuals held outside zimbabwe implement travel and economic sanctions against those individuals and their associates and families there are 141 people on the list at present including mugabe mnangagwa chiwenga and their cronies setting aside the zanu pf elites desires to lubricate their overseas financial holdings zidera has other features worthy of debate according to two critics in zimbabwe tendai murisa and shantha bloem first they write it also enshrined into law the u s stance that funding from the likes of the imf and world bank could not be reinstated until the act was lifted but as noted this has not been a consideration at all given that the bank has not been repaid its 1 3 billion in dubious mugabe era loans when making his general pitch for debt relief in an article last september ncube did not even bother mentioning zidera as a factor second murisa and bloem argue last july u s congress introduced an amended version of it passed just days before zimbabwe s first ever elections without mugabe this renewed act included the extra demand that the vote be free and fair it is debatable whether zimbabwe s 30 july elections passed that test in addition zidera was amended to support a few of zimbabwe s white farmers who in a regional court won a case for property reimbursement after their land was dispossessed more than 15 years ago do zidera s provisions prevent ncube from repaying arrears nearly impossible as that appears and then acquiring new loans from the imf and other multilateral financiers where the u s has influence apparently not in ncube s view as they were not raised even in passing last september in his own detailed article zimbabwe s options for sovereign debt relief indeed zidera has a provision that would actually help ncube two sectors of financial support for the zimbabwean economy under the imposed sanctions 1 bilateral debt relief restructuring rescheduling or eliminating the sovereign debt of zimbabwe held by any agency of the u s government and 2 multilateral debt relief and other financial assistance a review of the feasibility of restructuring rescheduling or eliminating the sovereign debt of zimbabwe as well as to instruct the u s executive director of international financial organizations to which the u s is a member to proposition financial and technical support for zimbabwe and do sanctions prevent zimbabwe from receiving donor aid in spite of mugabe s degenerate rule since 2010 zimbabwe has received far more western organization for economic cooperation and development donor grants than it ever did prior to 2010 in the 650mn 800mn year range of that more than a quarter comes from the usa from obama to trump there was a minor decline in 2017 18 but 194 million was given last year mostly in the form of aids medicines and strengthening private sector services of course much northern aid is a self serving sham remaining in multinational corporate or ngo home country accounts much of the funding that does reach zimbabwe is hijacked by the ruling party a crucial question is whether such funding plus large inflows of remittances from migrant often politically exiled zimbabweans then circulates locally relieving the cash shortage but as you would expect from u s dollars they leak out of the country quite rapidly given this is still the global currency and can readily be slipped into socks or underpants before traveling over the border unlike a local soft currency which typically requires capital control vetting before it can be changed into a hard currency but zimbabwe s underlying financial dilemma is two fold not only its inability to pay the 5 6 billion in arrears but whether payment is even appropriate given how badly the lenders performed when putting zimbabwe into debt this was the subject of my phd and a 1998 book uneven zimbabwe a study of finance development and underdevelopment when repaying arrears first emerged as a possibility during the period of joint zanu pf mdc rule from 2009 13 at a time foreign aid inflows soared advocacy groups including the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development and the african forum on debt and development demanded a debt audit a repayment moratorium and indeed full cancellation as reuters reported in 2009 at a time tsvangirai was in a government of national unity with mugabe his minister of state gordon moyo said it would be immoral for zimbabwe to pay off its debts to the imf world bank and afdb when it could not pay teachers again in 2017 when it appeared that one of the world s most notorious corporations amsterdam based trafigura would lend mugabe s regime 1 billion reportedly at usurious interest rates biti complained that will not help much or anything at all in reality the biggest challenges facing zimbabwe cannot and will not be addressed by paying off arrears on which we defaulted almost 20 years ago what really needs to be addressed are structural economic issues de industrialization and unemployment that money could be better used to fund industry revival to create jobs and boost production as well as increase exports and improve liquidity indeed none of the prior arrears repayment efforts worked but not because they were immoral or a waste of money but because the funding always fell through and yet today arrears repayment is the choice and first priority of neoliberal authoritarians damn the consequences where to zimbabwe s progressive forces have mainly been located in trade unions urban civic groups feminist and youth organizations rural social movements and a small but impressive intelligentsia at the time of writing we have heard only sporadic appeals for popular solidarity some of which were answered in once off protests by small solidarity groups against zimbabwe high commission offices in the main south african cities zambia s capital of lusaka and london the lesson is that capitalism cannot be reformed tweaked or improved it is a brutal system which creates inequality and poverty numsa s irvin jim argues for a much more ambitious political agenda there are major lessons to be learned in zimbabwe south africa and all over the globe the removal of mugabe did not solve the crisis which has paralysed the economy just like the removal of jacob zuma did nothing to improve the suffering of the working class in south africa instead conditions worsened and they continue to deteriorate the lesson is that capitalism cannot be reformed tweaked or improved it is a brutal system which creates inequality and poverty as the working class we must unite across borders to destroy it and replace it with a genuine democratic socialist state under the leadership and control of the working class jim is correct insofar as in various ways zimbabwe has served as the world s lead canary in the capitalist crisis coal mine for around three decades a variety of neo colonial strategies were deployed to displace inherited structural problems which include 1970s era overproduction extreme inequality and highly concentrated crony state corporate relations by the early 1990s as assimilation of a few black elites into white capital exhausted the potential for further accumulation within a closed economy washington consensus structural adjustment was introduced what with zimbabwe s small production lines due to the limited middle class base trade liberalization soon deindustrialized what was once africa s most balanced economy then came hyperinflationary reserve bank responses during the 2000s with the second highest price increases in modern human history after post war hungary wiping out a generation of savings and terminating the local currency after the turn to the u s dollar from 2009 the regime more recently tried providing liquidity through a supposedly cashless society with electronic transactions augmented by faux currency bond notes which soon rapidly devalued thus today the crisis is unfolding with one fatal overarching characteristic a lack of hard currency in the system the military men in charge are now a big part of that problem having dominated the lucrative diamond trade with chinese partners followed by close relations with trafigura when illicitly managing the supply of oil but the systematic looting by the military politicians and corporations under conditions of structural underdevelopment has nearly exhausted itself short of displacement of this elite through a revolution which appears a long way off on the horizon given chiwenga s military prowess and the troops continuing loyalty the strategic options for a beleaguered human rights and economic justice network are limited at the least such strategies should bolster the popular critique of any re legitimation of zimbabwe s neoliberal authoritarians such as the process south africa s ruling party is half heartedly attempting but beyond that the zimbabwean masses are way overdue in re gathering the spirit so evident exactly two decades ago at the january 1999 working people s convention held in a distant harare township chitungwiza while the convention s programme itself included social democratic bandaids at that point a new party was mandated to serve poor and working people s interests workers built the mdc throughout 1999 although it was soon thereafter hijacked by middle class elements adopting what its leader tsvangirai termeda spaghetti ideology contrary to the vision of the working people s convention an untouchable ruling elite was formed at cost of the party detaching itself from the mass according to a critique by the zimbabwe national student union in 2011 the mdc a party supposedly a movement for social democracy seems to be under a deadly and toxic siege from a capital centred clique inspired by the ever approaching prospects of economic as well as individual political gains these individuals some of whom have hands which can extend to reach to the party s top leadership clandestinely steered the party into abandoning its founding documents in a rush to reach to the feeding trough with the hitherto enemy nevertheless 1999 was a leap forward consolidating the aching demands of a society that had already suffered nearly a decade of neoliberalism such front building organization is lacking today even if the masses militancy is even higher in the aftermath of the state s recent show of force but unity of the oppressed always lurks as a potential and has more of a chance of re emerging in 2019 than do the efforts of mnangagwa chiwenga ncube have a hope of succeeding with neoliberal authoritarianism if they continue imposing such extreme economic pain expect more political shake ups as zimbabwean capitalism continues to implode
washington last wednesday u s secretary of state mike pompeo gave a disturbing interview to fox business network in which he divulged his plans to form a nato type alliance against iran the u s has long accused iran of supporting terrorism accusations that have ramped up under the trump administration pompeo said without a hint of irony that iran s government was leading the country into wars in syria yemen iraq and lebanon against the will of the iranian people furthermore the absurd accusation that hezbollah is in venezuela seemed a crude attempt to link the two countries in order to delegitimize both of their governments at the same time the announcement foreshadows the potential for an abrupt and extreme escalation of u s attacks on iran similar to the recent escalation of u s venezuela relations washington s playbook for regime change has become more and more obvious as it is used more frequently in the cases of countries with powerful militaries like venezuela iran north korea or china outright invasion is unfeasible as disapproving public opinion would drag morale down demonizing the target via some pretext to isolate it from the international community has been the preferred model to deal with larger threats the u s imposes financial sanctions under the guise of targeting regime figureheads and their inner circle of cronies and sweeping banking restrictions that cut a country s entire economy off from investment and foreign reserves as the country deteriorates under the weight of these sanctions washington points to the chaos it has created and says again without a hint of irony this is clearly a consequence of a neglectful and incompetent regime that must be overthrown the time period between the present and that unknown future date when the u s escalates is a crucial time for iran to prepare itself for the worst case scenario the u s is able to dictate these econo warfare policies through its disproportionate control of the world financial system iran has been sounding warnings about this strategy for some time and has been a vocal advocate of creating a new global financial system that will bypass u s control of the existing global financial system iran though is not the only country interested in such an arrangement russia china and venezuela have all found themselves facing arbitrary economic penalties levied by the u s and have also taken steps to wean the world off the dollar and use alternative currencies to conduct business a global trend that could seriously impact u s dominance over the world economy but in order to understand where king dollar is going we have to understand where it came from the birth of the petrodollar one of the first lessons we learn in econ 101 is that money has value only because we believe it does in a practical sense this means the currencies that are most used or most needed to purchase things are the most valuable a reserve currency is simply a widely accepted currency most countries have both a domestic currency for domestic use and foreign reserves which are designated for foreign trade and other international activities a few powerful countries issue reserve currencies or widely recognized and accepted currencies and have an advantage in international trade because they can simply print world reserve currencies instead of exchanging currencies or selling goods to acquire that currency today the u s dollar holds the status of world reserve currency because it is the most recognizable and widely used unit of currency in the world you can take a dollar to any random country any market on the side of the street and show them a greenback and chances are they will accept that funny little paper as payment if i decide to start a seashell based currency today chances are i won t be able to buy anything with my seashells there is nothing inherently more special about our green piece of paper than someone else s blue paper red paper or yellow paper the dollar is special only because it represents a very special country the united states of america a superpower the likes of which the world has never seen where american power goes its money always follows to become the region s unit of economic measurement the currency that goods are priced in is very important because if for example oil is priced in dollars you need dollars to buy oil this creates demand for dollars and not yen or rubles giving a tremendous advantage to the country that prints dollars at no cost before the international dollar standard there were other world reserve currencies the worldwide dominance of the dutch east india company made the dutch guilder the world reserve currency in the 17th and 18th centuries with the ascendance of the british empire came the ascendance of the pound sterling to world reserve currency status as the world s leading exporter of manufactured goods and services british banks had accumulated a large amount of gold deposits the bank of england issued sterling certificates paper that could be exchanged for gold making the sterling as good as gold this gave foreigners confidence that the paper sterling was not just paper but backed up by something of tangible value british investors chasing higher returns expanded the reach of sterling further by making sterling denominated long term investments read loans around the world at its height over 60 percent of world trade was denominated in pound sterling but as had all empires before it the british empire over expanded and collapsed unable to militarily control the land it claimed as its own however as the british cities were reduced to rubble in the second world war the united states untouched throughout the war got rich selling weapons to the other allied powers through exporting weapons ammunition equipment and food america s war economy accumulated 75 percent of the world s gold making it the undisputed economic power of the capitalist world no other country had enough gold to back its currency s value recognizing this the leaders of the european capitalist powers agreed to make the dollar the new world reserve currency by pegging the dollar to gold at a fixed exchange rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold other countries could exchange their currency for dollars instead of gold the logic being the dollar was as good as gold the international monetary fund was set up to ensure the u s maintained this exchange rate and the imf acted as a lender of last resort if a country s currency value fell too low compared to the dollar this was not just a convenient arrangement but a necessary one as the european capitalist empires had fallen and needed to pass their power on to an heir it was the recognition that now the united states was the only country powerful enough to organize and enforce worldwide markets in addition the use of nuclear weapons to wipe hiroshima nagasaki and 200 000 japanese civilians off the map sent a message to the world that the united states was more militarily advanced and ruthless than any other country on the planet a new global empire was born the united states immediately embarked on a series of invasions mass killings and covert regime change operations in places like korea guatemala iran and vietnam to expand its spheres of influence in order to fund these excursions the united states began printing dollars a privilege enjoyed solely by the united states since a dollar represented 1 35th of an ounce of gold the united states was essentially printing claim checks for gold gold that the united states didn t actually have a number of countries began to suspect that there were more than 35 dollars per ounce of gold in existence and began to turn in their dollars and ask for gold french president charles de gaulle famously remarked the fact that many countries accept as a principle dollars as good as gold for the payment of the differences existing to their advantage in the american balance of trade this very fact leads americans to get into debt and to get into debt for free at the expense of other countries because what the u s owes them it is paid at least in part with dollars they are the only ones allowed to emit considering the serious consequences a crisis would have in such a domain we think that measures must be taken in time to avoid it we consider necessary that international trade be established as it was the case before the great misfortunes of the world on an indisputable monetary base and one that does not bear the mark of any particular country which base in truth no one sees how one could really have any standard criterion other than gold the erosion of confidence in the dollar gold peg was called the triffin dilemma to understand how quickly the u s undermined the exchange rate consider that from 1790 to 1944 the u s accumulated around 200 billion dollars of debt from 1944 to 1971 the debt doubled to around 400 billion at least part of which was simply printed the nixon administration devalued the dollar a few times before suspending the convertibility of the dollar into gold completely on august 15th 1971 holding the world s gold and leaving them with pieces of green paper over the next decade the price of gold steadily increased to all time highs nixon s move a desperate attempt at stopping inflation failed to do so as the world rejected the dollar in order to avoid global loss of confidence in the dollar the dollar needed to be tied to a new commodity something equally as universally demanded the u s found that commodity in 1973 during the saudi imposed oil embargo saudi arabia was infuriated by u s support for israel in the yom kippur war and imposed an oil embargo on the u s as punishment henry kissinger led the diplomatic effort to end the embargo in 1974 a deal was struck to end the saudi embargo and bring u s saudi relations to previously unseen heights john perkins author of confessions of an economic hitman and former economic hitman himself summarized the deal aptly in the early 70s opec didn t like what we were doing in israel same old story so they cut off our oil supplies so some of you will remember these long lines at the gas stations and we feared we were gonna have another depression like the 1929 depression so the u s treasury department came to me and other economic hitmen and said listen you know we can t allow opec to blackmail us anymore you guys gotta come up with a plan so this doesn t happen again we knew this plan had to involve saudi arabia because it had more oil than anybody else and it also the house of saud was corrupt and corruptible the long version is explained in the book but the short version of what we did the deal we finally struck with the house of saud was a deal whereby they would return almost all the money they made from selling to the u s invest it in u s government securities the u s treasury department would use the interest from those securities which over the years amounted to trillions of dollars to hire us companies to westernize saudi arabia build petrochemical complexes desalination plants whole cities out of the desert mcdonalds and all the other things that go along with our western culture the house of saud would also agree to keep the price of oil within limits acceptable to the oil companies possibly not acceptable to you and me but acceptable to the oil companies and this is very very important they agree that they will never ever sell oil for anything other than u s dollars this happened in the early 70 s right after we had went off the gold standard because we were bankrupt because we could not pay our debts to the european countries in gold nixon took us off the gold standard and then we were stuck with the situation why would anyone in the world use u s dollars so then we came up with this plan which in essence put the dollar on the oil standard you cannot buy oil on the world market for anything other than dollars and that s very important for corporatocracy we our part of the bargain was we agreed to keep the house of saud in power in control it was an amazing deal the deal of the century it was history making incredibly powerful deal that we struck with saudi arabia and it s held crude oil is the most traded commodity in the world every country needs it the petrodollar system requires every country to have u s dollars on hand to buy oil it keeps demand for the u s dollar as high as it was when the dollar was the only currency that could buy gold if a country needs oil it will have to manufacture and export a tangible good of value like a car or a refrigerator to the united states while the u s can simply print or borrow paper dollars to use as immediate payment even more advantageous to the u s opec nations take the profits from their oil sales to buy u s securities read lend america money a system called petrodollar recycling the deal with saudi arabia allowed the u s to continue being the only country able to print the world reserve currency and run massive deficits to become the consumer capital of the world the petrodollar and the empire the takeaway from the petrodollar phenomenon is that as long as countries need oil they will need the dollar as long as countries demand dollars the u s can continue to go into massive amounts of debt to fund its network of global military bases wall street bailouts nuclear missiles and tax cuts for the rich but what happens if countries catch on to the scheme and try to break free of the petrodollar system the most notable example of this is iraq which began selling its oil for euros instead of dollars which iraq called the currency of an enemy state in the year 2000 this was a logical move for iraq as the country was under a brutal u n sanctions regime which caused 500 000 iraqi children to die of malnutrition a price acceptable to u s ambassador to the united nations madeleine albright iraq knew that the u s could use its control over the international financial markets to further punish a dollar dependent country its ditching of the dollar was just another reason why iraq ended up in george bush s so called axis of evil only weeks before the invasion of iraq saddam hussein boasted that iraq s euro filled oil account was earning a higher interest rate than it would have had it been stuffed with dollars the united states promptly turned iraq into a hell on earth overthrowing saddam s government and leaving over a million dead iraqis in its wake iraq s oil supply was back under u s corporate control and by extension under control of worldwide dollar hegemony as well libya also had plans to undermine the dollar s grip over the global oil trade an email from hillary clinton advisor and ally sidney blumenthal which was scrubbed from the state department s website revealed that french intelligence had discovered libya s vast gold and silver reserves and feared they would be used to back a pan african currency the dinar to rival the french franc the euro and the dollar the email goes on to casually describe france s motivations for intervening oil unsurprisingly topping the list a desire to gain a greater share of libya oil production increase french influence in north africa improve his internal political situation in france provide the french military with an opportunity to reassert its position in the world address the concern of his advisors over qaddafi s long term plans to supplant france as the dominant power in francophone africa while the initial efforts to destroy libya were spearheaded by france and britain none of these goals were in any way objectionable or contrary to u s foreign policy objectives and the interest of maintaining the petrodollar system which is why the u s quickly became a leader in the assassination campaign despite mass pro government protests of over a million people against the nato intervention which went nearly unreported in the corporate media in the following months libyan leader muammar gaddafi was beaten to death by nato armed rebels in the streets of tripoli part of the reason the united states continues to maintain such a heavy military presence in bahrain iraq kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates egypt israel jordan yemen syria and so on is that u s bases in these countries serve as launching pads for invasion against the next oil bearing country that tries to defy the global financial order where oil is buried in a way the u s must go in order to ensure the petrodollar system is preserved oil quite literally guides u s foreign policy however more and more people are seeing america s financial trickery for what it is and america can force the world to comply only for so long creating a new global financial system today two opec countries are trying to shake loose the petrodollar system venezuela and iran contrary to what we ve been taught to believe they don t do these things because they hate america or hate freedom but because they re forced to both countries have faced decades of slander and in recent years outright economic warfare in the form of restrictive financial sanctions that limit their access to international markets as mentioned in the beginning of the article these sanctions are designed to limit venezuela and iran s ability to acquire foreign reserves and by extension import things like medicine this isn t even a secret it s an openly stated goal of the sanctions policy donald trump s lawyer rudy giuliani celebrated the success of the sanctions after reports stated iranians were selling their organs and begging for food in a particularly genocidal episode mike pompeo said that the iranian leadership would have to make a decision that they want their people to eat meaning install a u s aligned government or continue to starve under the sanctions regime faced with no good options both countries have been experimenting with more creative ways of transacting with international trade partners most obviously both countries have dropped the dollar from their international exchanges pricing goods in other reserve currencies like euros and yuan this means you cannot import goods from these countries with dollars furthermore both countries are trying to repopularize gold as a means of international payment as sanctions crashed the value of the iranian rial demand for gold in iran hit four year highs iran is relying more heavily on its gold reserves to conduct trade iran is exploring exporting oil products to various african nations in exchange for gold iran has made similar agreements with india and turkey similarly venezuela is attempting to use its gold to acquire foreign reserves venezuela recently tried to withdraw 1 2 billion worth of its own gold stored in the vaults of the bank of england only to be denied in response to caracas attempts to subvert financial sanctions venezuela s enemies namely the lima group a u s sponsored organization of latin american countries have insisted that venezuela should be prevented from using oil and gold to conduct international trade the u s has already imposed sanctions on venezuela s gold mining industry which prevent american individuals and companies from buying venezuelan gold finally both countries have created gold backed cryptocurrencies which will be used as alternatives to the dollar as means of payment venezuela s crypto petro is backed by venezuela s natural resource wealth gold diamonds oil iron and so on western pundits wasted no time warning people on the internet that petro was a bad investment the only problem being that petro wasn t created as a vehicle for money making as most western cryptos are petro was created solely for the purpose of being a currency for venezuelans to send to other countries to buy goods they could not buy under the sanctions regime with oil and gold backing petro s value is largely decided by the global oil and gold prices you won t make a lot of money speculating on the value of petro iran recently unveiled its own gold backed cryptocurrency the paymon weeks ago similar to petro paymon gives iran the ability to get around u s financial sanctions iran and venezuela s maneuvers have raised eyebrows but in the context of the larger global trend of de dollarization they pose a much greater threat than as individual occurrences much larger economies are also moving to end their dependence on the dollar and are seriously considering creating multilateral trading blocks free of the dollar after washington tightened sanctions on russia regarding russia s activities in crimea russian president vladimir putin said that russia would work towards completely dumping the dollar so far russia has made good on this promise dumping 84 percent of its u s debt holdings and massively increasing its gold reserves in the last two years as russian foreign minister sergey lavrov once stated washington immediately stops servicing any banking operations in dollars in relation to both the country that they want to punish and also all those who have some kind of relationship with it china and japan america s biggest foreign debt holders have also been shedding u s debt holdings albeit at a steady pace turkey and india have also lowered their u s bond holdings by similar amounts in recent months each country in the shanghai cooperation organization has eliminated the use of the dollar in trade with at least one other country in the organization it s hardly inconceivable that eventually these countries will conduct deeper more robust trade within the organization without the dollar even the eu is considering asserting the euro s role on the international stage last year china what do all of these actions amount to as discussed earlier at its root money has power because people believe it does each of these small changes reduces the belief in the dollar s hegemony just a little bit eventually in theory these small material changes will lead to a larger qualitative change in the world financial system this type of massive change will not happen overnight but the world financial system may encounter a series of unrectifiable challenges in the next decade but of course as any empire would the u s will not simply allow the world to trigger a second triffin dilemma while it sits silently and watches it will fight to maintain the status quo that made it an empire top photo a u s soldier looks through a pair of

el salvador s farabundo martí national liberation front fmln has been ousted from office unseated in sunday s presidential election by an ambitious young millionaire who claims to transcend partisan politics after two consecutive terms in the presidency the former marxist leninist guerilla army won a distant third place in the vote trailing both the right wing nationalist republican alliance arena party which governed from 1989 2009 and the election s insurgent victor nayib bukele according to the preliminary results bukele swept the election with 1 388 009 votes 53 of the vote arena in coalition with smaller right wing parties took 31 8 and the fmln a dismal 14 4 the leftist party received even fewer votes than in the recent mid terms and over a million fewer than in the 2014 presidential race the election saw about 50 turn out significantly lower than previous presidential votes suggesting that while many former fmln supporters defected to bukele others did not vote at all the fmln s resounding defeat though painful was not unforeseen coming after massive mid term losses in march 2018 and amid a broader left retreat in latin america since the fall of commodity prices in 2014 left and center left administrations in argentina chile and brazil that depended on extractive rents have been swept out of office with venezuela and nicaragua in the crosshairs president elect bukele has called nicolas maduro and daniel ortega both dictators and will likely prove an eager ally in the us s right wing crusade in the region the fmln was elected with a firm mandate in 2009 but won with a slim margin in 2014 fmln power was significantly diminished over the course of its second term slowing the pace of reform as i argue in steve ellner s forthcoming book the pink tide experiences breakthroughs and shortcomings in twenty first century latin america the increasingly hostile geopolitical climate left the party without crucial international allies and alternative sources of financing even as right wing obstruction and destabilization successfully starved the administration of funds and support internally at the same time pragmatic alliances further narrowed fmln political horizons sometimes with devastating consequences in office the fmln was not as radical as many of its southern neighbors but although the party did not fundamentally restructure el salvador s economy it made unprecedented gains in social investment inclusion and infrastructure while forging diplomatic and commercial ties with the latin american anti neoliberal bloc many of these advances are now in danger and the future of the salvadoran left is uncertain as the rest of the region reckons with the limits of bourgeois electoral politics and state power el salvador s revolutionaries must decide if the fmln remains a viable instrument for their struggle a revolutionary history the fmln was founded in 1980 at the start of a bloody twelve year civil war against the us backed military dictatorship and the landed oligarchs it served the union of five leftist political military organizations the fmln s alliance of old and new left tendencies built on a revolutionary tradition forged in the 1932 communist and peasant uprising that was met with genocidal repression by the military dictatorship the guerrillas fought the anti communist regime to a draw in 1992 in 1993 the un truth commission report attributed at least 85 of the war s 75 000 deaths and 10 000 disappearances to us funded armed and trained salvadoran security forces and their associated death squads and only 5 to the insurgency the negotiations saw the fmln lay down arms and begin a fraught transition from guerrilla army to leftist political party as a party the fmln s statutes defined it as democratic revolutionary peaceful and socialist the former insurgency institutionalized its nation wide structures of base committees and secretariats and cultivated a base among radicalized rural communities urban intellectuals labor unions organized university students and other social movement groups throughout the dark neoliberal decade of the 1990s and the 2000s the fmln accompanied popular struggles against structural adjustment and right wing repression from the legislature and in the streets the peace accords demilitarized the salvadoran state and laid the foundations for a fragile bourgeois democracy but failed to address the structural inequities of el salvador s economy which remained firmly in the hands of a small class of elites as did state power even before the war s close the ruling class represented primarily by the quasi fascist nationalist republican alliance arena party began to enact sweeping neoliberal reforms with us support arena zealously privatized the public bank telecommunications electric energy sugar mills coffee exports and pension system it imposed the us dollar as the national currency and signed el salvador onto the central american free trade agreement cafta with the united states the results were predictably disastrous for the country s poor majority the low wage highly surveilled maquiladora employment that emerged in new deregulated tax exempt export processing zones for foreign investment could scarcely replace the tens of thousands of public sector and agricultural jobs lost to structural adjustment the ranks of the informal sector swelled and us bound migration exceeded wartime levels income from migrant remittances soon outpaced that of maquila exports the export of cheap labor fuelled the expansion of the precarious service sector in the us while remittances sustained the fragile salvadoran economy further entrenching the asymmetrical relationship of economic dependency and political subordination between the two countries rising violence and organized crime further eroded living conditions for the salvadoran working class racist anti gang policing in los angeles and anti immigrant legislation in the late 1990s facilitated the mass deportation of us raised youths to el salvador some of whom carried the culture and practices of street gangs formed in us working class neighborhoods and prisons these groups flourished amid the unaddressed traumas of the recent armed conflict and the poverty facing many post war salvadoran young people with steady us support arena responded to the growing crisis with repressive iron fist policing that only served to criminalize and alienate poor young men radicalizing and fortifying gang structures gang violence and extortion concentrated in struggling working class salvadoran communities soon joined economic hardship as a driving force for northward migration these were the fraught conditions in which the fmln assumed el salvador s presidency in 2009 aided by a swelling pink tide to the south and a relative diplomatic opening from the new obama administration in the north which offered the us s first ever neutrality statement ahead of the elections the election marked the country s first peaceful transition of power since the war and the first time that popular progressive forces would govern in the nation s history fmln gains the fmln s 2009 presidential candidate mauricio funes was an outspoken progressive journalist and non fmln militant enlisted to broaden the fmln s reach former guerrilla commander salvador sánchez cerén joined him on the ticket as vice president sánchez cerén a former schoolteacher and leader in the historic andes 21 de julio teacher s movement that challenged state repression in the 1970s also served as education minister under funes and was elected president in 2014 these administrations did not alter the structures of el salvador s highly concentrated us dependent economy but they enacted unprecedented social reforms and investment aimed at the country s most vulnerable and historically excluded populations the fmln s sweeping healthcare reforms abolished so called voluntary fees at public hospitals and following the cuban model established hundreds of community clinics across underserved areas with prevention oriented healthcare promotors providing regular home visits the government built several new hospitals including a national women s hospital to replace the maternity hospital that had languished in disrepair after a 2001 earthquake as arena officials embezzled reconstruction funds new comprehensive women s city centers provided on site services including mental and reproductive health care legal support and job training maternal mortality fell from 56 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2009 to 31 by 2018 sánchez cerén s education ministry launched a national literacy program designed and implemented with cuban advisors in which high school students fulfilled community service hours by teaching reading writing and basic arithmetic to adults in their communities by the close of 2018 over 330 000 people the majority elderly women had learned to read and write and 100 territories were declared free of illiteracy in what became a signature fmln policy the administration removed barriers to public education by providing annual packets of school supplies to public elementary students together with shoes and uniforms made by local small scale producers public schools began to serve milk and a small meal of rice and beans sourced from salvadoran farmers the ministry of agriculture distributed seasonal packets of native bean and corn seeds to small farmers a program that was unsuccessfully challenged by the us for favoring local cooperatives over monsanto el salvador had been reduced to importing most of these staples but by 2012 domestic production was meeting national demand the public works ministry was transformed from a notorious source of arena graft into an fmln flagship when the funes administration completed an emblematic highway the funds for which were brazenly stolen under the previous administration they named it after martyred archbishop oscar romero now a saint who was gunned down at mass in 1980 for his dissent to military repression at the orders of arena party founder roberto d abuisson the international airport was also renamed for romero and in 2012 funes apologized on behalf of the state for the violence waged against civilians during the civil war from the legislature the fmln advanced key social movement priorities like the law for a life free from violence against women the gender equality equity and eradication of discrimination against women law a constitutional amendment to recognize indigenous peoples and the national law against metallic mining the first of its kind in the world to ban the environmentally destructive industry the fmln also implemented an access to public information law and launched an open government portal on state websites for the first time public entities were mandated to publish yearly reports of their activities and spending at the helm of the elections authority the fmln established a nationwide residential voting system going from 460 voting centers in 2009 to 1 600 by the 2015 midterms adopted measures to ensure suffrage for disabled and transgender voters and inaugurated an international absentee voting system sánchez cerén modeled his presidency after uruguay s pepe mujíca he opened the presidential residence to the public remaining with his wife in their modest family home his administration also discursively aligned itself with south american pink tide governments by adopting the indigenous concept of buen vivir an indigenous notion of collective and sustainable well being employed in evo morales bolivia and rafael correa s ecuador he also signed el salvador onto petrocaribe under sánchez cerén programs providing supplies uniforms shoes and meals were expanded to high school and several more women s city centers were established the university of el salvador was made tuition free for public school students and the administration helped secure a major minimum wage raise that increased salaries by 102 for the country s lowest paid workers still the administration saw fewer innovations than its predecessor this relative moderation accounts in part for the fmln s declining support and corresponds to both internal and external pressures that increasingly limited the administration s ambitions shortcomings while the fmln oversaw a reduction in poverty and inequality the party did not transform el salvador s prevailing modes of capital accumulation fmln governed municipalities had partnered with venezuela since 2006 in the alba petroleos initiative which used proceeds from subsidized venezuelan fuel at alba gas stations towards community social programs after the fmln reached the presidency former communist party militant josé luis merino led an effort to build alternative capital founding companies like alba alimentos which sold local salvadoran staples tu financiera which provided microcredit and veca a new alba financed airline which offered cheap central american flights the fall of commodity prices at the start of the fmln s second term however dashed hopes that the anti neoliberal bloc would provide the solutions to finance broader transformations and offset us influence by 2018 most alba gas stations had been shuttered and veca airlines had folded in addition the party failed to make qualitative improvements to the country s entrenched public security crisis the 2009 decision to increase military participation in police operations disturbed human rights advocates who presciently warned that the remilitarization of public security would portend dangerous abuses in 2013 journalists exposed negotiations between the funes administration and the country s top gangs that had sharply reduced homicides the truce s subsequent unraveling saw a spike in violence and the fierce public backlash together with a supreme court decision classifying gang members as terrorists foreclosed on the possibility of future dialogue the sánchez cerén administration sought to center violence prevention in its security strategy but right wing obstruction in the legislature and courts blocked the funds for much of those initiatives at the same time the government escalated enforcement cracking down on prison security and provoking further human rights concerns even as public opinion in favor of hard line anti gang policing remained resolute homicide rates rose then fell over the fmln s two terms but gang violence and extortion remain a dark daily reality for the most vulnerable salvadorans more broadly the party failed to deploy the state s ideological institutions towards building a left cultural hegemony so as to better defend and radicalize the fmln project the demands of governance took a toll on the party s relationship with its base and allied social movements as attention and resources were diverted to affairs of state and increasingly subordinated to electoral logics at the same time the aging leadership s refusal to promote younger militants to top party posts aversion to critique and vertical decision making fostered additional tensions among fmln rank and file these discontents were heightened after the massive 2018 midterm losses despite the clamor from movements and left intellectuals for a decisive affirmation of radical fmln principles and policy the government fumbled waiting weeks to enact an unremarkable cabinet reshuffling rather than reassure its increasingly disaffected base the lackluster response only fostered further alienation the fmln leadership has not listened to its base it imposes decisions and has lost its revolutionary mystique declared the social alliance for governability and justice asgoju coalition in the aftermath adding that the discontent is also due to the government s lack of political direction weak presidential leadership the failed strategy of governability neoliberal economic measures deficient political communication and the lack of cabinet changes together with ongoing right wing destabilization these shortcomings helped secure nayib bukele his share of former fmln supporters after ten years in power the fmln was no longer the party of change reluctant to return to arena most salvadorans cast their lot with the charismatic newcomer destabilization from the outset the fmln faced fierce obstruction and destabilization by the representatives of salvadoran and transnational capital from its bastions in the legislature the judiciary and the commercial media the right worked to sabotage successful fmln governance no party achieved a 43 vote majority in the legislature but by 2012 arena had overtaken the fmln as the largest voting bloc measures requiring a two thirds majority like appointments for supreme court magistrate supreme elections tribunal magistrate attorney general and human rights ombudsperson as well as the national budget usually needed arena s votes to pass forcing negotiations the right wing parties consistently united to block social movement demands for legislation to guarantee equitable universal access to food and water and arena routinely held international loans and key budgetary measures hostage seeking to provoke a fiscal crisis from the supreme court s constitutional chamber magistrates rejected every fmln initiative to balance el salvador s regressive tax system abolishing a new 1 minimum income tax a tax on financial transactions over 1 000 an income tax for newspapers along with anti tax evasion measures the chamber also cut off crucial sources of public funding most notoriously reversing the legislature s emission of 900 million in government bonds the same magistrates adopted a cynical technocratic discourse of non partisanship to purge leftists from top institutions these decisions ran counter to the foundations of the salvadoran political system which rests on strong political parties the chamber barred party members from occupying any post determined through legislative vote ousting dozens of officials including the fmln president of the national elections authority tse and his successor for fmln sympathies the chamber ejected its own president for his fmln membership but left those with financial and familial ties to arena on the bench the court also unilaterally remade el salvador s electoral system in brazen disregard for the peace accord s designation of the tse as el salvador s highest elections authority the magistrates opened legislative and municipal races to independent candidates ordered candidates photographs on the ballot and allowed voters to select multiple legislative candidates across competing parties effectively orienting the system toward charismatic individuals over collective projects the court then barred party members from serving as poll station volunteers these decisions have generated confusion chaos and delays in recent elections they prompted public confidence in the electoral process to plummet and advanced a depoliticizing ideological framework that portrayed collective struggle through partisan politics as passé in addition to the court the office of the attorney general assumed a new antagonism towards the central government rather than investigating the over 150 cases of corruption against prior arena administrations that the fmln documented and filed after taking office prosecutors set about attacking arena s enemies with great fanfare the recent highly touted prosecutions of salvadoran ex presidents are illustrative after enormous pressure from president funes the attorney general reluctantly brought charges against ex president francisco flores 1999 2004 for the theft of at least 15 million in taiwanese donations for victims of the 2001 earthquake much of which was funnelled into arena party accounts even after trying to flee the country flores was granted house arrest during trial and no co conspirators were charged flores died during the proceedings and the case was dismissed former president tony saca 2004 2009 in contrast defected to found the conservative gana party in 2010 he was dramatically arrested during his daughter s wedding party and jailed to await trial saca was convicted of embezzling hundreds of millions in public funds but cut a plea deal his relatively light sentence prompting speculation that the attorney general s office negotiated leniency in exchange for protecting accomplices who remain loyal to arena after leaving office in 2014 funes himself became the target of a series of investigations in 2016 he sought asylum in nicaragua in 2016 shortly after the attorney general invited the press to a spectacular raid on the former fmln president s house live tweeting random photos of funes belongings from permitted firearms to an aquarium in 2017 he was convicted in abstentia for failing to account for 400 000 in an audit in 2018 he and 30 family members and business associates were charged with laundering and embezzling a staggering 350 million allegedly used for luxury goods and services the attorney general is now seeking the former president s extradition though requests for interpol to issue a warrant have been denied the case is still unfolding but the political cost to the fmln is already incalculable these selective prosecutions of arena s adversaries won high praise from the us embassy but preserved impunity for arena and the class it represents indeed the united states worked hard to constrain the fmln and impose policies that advanced the interests of us capital in addition to ongoing restraints on us aid that encourage repressive security measures and private sector led development despite obama s previous promises of neutrality the us actively intervened throughout the fmln s two administrations in 2013 the obama administration conditioned hundreds of millions in us development aid on the passage of a public private partnership law after major social movement opposition led by public sector unions the fmln legislative bloc was able to exclude healthcare education water and public security from the project in 2014 the us again threatened to withhold aid this time over the fmln s family agriculture program the us ambassador also repeatedly threatened aid if controversial supreme court decisions were not respected after the fmln rescinded diplomatic recognition of taiwan in favor of china in 2018 the trump administration temporarily recalled the us ambassador slamming the fmln and declaring us relations with el salvador would be reevaluated after the devastating decision to rescind temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of salvadorans in the us the rebuke fueled opposition accusations that the fmln was jeopardizing us relations together the political obstruction the campaign against leftist political partisans and the high profile corruption prosecutions helped foster a climate of cynicism and rejection not just of the fmln but of politics in general this ideological work was amplified by the monopolized corporate media which relentlessly railed against the government the salvadoran media projected a constant crisis amplifying acts of gang violence and portraying the fmln as inept or corrupt far outpacing the government s capacity to publicize any successes public opinion of the fmln and politics in general plummeted over the course of the sánchez cerén administration such was the success of this barrage of negativity that a central american university uca year end poll found 62 4 thought violence had increased in 2017 even as homicides fell significantly that year in a 2018 uca poll 57 5 of respondents identified insecurity and gang violence as the country s principal problem when asked if they had personally been victim of a crime 83 5 said no despite a decline in poverty and inequality under the fmln the 2017 poll found 54 6 of respondents thought poverty had increased the same poll found the top three most trusted institutions in the country were the catholic church evangelical churches and the armed forces the least respected were the elections authority the legislature and political parties pragmatism facing obstruction and antagonism from the opposition the fmln s project was also limited by its own political alliances the alliance with journalist mauricio funes ushered the fmln into the presidency with a strong mandate and high expectations in 2009 but relations between the party and its strategic ally were tense throughout much of the term funes surrounded himself with centrist non fmln advisors and he excluded party representatives from the economic cabinet entirely héctor dada founder of el salvador s social democratic party and representative of the small democratic change party that had endorsed the fmln ticket resigned from his post as economy minister in 2012 over the administration s continuity of the neoliberal course and funes fired other appointees like the minister of labor and the president of the salvadoran institute for women s development for their radicality most damaging however was the subsequent funes corruption investigation which however politicized dealt a devastating blow to fmln credibility the fmln reached its legislative peak in 2009 with 35 seats retaining 31 from 2012 2018 then falling to 23 as its legislative share diminished the fmln negotiated a pact with the small right wing gana party in exchange for gana s votes on key legislative measures the conservative party was granted posts in the sánchez cerén administration including the vice ministry of trade and industry the fmln also agreed to split the presidency of the national legislative assembly with gana from 2015 2018 leaving gana with control of the legislature for the final eighteen months of the term these concessions further shrank the fmln s political horizon the fmln was also constrained from within in order to unite the party around the 2014 ticket the popular five term mayor of the middle class san salvador suburb santa tecla óscar ortiz was tapped as vice president ortiz represents a latent social democratic renovador faction within the fmln that challenged the dominant revolutionary socialist current in the 1990s always cozy with the private sector ortiz courted capital under the title of commissioner for public and private investment in addition to his ceremonial duties as vice president following the dramatic 2018 mid term losses ortiz executed a sort of bloodless coup overseeing the ensuring cabinet reorganization and effectively taking over the government he steered the administration to the right unveiling a deeply unpopular proposal for a deregulated special economic zone on the country s eastern coast the initiative earned a scathing editorial from the arpas community radio network a longtime fmln ally declaring that the project is the final neoliberal catastrophe of this leftist government that abandoned the progressive project of structural transformations after the party s presidential defeat sánchez cerén announced that ortiz would lead the transition team in electoral terms however the party s most disastrous alliance proved to be its brief and ill fated romance with president elect nayib bukele bukele the heir to an unusually progressive wealthy family of palestinian descent bukele was not an fmln member when he was tapped by the party leadership to run for mayor of the small san salvador suburb of nuevo cuscatlán in 2012 at the age of 31 his charisma and publicity savvy however earned him a formidable social media following with middle class millennial voters and bukele consolidated his brand by bathing the city in his signature baby blue rather than the fmln s traditional red and white in 2015 bukele was selected to as the fmln candidate to regain the capital city from arena which he did decisively bukele styled himself an anti establishment renegade and he brought youthful energy to a party whose original guerilla comandancia still occupies the principal posts of power bukele s administration was far from radical however his governing slogan was there s enough money when nobody steals bukele s ambitions increasingly brought him into conflict with the fmln leadership all the more so as it became clear that he would not be tapped as the 2019 presidential candidate in 2017 he was expelled by the party ethics tribunal after he called an fmln city councilwoman a witch bukele took thousands of supporters with him he was ousted too late to run for re election as an independent in the 2018 mid terms and over 200 000 voters heeded his call to turn in blank ballots many more stayed home the fmln lost the mayor s seat to arena and was reduced to its lowest standing in the legislature since the 1990s but bukele s true ambition was the presidency when the right wing dominated elections authority rejected his hastily formed new ideas party he sought an alliance with the tiny center left cd party the elections authority then dissolved the cd and bukele even as he cast himself as a radical alternative to a corrupt political establishment jumped onto the right wing gana party s ticket he was joined by vice presidential candidate félix ulloa who was part of the fmln s diplomatic corps during the war but left the party in the 1990s to join a short lived social democratic party that advanced a less radical progressive politics he later went into academia and consulting with gana bukele capitalized on the pervasive cynicism fomented by the right honing a messianic post ideological populism he continued to rally supporters against both the fmln and arena and called the fmln arena 2 0 putting his publicity savvy to work bukele addressed his followers via facebook live and deployed internet trolls to defame his detractors he hedged against a potential defeat by claiming that the establishment was preparing electoral fraud bukele refused to participate in a single presidential debate much of his platform was plagiarized including from fmln government documents one of the document s few original turns of phrase declared that bukele s administration would be anti neoliberal and pro free market in the absence of any coherent political ideology or project beyond his own opportunism bukele has projected himself as a bruce wayne like savior feminist economist julia evelyn martínez warned in july it seems that for nayib bukele and the group of people that accompany and advise him the goal is not to transform politics instead the goal is to get to the presidency and if in order to get to the presidency they have to step on make pacts with the devil with the forces of evil with corruption they ll do it an uncertain future bukele s gana presidency is largely a monster of the fmln s own making sunday s outcome is the product of a dangerous electoral pragmatism that while successful in the short term seriously weakened the party in the long term as pablo benítez a voice of a younger generation of salvadoran leftists reflected that excess of pragmatism is what has the fmln in a crisis of credibility it s because of that frustration that people feel for not having made fundamental radical changes support for bukele however confirms that the salvadoran people are impatient for change unlike in brazil or argentina el salvador s rebuff of the fmln was not accompanied by an embrace of the traditional right the question for the left is whether it can regain the strength to offer a cogent alternative if and when bukele disappoints with gana s meager 10 seats in the legislature bukele s administration will have little political support it is not clear furthermore what class of policies his administration will pursue bukele was mercurial as ever on the campaign trail but his sponsor gana has opposed abortion and marriage equality a position bukele shares and supported water privatization and the death penalty ten years of gains in public healthcare education and social inclusion may well be reversed and the current social movement struggles for the decriminalization of abortion and against water privatization may face devastating setbacks bukele s friendliness with the oas s right wing secretary general luis almagro support for israel and denunciations of venezuelan president maduro suggest that he will likely steer el salvador s foreign policy to the right further consolidating the region s reactionary turn some like julia evelyn martínez have suggested it s time to rebuild the left through a new party still any effort to build a left alternative outside of the fmln in el salvador would face serious challenges though weakened the fmln maintains deep roots across contemporary salvadoran social movements and an extensive organizational network throughout the country the salvadoran leftist youth collective progre summarized we understand the many obstacles that arise when pushing a progressive agenda from the executive branch we know clearly the obstacles that faced in the legislative assembly without a majority and the need to secure votes from the right but none of that justifies the tolerance shown in the face of the corruption of some of its members the timidity with which it pursued deeper economic transformations the lack of ideological consistency from the executive initiatives like the special economic zones project despite that we recognize that the fmln remains the only political party with which we can ally in some of our collective battles like the struggle against water privatization improvements in public healthcare defence of women s rights cultural policy and more it is the fmln that must renew itself and rise to the ethical and combative level of the salvadoran left s struggles of our people and not we who should conform to their electoral interests within the fmln a struggle is brewing for the soul of the party while some advocate a return to the fmln s revolutionary roots moderates like ortiz appear to be consolidating political power together with fellow former communist party militants in the alba group ortiz was rumored to be seeking an alliance with bukele foreshadowing a possible rupture the fmln s more orthodox party leadership however appears shaken from its complacency on wednesday the party announced it will hold its internal elections scheduled for december 2020 in the coming months furthermore the majority of the political commission s members including ortiz sánchez cerén and secretary general medardo gonzález will abstain from any new positions effectively excluding an entire generation of the party s historic comandancia from continuing in internal positions of power there is a clamor for greater participation from our base which is why this process will be carried out in consultation with our party militants today we must promote greater participation of the new generations of revolutionary capable and ethical young people who can carry the fmln forward said gonzález in his victory speech bukele claimed to have turned the page on the post war urging his followers to look to the future not the past but el salvador s history of repression and resistance still palpably permeates the present deep inequality and impunity continue to structure everyday life and the revolutionary project launched by the fmln in 1980 is painfully incomplete as the region s right gathers strength the salvadoran left demands a political instrument committed to its most radical emancipatory traditions the fmln has assumed that responsibility in the past the coming struggles will determine whether it can do so again this piece was co published with jacobin hilary goodfriend is a doctoral student in latin american studies at the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico unam in

the forth international conference for the equilibrium of the world took place in havana cuba from 28 to 31 january 2019 the conference organized by the josé marti project of international solidarity was sponsored by unesco and a number of local and international organisms and ngos it coincided with the 60th anniversary of the cuban revolution and as such was also a celebration of that successful demonstration to the world that socialism solidarity and love for live can actually survive against all odds and yes cuba has faced more hardship than any other country in recent history through boycotts embargoes and all sorts of economic sanctions heinous military infiltrations and assassination attempts initiated by the united states and followed largely under threats from washington by most of the western world viva cuba a celebration well deserved and in the name of josé marti who was born 166 years ago but whose thoughts and spiritual thinking for a new world are as valid today as they were then they may perhaps best be summarized aslove solidarity justice living well for alland in peace these principles were taken over by fidel and raul castro the che and hugo chávez they transcend current generations and reach far beyond latin america the conference had many highlights brilliant speakers a torch march was organized at the university of havana in honor of josé marti and the organizers offered the participants an extraordinary music and modern ballet performance at the national theater from my point of view some of the important messages came from the representative of china who talked about the new silk road or the belt and road initiative bri of building bridges and connecting countries and people whereas the west was building walls a russian speaker sadly admitted that it took his government a longtime and relentless trying to build alliances with the west until they realized relatively recently that the west could not be trusted professoradan chavez frias chavez hugo s brother described an invasivehistory over the past 100 years by the united states of latin america and called upon the brother nations of the americas and the world to bond together in solidarity to resist the empire s infringement and steady attempts to subjugate sovereign nations with a vision towards a multipolar world of equals of sovereign nations living together in peaceful relations my own presentation focused on economy of resistance and what a better place than cuba to talk about economy of resistance impossible cuba has a 60 year history of successful resistance against a massive embargo ordered by washington and followed by almost the entire western world thus demonstrating that the west has been reduced to a us colony this was true already during the cold war but became even clearer when the sovietunion fell here too the west led by washington was instrumental in the collapse of the ussr but that s another story and the us grabbed the opportunity to become the emperor of a unipolar world cuban troops also resisted and conquered the attempted us bay of pigs playa girón invasion launched by president kennedy in 1961 and not least fidel castro survived more than 600 cia initiated assassination attempts the principles of economy of resistance cover a vast domain of topics with many ramifications this presentation focused on fourkey areas food medical and education sovereignty economic and financial sovereignty the fifth column and water resources a human right and a vital resource for survival on food health and education sovereignty cuba is 100 autonomous as far health and education go however cuba imports more than 70 of the food her citizens consume and that at present mostly from the european union cuba has the capacity and agricultural potential to become not only fully self sufficient but to develop and process agricultural produce into an agricultural industry and become a net exporter of agricultural goods this process might be addressed as apriority policy issue however it will take some time to fully implement meanwhile it may be wise to diversify imports from other parts of the world than the eu i e russia china central asia friendly alba countries because europe is not trustworthy they tell you today they will always honor your purchasing contracts but if the empire strikes down with sanctions as they did recently for anyone doing business with iran cuba may be cooked spineless europe will bend to the orders of washington they have demonstrated this time and again not least with iran despite the fact that they signed the so called nuclear deal the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa on 14 july 2015 the permanent members of the united nations security council the united states uk russia france and china plus germany and the eu and iran after which obama lifted all sanctions with iran only to have trump break the agreement and reimpose the most draconian sanctions on iran and on enterprises doing business with iran the us government and by association europe does not adhere to any agreement or any international law for that matter when it doesn t suit them there are plenty of indications venezuela today to be followed by nicaragua and cuba these should be valid signals for cuba to diversify her food imports until full self sufficiency is achieved already in 2014 mr putin said the sanctions were the best thing that could have happened to russia it forced her to revamp her agriculture and rebuild her industrial parks with the latest technology to become fully independent from imports today sanctions are a mere propaganda tool of the west but they have hardly an impact on russia russia has become the largest wheat exporter in the world cuba could do likewise she has the agricultural potential to become fully food autonomous on economic and financial sovereignty four facets are being addressed the first one foreign investments cuba may want to focus on i technology ii assuring that a majority of the investment shares remains cuban iii using to the extent possible cuba s own capital reserves for investments foreign capital is bound to certain conditionalities imposed by foreign investors thus it bears exchange rate and other risks to the point where potential profits from foreign assets are usually discounted by between 10 and 20 and iv last but not least cuba ought to decide on the sectors for foreign investors not the foreign investor following scenario as propagated by opposition lawyer and economist pablo de cuba in miami should be avoided cuba cedes a piece of her conditions of sovereignty and negotiates with foreign investors puts a certain amount of discounted debt at the creditors disposal so as to attract more investments in sectors that they the investors choose for the internal development of cuba as the hegemony of the us dollar is used to strangle any country that refuses to bend to the empire a progressive dedollarization is of the order meaning in addition to the us dollar itself move progressively away from all currencies that are intimately linked to the us dollar i e canadian and australian dollars euro yen pound sterling and more this is a strategy to be pursued in the short and medium term for the protection against more sanctions dished out by the us and its spineless allies simultaneously a rapprochement towards other monetary systems for example in the east especially based on the chinese gold convertible petro yuan may be seriously considered russia and china and in fact the entire sco shanghai cooperation organization have already designed a monetary transfer system circumventing the western swift system which has every transaction channeled through and controlled by a us bank this is the key motive for economic and financial sanctions there is no reason why cuba could not gradually but pointedly join such an alternative system to move out of the western claws of embargo the sco members today encompass about half of the world population and control one third of the globe s gdp drawbacks would be that the import markets would have to be revisited and diversified unless western suppliers would accept to be paid in cuc or yuan through a system different from swift moving away from the western monetary transfer system may also impact remittances from cubans living in the us and elsewhere in the west about us 3 4 billion 2017 less than 4 of gdp it would mean departing from monetary transactions in the euro and european monetary zones be aware the future is in the east the west is committing slowly but steadily suicide another crucialadvice is stay away from imf world bank inter american development bank idb world trade organization wto and the like they are so called international financial and trade organizations all controlled by the us and her western allies and tend to enslave their clients with debt case in point mexico president andres manuel lopez obrador amlo a leftist has little margin to maneuver mexico s economy inherited from his neoliberal predecessor enrique peña nieto mexico s finances are shackled by the international banking system led by the imf fed wb and by association the globalized wall street system for example amlo intended to revive pemex the petroleum state enterprise the imf told him that he first had to financially sanitize pemex meaning putting pemex through a severe austerity program the banking community agreed in caseamlo wouldn t follow their advice they might strangle his country the cuc versus the peso a dual monetary system cuc 1 cup 25 75 has also been used by china up to the mid 80s and by germany after wwi to develop export import markets however there comes a time when the system could divide the population between those who have access to foreign currencies cuc convertible and those who have no such access also the convertibility of the cuc with the euro swiss franc pound sterling and yen make the cuc de facto convertible with the dollar hence the cuc is dollarized this is what washington likes to keep cuba s economy despite the embargo in the orbit of the dollar hegemony which will be used in an attempt to gradually integrate cuba into the western capitalist economy however washington will not succeed cuba is alert and has been resisting for the last 60 years the fifth column refers to clandestine and or overt infiltration of opposing and enemy elements into the government they come in the form of ngos us cia trained local or foreigners to destabilize a country and especially a country s economy from inside there are ever more countries that do not bend to the dictate of the empire and are targets for fifth columns russia china iran syria venezuela pakistan and more and cuba the term fifth column is attributed to general emilio mola who during the spanish civil war in 1936 informed his homologue general francisco franco that he has four columns of troops marching towards madrid and that they would be backed by a fifth column hidden inside the city with the support of this fifth column he expected to finish with the legitimate republican government the process of infiltration is becoming ever more sophisticated bolder and acting with total impunity perhaps the most in famous organization to foment fifth columns around the world among many others is the national endowment for democracy ned the extended arm of the cia it goes as a so called ngo or foreign policy thinktank which receives hundreds of millions of dollars from the state department to subvert non obedient countries governments bringing about regime change through infiltration of foreign trained funded and armed disruptive forces sowing social unrest and even civil wars cases in point are ukraine syria afghanistan sudan somalia libya and more and now they attempt to topple venezuela s legitimate democratically elected government of nicolás maduro they work through national and international ngos and even universities in the countries to be regime changed part of this infiltration is a massive propaganda campaign and intimidation on so called allies or client states the process to reach regime change may take years and billions of dollars in the case of ukraine it took at least 5 years and 5 billion dollars in venezuela the process towards regime change started some 20 years ago as soon as hugo chavez was elected president in 1998 it brought about a failed coup in 2002 and was followed by ever increasing economic sanctions and physical military threats earlier this year washington was able to intimidating almost all of europe and a large proportion of latin america into accepting a us trained implant a trumppuppet juan guaidó as the interim president attempting to push the true legitimate maduro government aside to put impunity to its crest the trump government blocked 12 billion dollars of venezuela s foreign reserves in ny bank accounts and transferred the authority of access to the money to the illegitimate self appointedinterim president juan guaidó along the same lines the uk refused to return 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan gold to caracas all these criminalacts would not be possible without the inside help i e the fifth column the members of which are often not readily identifiable it is not known how often the empire attempted regime change in cuba however none of these attempts were successful the cuban revolution will not be broken water resources is a human right and a vital component of an economy of resistance water resources will be more precious in the future than petrol the twin satellites grace gravity recovery and climate experiment discovered the systematic depletion of groundwater resources throughout the world due to over exploitation and massive contamination from agriculture and industrial waste examples among many are the northern punjab region in india with massive inefficient irrigation and in peru the pacific coastal region due to inefficient irrigation unretained runoff rain and river water into the pacific ocean and destruction of entire watersheds through mining privatization of water resources not only of drinking water and water for irrigation but of entire aquifers is becoming an increasing calamity for the peoples of our planet again with impunity giant water corporations led by france the uk and the us are gradually and quietly encroaching on the diminishing fresh water resources by privatizing them so as to make water a commodity to be sold at market prices manipulated by the water giants hence depriving ready access to drinking water to an ever growing mass of increasingly impoverished populations victims of globalized neoliberal economies for example nestlé and coca cola have negotiated with former brazilian president temer and now with bolsonaro a 100 year concession over the guaraní aquiver the largest known renewable freshwater underground resource 74 of which is under brazil bolsonaro has already said he would open up the amazon area for private investors that could mean privatization of the world s largest pool of fresh water the amazon basin economic resistance means water is a human right and is part of a country s sovereignty water should never be privatized for cuba rainwater on average about 1 300 mm year is the only resource of fresh water cuba like most islands is vulnerable to rainwater runoff estimated at up to 80 there are already water shortages during certain times of the year resulting in droughts in specific regions small retention walls may help infiltrate rainwater into the ground and at the same time regulate irrigation provide drinking water and possibly generate electricity for local use through small hydroelectric plants the national water resources institute inrh instituto nacional de recursoshidráulicos is aware of this issue and is formulating a forward looking water strategy and planning the construction of infrastructure works to secure a countrywide water balance other challenges include the hygienic reuse and evacuation of waste water as well as in the medium to long run an island wide integrated water resources management iwrm in conclusion economic resistance might be summarized as follows self sufficiencyin food health services and education cuba has achieved the latter two and is now aiming at achieving 100 agricultural autonomy and in the meantime is advised diversifying food import markets health services and education cuba has achieved the latter two and is now aiming at achieving 100 agricultural autonomy and in the meantime is advised diversifying food import markets economic

loyalty and empowered employees americas on december 6 2018 aegon hosted an analyst investor conference specifically focused on the us business during the conference the management team of aegon americas highlighted to analysts and investors how the organization is well positioned to capture market opportunities in the united states and detailed broad actions to accelerate organic growth these actions include improving the company s competitive position attracting new customers strengthening existing customer relationships and increasing customer retention as part of aegon s ongoing process to simplify the legal structure of its business aegon eliminated its variable annuity captive in the us in the second half of 2018 the rationale behind setting up the variable annuity captive in 2015 was the need to manage the volatility of the us rbc ratio as a consequence of misalignment between reserve movements and hedging within the existing variable annuity capital framework recently the national association of insurance commissioners naic proposed improvements to the existing variable annuity capital framework these reduce the non economic volatility of the rbc ratio and for this reason the use of a variable annuity captive was no longer required as a result of the merger of two legal entities aegon realized a one time benefit to capital generation of approximately usd 1 billion in the second half of 2018 this benefit was offset by the impact of tax reform on the rbc ratio in the second half of 2018 europe on september 11 2018 aegon closed the acquisition of robidus a leading dutch income protection service provider this transaction fits the company s strategic objective to grow its fee based businesses aegon acquired approximately 95 of the company with the remainder being retained by robidus management team robidus continues to operate on a standalone basis under its own brand name the acquisition was financed from holding excess cash in the united kingdom aegon s platform offering and omni channel distribution strategy have established aegon as the leading platform provider in the market with a personal and workplace pension investment and protection offering in the second half of 2018 assets across aegon uk s platform business reached gbp 128 billion the first half of 2018 saw the migration of two portfolios of the cofunds business by moving gbp 57 billion of institutional assets to aegon technology in march followed by gbp 28 billion of retail assets in may a program was established to address service issues associated with the retail migration core trading and service levels have now returned to target levels the focus now is to continually improve the platform further increasing functionality and ease of use the final phase of the cofunds integration will take place in the first half of 2019 with the migration of assets related to nationwide to date aegon has realized gbp 40 million annualized expense savings from integrating the cofunds business a figure which will rise to gbp 60 million following the nationwide integration the digitization of aegon s protection business in the united kingdom in the first half of 2018 has made it simpler and quicker for advisers to apply for cover for their clients and has led to a significant uptick in business with new protection customer numbers up 36 in 2018 compared with the previous year aegon announced on november 20 2018 that it had strengthened its existing partnership with atos signing a 15 year contract to service and administer its existing business non platform customers in the united kingdom the extension of the partnership will further improve customer service for 1 4 million customers since 2016 atos has successfully serviced and administered aegon s 500 000 protection customers in the uk and has an excellent understanding of aegon s business culture and ways of working the agreement to be effective as of mid 2019 is initially expected to lead to annual run rate expense savings for aegon of approximately gbp 10 million growing to approximately gbp 30 million over time total transition and conversion charges are estimated to amount to approximately gbp 130 million and are expected to be recorded over the first three years of the agreement consistent with aegon s strategic objective to optimize its portfolio and capital allocation across its businesses aegon has successfully completed the sale of its businesses in the czech republic and slovakia for eur 155 million on january 8 2019 this is a further step in rationalizing aegon s geographical footprint and focusing resources on aegon s key markets on december 21 2018 aegon expanded its partnership with banco santander in portugal the transaction with banco santander in portugal comprises the life and non life in force books owned by banco popular within the scope of the partnership and generated by the banco popular franchise as well as other channels mainly agents and brokers in addition it includes the life and non life new business within the scope of business of the partnership distributed through the former banco popular franchise which banco santander acquired in 2017 aegon has paid an upfront consideration for the expansion of the partnership in portugal of eur 14 million and will pay an additional amount of up to eur 6 million depending on the performance of the partnership asia in india aegon life launched a new guaranteed return insurance plan called pos grip point of sale guaranteed return insurance plan the product is in line with aegon s philosophy of launching simple easy to understand products pos grip provides dual benefits of protection and savings the benefit which a customer will receive at the end of the policy term is guaranteed and is stated up front when buying the policy the guaranteed additions accrue at the end of every year throughout the policy term and include a one off loyalty booster payable at the end of the policy term in china aegon thtf launched an upgrade of its award winning platform for agents that was unveiled in october last year the platform features professional marketing smart recruitment and differentiated service serving as the smart personal assistant to agents aegon thtf has been increasing investments into digitalization in pursuit of its digital development strategy asset management growing external third party assets is an important element of the growth strategy of aegon asset management 2018 was the seventh consecutive full year of positive external third party net inflows this reflects aegon asset management s competitive performance together with management s ability to leverage scale and capabilities from the general account and third party affiliate businesses the continued strong commercial momentum in the netherlands was underlined by strong inflows into the dutch mortgage funds which grew to eur 16 billion of assets under management in the second half of 2018 operational highlights underlying earnings before tax aegon s underlying earnings before tax decreased by 8 compared with the second half of 2017 to eur 1 010 million expense savings in all regions and higher earnings in spain portugal the netherlands and the uk platform business from business growth and higher margins were more than offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands and lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience in the united states underlying earnings from the americas decreased by 16 to eur 614 million driven by lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience which more than offset expense savings the second half year of 2018 included eur 14 million unfavorable claims experience compared with eur 62 million favorable claims experience over the same period last year unfavorable mortality experience in life and retirement plans was partly offset by favorable claims experience in accident health retirement plans earnings decreased significantly which was mainly driven by lower fee income from lower asset balances a lower investment margin and investments in operations and technology underlying earnings before tax from aegon s operations in europe increased by 12 to eur 404 million this was the result of growth in all regions most notably in spain portugal driven by better underwriting results and expense savings furthermore earnings growth was supported by a higher investment margin in the netherlands from the shift to higher yielding assets lower funding costs for the bank and growth of the bank s balance sheet as well as growth of the digital solutions business in the united kingdom this was partly offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands aegon s underlying earnings in asia decreased by eur 3 million to eur 23 million driven by lower earnings from the joint venture in china as a result of investments in growth and lower earnings from the direct marketing business which is in run off underlying earnings before tax from aegon asset management were up by 3 to eur 69 million in the second half of 2018 this increase was a result of higher earnings in the americas and in europe driven by an increase in management fees and lower expenses which were partly offset by lower performance fees from aegon s chinese asset management joint venture aegon industrial fund management company aifmc the result from the holding declined by eur 17 million to a loss of eur 100 million as a result of interest expenses on usd 800 million tier 2 securities issued in april 2018 to replace perpetual securities interest expenses for these tier 2 securities are taken through the p l while the interest expenses for the perpetuals were recognized directly through equity net income net income declined to eur 253 million in the second half of 2018 and mainly reflects fair value losses as a result of market movements and an increase in other charges fair value items the loss from fair value items amounted to eur 257 million gains from fair value items in europe asia and at the holding totaled eur 281 million and mainly resulted from hedging gains in addition to real estate revaluations in the netherlands these were more than offset by losses in the united states of eur 538 million largely from underperformance of alternative investments and the impact of declining equity markets on reserve movements net of hedging the loss was higher than expected mainly due to lower than anticipated gains as a result of the lack of implied volatility movements during the equity market decline realized losses on investments realized losses on investments totaled eur 10 million as losses from the sale of us treasuries more than offset gains as a result of portfolio optimization in the united kingdom net impairments net impairments remained low at eur 19 million and were driven by the impairment of corporate bonds resulting from a bankruptcy filing in the us other charges other charges of eur 581 million were mainly driven by a provision related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and a book loss on the sale of life reinsurance business in the united states model assumption changes in the netherlands and restructuring expenses in the united kingdom and united states in the united states other charges of eur 310 million were largely the result of a provision of eur 147 million related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders a eur 94 million book loss on the divestment of the last remaining substantial block of life reinsurance transition and conversion charges of eur 27 million related to the tcs partnership and a eur 26 million addition to a provision for unclaimed property in january 2019 a court approved the aforementioned settlement with universal life policyholders over 99 of affected policyholders participated in the settlement while less than 1 of policyholders opted out of the settlement they represented approximately 43 of the value of the settlement fund the settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs although aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders in europe other charges of eur 230 million were caused by eur 138 million charges from updated mortality and lapse assumptions in the netherlands eur 35 million integration expenses for cofunds and blackrock s defined contribution business and eur 19 million transition and conversion charges related to the agreement with atos for administration services related to the existing business both in the united kingdom other charges at the holding amounted to eur 36 million and were driven by ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses for the group run off businesses the result from run off businesses amounted to a loss of eur 7 million which was in line with expectations following the divestment of the majority of the remainder of these businesses in 2017 income tax income tax amounted to a benefit of eur 117 million while income before tax amounted to eur 136 million the income tax included one time tax benefits of declining us and dutch corporate income tax rates of eur 84 million next to the regular tax exempt income items and tax credits the effective tax rate on underlying earnings declined from 26 in the second half of 2017 to 12 in the second half of 2018 reflecting the reduction of the nominal corporate tax rate in the united states from 35 to 21 the effective tax rate on underlying earnings is below the nominal tax rate as a result of tax exempt income and other tax benefits return on equity to align closer to definitions used by peers and rating agencies aegon has retrospectively changed its internal definition of adjusted shareholders equity used in calculating return on equity for the group return on capital for its units and the gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 shareholders equity will no longer be adjusted for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans all figures in this press release including comparatives are based on the new definition unless stated otherwise return on equity increased by 50 basis points compared with the same period last year to 10 2 in the second half of 2018 under the current definition under the previous definition return on equity would have been 9 3 lower underlying earnings were more than offset by a lower effective tax rate operating expenses operating expenses increased by 2 to eur 1 923 million as expense savings and the divestments of umg and aegon ireland were more than offset by investments in growth in banking and the service business in the netherlands the acquisition of robidus restructuring charges and ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses aegon achieved its target to deliver eur 350 million in annual run rate expense savings by year end 2018 as part of its plans to improve return on equity initiatives to reduce expenses have led to annual run rate expense savings of eur 355 million since the beginning of 2016 transamerica achieved expense savings of usd 270 million over the last three years which was below the usd 300 million target a significant contributor to these savings was the partnership entered into with tcs earlier in 2018 which generated approximately one third of the total benefit achieved however investments within retirement plans drove staffing levels and related expenses higher than planned in the second half of 2018 as transamerica aims to improve the workplace experience and positions the business to accelerate growth at a group level that was compensated by additional expense savings in dutch life and non life insurance entities digitization of the business automation of processes and efficiencies in the marketing and sales organization delivered eur 79 million run rate expense savings compared with the eur 50 million targeted for the netherlands expense savings at the holding totaled eur 19 million versus a target of eur 15 million the abovementioned run rate expense savings exclude the synergies from the cofunds integration which are expected to total gbp 60 million once completed and the anticipated gbp 30 million savings from the extension of the partnership with atos to administer the existing business in the united kingdom deposits and sales gross deposits decreased by 13 to eur 58 billion driven by lower deposits on the platform in the united kingdom and in asset management while the prior period included eur 6 billion of inflows from a single large mandate won by aegon s strategic partner la banque postale asset management lbpam gross deposits in the americas increased by eur 2 billion net outflows amounted to eur 8 5 billion for the second half mainly driven by outflows in the united states of eur 7 6 billion caused by contract discontinuances in retirement plans these were caused by a limited number of large contract losses new life sales declined by 7 to eur 398 million as a result of lower term life and indexed universal life sales in the united states and lower sales in the asian high net worth hnw businesses the latter was impacted by higher cost of premium financing for customers as short term interest rates rose new premium production for accident health insurance decreased by 69 to eur 95 million this was predominantly driven by lower sales in the travel insurance affinity and stop loss segments in the united states and resulted from the previously announced strategic decision to exit these segments new premium production for property casualty insurance increased by 15 to eur 60 million driven by higher sales in hungary market consistent value of new business market consistent value of new business mcvnb increased by 37 to eur 236 million driven by the americas and europe the increase in mcvnb in the americas mainly resulted from tax reform in europe mcvnb almost doubled driven by an enhanced sales mix in spain portugal and improved margins on pension products on the uk platform revenue generating investments revenue generating investments decreased by 2 during the second half of 2018 to eur 804 billion net outflows and the impact of unfavorable equity market movements more than offset the inclusion of eur 18 billion assets related to the acquisition of blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased by eur 0 9 billion to eur 19 5 billion on december 31 2018 primarily driven by a lower revaluation reserve as a result of widening credit spreads in the united states shareholders equity excluding revaluation reserves decreased by eur 0 4 billion to eur 16 1 billion or eur 7 84 per common share at the end of the second half 2018 this decrease was largely driven by the strengthening of the us dollar and net income which were more than offset by dividends paid to shareholders and the impact of adverse market movements on defined benefit obligations gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 aegon retrospectively changed the definition of shareholders equity used in calculating the gross financial leverage ratio the company will no longer adjust shareholders equity for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans to align its definition closer with those used by peers and rating agencies based on this more conservative calculation the gross financial leverage ratio decreased by 160 basis points to 29 2 in the second half of 2018 which is within the 26 30 target range this resulted from the redemption of eur 200 million grandfathered tier 1 securities in july 2018 and the maturity of eur 500 million senior debt in august 2018 under the previous definition the gross financial leverage ratio would have been 27 0 holding excess cash holding excess cash decreased from eur 1 923 million to eur 1 274 million during the second half of the year driven by eur 700 million leverage reduction the group received eur 786 million in remittances from subsidiaries of which eur 518 million from the united states eur 215 million from europe eur 21 million from asia and eur 29 million from asset management capital injections of eur 57 million in asset management central eastern europe spain portugal and asia were primarily related to investments in business growth the acquisition of robidus led to a cash outflow of eur 97 million furthermore eur 410 million cash was deployed for capital return to shareholders in the form of the cash portion of the interim 2018 dividend and the share buybacks to neutralize the final 2017 and interim 2018 stock dividends the remaining cash outflows of eur 171 million mainly related to holding funding and operating expenses capital generation capital generation of the operating units amounted to eur 39 million for the second half of 2018 adverse market movements totaled eur 1 040 million and favorable one time items eur 106 million bringing normalized capital generation to eur 973 million market impacts were mainly driven by the unfavorable equity market in the united states and the impact of adverse credit spread movements in the netherlands one time items were mainly driven by model assumption changes in the netherlands which more than offset the impact of tax changes in the netherlands and the acquisition of robidus in the netherlands in the united states several items including the adverse impact of us tax reform on required capital and the benefit from the elimination of a variable annuity captive largely offset each other solvency ii ratio aegon s solvency ii ratio decreased from 215 to 211 during the second half of 2018 as normalized capital generation favorable one time items and other items were more than offset by payment of the interim 2018 dividend adverse market impacts and the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom the estimated rbc ratio in the united states decreased to 465 on december 31 2018 from 490 on june 30 2018 this decrease was mainly driven by the unfavorable impact from markets which was partly driven by lower than expected gains from implied volatility movements during the equity market decline furthermore market movements included a negative impact of 10 points from equity market movements on transamerica advisors life insurance company talic which is planned to merge with transamerica life insurance company tlic in 2019 one time items largely offset each other and included the impact of us tax reform the elimination of a variable annuity captive the settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and the release of capital as a result of the previously announced strategic decision to exit the travel insurance affinity and stop loss insurance segments the estimated solvency ii ratio in the netherlands decreased to 181 on december 31 2018 from 190 on june 30 2018 the net positive impact of model assumption changes was offset by adverse market impacts and the impact of tax changes in the netherlands at the end of 2018 aegon updated its modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment to align with the guidance from the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa this model change results in a change in credit sensitivities and increased 1 in 10 year combined sensitivities for the netherlands and as a result the company is reviewing the target zones for aegon the netherlands aegon is considering increasing the mid point of the target zone by 5 points to 10 points the positive impact from a change in modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment more than offset other model assumption changes including changes to the assumptions regarding mortgages mortality rates and lapses for individual life policies for mortgages aegon changed a number of assumptions including reflecting changes to market conditions adverse market movements were the result of lower interest rates and the adverse impact of credit spread movements on the dynamic volatility adjustment before the aforementioned update to the model the estimated solvency ii ratio in the united kingdom decreased to 184 on december 31 2018 from 197 on june 30 2018 the decrease was mainly driven by the completion of the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business unfavorable interest rate movements and the effect from changes in the equity hedging program which led to an increase in required capital assumption changes were on balance positive mainly as a result of lower expected future expenses resulting from the extended partnership with atos for administration services related to the existing business as well as the favorable impact from mortality updates final 2018 dividend aegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to allow equity investors to share in aegon s performance which can grow over time if aegon s performance so allows at the annual general meeting of shareholders on may 17 2019 the supervisory board will in the absence of unforeseen circumstances propose a final dividend for 2018 of eur 0 15 per common share if approved and in combination with the interim dividend of eur 0 14 per share paid over the first half of 2018 aegon s

at the election of the shareholder the value of the stock dividend will be approximately equal to the cash dividend aegon intends to neutralize the dilutive effect of the final 2018 stock dividend on

portugal are separate operating segments which under ifrs 8 cannot be aggregated therefore further details will be provided for these operating segments in the europe section 2 new life sales is defined as new recurring premiums plus 1 10 of single premiums 3 the present value at point of sale of all cashflows for new business written during the reporting period calculated using approximate

capital generation reflects the sum of the return on free surplus earnings on in force business release of required surplus on in force business reduced by new business first year strain and required surplus on new business capital generation is defined as the capital generated in a local operating unit measured as the change in the local binding capital metric according to aegon s capital management policy for that period and after investments in new business capital generation is a non ifrs financial measure that should not be confused with cash flow from operations or any other cash flow measure calculated in accordance with ifrs management believes that capital generation provides meaningful information to investors regarding capital generated on a net basis by aegon s operating subsidiaries that may be available at the holding company because elements of capital generation are calculated in accordance with local solvency requirements rather than in accordance with any recognized body of accounting principles there is no ifrs financial measure that is directly comparable to capital generation 11b the calculation of the solvency ii capital surplus and ratio are based on solvency ii requirements for insurance entities in solvency ii equivalent regimes united states bermuda and brazil local regulatory solvency measurements are used specifically required capital for the regulated entities in the us is calculated as one and a half times 150 the upper end of the company action level range 200 of authorized control level as applied by the national association of insurance commissioners in the us while the own funds is calculated by applying a haircut to available capital under the local regulatory solvency measurement of one time 100 the upper end of the company action level range for entities in financial sectors other than the insurance sector the solvency requirements of the appropriate regulatory framework are taken into account in the group ratio the group ratio does not include aegon bank n v as the uk with profit funds is ring fenced no surplus is taken into account regarding the uk with profit funds for aegon uk and group numbers 12 the solvency ii ratio reflects aegon s interpretation of solvency ii requirements which is subject to supervisory review 13 the results in this release are unaudited disclaimers cautionary note regarding

investor conference aegon americas eliminates variable annuity captive leading to significant benefits to its capital position aegon extends partnership with atos in the uk for administration services aegon and banco santander expand their successful partnership in portugal seventh consecutive full year of external third party net inflows at aegon asset management aegon s strategy aegon s purpose to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security forms the basis of the company s strategy the central focus of the strategy is to further transform aegon from a product based to a customer needs driven company this means serving diverse and evolving needs across the customer life cycle being a trusted partner for financial solutions that are relevant simple rewarding and convenient and developing long term customer relationships by providing guidance and advice and identifying additional financial security needs at every stage of customers lives aegon is focused on reducing

businesses four key strategic objectives that enable the company to execute its strategy are embedded in all of aegon s businesses optimized portfolio operational excellence customer loyalty and empowered employees americas on december 6 2018 aegon hosted an analyst investor conference specifically focused on the us business during the conference the management team of aegon americas highlighted to analysts and investors how the organization is well positioned to capture market opportunities in the united states and detailed broad actions to accelerate organic growth these actions include improving the company s competitive position attracting new customers strengthening existing customer relationships and increasing customer retention as part of aegon s ongoing process to simplify the legal structure of its business aegon eliminated its variable annuity captive in the us in the second half of 2018 the rationale behind setting up the variable annuity captive in 2015 was the need to manage the volatility of the us rbc ratio as a consequence of misalignment between reserve movements and hedging within the existing variable annuity capital framework recently the national association of insurance commissioners naic proposed improvements to the existing variable annuity capital framework these reduce the non economic volatility of the rbc ratio and for this reason the use of a variable annuity captive was no longer required as a result of the merger of two legal entities aegon realized a one time benefit to capital generation of approximately usd 1 billion in the second half of 2018 this benefit was offset by the impact of tax reform on the rbc ratio in the second half of 2018 europe on september 11 2018 aegon closed the acquisition of robidus a leading dutch income protection service provider this transaction fits the company s strategic objective to grow its fee based businesses aegon acquired approximately 95 of the company with the remainder being retained by robidus management team robidus continues to operate on a standalone basis under its own brand name the acquisition was financed from holding excess cash in the united kingdom aegon s platform offering and omni channel distribution strategy have established aegon as the leading platform provider in the market with a personal and workplace pension investment and protection offering in the second half of 2018 assets across aegon uk s platform business reached gbp 128 billion the first half of 2018 saw the migration of two portfolios of the cofunds business by moving gbp 57 billion of institutional assets to aegon technology in march followed by gbp 28 billion of retail assets in may a program was established to address service issues associated with the retail migration core trading and service levels have now returned to target levels the focus now is to continually improve the platform further increasing functionality and ease of use the final phase of the cofunds integration will take place in the first half of 2019 with the migration of assets related to nationwide to date aegon has realized gbp 40 million annualized expense savings from integrating the cofunds business a figure which will rise to gbp 60 million following the nationwide integration the digitization of aegon s protection business in the united kingdom in the first half of 2018 has made it simpler and quicker for advisers to apply for cover for their clients and has led to a significant uptick in business with new protection customer numbers up 36 in 2018 compared with the previous year aegon announced on november 20 2018 that it had strengthened its existing partnership with atos signing a 15 year contract to service and administer its existing business non platform customers in the united kingdom the extension of the partnership will further improve customer service for 1 4 million customers since 2016 atos has successfully serviced and administered aegon s 500 000 protection customers in the uk and has an excellent understanding of aegon s business culture and ways of working the agreement to be effective as of mid 2019 is initially expected to lead to annual run rate expense savings for aegon of approximately gbp 10 million growing to approximately gbp 30 million over time total transition and conversion charges are estimated to amount to approximately gbp 130 million and are expected to be recorded over the first three years of the agreement consistent with aegon s strategic objective to optimize its portfolio and capital allocation across its businesses aegon has successfully completed the sale of its businesses in the czech republic and slovakia for eur 155 million on january 8 2019 this is a further step in rationalizing aegon s geographical footprint and focusing resources on aegon s key markets on december 21 2018 aegon expanded its partnership with banco santander in portugal the transaction with banco santander in portugal comprises the life and non life in force books owned by banco popular within the scope of the partnership and generated by the banco popular franchise as well as other channels mainly agents and brokers in addition it includes the life and non life new business within the scope of business of the partnership distributed through the former banco popular franchise which banco santander acquired in 2017 aegon has paid an upfront consideration for the expansion of the partnership in portugal of eur 14 million and will pay an additional amount of up to eur 6 million depending on the performance of the partnership asia in india aegon life launched a new guaranteed return insurance plan called pos grip point of sale guaranteed return insurance plan the product is in line with aegon s philosophy of launching simple easy to understand products pos grip provides dual benefits of protection and savings the benefit which a customer will receive at the end of the policy term is

and differentiated service serving as the smart personal assistant to agents aegon thtf has been increasing investments into digitalization in pursuit of its digital development strategy asset management growing external third party assets is an important element of the growth strategy of aegon asset management 2018 was the seventh consecutive full year of positive external third party net inflows this reflects aegon asset management s competitive performance together with management s ability to leverage scale and capabilities from the general account and third party affiliate businesses the continued strong commercial momentum in the netherlands was underlined by strong inflows into the dutch mortgage funds which grew to eur 16 billion of assets under management in the second half of 2018 operational highlights underlying earnings before tax aegon s underlying earnings before tax decreased by 8 compared with the second half of 2017 to eur 1 010 million expense savings in all regions and higher earnings in spain portugal the netherlands and the uk platform business from business growth and higher margins were more than offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands and lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience in the united states underlying earnings from the americas decreased by 16 to eur 614 million driven by lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience which more than offset expense savings the second half year of 2018 included eur 14 million unfavorable claims experience compared with eur 62 million favorable claims experience over the same period last year unfavorable mortality experience in life and retirement plans was partly offset by favorable claims experience in accident health retirement plans earnings decreased significantly which was mainly driven by lower fee income from lower asset balances a lower investment margin and investments in operations and technology underlying earnings before tax from aegon s operations in europe increased by 12 to eur 404 million this was the result of growth in all regions most notably in spain portugal driven by better underwriting results and expense savings furthermore earnings growth was supported by a higher investment margin in the netherlands from the shift to higher yielding assets lower funding costs for the bank and growth of the bank s balance sheet as well as growth of the digital solutions business in the united kingdom this was partly offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands aegon s underlying earnings in asia decreased by eur 3 million to eur 23 million driven by lower earnings from the joint venture in china as a result of investments in growth and lower earnings from the direct marketing business which is in run off underlying earnings before tax from aegon asset management were up by 3 to eur 69 million in the second half of 2018 this increase was a result of higher earnings in the americas and in europe driven by an increase in management fees and lower expenses which were partly offset by lower performance fees from aegon s chinese asset management joint venture aegon industrial fund management company aifmc the result from the holding declined by eur 17 million to a loss of eur 100 million as a result of interest expenses on usd 800 million tier 2 securities issued in april 2018 to replace perpetual securities interest expenses for these tier 2 securities are taken through the p l while the interest expenses for the perpetuals were recognized directly through equity net income net income declined to eur 253 million in the second half of 2018 and mainly reflects fair value losses as a result of market movements and an increase in other charges fair value items the loss from fair value items amounted to eur 257 million gains from fair value items in europe asia and at the holding totaled eur 281 million and mainly resulted from hedging gains in addition to real estate revaluations in the netherlands these were more than offset by losses in the united states of eur 538 million largely from underperformance of alternative investments and the impact of declining equity markets on reserve movements net of hedging the loss was higher than expected mainly due to lower than anticipated gains as a result of the lack of implied volatility movements during the equity market decline realized losses on investments realized losses on investments totaled eur 10 million as losses from the sale of us treasuries more than offset gains as a result of portfolio optimization in the united kingdom net impairments net impairments remained low at eur 19 million and were driven by the impairment of corporate bonds resulting from a bankruptcy filing in the us other charges other charges of eur 581 million were mainly driven by a provision related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and a book loss on the sale of life reinsurance business in the united states model assumption changes in the netherlands and restructuring expenses in the united kingdom and united states in the united states other charges of eur 310 million were largely the result of a provision of eur 147 million related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders a eur 94 million book loss on the divestment of the last remaining substantial block of life reinsurance transition and conversion charges of eur 27 million related to the tcs partnership and a eur 26 million addition to a provision for unclaimed property in january 2019 a court approved the aforementioned settlement with universal life policyholders over 99 of affected policyholders participated in the settlement while less than 1 of policyholders opted out of the settlement they represented approximately 43 of the value of the settlement fund the settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs although aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders in europe other charges of eur 230 million were caused by eur 138 million charges from updated mortality and lapse assumptions in the netherlands eur 35 million integration expenses for cofunds and blackrock s defined contribution business and eur 19 million transition and conversion charges related to the agreement with atos for administration services related to the existing business both in the united kingdom other charges at the holding amounted to eur 36 million and were driven by ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses for the group run off businesses the result from run off businesses amounted to a loss of eur 7 million which was in line with expectations following the divestment of the majority of the remainder of these businesses in 2017 income tax income tax amounted to a benefit of eur 117 million while income before tax amounted to eur 136 million the income tax included one time tax benefits of declining us and dutch corporate income tax rates of eur 84 million next to the regular tax exempt income items and tax credits the effective tax rate on underlying earnings declined from 26 in the second half of 2017 to 12 in the second half of 2018 reflecting the reduction of the nominal corporate tax rate in the united states from 35 to 21 the effective tax rate on underlying earnings is below the nominal tax rate as a result of tax exempt income and other tax benefits return on equity to align closer to definitions used by peers and rating agencies aegon has retrospectively changed its internal definition of adjusted shareholders equity used in calculating return on equity for the group return on capital for its units and the gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 shareholders equity will no longer be adjusted for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans all figures in this press release including comparatives are based on the new definition unless stated otherwise return on equity increased by 50 basis points compared with the same period last year to 10 2 in the second half of 2018 under the current definition under the previous definition return on equity would have been 9 3 lower underlying earnings were more than offset by a lower effective tax rate operating expenses operating expenses increased by 2 to eur 1 923 million as expense savings and the divestments of umg and aegon ireland were more than offset by investments in growth in banking and the service business in the netherlands the acquisition of robidus restructuring charges and ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses aegon achieved its target to deliver eur 350 million in annual run rate expense savings by year end 2018 as part of its plans to improve return on equity initiatives to reduce expenses have led to annual run rate expense savings of eur 355 million since the beginning of 2016 transamerica achieved expense savings of usd 270 million over the last three years which was below the usd 300 million target a significant contributor to these savings was the partnership entered into with tcs earlier in 2018 which generated approximately one third of the total benefit achieved however investments within retirement plans drove staffing levels and related expenses higher than planned in the second half of 2018 as transamerica aims to improve the workplace experience and positions the business to accelerate growth at a group level that was compensated by additional expense savings in dutch life and non life insurance entities digitization of the business automation of processes and efficiencies in the marketing and sales organization delivered eur 79 million run rate expense savings compared with the eur 50 million targeted for the netherlands expense savings at the holding totaled eur 19 million versus a target of eur 15 million the abovementioned run rate expense savings exclude the synergies from the cofunds integration which are expected to total gbp 60 million once completed and the anticipated gbp 30 million savings from the extension of the partnership with atos to administer the existing business in the united kingdom deposits and sales gross deposits decreased by 13 to eur 58 billion driven by lower deposits on the platform in the united kingdom and in asset management while the prior period included eur 6 billion of inflows from a single large mandate won by aegon s strategic partner la banque postale asset management lbpam gross deposits in the americas increased by eur 2 billion net outflows amounted to eur 8 5 billion for the second half mainly driven by outflows in the united states of eur 7 6 billion caused by contract discontinuances in retirement plans these were caused by a limited number of large contract losses new life sales declined by 7 to eur 398 million as a result of lower term life and indexed universal life sales in the united states and lower sales in the asian high net worth hnw businesses the latter was impacted by higher cost of premium financing for customers as short term interest rates rose new premium production for accident health insurance decreased by 69 to eur 95 million this was predominantly driven by lower sales in the travel insurance affinity and stop loss segments in the united states and resulted from the previously announced strategic decision to exit these segments new premium production for property casualty insurance increased by 15 to eur 60 million driven by higher sales in hungary market consistent value of new business market consistent value of new business mcvnb increased by 37 to eur 236 million driven by the americas and europe the increase in mcvnb in the americas mainly resulted from tax reform in europe mcvnb almost doubled driven by an enhanced sales mix in spain portugal and improved margins on pension products on the uk platform revenue generating investments revenue generating investments decreased by 2 during the second half of 2018 to eur 804 billion net outflows and the impact of unfavorable equity market movements more than offset the inclusion of eur 18 billion assets related to the acquisition of blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased by eur 0 9 billion to eur 19 5 billion on december 31 2018 primarily driven by a lower revaluation reserve as a result of widening credit spreads in the united states shareholders equity excluding revaluation reserves decreased by eur 0 4 billion to eur 16 1 billion or eur 7 84 per common share at the end of the second half 2018 this decrease was largely driven by the strengthening of the us dollar and net income which were more than offset by dividends paid to shareholders and the impact of adverse market movements on defined benefit obligations gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 aegon retrospectively changed the definition of shareholders equity used in calculating the gross financial leverage ratio the company will no longer adjust shareholders equity for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans to align its definition closer with those used by peers and rating agencies based on this more conservative calculation the gross financial leverage ratio decreased by 160 basis points to 29 2 in the second half of 2018 which is within the 26 30 target range this resulted from the redemption of eur 200 million grandfathered tier 1 securities in july 2018 and the maturity of eur 500 million senior debt in august 2018 under the previous definition the gross financial leverage ratio would have been 27 0 holding excess cash holding excess cash decreased from eur 1 923 million to eur 1 274 million during the second half of the year driven by eur 700 million leverage reduction the group received eur 786 million in remittances from subsidiaries of which eur 518 million from the united states eur 215 million from europe eur 21 million from asia and eur 29 million from asset management capital injections of eur 57 million in asset management central eastern europe spain portugal and asia were primarily related to investments in business growth the acquisition of robidus led to a cash outflow of eur 97 million furthermore eur 410 million cash was deployed for capital return to shareholders in the form of the cash portion of the interim 2018 dividend and the share buybacks to neutralize the final 2017 and interim 2018 stock dividends the remaining cash outflows of eur 171 million mainly related to holding funding and operating expenses capital generation capital generation of the operating units amounted to eur 39 million for the second half of 2018 adverse market movements totaled eur 1 040 million and favorable one time items eur 106 million bringing normalized capital generation to eur 973 million market impacts were mainly driven by the unfavorable equity market in the united states and the impact of adverse credit spread movements in the netherlands one time items were mainly driven by model assumption changes in the netherlands which more than offset the impact of tax changes in the netherlands and the acquisition of robidus in the netherlands in the united states several items including the adverse impact of us tax reform on required capital and the benefit from the elimination of a variable annuity captive largely offset each other solvency ii ratio aegon s solvency ii ratio decreased from 215 to 211 during the second half of 2018 as normalized capital generation favorable one time items and other items were more than offset by payment of the interim 2018 dividend adverse market impacts and the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom the estimated rbc ratio in the united states decreased to 465 on december 31 2018 from 490 on june 30 2018 this decrease was mainly driven by the unfavorable impact from markets which was partly driven by lower than expected gains from implied volatility movements during the equity market decline furthermore market movements included a negative impact of 10 points from equity market movements on transamerica advisors life insurance company talic which is planned to merge with transamerica life insurance company tlic in 2019 one time items largely offset each other and included the impact of us tax reform the elimination of a variable annuity captive the settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and the release of capital as a result of the previously announced strategic decision to exit the travel insurance affinity and stop loss insurance segments the estimated solvency ii ratio in the netherlands decreased to 181 on december 31 2018 from 190 on june 30 2018 the net positive impact of model assumption changes was offset by adverse market impacts and the impact of tax changes in the netherlands at the end of 2018 aegon updated its modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment to align with the guidance from the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa this model change results in a change in credit sensitivities and increased 1 in 10 year combined sensitivities for the netherlands and as a result the company is reviewing the target zones for aegon the netherlands aegon is considering increasing the mid point of the target zone by 5 points to 10 points the positive impact from a change in modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment more than offset other model assumption changes including changes to the assumptions regarding mortgages mortality rates and lapses for individual life policies for mortgages aegon changed a number of assumptions including reflecting changes to market conditions adverse market movements were the result of lower interest rates and the adverse impact of credit spread movements on the dynamic volatility adjustment before the aforementioned update to the model the estimated solvency ii ratio in the united kingdom decreased to 184 on december 31 2018 from 197 on june 30 2018 the decrease was mainly driven by the completion of the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business unfavorable interest rate movements and the effect from changes in the equity hedging program which led to an increase in required capital assumption changes were on balance positive mainly as a result of lower expected future expenses resulting from the extended partnership with atos for administration services related to the existing business as well as the favorable impact from mortality updates final 2018 dividend aegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to allow equity investors to share in aegon s performance which can grow over time if aegon s performance so allows at the annual general meeting of shareholders on may 17 2019 the supervisory board will in the absence of unforeseen

meaningful information about the underlying results of aegon s business including insight into the financial measures that aegon s senior management uses in managing the business among other things aegon s senior management is compensated based in part on aegon s results against targets using the non ifrs measures presented here while other insurers in aegon s peer group present substantially similar non ifrs measures the non ifrs measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the non ifrs measures presented by other insurers there is no standardized meaning to these measures under ifrs or any other recognized set of accounting standards readers are cautioned to consider carefully the different ways in which aegon and its peers present similar information before comparing them aegon believes the non ifrs measures shown herein when read together with aegon s reported ifrs financial statements provide meaningful supplemental information for the investing public to evaluate aegon s business after eliminating the impact of current ifrs accounting policies for financial instruments and insurance contracts which embed a number of accounting policy alternatives that companies may select in presenting their results i e companies can use different local gaaps to measure the insurance contract liability and that can make the comparability from period to period difficult for a definition of underlying earnings and the reconciliation from underlying earnings before tax to income before tax being the most comparable ifrs measure reference is made to note 3 segment information of aegon s condensed consolidated interim financial statements aegon segment reporting is based on the businesses as presented in internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the executive board which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker for europe the underlying businesses the netherlands united kingdom including va europe central eastern europe and spain portugal are separate operating segments which under ifrs 8 cannot be aggregated therefore further details will be provided for these operating segments in the europe section 2 new life sales is defined as new recurring premiums plus 1 10 of single premiums 3 the present value at point of sale of all cashflows for new business written during the reporting period calculated using approximate

risk free rates swap curves with the exception of an allowance for liquidity premium the swap curve is extrapolated beyond the last liquid point to an ultimate forward rate the market consistent value of new business is calculated on a post tax basis after allowing for the time value financial options and guarantees a market value margin for non hedgeable non financial risks and the costs of non

capital generation reflects the sum of the return on free surplus earnings on in force business release of required surplus on in force business reduced by new business first year strain and required surplus on new business capital generation is defined as the capital generated in a local operating unit measured as the change in the local binding capital metric according to aegon s capital management policy for that period and after investments in new business capital generation is a non ifrs financial measure that should not be confused with cash flow from operations or any other cash flow measure calculated in accordance with ifrs management believes that capital generation provides meaningful information to investors regarding capital generated on a net basis by aegon s operating subsidiaries that may be available at the holding company because elements of capital generation are calculated in accordance with local solvency requirements rather than in accordance with any recognized body of accounting principles there is no ifrs financial measure that is directly comparable to capital generation 11b the calculation of the solvency ii capital surplus and ratio are based on solvency ii requirements for insurance entities in solvency ii equivalent regimes united states bermuda and brazil local regulatory solvency measurements are used specifically required capital for the regulated entities in the us is calculated as one and a half times 150 the upper end of the company action level range 200 of authorized control level as applied by the national association of insurance commissioners in the us while the own funds is calculated by applying a haircut to available capital under the local regulatory solvency measurement of one time 100 the upper end of the company action level range for entities in financial sectors other than the insurance sector the solvency requirements of the appropriate regulatory framework are taken into account in the group ratio the group ratio does not include aegon bank n v as the uk with profit funds is ring fenced no surplus is taken into account regarding the uk with profit funds for aegon uk and group numbers 12 the solvency ii ratio reflects aegon s interpretation of solvency ii requirements which is subject to supervisory review 13 the results in this release are unaudited disclaimers cautionary note regarding

the hague netherlands business wire regulatory news net income declines to eur 253 million reflecting unfavorable market movements and other charges underlying earnings decrease by 8 to eur 1 010 million as lower retirement plans earnings in the us more than offset business growth and higher margins in europe and expense savings fair value losses of eur 257 million mainly driven by unfavorable market movements in the us which are partly offset by positive real estate revaluations and hedging gains in the netherlands and the uk other charges of eur 581 million mostly due to the previously announced legal settlement in the us and book loss on the divestment of the last block of us life reinsurance business as well as model assumption changes in the netherlands and restructuring expenses

points to 29 2 in the second half year 2018 following eur 700 million deleveraging and based on a more conservative internal definition of adjusted shareholders equity statement of alex wynaendts ceo the second half of 2018 was challenging as we experienced a significant decline in the markets towards the end of the year this impacted the value of our customers investments and thereby the results of our administration and services businesses we have broad initiatives in place to provide additional value added services and drive sales growth in order to increase these results net income was also affected by previously announced transactions such as the divestment of the last block of life reinsurance in the united states at the same time we continue to simplify the organization

loyalty and empowered employees americas on december 6 2018 aegon hosted an analyst investor conference specifically focused on the us business during the conference the management team of aegon americas highlighted to analysts and investors how the organization is well positioned to capture market opportunities in the united states and detailed broad actions to accelerate organic growth these actions include improving the company s competitive position attracting new customers strengthening existing customer relationships and increasing customer retention as part of aegon s ongoing process to simplify the legal structure of its business aegon eliminated its variable annuity captive in the us in the second half of 2018 the rationale behind setting up the variable annuity captive in 2015 was the need to manage the volatility of the us rbc ratio as a consequence of misalignment between reserve movements and hedging within the existing variable annuity capital framework recently the national association of insurance commissioners naic proposed improvements to the existing variable annuity capital framework these reduce the non economic volatility of the rbc ratio and for this reason the use of a variable annuity captive was no longer required as a result of the merger of two legal entities aegon realized a one time benefit to capital generation of approximately usd 1 billion in the second half of 2018 this benefit was offset by the impact of tax reform on the rbc ratio in the second half of 2018 europe on september 11 2018 aegon closed the acquisition of robidus a leading dutch income protection service provider this transaction fits the company s strategic objective to grow its fee based businesses aegon acquired approximately 95 of the company with the remainder being retained by robidus management team robidus continues to operate on a standalone basis under its own brand name the acquisition was financed from holding excess cash in the united kingdom aegon s platform offering and omni channel distribution strategy have established aegon as the leading platform provider in the market with a personal and workplace pension investment and protection offering in the second half of 2018 assets across aegon uk s platform business reached gbp 128 billion the first half of 2018 saw the migration of two portfolios of the cofunds business by moving gbp 57 billion of institutional assets to aegon technology in march followed by gbp 28 billion of retail assets in may a program was established to address service issues associated with the retail migration core trading and service levels have now returned to target levels the focus now is to continually improve the platform further increasing functionality and ease of use the final phase of the cofunds integration will take place in the first half of 2019 with the migration of assets related to nationwide to date aegon has realized gbp 40 million annualized expense savings from integrating the cofunds business a figure which will rise to gbp 60 million following the nationwide integration the digitization of aegon s protection business in the united kingdom in the first half of 2018 has made it simpler and quicker for advisers to apply for cover for their clients and has led to a significant uptick in business with new protection customer numbers up 36 in 2018 compared with the previous year aegon announced on november 20 2018 that it had strengthened its existing partnership with atos signing a 15 year contract to service and administer its existing business non platform customers in the united kingdom the extension of the partnership will further improve customer service for 1 4 million customers since 2016 atos has successfully serviced and administered aegon s 500 000 protection customers in the uk and has an excellent understanding of aegon s business culture and ways of working the agreement to be effective as of mid 2019 is initially expected to lead to annual run rate expense savings for aegon of approximately gbp 10 million growing to approximately gbp 30 million over time total transition and conversion charges are estimated to amount to approximately gbp 130 million and are expected to be recorded over the first three years of the agreement consistent with aegon s strategic objective to optimize its portfolio and capital allocation across its businesses aegon has successfully completed the sale of its businesses in the czech republic and slovakia for eur 155 million on january 8 2019 this is a further step in rationalizing aegon s geographical footprint and focusing resources on aegon s key markets on december 21 2018 aegon expanded its partnership with banco santander in portugal the transaction with banco santander in portugal comprises the life and non life in force books owned by banco popular within the scope of the partnership and generated by the banco popular franchise as well as other channels mainly agents and brokers in addition it includes the life and non life new business within the scope of business of the partnership distributed through the former banco popular franchise which banco santander acquired in 2017 aegon has paid an upfront consideration for the expansion of the partnership in portugal of eur 14 million and will pay an additional amount of up to eur 6 million depending on the performance of the partnership asia in india aegon life launched a new guaranteed return insurance plan called pos grip point of sale guaranteed return insurance plan the product is in line with aegon s philosophy of launching simple easy to understand products pos grip provides dual benefits of protection and savings the benefit which a customer will receive at the end of the policy term is guaranteed and is stated up front when buying the policy the guaranteed additions accrue at the end of every year throughout the policy term and include a one off loyalty booster payable at the end of the policy term in china aegon thtf launched an upgrade of its award winning platform for agents that was unveiled in october last year the platform features professional marketing smart recruitment and differentiated service serving as the smart personal assistant to agents aegon thtf has been increasing investments into digitalization in pursuit of its digital development strategy asset management growing external third party assets is an important element of the growth strategy of aegon asset management 2018 was the seventh consecutive full year of positive external third party net inflows this reflects aegon asset management s competitive performance together with management s ability to leverage scale and capabilities from the general account and third party affiliate businesses the continued strong commercial momentum in the netherlands was underlined by strong inflows into the dutch mortgage funds which grew to eur 16 billion of assets under management in the second half of 2018 operational highlights underlying earnings before tax aegon s underlying earnings before tax decreased by 8 compared with the second half of 2017 to eur 1 010 million expense savings in all regions and higher earnings in spain portugal the netherlands and the uk platform business from business growth and higher margins were more than offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands and lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience in the united states underlying earnings from the americas decreased by 16 to eur 614 million driven by lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience which more than offset expense savings the second half year of 2018 included eur 14 million unfavorable claims experience compared with eur 62 million favorable claims experience over the same period last year unfavorable mortality experience in life and retirement plans was partly offset by favorable claims experience in accident health retirement plans earnings decreased significantly which was mainly driven by lower fee income from lower asset balances a lower investment margin and investments in operations and technology underlying earnings before tax from aegon s operations in europe increased by 12 to eur 404 million this was the result of growth in all regions most notably in spain portugal driven by better underwriting results and expense savings furthermore earnings growth was supported by a higher investment margin in the netherlands from the shift to higher yielding assets lower funding costs for the bank and growth of the bank s balance sheet as well as growth of the digital solutions business in the united kingdom this was partly offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands aegon s underlying earnings in asia decreased by eur 3 million to eur 23 million driven by lower earnings from the joint venture in china as a result of investments in growth and lower earnings from the direct marketing business which is in run off underlying earnings before tax from aegon asset management were up by 3 to eur 69 million in the second half of 2018 this increase was a result of higher earnings in the americas and in europe driven by an increase in management fees and lower expenses which were partly offset by lower performance fees from aegon s chinese asset management joint venture aegon industrial fund management company aifmc the result from the holding declined by eur 17 million to a loss of eur 100 million as a result of interest expenses on usd 800 million tier 2 securities issued in april 2018 to replace perpetual securities interest expenses for these tier 2 securities are taken through the p l while the interest expenses for the perpetuals were recognized directly through equity net income net income declined to eur 253 million in the second half of 2018 and mainly reflects fair value losses as a result of market movements and an increase in other charges fair value items the loss from fair value items amounted to eur 257 million gains from fair value items in europe asia and at the holding totaled eur 281 million and mainly resulted from hedging gains in addition to real estate revaluations in the netherlands these were more than offset by losses in the united states of eur 538 million largely from underperformance of alternative investments and the impact of declining equity markets on reserve movements net of hedging the loss was higher than expected mainly due to lower than anticipated gains as a result of the lack of implied volatility movements during the equity market decline realized losses on investments realized losses on investments totaled eur 10 million as losses from the sale of us treasuries more than offset gains as a result of portfolio optimization in the united kingdom net impairments net impairments remained low at eur 19 million and were driven by the impairment of corporate bonds resulting from a bankruptcy filing in the us other charges other charges of eur 581 million were mainly driven by a provision related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and a book loss on the sale of life reinsurance business in the united states model assumption changes in the netherlands and restructuring expenses in the united kingdom and united states in the united states other charges of eur 310 million were largely the result of a provision of eur 147 million related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders a eur 94 million book loss on the divestment of the last remaining substantial block of life reinsurance transition and conversion charges of eur 27 million related to the tcs partnership and a eur 26 million addition to a provision for unclaimed property in january 2019 a court approved the aforementioned settlement with universal life policyholders over 99 of affected policyholders participated in the settlement while less than 1 of policyholders opted out of the settlement they represented approximately 43 of the value of the settlement fund the settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs although aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders in europe other charges of eur 230 million were caused by eur 138 million charges from updated mortality and lapse assumptions in the netherlands eur 35 million integration expenses for cofunds and blackrock s defined contribution business and eur 19 million transition and conversion charges related to the agreement with atos for administration services related to the existing business both in the united kingdom other charges at the holding amounted to eur 36 million and were driven by ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses for the group run off businesses the result from run off businesses amounted to a loss of eur 7 million which was in line with expectations following the divestment of the majority of the remainder of these businesses in 2017 income tax income tax amounted to a benefit of eur 117 million while income before tax amounted to eur 136 million the income tax included one time tax benefits of declining us and dutch corporate income tax rates of eur 84 million next to the regular tax exempt income items and tax credits the effective tax rate on underlying earnings declined from 26 in the second half of 2017 to 12 in the second half of 2018 reflecting the reduction of the nominal corporate tax rate in the united states from 35 to 21 the effective tax rate on underlying earnings is below the nominal tax rate as a result of tax exempt income and other tax benefits return on equity to align closer to definitions used by peers and rating agencies aegon has retrospectively changed its internal definition of adjusted shareholders equity used in calculating return on equity for the group return on capital for its units and the gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 shareholders equity will no longer be adjusted for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans all figures in this press release including comparatives are based on the new definition unless stated otherwise return on equity increased by 50 basis points compared with the same period last year to 10 2 in the second half of 2018 under the current definition under the previous definition return on equity would have been 9 3 lower underlying earnings were more than offset by a lower effective tax rate operating expenses operating expenses increased by 2 to eur 1 923 million as expense savings and the divestments of umg and aegon ireland were more than offset by investments in growth in banking and the service business in the netherlands the acquisition of robidus restructuring charges and ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses aegon achieved its target to deliver eur 350 million in annual run rate expense savings by year end 2018 as part of its plans to improve return on equity initiatives to reduce expenses have led to annual run rate expense savings of eur 355 million since the beginning of 2016 transamerica achieved expense savings of usd 270 million over the last three years which was below the usd 300 million target a significant contributor to these savings was the partnership entered into with tcs earlier in 2018 which generated approximately one third of the total benefit achieved however investments within retirement plans drove staffing levels and related expenses higher than planned in the second half of 2018 as transamerica aims to improve the workplace experience and positions the business to accelerate growth at a group level that was compensated by additional expense savings in dutch life and non life insurance entities digitization of the business automation of processes and efficiencies in the marketing and sales organization delivered eur 79 million run rate expense savings compared with the eur 50 million targeted for the netherlands expense savings at the holding totaled eur 19 million versus a target of eur 15 million the abovementioned run rate expense savings exclude the synergies from the cofunds integration which are expected to total gbp 60 million once completed and the anticipated gbp 30 million savings from the extension of the partnership with atos to administer the existing business in the united kingdom deposits and sales gross deposits decreased by 13 to eur 58 billion driven by lower deposits on the platform in the united kingdom and in asset management while the prior period included eur 6 billion of inflows from a single large mandate won by aegon s strategic partner la banque postale asset management lbpam gross deposits in the americas increased by eur 2 billion net outflows amounted to eur 8 5 billion for the second half mainly driven by outflows in the united states of eur 7 6 billion caused by contract discontinuances in retirement plans these were caused by a limited number of large contract losses new life sales declined by 7 to eur 398 million as a result of lower term life and indexed universal life sales in the united states and lower sales in the asian high net worth hnw businesses the latter was impacted by higher cost of premium financing for customers as short term interest rates rose new premium production for accident health insurance decreased by 69 to eur 95 million this was predominantly driven by lower sales in the travel insurance affinity and stop loss segments in the united states and resulted from the previously announced strategic decision to exit these segments new premium production for property casualty insurance increased by 15 to eur 60 million driven by higher sales in hungary market consistent value of new business market consistent value of new business mcvnb increased by 37 to eur 236 million driven by the americas and europe the increase in mcvnb in the americas mainly resulted from tax reform in europe mcvnb almost doubled driven by an enhanced sales mix in spain portugal and improved margins on pension products on the uk platform revenue generating investments revenue generating investments decreased by 2 during the second half of 2018 to eur 804 billion net outflows and the impact of unfavorable equity market movements more than offset the inclusion of eur 18 billion assets related to the acquisition of blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased by eur 0 9 billion to eur 19 5 billion on december 31 2018 primarily driven by a lower revaluation reserve as a result of widening credit spreads in the united states shareholders equity excluding revaluation reserves decreased by eur 0 4 billion to eur 16 1 billion or eur 7 84 per common share at the end of the second half 2018 this decrease was largely driven by the strengthening of the us dollar and net income which were more than offset by dividends paid to shareholders and the impact of adverse market movements on defined benefit obligations gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 aegon retrospectively changed the definition of shareholders equity used in calculating the gross financial leverage ratio the company will no longer adjust shareholders equity for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans to align its definition closer with those used by peers and rating agencies based on this more conservative calculation the gross financial leverage ratio decreased by 160 basis points to 29 2 in the second half of 2018 which is within the 26 30 target range this resulted from the redemption of eur 200 million grandfathered tier 1 securities in july 2018 and the maturity of eur 500 million senior debt in august 2018 under the previous definition the gross financial leverage ratio would have been 27 0 holding excess cash holding excess cash decreased from eur 1 923 million to eur 1 274 million during the second half of the year driven by eur 700 million leverage reduction the group received eur 786 million in remittances from subsidiaries of which eur 518 million from the united states eur 215 million from europe eur 21 million from asia and eur 29 million from asset management capital injections of eur 57 million in asset management central eastern europe spain portugal and asia were primarily related to investments in business growth the acquisition of robidus led to a cash outflow of eur 97 million furthermore eur 410 million cash was deployed for capital return to shareholders in the form of the cash portion of the interim 2018 dividend and the share buybacks to neutralize the final 2017 and interim 2018 stock dividends the remaining cash outflows of eur 171 million mainly related to holding funding and operating expenses capital generation capital generation of the operating units amounted to eur 39 million for the second half of 2018 adverse market movements totaled eur 1 040 million and favorable one time items eur 106 million bringing normalized capital generation to eur 973 million market impacts were mainly driven by the unfavorable equity market in the united states and the impact of adverse credit spread movements in the netherlands one time items were mainly driven by model assumption changes in the netherlands which more than offset the impact of tax changes in the netherlands and the acquisition of robidus in the netherlands in the united states several items including the adverse impact of us tax reform on required capital and the benefit from the elimination of a variable annuity captive largely offset each other solvency ii ratio aegon s solvency ii ratio decreased from 215 to 211 during the second half of 2018 as normalized capital generation favorable one time items and other items were more than offset by payment of the interim 2018 dividend adverse market impacts and the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom the estimated rbc ratio in the united states decreased to 465 on december 31 2018 from 490 on june 30 2018 this decrease was mainly driven by the unfavorable impact from markets which was partly driven by lower than expected gains from implied volatility movements during the equity market decline furthermore market movements included a negative impact of 10 points from equity market movements on transamerica advisors life insurance company talic which is planned to merge with transamerica life insurance company tlic in 2019 one time items largely offset each other and included the impact of us tax reform the elimination of a variable annuity captive the settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and the release of capital as a result of the previously announced strategic decision to exit the travel insurance affinity and stop loss insurance segments the estimated solvency ii ratio in the netherlands decreased to 181 on december 31 2018 from 190 on june 30 2018 the net positive impact of model assumption changes was offset by adverse market impacts and the impact of tax changes in the netherlands at the end of 2018 aegon updated its modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment to align with the guidance from the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa this model change results in a change in credit sensitivities and increased 1 in 10 year combined sensitivities for the netherlands and as a result the company is reviewing the target zones for aegon the netherlands aegon is considering increasing the mid point of the target zone by 5 points to 10 points the positive impact from a change in modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment more than offset other model assumption changes including changes to the assumptions regarding mortgages mortality rates and lapses for individual life policies for mortgages aegon changed a number of assumptions including reflecting changes to market conditions adverse market movements were the result of lower interest rates and the adverse impact of credit spread movements on the dynamic volatility adjustment before the aforementioned update to the model the estimated solvency ii ratio in the united kingdom decreased to 184 on december 31 2018 from 197 on june 30 2018 the decrease was mainly driven by the completion of the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business unfavorable interest rate movements and the effect from changes in the equity hedging program which led to an increase in required capital assumption changes were on balance positive mainly as a result of lower expected future expenses resulting from the extended partnership with atos for administration services related to the existing business as well as the favorable impact from mortality updates final 2018 dividend aegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to allow equity investors to share in aegon s performance which can grow over time if aegon s performance so allows at the annual general meeting of shareholders on may 17 2019 the supervisory board will in the absence of unforeseen circumstances propose a final dividend for 2018 of eur 0 15 per common share if approved and in combination with the interim dividend of eur 0 14 per share paid over the first half of 2018 aegon s

at the election of the shareholder the value of the stock dividend will be approximately equal to the cash dividend aegon intends to neutralize the dilutive effect of the final 2018 stock dividend on

commissions and expenses operating expenses income tax including joint ventures jv s and associated companies income before tax including jv s and associated companies and market consistent value of new business are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis the revenues and expenses of aegon s joint ventures and aegon s associates aegon believes that these non ifrs measures provide meaningful information about the underlying results of aegon s business including insight into the financial measures that aegon s senior management uses in managing the business among other things aegon s senior management is compensated based in part on aegon s results against targets using the non ifrs measures presented here while other insurers in aegon s peer group present substantially similar non ifrs measures the non ifrs measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the non ifrs measures presented by other insurers there is no standardized meaning to these measures under ifrs or any other recognized set of accounting standards readers are cautioned to consider carefully the different ways in which aegon and its peers present similar information before comparing them aegon believes the non ifrs measures shown herein when read together with aegon s reported ifrs financial statements provide meaningful supplemental information for the investing public to evaluate aegon s business after eliminating the impact of current ifrs accounting policies for financial instruments and insurance contracts which embed a number of accounting policy alternatives that companies may select in presenting their results i e companies can use different local gaaps to measure the insurance contract liability and that can make the comparability from period to period difficult for a definition of underlying earnings and the reconciliation from underlying earnings before tax to income before tax being the most comparable ifrs measure reference is made to note 3

portugal are separate operating segments which under ifrs 8 cannot be aggregated therefore further details will be provided for these operating segments in the europe section 2 new life sales is defined as new recurring premiums plus 1 10 of single premiums 3 the present value at point of sale of all cashflows for new business written during the reporting period calculated using approximate

capital generation reflects the sum of the return on free surplus earnings on in force business release of required surplus on in force business reduced by new business first year strain and required surplus on new business capital generation is defined as the capital generated in a local operating unit measured as the change in the local binding capital metric according to aegon s capital management policy for that period and after investments in new business capital generation is a non ifrs financial measure that should not be confused with cash flow from operations or any other cash flow measure calculated in accordance with ifrs management believes that capital generation provides meaningful information to investors regarding capital generated on a net basis by aegon s operating subsidiaries that may be available at the holding company because elements of capital generation are calculated in accordance with local solvency requirements rather than in accordance with any recognized body of accounting principles there is no ifrs financial measure that is directly comparable to capital generation 11b the calculation of the solvency ii capital surplus and ratio are based on solvency ii requirements for insurance entities in solvency ii equivalent regimes united states bermuda and brazil local regulatory solvency measurements are used specifically required capital for the regulated entities in the us is calculated as one and a half times 150 the upper end of the company action level range 200 of authorized control level as applied by the national association of insurance commissioners in the us while the own funds is calculated by applying a haircut to available capital under the local regulatory solvency measurement of one time 100 the upper end of the company action level range for entities in financial sectors other than the insurance sector the solvency requirements of the appropriate regulatory framework are taken into account in the group ratio the group ratio does not include aegon bank n v as the uk with profit funds is ring fenced no surplus is taken into account regarding the uk with profit funds for aegon uk and group numbers 12 the solvency ii ratio reflects aegon s interpretation of solvency ii requirements which is subject to supervisory review 13 the results in this release are unaudited disclaimers cautionary note regarding

in the us which are partly offset by positive real estate revaluations and hedging gains in the netherlands and the uk other charges of eur 581 million mostly due to the previously announced legal settlement in the us and book loss on the divestment of the last block of us life reinsurance business as well as model assumption changes in the netherlands and restructuring expenses return on

administration and services businesses we have broad initiatives in place to provide additional value added services and drive sales growth in order to increase these results net income was also affected by previously announced transactions such as the divestment of the last block of life reinsurance in the united states at the same time we continue to simplify the organization strengthen

for administration services aegon and banco santander expand their successful partnership in portugal seventh consecutive full year of external third party net inflows at aegon asset management aegon s strategy aegon s purpose to help people achieve a lifetime of financial security forms the basis of the company s strategy the central focus of the strategy is to further transform aegon from a

loyalty and empowered employees americas on december 6 2018 aegon hosted an analyst investor conference specifically focused on the us business during the conference the management team of aegon americas highlighted to analysts and investors how the organization is well positioned to capture market opportunities in the united states and detailed broad actions to accelerate organic growth these actions include improving the company s competitive position attracting new customers strengthening existing customer relationships and increasing customer retention as part of aegon s ongoing process to simplify the legal structure of its business aegon eliminated its variable annuity captive in the us in the second half of 2018 the rationale behind setting up the variable annuity captive in 2015 was the need to manage the volatility of the us rbc ratio as a consequence of misalignment between reserve movements and hedging within the existing variable annuity capital framework recently the national association of insurance commissioners naic proposed improvements to the existing variable annuity capital framework these reduce the non economic volatility of the rbc ratio and for this reason the use of a variable annuity captive was no longer required as a result of the merger of two legal entities aegon realized a one time benefit to capital generation of approximately usd 1 billion in the second half of 2018 this benefit was offset by the impact of tax reform on the rbc ratio in the second half of 2018 europe on september 11 2018 aegon closed the acquisition of robidus a leading dutch income protection service provider this transaction fits the company s strategic objective to grow its fee based businesses aegon acquired approximately 95 of the company with the remainder being retained by robidus management team robidus continues to operate on a standalone basis under its own brand name the acquisition was financed from holding excess cash in the united kingdom aegon s platform offering and omni channel distribution strategy have established aegon as the leading platform provider in the market with a personal and workplace pension investment and protection offering in the second half of 2018 assets across aegon uk s platform business reached gbp 128 billion the first half of 2018 saw the migration of two portfolios of the cofunds business by moving gbp 57 billion of institutional assets to aegon technology in march followed by gbp 28 billion of retail assets in may a program was established to address service issues associated with the retail migration core trading and service levels have now returned to target levels the focus now is to continually improve the platform further increasing functionality and ease of use the final phase of the cofunds integration will take place in the first half of 2019 with the migration of assets related to nationwide to date aegon has realized gbp 40 million annualized expense savings from integrating the cofunds business a figure which will rise to gbp 60 million following the nationwide integration the digitization of aegon s protection business in the united kingdom in the first half of 2018 has made it simpler and quicker for advisers to apply for cover for their clients and has led to a significant uptick in business with new protection customer numbers up 36 in 2018 compared with the previous year aegon announced on november 20 2018 that it had strengthened its existing partnership with atos signing a 15 year contract to service and administer its existing business non platform customers in the united kingdom the extension of the partnership will further improve customer service for 1 4 million customers since 2016 atos has successfully serviced and administered aegon s 500 000 protection customers in the uk and has an excellent understanding of aegon s business culture and ways of working the agreement to be effective as of mid 2019 is initially expected to lead to annual run rate expense savings for aegon of approximately gbp 10 million growing to approximately gbp 30 million over time total transition and conversion charges are estimated to amount to approximately gbp 130 million and are expected to be recorded over the first three years of the agreement consistent with aegon s strategic objective to optimize its portfolio and capital allocation across its businesses aegon has successfully completed the sale of its businesses in the czech republic and slovakia for eur 155 million on january 8 2019 this is a further step in rationalizing aegon

portugal comprises the life and non life in force books owned by banco popular within the scope of the partnership and generated by the banco popular franchise as well as other channels mainly agents

and differentiated service serving as the smart personal assistant to agents aegon thtf has been increasing investments into digitalization in pursuit of its digital development strategy asset management growing external third party assets is an important element of the growth strategy of aegon asset management 2018 was the seventh consecutive full year of positive external third party net inflows this reflects aegon asset management s competitive performance together with management s ability to leverage scale and capabilities from the general account and third party affiliate businesses the continued strong commercial momentum in the netherlands was underlined by strong inflows into the dutch mortgage funds which grew to eur 16 billion of assets under management in the second half of 2018 operational highlights underlying earnings before tax aegon s underlying earnings before tax decreased by 8 compared with the second half of 2017 to eur 1 010 million expense savings in all regions and higher earnings in spain portugal the netherlands and the uk platform business from business growth and higher margins were more than offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands and lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience in the united states underlying earnings from the americas decreased by 16 to eur 614 million driven by lower retirement plans earnings and adverse claims experience which more than offset expense savings the second half year of 2018 included eur 14 million unfavorable claims experience compared with eur 62 million favorable claims experience over the same period last year unfavorable mortality experience in life and retirement plans was partly offset by favorable claims experience in accident health retirement plans earnings decreased significantly which was mainly driven by lower fee income from lower asset balances a lower investment margin and investments in operations and technology underlying earnings before tax from aegon s operations in europe increased by 12 to eur 404 million this was the result of growth in all regions most notably in spain portugal driven by better underwriting results and expense savings furthermore earnings growth was supported by a higher investment margin in the netherlands from the shift to higher yielding assets lower funding costs for the bank and growth of the bank s balance sheet as well as growth of the digital solutions business in the united kingdom this was partly offset by the divestment of umg in the netherlands aegon s underlying earnings in asia decreased by eur 3 million to eur 23 million driven by lower earnings from the joint venture in china as a result of investments in growth and lower earnings from the direct marketing business which is in run off underlying earnings before tax from aegon asset management were up by 3 to eur 69 million in the second half of 2018 this increase was a result of higher earnings in the americas and in europe driven by an increase in management fees and lower expenses which were partly offset by lower performance fees from aegon s chinese asset management joint venture aegon industrial fund management company aifmc the result from the holding declined by eur 17 million to a loss of eur 100 million as a result of interest expenses on usd 800 million tier 2 securities issued in april 2018 to replace perpetual securities interest expenses for these tier 2 securities are taken through the p l while the interest expenses for the perpetuals were recognized directly through equity net income net income declined to eur 253 million in the second half of 2018 and mainly reflects fair value losses as a result of market movements and an increase in other charges fair value items the loss from fair value items amounted to eur 257 million gains from fair value items in europe asia and at the holding totaled eur 281 million and mainly resulted from hedging gains in addition to real estate revaluations in the netherlands these were more than offset by losses in the united states of eur 538 million largely from underperformance of alternative investments and the impact of declining equity markets on reserve movements net of hedging the loss was higher than expected mainly due to lower than anticipated gains as a result of the lack of implied volatility movements during the equity market decline realized losses on investments realized losses on investments totaled eur 10 million as losses from the sale of us treasuries more than offset gains as a result of portfolio optimization in the united kingdom net impairments net impairments remained low at eur 19 million and were driven by the impairment of corporate bonds resulting from a bankruptcy filing in the us other charges other charges of eur 581 million were mainly driven by a provision related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and a book loss on the sale of life reinsurance business in the united states model assumption changes in the netherlands and restructuring expenses in the united kingdom and united states in the united states other charges of eur 310 million were largely the result of a provision of eur 147 million related to the earlier announced settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders a eur 94 million book loss on the divestment of the last remaining substantial block of life reinsurance transition and conversion charges of eur 27 million related to the tcs partnership and a eur 26 million addition to a provision for unclaimed property in january 2019 a court approved the aforementioned settlement with universal life policyholders over 99 of affected policyholders participated in the settlement while less than 1 of policyholders opted out of the settlement they represented approximately 43 of the value of the settlement fund the settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs although aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders in europe other charges of eur 230 million were caused by eur 138 million charges from updated mortality and lapse assumptions in the netherlands eur 35 million integration expenses for cofunds and blackrock s defined contribution business and eur 19 million transition and conversion charges related to the agreement with atos for administration services related to the existing business both in the united kingdom other charges at the holding amounted to eur 36 million and were driven by ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses for the group run off businesses the result from run off businesses amounted to a loss of eur 7 million which was in line with expectations following the divestment of the majority of the remainder of these businesses in 2017 income tax income tax amounted to a benefit of eur 117 million while income before tax amounted to eur 136 million the income tax included one time tax benefits of declining us and dutch corporate income tax rates of eur 84 million next to the regular tax exempt income items and tax credits the effective tax rate on underlying earnings declined from 26 in the second half of 2017 to 12 in the second half of 2018 reflecting the reduction of the nominal corporate tax rate in the united states from 35 to 21 the effective tax rate on underlying earnings is below the nominal tax rate as a result of tax exempt income and other tax benefits return on equity to align closer to definitions used by peers and rating agencies aegon has retrospectively changed its internal definition of adjusted shareholders equity used in calculating return on equity for the group return on capital for its units and the gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 shareholders equity will no longer be adjusted for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans all figures in this press release including comparatives are based on the new definition unless stated otherwise return on equity increased by 50 basis points compared with the same period last year to 10 2 in the second half of 2018 under the current definition under the previous definition return on equity would have been 9 3 lower underlying earnings were more than offset by a lower effective tax rate operating expenses operating expenses increased by 2 to eur 1 923 million as expense savings and the divestments of umg and aegon ireland were more than offset by investments in growth in banking and the service business in the netherlands the acquisition of robidus restructuring charges and ifrs 9 17 implementation expenses aegon achieved its target to deliver eur 350 million in annual run rate expense savings by year end 2018 as part of its plans to improve return on equity initiatives to reduce expenses have led to annual run rate expense savings of eur 355 million since the beginning of 2016 transamerica achieved expense savings of usd 270 million over the last three years which was below the usd 300 million target a significant contributor to these savings was the partnership entered into with tcs earlier in 2018 which generated approximately one third of the total benefit achieved however investments within retirement plans drove staffing levels and related expenses higher than planned in the second half of 2018 as transamerica aims to improve the workplace experience and positions the business to accelerate growth at a group level that was compensated by additional expense savings in dutch life and non life insurance entities digitization of the business automation of processes and efficiencies in the marketing and sales organization delivered eur 79 million run rate expense savings compared with the eur 50 million targeted for the netherlands expense savings at the holding totaled eur 19 million versus a target of eur 15 million the abovementioned run rate expense savings exclude the synergies from the cofunds integration which are expected to total gbp 60 million once completed and the anticipated gbp 30 million savings from the extension of the partnership with atos to administer the existing business in the united kingdom deposits and sales gross deposits decreased by 13 to eur 58 billion driven by lower deposits on the platform in the united kingdom and in asset management while the prior period included eur 6 billion of inflows from a single large mandate won by aegon s strategic partner la banque postale asset management lbpam gross deposits in the americas increased by eur 2 billion net outflows amounted to eur 8 5 billion for the second half mainly driven by outflows in the united states of eur 7 6 billion caused by contract discontinuances in retirement plans these were caused by a limited number of large contract losses new life sales declined by 7 to eur 398 million as a result of lower term life and indexed universal life sales in the united states and lower sales in the asian high net worth hnw businesses the latter was impacted by higher cost of premium financing for customers as short term interest rates rose new premium production for accident health insurance decreased by 69 to eur 95 million this was predominantly driven by lower sales in the travel insurance affinity and stop loss segments in the united states and resulted from the previously announced strategic decision to exit these segments new premium production for property casualty insurance increased by 15 to eur 60 million driven by higher sales in hungary market consistent value of new business market consistent value of new business mcvnb increased by 37 to eur 236 million driven by the americas and europe the increase in mcvnb in the americas mainly resulted from tax reform in europe mcvnb almost doubled driven by an enhanced sales mix in spain portugal and improved margins on pension products on the uk platform revenue generating investments revenue generating investments decreased by 2 during the second half of 2018 to eur 804 billion net outflows and the impact of unfavorable equity market movements more than offset the inclusion of eur 18 billion assets related to the acquisition of blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased by eur 0 9 billion to eur 19 5 billion on december 31 2018 primarily driven by a lower revaluation reserve as a result of widening credit spreads in the united states shareholders equity excluding revaluation reserves decreased by eur 0 4 billion to eur 16 1 billion or eur 7 84 per common share at the end of the second half 2018 this decrease was largely driven by the strengthening of the us dollar and net income which were more than offset by dividends paid to shareholders and the impact of adverse market movements on defined benefit obligations gross financial leverage ratio as of the second half of 2018 aegon retrospectively changed the definition of shareholders equity used in calculating the gross financial leverage ratio the company will no longer adjust shareholders equity for the remeasurement of defined benefit plans to align its definition closer with those used by peers and rating agencies based on this more conservative calculation the gross financial leverage ratio decreased by 160 basis points to 29 2 in the second half of 2018 which is within the 26 30 target range this resulted from the redemption of eur 200 million grandfathered tier 1 securities in july 2018 and the maturity of eur 500 million senior debt in august 2018 under the previous definition the gross financial leverage ratio would have been 27 0 holding excess cash holding excess cash decreased from eur 1 923 million to eur 1 274 million during the second half of the year driven by eur 700 million leverage reduction the group received eur 786 million in remittances from subsidiaries of which eur 518 million from the united states eur 215 million from europe eur 21 million from asia and eur 29 million from asset management capital injections of eur 57 million in asset management central eastern europe spain portugal and asia were primarily related to investments in business growth the acquisition of robidus led to a cash outflow of eur 97 million furthermore eur 410 million cash was deployed for capital return to shareholders in the form of the cash portion of the interim 2018 dividend and the share buybacks to neutralize the final 2017 and interim 2018 stock dividends the remaining cash outflows of eur 171 million mainly related to holding funding and operating expenses capital generation capital generation of the operating units amounted to eur 39 million for the second half of 2018 adverse market movements totaled eur 1 040 million and favorable one time items eur 106 million bringing normalized capital generation to eur 973 million market impacts were mainly driven by the unfavorable equity market in the united states and the impact of adverse credit spread movements in the netherlands one time items were mainly driven by model assumption changes in the netherlands which more than offset the impact of tax changes in the netherlands and the acquisition of robidus in the netherlands in the united states several items including the adverse impact of us tax reform on required capital and the benefit from the elimination of a variable annuity captive largely offset each other solvency ii ratio aegon s solvency ii ratio decreased from 215 to 211 during the second half of 2018 as normalized capital generation favorable one time items and other items were more than offset by payment of the interim 2018 dividend adverse market impacts and the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business in the united kingdom the estimated rbc ratio in the united states decreased to 465 on december 31 2018 from 490 on june 30 2018 this decrease was mainly driven by the unfavorable impact from markets which was partly driven by lower than expected gains from implied volatility movements during the equity market decline furthermore market movements included a negative impact of 10 points from equity market movements on transamerica advisors life insurance company talic which is planned to merge with transamerica life insurance company tlic in 2019 one time items largely offset each other and included the impact of us tax reform the elimination of a variable annuity captive the settlement of class action litigation with universal life policyholders and the release of capital as a result of the previously announced strategic decision to exit the travel insurance affinity and stop loss insurance segments the estimated solvency ii ratio in the netherlands decreased to 181 on december 31 2018 from 190 on june 30 2018 the net positive impact of model assumption changes was offset by adverse market impacts and the impact of tax changes in the netherlands at the end of 2018 aegon updated its modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment to align with the guidance from the european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa this model change results in a change in credit sensitivities and increased 1 in 10 year combined sensitivities for the netherlands and as a result the company is reviewing the target zones for aegon the netherlands aegon is considering increasing the mid point of the target zone by 5 points to 10 points the positive impact from a change in modeling of the dynamic volatility adjustment more than offset other model assumption changes including changes to the assumptions regarding mortgages mortality rates and lapses for individual life policies for mortgages aegon changed a number of assumptions including reflecting changes to market conditions adverse market movements were the result of lower interest rates and the adverse impact of credit spread movements on the dynamic volatility adjustment before the aforementioned update to the model the estimated solvency ii ratio in the united kingdom decreased to 184 on december 31 2018 from 197 on june 30 2018 the decrease was mainly driven by the completion of the part vii transfer related to blackrock s defined contribution business unfavorable interest rate movements and the effect from changes in the equity hedging program which led to an increase in required capital assumption changes were on balance positive mainly as a result of lower expected future expenses resulting from the extended partnership with atos for administration services related to the existing business as well as the favorable impact from mortality updates final 2018 dividend aegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to allow equity investors to share in aegon s performance which can grow over time if aegon s performance so allows at the annual general meeting of shareholders on may 17 2019 the supervisory board will in the absence of unforeseen

meaningful information about the underlying results of aegon s business including insight into the financial measures that aegon s senior management uses in managing the business among other things aegon s senior management is compensated based in part on aegon s results against targets using the non ifrs measures presented here while other insurers in aegon s peer group present substantially similar non ifrs measures the non ifrs measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the non ifrs measures presented by other insurers there is no standardized meaning to these measures under ifrs or any other recognized set of accounting standards readers are cautioned to consider carefully the different ways in which aegon and its peers present similar information before comparing them aegon believes the non ifrs measures shown herein when read together with aegon s reported ifrs financial statements provide meaningful supplemental information for the investing public to evaluate aegon s business after eliminating the impact of current ifrs accounting policies for financial instruments and insurance contracts which embed a number of accounting policy alternatives that companies may select in presenting their results i e companies can use different local gaaps to measure the insurance contract liability and that can make the comparability from period to period difficult for a definition of underlying earnings and the reconciliation from underlying earnings before tax to income before tax being the most comparable ifrs measure reference is made to note 3 segment information of aegon s condensed consolidated interim financial statements aegon segment reporting is based on the businesses as presented in internal reports that are regularly reviewed by

portugal are separate operating segments which under ifrs 8 cannot be aggregated therefore further details will be provided for these operating segments in the europe section 2 new life sales is defined as new recurring premiums plus 1 10 of single premiums 3 the present value at point of sale of all cashflows for new business written during the reporting period calculated using approximate

capital generation reflects the sum of the return on free surplus earnings on in force business release of required surplus on in force business reduced by new business first year strain and required surplus on new business capital generation is defined as the capital generated in a local operating unit measured as the change in the local binding capital metric according to aegon s capital management policy for that period and after investments in new business capital generation is a non ifrs financial measure that should not be confused with cash flow from operations or any other cash flow measure calculated in accordance with ifrs management believes that capital generation provides meaningful information to investors regarding capital generated on a net basis by aegon s operating subsidiaries that may be available at the holding company because elements of capital generation are calculated in accordance with local solvency requirements rather than in accordance with any recognized body of accounting principles there is no ifrs financial measure that is directly comparable to capital generation 11b the calculation of the solvency ii capital surplus and ratio are based on solvency ii requirements for insurance entities in solvency ii equivalent regimes united states bermuda and brazil local regulatory solvency measurements are used specifically required capital for the regulated entities in the us is calculated as one and a half times 150 the upper end of the company action level range 200 of authorized control level as applied by the national association of insurance commissioners in the us while the own funds is calculated by applying a haircut to available capital under the local regulatory solvency measurement of one time 100 the upper end of the company action level range for entities in financial sectors other than the insurance sector the solvency requirements of the appropriate regulatory framework are taken into account in the group ratio the group ratio does not include aegon bank n v as the uk with profit funds is ring fenced no surplus is taken into account regarding the uk with profit funds for aegon uk and group numbers 12 the solvency ii ratio reflects aegon s interpretation of solvency ii requirements which is subject to supervisory review 13 the results in this release are unaudited disclaimers cautionary note regarding

company received consideration with a total value of approximately 85 million which includes cash proceeds of 30 million 30 million in additional payments related to the advancement of the deep carbonates project and royalties related to metal production at gualcamayo and the deep carbonates project the consideration received offers significant upside in the case of new oxide discoveries higher gold prices and or development of the deep carbonates project thereby preserving considerable optionality the transaction also includes an option for mineros to acquire up to a 51 interest in the la pepa project in chile the company s exploration programs continue to deliver on mineral resources discovery and mineral reserve replacement and growth the exploration program successfully increased gold mineral reserves to replace 2018 mineral depletion excluding assets that were disposed of in 2018 on the same basis measured and indicated gold mineral resources and inferred mineral resources increased by 5 and 7 respectively for silver mineral reserves decreased 3 measured and indicated mineral resources decreased 4 and inferred mineral resources decreased 3 for copper mineral reserves increased 6 measured and indicated mineral resources increased 55 and inferred mineral resources increased 211 the balance sheet as at december 31 2018 includes cash and cash equivalents of 98 5 million with available credit of 705 0 million for total liquidity of 803 5 million net debt 4 as at december 31 2018 was 1 66 billion daniel racine yamana s president and chief executive officer commented as follows in 2018 we achieved another year of exceeding our production guidance for all metals and at costs better than or in line with our guidance gold and copper exceeded the increased guidance levels we announced in october while silver production exceeded the guidance that was lowered at that time our operational performance would not have been possible without our success in delivering cerro moro on time and on budget and exceeding expectations on both production and costs through the first six months of commercial production throughout the year we also advanced several strategic initiatives including closing the sale of the canadian malartic exploration properties the gualcamayo mine and completion of the business combination between brio gold and leagold in addition to the ongoing evaluation and engagement in discussions relating to scenarios to develop agua rica overall we remain in a strong position to carry the company s health and safety operational and balance sheet momentum into 2019 development optimization and strategic initiatives chapada the company continues to advance its exploration program with the objective of identifying higher grade copper and gold opportunities that are near the chapada mine completing infill drilling of the sucupira and baru deposits which would lead to a pit expansion and advancing district scale targets mineralization has been identified along a 15 kilometre trend with numerous prospective areas under consideration for further drilling infill drilling in the baru area is expected to reduce stripping ratios for the sucupira deposit and drilling on oxide mineralization such as hidrotermalito brings the potential for heap leaching opportunities that could complement the suruca oxides project notwithstanding the focus on the exploration potential to discover higher grade copper and gold areas the company has also advanced other projects that are expected to further enhance returns from the chapada mine to this end the company has completed studies and evaluations on several of the development opportunities at chapada and has embarked on a feasibility level review of a three phase plan at chapada these opportunities range in scope from plant optimization initiatives to enhance copper and gold recoveries to plant expansions to bring forward cash flows and pit wall pushbacks to expose higher grade zones the study and evaluations include third party design and engineering estimates of capital expenses production and operating cost forecasts given the nature of the opportunities the projects can be considered on their own or as part of a phased development plan this flexibility in approach allows the company to balance the maximization of value at chapada with the allocation of capital across the broader company portfolio the phase 1 plant optimization work with expected recovery improvements in the range of 2 for both metals has been approved associated capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately 9 million the company is continuing to prioritize engineering for long lead time equipment for phase 1 and during the fourth quarter the flotation circuit expansion continued as planned with the installation of six new dfr flotation cells commissioning is scheduled for mid 2019 engineering is being advanced for phases 2 and 3 an expansion of the chapada mill and pushback of the chapada pit wall to expose higher grade sucupira ores respectively while review of these projects are in the evaluation process the company does not anticipate the allocation of significant expansionary capital for these projects before 2021 based on the work completed to date the company estimates the phased plan will provide the foundation to sustain annual production in the range of 100 000 to 110 000 ounces of gold not including contributions to gold production from identified higher grade areas of suruca which is a gold only ore body and 150 to 160 million pounds of copper until at least 2034 this represents an opportunity to deliver significant cash flow increases and cash flow returns on invested capital and an increase to the production outlook as disclosed in the chapada ni 43 101 technical report dated march 21 2018 further project details are expected to be available in mid 2019 with the completion of the feasibility study a development decision for phase 2 is expected to follow in 2020 suruca gold only oxide and sulphide development opportunity concurrent with the multi phase plan for chapada development of the gold only suruca oxides deposit continues to be evaluated as a standalone heap leach operation for which a feasibility study level update has been completed furthermore the suruca sulphides project has been updated in the 2018 exploration results for these ore bodies resulting in an increase of gold mineral resources the integrated scenario for suruca ore bodies includes processing of the oxides through a heap leach and processing of the gold only sulphides through a carbon in leach cil plant located at chapada alternatives to process the sulphide portion of suruca earlier in the life of mine are currently being contemplated including an exploration program designed to test further extensions of the sulphide mineralization and metallurgical test work the company expects to continue this development program through 2019 in order to build on the results from the 2017 and 2018 programs which resulted in extensions of the oxide and sulphide deposits canadian malartic the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 basis expansionary capex is expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work in the fourth quarter continued to focus on the highway 117 road deviation pit preparation and tailings expansion other optimization and monetization initiatives agua rica the company is continuing its evaluation of and engagement in discussions relating to various development scenarios for agua rica this includes an integration scenario between agua rica and alumbrera pursuant to which a joint pre feasibility study has started concurrently the company continues the engagement with the other partners of alumbrera and with various other stakeholders at the national and provincial level separately the company continues to advance alternatives for the development of agua rica this includes technical work and analysis for project development options for agua rica as well as the review and consideration of various strategic alternatives all in an effort to advance the project and surface value considerable effort has been undertaken to advance two development scenarios one a large scale open pit integrated operation and the other an initially smaller scale but scalable standalone operation the large scale open pit scenario contemplates the aforementioned integration with the neighboring alumbrera mine in which the company holds a 12 5 interest and for which it expects to complete an updated pre feasibility study during the first half of 2019 suyai the company previously completed a scoping study that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favorable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is one of the highest gold grade development ready projects in the americas while a financial adviser has not been retained at this time the company is evaluating its strategic alternatives in addition to development of the project monument bay the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised by three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 ga gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2018 approximately 16 270 metres of drilling were completed on the monument bay project the focus was testing targets near the twin lakes deposit and testing regional targets in addition during the period a new geological interpretation of the deposit was formed and is expected to form the basis for an updated block model and mineral resource estimate groundwork is continuing and generating prospects for follow up testing in 2019 on september 13 2018 the company signed an exploration agreement with red sucker lake first nations in relation to the monument bay exploration site in northern manitoba this is an important step allowing the company to solidify a strategic collaboration with this community as it continues to advance the project other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans

at gold mineral reserves in thousands of ounces adjustment to geological interpretation and cut off grade additions due to infill drilling cerro moro argentina at cerro moro increases in gold and silver mineral reserves partially offset depletion associated with 2018 production the main increases came from the discovery of new high grade near surface vein veronica and the extensions of nini also drilling in the core mine area returned mineralized intercepts at michelle milagros and tres lomas which will be followed up upon in 2019 updated economical parameters with higher cut off grades for both mineral reserves and mineral resources had the impact of reducing tonnage but increasing the overall grade due to the previous focus of the site on project development start up and ramp up of operations long term exploration effort began in 2018 and as result the current mineral resources do not consider drilling results for the last four months of the year these results are in the process of being analyzed and are expected to provide good quality targets for 2019 this ultimately resulted in 13 lower gold for remaining measured and indicated mineral resources and 24 lower inferred mineral resources regional exploration south of the mine area intercepted a wide zone of mineralization at naty these zones are expected to undergo further drilling in 2019 as part of the increased

standard developed by the gold institute which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading north american gold producers the gold institute ceased operations in 2002 but the standard remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production in north america adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the measure of cash costs along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to

sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about the company s underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis net of by product sales and on a co product basis as follows cash costs of gold and silver on a by product basis shown on a per ounce basis the attributable cost for each metal is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to gold and silver ounces produced thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal production these costs are then divided by gold and silver ounces produced cash costs of gold and silver on a co product basis shown on a per ounce basis costs directly attributed to gold and silver will be allocated to each metal costs not directly attributed to each metal will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues which will be determined annually the attributable cost for each metal will then be divided by the production of each metal in calculating cash costs per ounce on a co product basis for the period cash costs of copper on a co product basis shown on a per pound basis costs attributable to copper production are divided by commercial copper pounds produced by product and co product aisc all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold and silver produced seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing gold and silver ounces from current operations based on co product costs or by product costs including cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures corporate general and administrative expense excluding stock based compensation and exploration and evaluation expense all in sustaining costs do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments financing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods all in sustaining co product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold silver or copper production activities similarly all in sustaining by product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature

company received consideration with a total value of approximately 85 million which includes cash proceeds of 30 million 30 million in additional payments related to the advancement of the deep carbonates project and royalties related to metal production at gualcamayo and the deep carbonates project the consideration received offers significant upside in the case of new oxide discoveries higher gold prices and or development of the deep carbonates project thereby preserving considerable optionality the transaction also includes an option for mineros to acquire up to a 51 interest in the la pepa project in chile the company s exploration programs continue to deliver on mineral resources discovery and mineral reserve replacement and growth the exploration program successfully increased gold mineral reserves to replace 2018 mineral depletion excluding assets that were disposed of in 2018 on the same basis measured and indicated gold mineral resources and inferred mineral

commented as follows in 2018 we achieved another year of exceeding our production guidance for all metals and at costs better than or in line with our guidance gold and copper exceeded the increased guidance levels we announced in october while silver production exceeded the guidance that was lowered at that time our operational performance would not have been possible without our success in delivering cerro moro on time and on budget and exceeding expectations on both production and costs through the first six months of commercial production throughout the year we also advanced several strategic initiatives including closing the sale of the canadian malartic exploration properties the gualcamayo mine and completion of the business combination between brio gold and leagold in addition to the ongoing evaluation and engagement in discussions relating to scenarios to develop agua rica overall we remain in a strong position to carry the company s health and safety operational and balance sheet momentum into 2019 development optimization and strategic initiatives chapada the company continues to advance its exploration program with the objective of identifying higher grade copper and gold opportunities that are near the chapada mine completing infill drilling of the sucupira and baru deposits which would lead to a pit expansion and advancing district scale targets mineralization has been identified along a 15 kilometre trend with numerous prospective areas under consideration for further drilling infill drilling in the baru area is expected to reduce stripping ratios for the sucupira deposit and drilling on oxide mineralization such as hidrotermalito brings the potential for heap leaching opportunities that could complement the suruca oxides project notwithstanding the focus on the exploration potential to discover higher grade copper and gold areas the company has also advanced other projects that are expected to further enhance returns from the chapada mine to this end the company has completed studies and evaluations on several of the development opportunities at chapada and has embarked on a feasibility level review of a three phase plan at chapada these opportunities range in scope from plant optimization initiatives to enhance copper and gold recoveries to plant expansions to bring forward cash flows and pit wall pushbacks to expose higher grade zones the study and evaluations include third party design and engineering estimates of capital expenses production and operating cost forecasts given the nature of the opportunities the projects can be considered on their own or as part of a phased development plan this flexibility in approach allows the company to balance the maximization of value at chapada with the allocation of capital across the broader company portfolio the phase 1 plant optimization work with expected recovery improvements in the range of 2 for both metals has been approved associated capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately 9 million the company is continuing to prioritize engineering for long lead time equipment for phase 1 and during the fourth quarter the flotation circuit expansion continued as planned with the installation of six new dfr flotation cells commissioning is scheduled for mid 2019 engineering is being advanced for phases 2 and 3 an expansion of the chapada mill and pushback of the chapada pit wall to expose higher grade sucupira ores respectively while review of these projects are in the evaluation process the company does not anticipate the allocation of significant expansionary capital for these projects before 2021 based on the work completed to date the company estimates the phased plan will provide the foundation to sustain annual production in the range of 100 000 to 110 000 ounces of gold not including contributions to gold production from identified higher grade areas of suruca which is a gold only ore body and 150 to 160 million pounds of copper until at least 2034 this represents an opportunity to deliver significant cash flow increases and cash flow returns on invested capital and an increase to the production outlook as disclosed in the chapada ni 43 101 technical report dated march 21 2018 further project details are expected to be available in mid 2019 with the completion of the feasibility study a development decision for phase 2 is expected to follow in 2020 suruca gold only oxide and sulphide development opportunity concurrent with the multi phase plan for chapada development of the gold only suruca oxides deposit continues to be evaluated as a standalone heap leach operation for which a feasibility study level update has been completed furthermore the suruca sulphides project has been updated in the 2018 exploration results for these ore bodies resulting in an increase of gold mineral resources the integrated scenario for suruca ore bodies includes processing of the oxides through a heap leach and processing of the gold only sulphides through a carbon in leach cil plant located at chapada alternatives to process the sulphide portion of suruca earlier in the life of mine are currently being contemplated including an exploration program designed to test further extensions of the sulphide mineralization and metallurgical test work the company expects to continue this development program through 2019 in order to build on the results from the 2017 and 2018 programs which resulted in extensions of the oxide and sulphide deposits canadian malartic the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 basis expansionary capex is expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work in the fourth quarter continued to focus on the highway 117 road deviation pit preparation and tailings expansion other optimization and monetization initiatives agua rica the company is continuing its evaluation of and engagement in discussions relating to various development scenarios for agua rica this includes an integration scenario between agua rica and alumbrera pursuant to which a joint pre feasibility study has started concurrently the company continues the engagement with the other partners of alumbrera and with various other stakeholders at the national and provincial level separately the company continues to advance alternatives for the development of agua rica this includes technical work and analysis for project development options for agua rica as well as the review and consideration of various strategic alternatives all in an effort to advance the project and surface value considerable effort has been undertaken to advance two development scenarios one a large scale open pit integrated operation and the other an initially smaller scale but scalable standalone operation the large scale open pit scenario contemplates the aforementioned integration with the neighboring alumbrera mine in which the company holds a 12 5 interest and for which it expects to complete an updated pre feasibility study during the first half of 2019 suyai the company previously completed a scoping study that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favorable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is one of the highest gold grade development ready projects in the americas while a financial adviser has not been retained at this time the company is evaluating its strategic alternatives in addition to development of the project monument bay the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised by three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 ga gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2018 approximately 16 270 metres of drilling were completed on the monument bay project the focus was testing targets near the twin lakes deposit and testing regional targets in addition during the period a new geological interpretation of the deposit was formed and is expected to form the basis for an updated block model and mineral resource estimate groundwork is continuing and generating prospects for follow up testing in 2019 on september 13 2018 the company signed an exploration agreement with red sucker lake first nations in relation to the monument bay exploration site in northern manitoba this is an important step allowing the company to solidify a strategic collaboration with this community as it continues to advance the project other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans

metallurgical testing canadian malartic including odyssey canada 50 gold mineral reserves reflect depletion associated with 2018 production at canadian malartic separately much of the mineral resource accretion in 2018 is associated with the east malartic underground additional drilling also at east malartic and odyssey contributed to the 33 increase in gold measured and indicated mineral resources and the 1 increase in gold inferred mineral resources gold mineral reserves in thousands of ounces adjustments to pit design and cut off grade jacobina brazil jacobina successfully increased gold mineral reserves by 11 over 2018 mining depletion measured and indicated mineral resources are in line with 2017 and reflect the conversion to mineral reserves inferred mineral resources increased significantly by over 800 000 ounces of gold despite increasing the cut off grade from 0 5 g t to 1 0 g t the exploration program at jacobina also achieved the main goal for the year which was to identify and define high grade mineralization close to current infrastructure several zones were defined including down dip of joão belo morro do vento south and the northern portion serra do corrego and canavieiras sul in 2019 the exploratory drilling will continue focusing on the extension of these high grade zones including the south extension of joão belo the definition drilling program will continue in 2019 to increase confidence in reef geometry and fault locations for sectors planned to be mined within the next three years the following chart summarizes the changes in gold mineral reserves at jacobina as at december 31 2018 compared to the prior period gold mineral reserves in thousands of ounces additions mostly at morro do vento with additional reefs minera florida chile at minera florida the decrease in mineral reserves is a result of mine depletion and the application of an updated geological model and more conservative design parameters with higher cut off grades especially around the historic mining areas gold measured and indicated mineral resources increased by 5 resulting from an upgrade of certain inferred mineral resources the pvs and pataguas zones will be the main targets of 2019 exploration drilling the following chart summarizes the changes in gold mineral reserves at minera florida as at december 31 2018 compared to the prior period gold mineral reserves in thousands of ounces adjustment to geological interpretation and cut off grade additions due to infill drilling cerro moro argentina at cerro moro increases in gold and silver mineral reserves partially offset depletion associated with 2018 production the main increases came from the discovery of new high grade near surface vein veronica and the extensions of nini also drilling in the core mine area returned mineralized intercepts at michelle milagros and tres lomas which will be followed up upon in 2019 updated economical parameters with higher cut off grades for both mineral reserves and mineral resources had the impact of reducing tonnage but increasing the overall grade due to the previous focus of the site on project development start up and ramp up of operations long term exploration effort began in 2018 and as result the current mineral resources do not consider drilling results for the last four months of the year these results are in the process of being analyzed and are expected to provide good quality targets for 2019 this ultimately resulted in 13 lower gold for remaining measured and indicated mineral resources and 24 lower inferred mineral resources regional exploration south of the mine area intercepted a wide zone of mineralization at naty these zones are expected to undergo further drilling in 2019 as part of the increased exploration budget allocation to the mine the following chart summarizes the changes in gold mineral reserves at cerro moro as at december 31 2018 compared to the prior period gold mineral reserves in

may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the united states federal securities laws and the rules and

costs per ounce of silver produced on a co product and by product basis co product cash costs per pound of copper produced all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co product and by product basis all in sustaining costs per ounce of silver produced on a co product and by product basis all in sustaining co product costs per pound of copper produced net debt net free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold sold average realized price per ounce of silver sold and average realized price per pound of copper sold the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities cash costs figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the gold institute which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading north american gold producers the gold institute ceased operations in 2002 but the standard remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production in north america adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the measure of cash costs along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms co product and by product cash costs per ounce of gold or silver produced co product cash costs per pound of copper produced co product and by product aisc per ounce of gold or silver produced and co product aisc per pound of copper produced do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap

profit or cash flows presented under ifrs by product and co product cash costs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about the company s underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis net of by product sales and on a co product basis as follows cash costs of gold and silver on a by product basis shown on a per ounce basis the attributable cost for each metal is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to gold and silver ounces produced thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal production these costs are then divided by gold and silver ounces produced cash costs of gold and silver on a co product basis shown on a per ounce basis costs directly attributed to gold and silver will be allocated to each metal costs not directly attributed to each metal will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues which will be determined annually the attributable cost for each metal will then be divided by the production of each metal in calculating cash costs per ounce on a co product basis for the period cash costs of copper on a co product basis shown on a per pound basis costs attributable to copper production are divided by commercial copper pounds produced by product and co product aisc all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold and silver produced seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing gold and silver ounces from current operations based on co product costs or by product costs including cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures corporate general and administrative expense excluding stock based compensation and exploration and evaluation expense all in sustaining costs do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments financing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods all in sustaining co product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold silver or copper production activities similarly all in sustaining by product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold and silver production activities but net of by product revenue credits from sales of copper and zinc a reconciliation of total cost of sales of gold silver and copper sold cost of sales excluding depreciation depletion and amortization plus depreciation depletion and amortization per the consolidated financial statements to co product cash

added for 2018 we delivered healthy free cash flow growth of 24 per cent reflecting solid ebitda growth and lower capital expenditures as planned in 2019 we expect to generate robust free cash flow driven by continued profitable customer growth and lower capital expenditures before spectrum of 2 85 billion despite an increase to cash taxes due to a one time catch up payment importantly cash taxes are expected to decline to a lower level in 2020 overall our strong balance sheet positions us well as we look to continue investing in our world leading advanced broadband network further extending our leadership position and supporting our planned participation in the upcoming 600 mhz spectrum auction in wireless external revenue increased by 5 4 per cent reflecting network and equipment revenue growth of 1 8 per cent and 19 per cent respectively network revenue growth was driven by continued customer growth and a larger proportion of customers selecting plans with larger data buckets or periodically topping up their data buckets this was partly offset by declining chargeable data usage and the competitive environment putting pressure on base rate plan prices including larger data buckets in wireline external revenue increased by 7 5 per cent driven by data services revenue growth of 13 per cent reflecting increased internet and enhanced data service revenues from higher revenue per customer and continued high speed internet subscriber growth higher customer care and business services ccbs revenues due primarily to increased business volumes from business acquisitions and organic growth increased telus health revenues driven partially by business acquisitions revenues from our home and business security service offerings and increased telus tv revenues from subscriber growth in the quarter we added 164 000 new wireless postpaid high speed internet and telus tv customers up 8 000 or 5 1 per cent over the same quarter a year ago the higher net additions included 112 000 wireless postpaid net additions 28 000 high speed internet subscribers and 24 000 telus tv customers our total wireless subscriber base of 9 2 million is up 3 6 per cent from a year ago reflecting a 4 2 per cent increase in our postpaid subscriber base to 8 3 million while our prepaid base of 924 000 remained relatively stable our high speed internet connections of 1 9 million are up 6 6 per cent over the last twelve months while our telus tv subscriber base stands at 1 1 million for the quarter net income of 368 million increased by 4 0 per cent over the same period a year ago as ebitda growth was partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization due to growth in our asset base resulting in part from business acquisitions as well as increased financing costs basic earnings per share eps of 0 60 rose by 1 7 per cent over the same period last year adjusted net income of 409 million increased by 3 3 per cent over the same period a year ago while adjusted basic eps of 0 69 rose by 4 5 per cent free cash flow for the quarter of 122 million decreased by 55 5 per cent over the same period a year ago as ebitda growth was offset by higher wireless acquisition and retention costs as well as increased share based compensation and higher cash taxes both of which were higher due to timing the higher acquisition and retention costs reflect more attractive handset promotion offers during the competitive holiday selling season while in the same period a year ago subscriber loading was driven by an attractive bring your own device promotion for

fourth quarter 2018 opening postpaid and total subscribers as well as associated fourth quarter 2018 operating statistics arpu abpu and churn have been adjusted to exclude an estimated 23 000 subscribers impacted by the crtc s final pro rating ruling in june 2018 which was effective october 1 2018 fourth quarter 2018 operating highlights telus wireless external operating revenue increased by 111 million or 5 4 per cent driven by higher network and equipment revenues wireless network revenues increased by 27 million or 1 8 per cent year over year to 1 5 billion this growth was driven by continued subscriber growth and a larger proportion of customers selecting plans with larger data buckets or periodically topping up their data buckets these factors were partly offset by declining chargeable data usage and the competitive environment putting pressure on base rate plan price increases including larger data buckets wireless equipment and other service revenue increased by 102 million or 19 per cent mainly due to more higher value smartphones in the sales mix of gross additions and retention units growth in revenue per handset as well as higher volume of new postpaid contracts average billing per user per month abpu of 66 80 declined by 0 7 per cent due to lower chargeable data usage and competitive pressures on base rate plan pricing offsetting growth from customers selecting plans with larger data buckets the introduction of our platinum rate plans and more higher value smartphones in the sales mix of gross additions and retention units postpaid churn rate of 0 91 per cent declined by 8 basis points over the same period a year ago due to our focus on customers first initiatives retention programs and our leading network quality and in the prior period incremental deactivations from heightened competitive and promotional activity this marks the twenty first out of the past twenty two quarters postpaid churn has been below 1 per cent wireless postpaid net additions of 112 000 decreased by 9 000 over the same period a year ago driven by lower gross additions due to the non recurrence of an attractive holiday rate plan offer which stimulated significant customer traffic in the prior year partly offset by lower customer churn prepaid net losses of 6 000 improved by 17 000 over the same period a year ago due to higher gross additions from successful promotions and lower churn ebitda of 830 million increased by 19 million or 2 4 per cent while adjusted ebitda of 852 million increased by 40 million or 5 0 per cent over last year reflecting higher equipment margins and network revenue growth driven by a larger customer base partly offset by higher administrative costs and increased customer support costs due to growth in the subscriber base and increased network operating expenses wireless capital expenditures increased by 20 million or 8 6 per cent over the same period a year ago due to increased infrastructure initiatives telus wireline external operating revenue increased by 112 million or 7 5 per cent to 1 6 billion this growth was driven by higher data services revenue growth data services revenues increased by 136 million or 12 8 per cent reflecting increased internet and enhanced data service revenues resulting from higher revenue per customer as well as an increase in our high speed internet subscriber base and higher ccbs revenues due to growth in business volumes including from business acquisitions and recovery of organic growth additionally increased telus health revenues driven partially by growth from business acquisitions revenues from our home and business security service offerings and increased telus tv revenues resulting from subscriber growth also supported data services revenue growth high speed internet net additions of 28 000 increased by 7 000 over the same quarter a year ago due to increased customer demand for and availability of our high speed broadband services including fibre to the premises as well as improved churn reflecting our focus on executing customers first initiatives and retention programs telus tv net additions of 24 000 increased by 10 000 over the same quarter a year ago due to a lower customer churn rate from stronger retention efforts and higher gross additions from our diverse product offerings residential network access line nal losses of 13 000 improved slightly by 1 000 over the same quarter a year ago residential nal losses continue to reflect the trend of substitution to wireless and internet based services partially offset by the success of our stronger retention efforts wireline ebitda of 405 million decreased by 7 million or 1 2 per cent while adjusted ebitda increased by 12 million or 3 1 per cent due to growth in internet and telus health margins as well as an increased contribution from our ccbs business aided by business acquisitions and an increase in other services and equipment margin wireline capital expenditures decreased by 48 million or 9 5 per cent over the same period a year ago which is aligned with our broadband build plan partially offset by increased investments in businesses we have acquired at the end of 2018 approximately 1 89 million premises or 61 per cent of our high speed broadband footprint of more than 3 1 million premises were covered by telus purefibre this is an increase of approximately 450 000 purefibre premises over 2017 telus sets 2019 consolidated financial targets telus consolidated financial targets for 2019 reflect continued

has remained the increase in industrial production is expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s business operations during 2019 raw material prices are expected to remain at their current level or decrease the national economy and industrial production are growing moderately in russia an important market area for aspo while international sanctions and their possible increase have maintained uncertainties regarding the development of the russian economy general political risks continue to increase and this may have rapid effects on the operating environment or decrease free trade also affecting the operating conditions of customers of aspo s businesses economic conditions will remain favorable in aspo s businesses even though there is always the risk of rapid changes aki ojanen ceo of aspo group comments on the fourth quarter and financial year aspo s net sales continued to increase significantly and the operating profit adjusted by the impairment loss recognized on kauko s goodwill improved clearly even though aspo s profitability has developed positively and all main businesses increased their operating profit during the fourth quarter we have not been able to use the full potential of all businesses esl shipping accounted for a significant part of the increase in aspo s net sales esl shipping s new environmentally friendly vessels and the acquisition of swedish shipping company atob c had a positive effect on its net sales in the fourth quarter eastern markets an area important to aspo developed well with net sales during the fourth quarter growing by 12 during the fourth quarter the impairment loss of eur 4 8 million recognized on kauko s goodwill strained aspo s operating profit serious technical problems with cranes slowed down the deployment of esl shipping s new vessels this also reduced profit for the fourth quarter cargotec macgregor the crane supplier is committed to completing its warranty repairs during the first quarter of 2019 we can be satisfied with the operation of the energy and environmental efficiency systems of the new vessels when we can raise the reliability and efficiency of the loading and unloading operations of the new vessels to the planned level the vessels will meet our high profitability requirements and they can be placed to intended customers cargo deliveries during the 2018

4 7 outlook for 2019 global economic growth is expected to slow down economies in russia and eastern markets will continue their moderate increase while political risks and international sanctions imposed on russia have maintained a high level of risks in the market area meaning that future development is difficult to predict the risk of increasing obstacles to international free trade has remained and negative development may also be rapid which may affect the operating prerequisites of aspo s principals customer companies or aspo s businesses exchange rates are expected to continue to fluctuate heavily economic growth in the eu and particularly in finland remains at good level while the growth in finnish export volumes has decelerated the increase in industrial production is expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s businesses in northern europe the boom will continue in aspo s businesses even though there is always the risk of rapid changes the prices of industrial raw materials and oil that are important to aspo are expected to remain at their current low level dry bulk freight rates in sea transportation that are important to esl shipping are expected to remain at their current level aspo s business operations esl shipping esl shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the baltic sea region at the end of the financial year the shipping company s fleet consisted of 49 vessels with a total capacity of 464 000 dwt of the vessels 22 are wholly owned two are minority owned one is leased and the remaining 24 are time chartered esl shipping s competitive edge is based on its ability to secure product and raw material transportation for the industries and energy production round the year even in difficult weather conditions

dry bulk cargo decreased slightly during the fourth quarter being at the same level as in the year before at the end of the quarter duties and sanctions that potentially restrict international free trade have increased uncertainties over continued international growth during the fourth quarter the shipping company s vessels mainly operated in contract traffic in the baltic sea and in northern europe and also performed loading and unloading operations at sea transportation operations in the baltic sea and the north sea are mainly based on long term customer agreements and established customer relationships operations from the canadian arctic to europe continued as in previous years until the end of the season in november the numerous storms in late autumn caused lay days in vessel operations and additional costs also as a result of higher fuel consumption esl shipping s net sales in the fourth quarter increased significantly as a result of higher transportation volumes the completion of the new vessels and the increase in the vessel capacity through the acquisition of atob c as part of its growth strategy esl shipping completed the acquisition of swedish shipping company atob c on august 31 2018 its figures are included in the shipping company s financial reporting starting from the beginning of september net sales for the fourth quarter grew by 105 from the comparative period to eur 46 4 22 6 million the impact of the acquisition on the increase in net sales was eur 20 0 million in the fourth quarter operating profit for the fourth quarter was eur 4 2 4 1 million the operating profit rate for the period of 9 1 18 1 was not satisfactory considering long term target fluctuations in the prices of ship fuel were unusually high during the fourth quarter the highest prices of the year were recorded in the middle of october after which prices fell rapidly by more than 30 to the lowest level of the year fuel prices mainly have an impact on net sales through fuel clauses included in agreements however extreme short term fluctuations have also some impact on results transportation volumes in the steel industry increased from the comparative period but were lower than expected due to production problems at certain plants and congestion at ports in the energy industry the transportation volumes of coal decreased slightly as expected from the comparative period the transportation volumes of biofuels increased as expected transportation volumes in other customer sectors increased significantly in particular as a result of new product groups and customers brought by the business acquisition the cargo volume carried by esl shipping during the final quarter amounted to 4 5 3 3 million tons demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea was at the usual level in the fourth quarter being however lower compared with the very high demand in the previous year through the acquisition of atob c esl shipping also strengthened its position in the smaller vessel category the shipping company s operations diversified significantly as it expanded its service range and customer base from the transportation of raw materials to industrial products esl shipping will continue its development to offer more environmentally friendly and efficient transportation solutions to meet its customers future needs in the fourth quarter two smaller wholly owned vessels and both party owned vessels were docked as planned in november atob c acquired a 4 100 dwt dry cargo vessel of ice class 1a built in 2000 the shipping company had already operated the vessel through long term time chartering and it also owns the vessel s sister ship in the fourth quarter esl shipping started activities to reach synergy benefits and profitability target level in addition it strengthened its operating and sales resources through recruitment processes in order to ensure the high and efficient use of its vessel capacity all important and expiring customer agreements were renewed as targeted during the fourth quarter in addition the shipping company signed new agreements and expanded existing agreements at a highly satisfactory cargo level ms viikki and ms haaga the world s first ice strengthened dry bulk cargo vessels fueled by liquefied natural gas have started their operations the vessels fulfil the high goals set for them for example in terms of load bearing capacity fuel economy and eco friendliness in the fourth quarter both vessels arrived safely and fully laden to the baltic sea via the northern sea route which is shorter than the route via the panama canal by three weeks significantly reducing the environmental impact of the voyage however extensive and serious problems in the conventional mechanics of high power cranes which are subject to warranty have significantly interfered with the efficient operations of both vessels these have resulted in significant loss of income and additional costs for the shipping company this problem concerns all the cranes on both vessels due to the delivery times of spare parts repairs are expected to be completed only at the end of the first quarter of 2019 during this time the vessels cannot be operated fully efficiently as planned in 2018 esl shipping improved its profitability and its operating profit stood at eur 15 1 13 5 million the operating profit includes eur 0 9 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition the shipping company s net sales grew by 51 in january december to eur 120 1 79 3 million in 2018 the cargo volume carried by esl shipping amounted to 13 4 11 4 million tons outlook for esl shipping for 2019 the shipping company s vessel capacity increased significantly as a result of the atob c acquisition and the completion of its two new vessels due to serious warranty repairs involving the cranes of the new vessels the financial performance of the vessels can only reach the targeted level starting from the second quarter the increase in capacity enables the company to improve its operational efficiency and profitability especially during the second half of the year when there is typically a shortage of vessel capacity economic growth is expected to slow down in the shipping company s main market areas in finland any disputes resulting from collective bargaining in the transportation sector may have an impact on the operations of customer companies and transportation chains during spring actions directed at international free trade an increase in political risks and decelerating economic growth in china may have an impact on global flows of goods the vessel capacity in the vessel categories operated by the shipping company will increase slowly and the availability of leased high quality vessels may be limited particularly in the smaller vessel category the development of the cargo markets in 2019 will be most directly reflected in the financial performance of the largest supramax vessels of the shipping company most of the shipping company s transportation capacity has been secured in the baltic sea and northern europe through long term agreements the current forecasts of general transportation volumes of contractual partners are highly satisfactory in all key customer segments even though there are uncertainties in demand due to political situation and increased economic uncertainty general demand in the steel industry is high and transportation volumes are expected to develop very positively and improve significantly starting from the second quarter demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea a segment important to the shipping company is expected to remain high furthermore demand for raw material and product transportation in the forest industry an important sector for the shipping company s smaller vessel category is expected to continue strong total transportation volumes in the energy industry are expected to increase from the previous year as a result of higher demand for the transportation of bioenergy the biofuel transportation markets in the baltic sea are expected to grow significantly in the near future the transportation volumes of coal will decrease as expected during 2019 three vessels of the larger category and one smaller vessel will be docked as planned in addition the docking of time chartered vessels will affect the available vessel capacity the content of the time chartering portfolio will be reviewed if necessary in accordance with any changes in demand ice conditions in the baltic sea area are expected to be normal during winter and spring wind conditions will have an impact on the development of pack ice which may be reflected in the efficiency of operations esl shipping aims at net sales of more than eur 200 million and an operating profit rate of 12 15 by 2020 leipurin leipurin is a unique provider of solutions for bakery and confectionery products and the out of home foodservice market the solutions offered by leipurin range for example from product development recipes raw materials training and equipment all the way to

leipurin s project delivery completed in 2014 including processing fees totaling eur 0 5 million during the fourth quarter confidence among consumers decreased in leipurin s main market areas the consumer price of food increased in finland and the rate of inflation accelerated slightly in russia remaining however at a low level the prices of raw materials important to leipurin showed variation from one raw material group to the next and the market prices of seasonal products continued to increase during the fourth quarter the market for industrially packed bread continues to decrease in the west whereas the market of in store bakeries and baking units has continued to increase this change presents challenges in the operations of industrial bakeries in 2017 a change took place in russia as a result of which bakeries are no longer responsible for retail bread wastage instead any unsold bread is covered by the retail industry the change has significantly reduced the production of packed bread and reduced net sales compared with the comparative period however this change has increased the markets for in shop bakeries in russia where leipurin has gained a strong market position the trends that are important to leipurin and affect the consumer market i e increasing popularity of out of home eating eating snacks and the consumption of pastries continued the net sales of leipurin in the fourth quarter decreased from the comparative period to eur 31 6 32 9 million this decrease was mainly attributable to the timing of project deliveries in machinery operations net sales in ukraine and russia and in certain baltic countries increased the operating profit of eur 0 8 0 7 million was not at the targeted level the operating profit includes costs from the discontinuation of loss producing operations such as raw material operations in poland operations in eastern markets in particular improved profitability the operating profit rate during the quarter was 2 5 2 1 net sales of bakery raw materials in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased in the fourth quarter by 2 to eur 9 1 8 9 million the operating profit rate was approximately 9 10 net sales in the eastern markets including machinery sales increased by approximately 14 to eur 11 8 10 3 million and the operating profit rate was approximately 10 10 in western markets the total net sales of raw material and foodservice operations were at the comparative period s level the decreasing profitability of the loss producing test cafeteria operations and costs from discontinuation of raw material operations in poland and a test cafeteria had a negative impact on the operating profit in finland the total net sales of raw material and foodservice operations were at the comparative period s level even though the volume of industrial sales fell the net sales of foodservice operations increased in finland from the comparative period as a result of the procurement and logistics services of a new significant chain customer currently foodservice operations do not account for any significant part of net sales the net sales of machinery operations fell by roughly 20 due to the timing of project deliveries in leipurin s own machine production and deliveries of principals equipment cyclicality is typical of leipurin s machinery operations due to the timing of revenue recognition related to bakery lines and projects leipurin s net sales in january december fell to eur 121 0 million 122 3 the net sales of raw material operations decreased by 3 due to the divestment completed at the end of august 2017 where leipurin sold its meat industry raw material business to mp maustepalvelut oy leipurin s operating profit improved to eur 3 3 3 1 million the operating profit during the comparative period included sales gains of eur 0 4 million from the sale of meat industry raw material business and compensation of eur 0 5 million for a project delivery completed by leipurin in 2014 including processing fees the operating profit during january december was strained by the further decrease in loss producing operations such as raw material operations in poland and by costs from the discontinuation of loss producing operations in addition exchange rate losses and increased resources in foodservice operations reduced the operating profit net sales in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased by 3 6 to eur 36 3 35 0 million profitability in this market area remained at the comparative period s level approximately at 8 8 outlook for leipurin for 2019 the market situation is expected to remain challenging in leipurin s key markets the development of leipurin s main customer categories i e bakeries and foodservice chains continues to vary from one customer to the next for example many bakeries in finland announced in 2018 that their operations will discontinue this reduces the net sales of leipurin s operations in finland the market position of leipurin is expected to remain strong in the industrial baking sector in finland russia and the baltic region the operating profit of leipurin is expected to increase in 2019 in russia the national economy and the purchasing power of consumers are in moderate growth while international sanctions and their possible increase have added to the uncertainties regarding the development of the russian economy exchange rate changes have reduced leipurin s price competitiveness in eastern markets however leipurin will continue to develop the procurement of bakery raw materials in the area in order to better respond to any changes in demand leipurin will maintain its high profitability in the region strengthen its market position and look for growth in the bread and pastry sectors as well as in store bakeries the foodservice market is a significant area of growth for leipurin leipurin will continue to invest in the foodservice market particularly in finland and the western markets where leipurin is responding for example to the growing demand of chain customers such as cafés and fast food restaurants the company has further developed its operations targeted at foodservice chains offering both procurement and logistics services to chain customers the large logistics volumes of leipurin as well as its efficiency and expertise allow the development and expansion of its operations in terms of machinery operations bakeries are expected to maintain their current equipment investment level in finland and the baltic countries a moderate increase in investments is expected in russia the expansion of the procurement network for leipurin s own machine production and the development of manufacturing and installation lead times will continue in machinery operations the order book shows variation between quarters currently orders focus on the latter half of 2019 due to customers project schedules the increase in the leipurin s own machine production will be driven by increased industrial investments in leipurin s home markets and elsewhere in europe telko telko is a leading expert and supplier of plastic raw materials and industrial chemicals its

trend however the prices of technical plastics started to decrease clearly during the final quarter the prices of industrial chemicals that are important to telko have remained high in the long term but turned to a slight decrease during the fourth quarter as a result of lower oil prices problems with the availability of products that limited growth have been eliminated which improves telko s potential for growth however the prices of plastic and chemical raw materials were at the comparative period s level despite any decreases in the fourth quarter telko s net sales increased by 6 to eur

kazakhstan and azerbaijan where the initial level was moderate the operating profit rate remained below 5 in the western markets telko s net sales decreased slightly and operating profit improved outlook for telko for 2019 uncertainties over international economic growth have increased the prices of both chemicals and plastics decreased as a result of lower oil prices these prices are expected to continue their slight decrease the prices of volume plastics decreased throughout the second half of 2018 and they are expected to reach the bottom during the first quarter of 2019 in the third quarter of 2018 telko acquired the operations of danish square oil a s square oil is a specialist in lubricants and a distribution company its net sales amounted to approximately eur 3 million the

in order to secure the company s long term development aspo acts like a good corporate citizen in all its operating countries for aspo being a good corporate citizen means bearing its social

treats all of its employees and stakeholders fairly and equally in all its operating countries aspo group s code of conduct and environmental policy form a common set of rules for all businesses aspo

of corporate responsibility in the fields in which the businesses aspo owns operate are reduction in energy consumption and the volume of waste the wellbeing of employees and safe working environment equality and good governance aspo takes climate change seriously and aims to reduce its impact through its actions aspo s businesses continued to develop their responsibility in 2018 all of aspo s businesses have shared and separate indicators that represent the responsibility of their operations aspo s responsibility report will be presented in the year 2018 publication to be released in conjunction with financial statements aspo s application to join the un s global compact initiative was approved in december 2018 and therefore aspo committed to adopting supporting and implementing the ten principles related to human rights working life principles the environment and the prevention of bribery within its scope of influence risks and risk management despite the lower financial indicators the economic outlook is positive in all aspo s market areas economic growth and increased industrial production have decreased financial risks associated with aspo s market areas but general risks can increase when the economic trend reaches its peak increases in political risks are not expected to have any impact on aspo s business operations in the short term import duties imposed by the usa and china which limit international free trade have not affected aspo s operations aspo does not have any business operations that are or would be affected directly by the brexit or its implementation but there may be an indirect impact through the principals or customers of aspo s businesses following the financial crisis the global economy is growing simultaneously in all of aspo s market areas decelerating towards the end of the year in the eurozone development has slowed down partly due to growing political tension related to trade in russia the increase in the gdp and the inflation rate are at the expected levels exports have increased and private consumption and investments have increased slowly general cargo prices in sea transport fluctuated throughout the period under review at the end of the review period the prices started to increase financial risks in all of aspo s businesses have decreased as a result of more stable markets however any unexpected changes in international politics and trade policies combined with rapid changes in exchange rates or commodities markets may have an impact on the demand and competitiveness of the products of aspo s companies the subdued demand for investment commodities which earlier limited growth in both the eastern and western markets has turned into a moderate increase investments have increased in russia even though most of them are still targeted at the energy sector private consumption and export volumes have increased slowly as there have been no structural economic changes economic growth is expected to remain at the previous year s level strategic risks political risks have increased globally which may have a rapid impact on aspo s operating environment and reduce free trade in the short and long term the economic and political situation in aspo s market areas may have made it more difficult to make structural changes as part of aspo s strategy even though some have been implemented recently the situation may continue unchanged but as the economic and political pressure alleviates or increases it may change rapidly the russian economy has stabilized inflation has accelerated slightly and growth is slow deteriorated consumption demand in the long term has affected trade in general but the increase in nominal wages has increased consumption even though inflation has reduced the purchasing power in ukraine the economic situation has stabilized consumer and producer prices are at a moderate level and did not change significantly after the fluctuations early in the year during the review period production volumes were up from the previous year and imports and exports increased albeit at a more moderate rate than in the previous year no signs of weakening have been seen in the financial and payment markets of russia and ukraine but they involve risks that are reflected for example in the russian banking sector companies are now more willing to make investments the promotion of local production has increased the volume of raw materials and items produced in russia in industrial production despite the decrease in quality this may further reduce the position of imported raw materials in the value chain and the margin level but correspondingly an increase in import volumes may increase demand for foreign raw materials and reduce related risks for aspo economic sanctions their increase or other obstacles arising from the economic or political situation in russia may in part reduce transportation volumes originating from russia and the demand for unloading services for large ocean liners at sea protectionist actions may decrease sea transportation in the russian arctic if russia set stricter regulations on internal transportation for example regarding the transport of energy products in finland and the rest of europe social pressures to reduce the use of fossil energy sources in energy production have increased which will reduce coal transportation volumes in the future correspondingly the transportation volumes of replacement energy products will increase due to this change it is difficult to estimate future transportation volumes fluctuations in international freight indices their extended low level and the global increase in the number of vessels particularly in large size categories have increased uncertainty over the long term profitability of shipping companies nevertheless there are signs of an increase in freight indices and of a decrease in the number of vessels in operations in the long term strategic risks may be caused by the deterioration of the global economic situation the political atmosphere protectionism and the outlook and production choices of industrial customers decisions regarding energy production structures affected by environmental policy and other political choices cause changes in industry and energy production that may decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of alternative forms of energy the flow of goods in the baltic sea may change as a result of steel production cost structures changes in the customer structure such as centralization or other reasons these changes may have negative consequences on operations as the need for transportation decreases but they can also be seen as significant opportunities as a result of low cargo prices in international shipping competition over cargoes may also become fiercer in the baltic sea mild ice free winters may also increase competition during the review period esl shipping received two new low emission vessels with better fuel economy for this region and customer base these will also be able to operate in ice conditions the shipping company also completed an acquisition that will significantly improve its competitiveness strategic risks are influenced by long term changes in cargo prices the building of new vessels and the removal of others from the markets investment trends and changes in trade structures especially in western markets in eastern markets risks are increased by such factors as political instability social structures or the lack of reaction to the difficulties encountered by business operations the accumulation and discharge of investments may cause long term changes in the competitive situation and customer behavior trade between eastern and western markets may suffer from restrictions on free trade as a result of which there may be a decrease in the sales of goods and services rapid changes in economic structures may cause risks due to changes in the customer or principal structure or technologies and due to unused opportunities that require a quick response changes in demand as a result of various megatrends may cause changes in the product and service ranges of aspo s subsidiaries due to which it may be difficult to replace their current products disruptive changes may be very rapid aspo s strategic risks are evened out by the distribution of business operations over four segments its engagement in business operations in a broad geographical area and its ability to react quickly to changing situations in addition to western markets aspo operates in areas where economic trends or the political atmosphere may turn rapidly positive or negative which could significantly change the prevailing operating conditions operational risks economic uncertainty in aspo s operating environment was lower during the review period than in the previous year however operational risks remained unchanged these include risks related to supply chains goods and services and persons the threat of different kinds of misuse from outside the company has also increased as a result of the development of electronic media for a long time the focus of aspo s growth has been on emerging market areas where risks decelerating growth are affected by factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates the level of and changes in the global market prices of raw materials industrial and commercial investments customer liquidity changes in legislation and import regulations and inactivity bias or corruption among public authorities economic growth and alternatively any decrease in production may have an impact on demand for raw materials political instability makes commercial activities more difficult and if the situation prolongs it may also decelerate the growth of aspo s businesses consumer behavior and confidence are also reflected in risks associated with b to b customers and their risk levels the growth opportunities presented by emerging markets are encouraging interest among competitors in starting or expanding business operations in these areas the challenging emerging markets and their escalated situations have also caused competitors to withdraw from these markets which has created new potential for aspo s businesses and has increased their market shares hedging against exchange rate changes is not possible in all conditions or in particular at all times changes in exchange rates may reduce profit and equity on the balance sheet as a result of translation differences then again changes in exchange rates may also strengthen results and the balance sheet as changes in credit loss risks are diversified across businesses and customers aspo s businesses have not been subjected to any significant credit losses related to their customers even though credit loss risks have increased and provisions are made for them in accordance with principles of ifrs 9 standard the technical products or applications deployed by aspo s businesses may break or malfunction due to which the increase in profit based on these products or applications may slow down or be delayed sales margins may be reduced and financial claims related to deliveries may emerge if aspo s products are not suited for the customers production processes or do not have the correct technical properties operational risks have also increased as a result of computer related crime malware and the increased number of fraud attempts if realized these risks may mean financial losses for aspo aspo has appropriate information security and internal training arrangements but individual cases may occur due to the decentralized structure of operations any deviations in internal processes may result in losses for example in the form of taxes or official fees the quantity and probability of the group s loss risks are regularly assessed bidding processes are arranged for general insurance policies and the amounts insured are regularly updated the amounts insured are sufficient in view of the scope of aspo s operations but insurance companies may restrict the validity of insurance policies as a

current level or decrease the national economy and industrial production are growing moderately in russia an important market area for aspo while international sanctions and their possible increase have maintained uncertainties regarding the development of the russian economy general political risks continue to increase and this may have rapid effects on the operating environment or decrease free trade also affecting the operating conditions of customers of aspo s businesses economic conditions will remain favorable in aspo s businesses even though there is always the risk of rapid changes aki ojanen ceo of aspo group comments on the fourth quarter and financial year aspo s net sales continued to increase significantly and the operating profit adjusted by the impairment loss recognized on kauko s goodwill improved clearly even though aspo s profitability has developed positively and all main businesses increased their operating profit during the fourth quarter we have not been able to use the full potential of all businesses esl shipping accounted for a significant part of the increase in aspo s net sales esl shipping s new environmentally friendly vessels and the acquisition of swedish shipping company atob c had a positive effect on its net sales in the fourth quarter eastern markets an area important to aspo developed well with net sales during the fourth quarter growing by 12 during the fourth quarter the impairment loss of eur 4 8 million recognized on kauko s goodwill strained aspo s operating profit serious technical problems with cranes slowed down the deployment of esl shipping s new vessels this also reduced profit for the fourth quarter cargotec macgregor the crane supplier is committed to completing its warranty repairs during the first quarter of 2019 we can be satisfied with the operation of the energy and environmental efficiency systems of the new vessels when we can raise the reliability and efficiency of the loading and unloading operations of the new vessels to the planned level the vessels will meet our high profitability requirements and they can be placed to intended customers cargo deliveries during the 2018 financial year net sales reached a new record level of eur 541 million the operating profit for the financial year adjusted by the impairment loss recognized on goodwill stood at eur 25 4 million

4 7 outlook for 2019 global economic growth is expected to slow down economies in russia and eastern markets will continue their moderate increase while political risks and international sanctions imposed on russia have maintained a high level of risks in the market area meaning that future development is difficult to predict the risk of increasing obstacles to international free trade has remained and negative development may also be rapid which may affect the operating prerequisites of aspo s principals customer companies or aspo s businesses exchange rates are expected to continue to fluctuate heavily economic growth in the eu and particularly in finland remains at good level while the growth in finnish export volumes has decelerated the increase in industrial production is expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s businesses in northern europe the boom will continue in aspo s businesses even though there is always the risk of rapid changes the prices of industrial raw materials and oil that are important to aspo are expected to remain at their current low level dry bulk freight rates in sea transportation that are important to esl shipping are expected to remain at their current level aspo s business operations esl shipping esl shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the baltic sea region at the end of the financial year the shipping company s fleet consisted of 49 vessels with a total capacity of 464 000 dwt of the vessels 22 are wholly owned two are minority owned one is leased and the remaining 24 are time chartered esl shipping s competitive edge is based on its ability to secure product and raw material transportation for the industries and energy production round the year even in difficult weather conditions

dry bulk cargo decreased slightly during the fourth quarter being at the same level as in the year before at the end of the quarter duties and sanctions that potentially restrict international free trade have increased uncertainties over continued international growth during the fourth quarter the shipping company s vessels mainly operated in contract traffic in the baltic sea and in northern europe and also performed loading and unloading operations at sea transportation operations in the baltic sea and the north sea are mainly based on long term customer agreements and established customer relationships operations from the canadian arctic to europe continued as in previous years until the end of the season in november the numerous storms in late autumn caused lay days in vessel operations and additional costs also as a result of higher fuel consumption esl shipping s net sales in the fourth quarter increased significantly as a result of higher transportation volumes the completion of the new vessels and the increase in the vessel capacity through the acquisition of atob c as part of its growth strategy esl shipping completed the acquisition of swedish shipping company atob c on august 31 2018 its figures are included in the shipping company s financial reporting starting from the beginning of september net sales for the fourth quarter grew by 105 from the comparative period to eur 46 4 22 6 million the impact of the acquisition on the increase in net sales was eur 20 0 million in the fourth quarter operating profit for the fourth quarter was eur 4 2 4 1 million the operating profit rate for the period of 9 1 18 1 was not satisfactory considering long term target fluctuations in the prices of ship fuel were unusually high during the fourth quarter the highest prices of the year were recorded in the middle of october after which prices fell rapidly by more than 30 to the lowest level of the year fuel prices mainly have an impact on net sales through fuel clauses included in agreements however extreme short term fluctuations have also some impact on results transportation volumes in the steel industry increased from the comparative period but were lower than expected due to production problems at certain plants and congestion at ports in the energy industry the transportation volumes of coal decreased slightly as expected from the comparative period the transportation volumes of biofuels increased as expected transportation volumes in other customer sectors increased significantly in particular as a result of new product groups and customers brought by the business acquisition the cargo volume carried by esl shipping during the final quarter amounted to 4 5 3 3 million tons demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea was at the usual level in the fourth quarter being however lower compared with the very high demand in the previous year through the acquisition of atob c esl shipping also strengthened its position in the smaller vessel category the shipping company s operations diversified significantly as it expanded its service range and customer base from the transportation of raw materials to industrial products esl shipping will continue its development to offer more environmentally friendly and efficient transportation solutions to meet its customers future needs in the fourth quarter two smaller wholly owned vessels and both party owned vessels were docked as planned in november atob c acquired a 4 100 dwt dry cargo vessel of ice class 1a built in 2000 the shipping company had already operated the vessel through long term time chartering and it also owns the vessel s sister ship in the fourth quarter esl shipping started activities to reach synergy benefits and profitability target level in addition it strengthened its operating and sales resources through recruitment processes in order to ensure the high and efficient use of its vessel capacity all important and expiring customer agreements were renewed as targeted during the fourth quarter in addition the shipping company signed new agreements and expanded existing agreements at a highly satisfactory cargo level ms viikki and ms haaga the world s first ice strengthened dry bulk cargo vessels fueled by liquefied natural gas have started their operations the vessels fulfil the high goals set for them for example in terms of load bearing capacity fuel economy and eco friendliness in the fourth quarter both vessels arrived safely and fully laden to the baltic sea via the northern sea route which is shorter than the route via the panama canal by three weeks significantly reducing the environmental impact of the voyage however extensive and serious problems in the conventional mechanics of high power cranes which are subject to warranty have significantly interfered with the efficient operations of both vessels these have resulted in significant loss of income and additional costs for the shipping company this problem concerns all the cranes on both vessels due to the delivery times of spare parts repairs are expected to be completed only at the end of the first quarter of 2019 during this time the vessels cannot be operated fully efficiently as planned in 2018 esl shipping improved its profitability and its operating profit stood at eur 15 1 13 5 million the operating profit includes eur 0 9 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition the shipping company s net sales grew by 51 in january december to eur 120 1 79 3 million in 2018 the cargo volume carried by esl shipping amounted to 13 4 11 4 million tons outlook for esl shipping for 2019 the shipping company s vessel capacity increased significantly as a result of the atob c acquisition and the completion of its two new vessels due to serious warranty repairs involving the cranes of the new vessels the financial performance of the vessels can only reach the targeted level starting from the second quarter the increase in capacity enables the company to improve its operational efficiency and profitability especially during the second half of the year when there is typically a shortage of vessel capacity economic growth is expected to slow down in the shipping company s main market areas in finland any disputes resulting from collective bargaining in the transportation sector may have an impact on the operations of customer companies and transportation chains during spring actions directed at international free trade an increase in political risks and decelerating economic growth in china may have an impact on global flows of goods the vessel capacity in the vessel categories operated by the shipping company will increase slowly and the availability of leased high quality vessels may be limited particularly in the smaller vessel category the development of the cargo markets in 2019 will be most directly reflected in the financial performance of the largest supramax vessels of the shipping company most of the shipping company s transportation capacity has been secured in the baltic sea and northern europe through long term agreements the current forecasts of general transportation volumes of contractual partners are highly satisfactory in all key customer segments even though there are uncertainties in demand due to political situation and increased economic uncertainty general demand in the steel industry is high and transportation volumes are expected to develop very positively and improve significantly starting from the second quarter demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea a segment important to the shipping company is expected to remain high furthermore demand for raw material and product transportation in the forest industry an important sector for the shipping company s smaller vessel category is expected to continue strong total transportation volumes in the energy industry are expected to increase from the previous year as a result of higher demand for the transportation of bioenergy the biofuel transportation markets in the baltic sea are expected to grow significantly in the near future the transportation volumes of coal will decrease as expected during 2019 three vessels of the larger category and one smaller vessel will be docked as planned in addition the docking of time chartered vessels will affect the available vessel capacity the content of the time chartering portfolio will be reviewed if necessary in accordance with any changes in demand ice conditions in the baltic sea area are expected to be normal during winter and spring wind conditions will have an impact on the development of pack ice which may be reflected in the efficiency of operations esl shipping aims at net sales of more than eur 200 million and an operating profit rate of 12 15 by 2020 leipurin leipurin is a unique provider of solutions for bakery and confectionery products and the out of home foodservice market the solutions offered by leipurin range for example from product development recipes raw materials training and equipment all the way to

consumer price of food increased in finland and the rate of inflation accelerated slightly in russia remaining however at a low level the prices of raw materials important to leipurin showed variation from one raw material group to the next and the market prices of seasonal products continued to increase during the fourth quarter the market for industrially packed bread continues to decrease in the west whereas the market of in store bakeries and baking units has continued to increase this change presents challenges in the operations of industrial bakeries in 2017 a change took place in russia as a result of which bakeries are no longer responsible for retail bread wastage instead any unsold bread is covered by the retail industry the change has significantly reduced the production of packed bread and reduced net sales compared with the comparative period however this change has increased the markets for in shop bakeries in russia where leipurin has gained a strong market position

leipurin in the fourth quarter decreased from the comparative period to eur 31 6 32 9 million this decrease was mainly attributable to the timing of project deliveries in machinery operations net sales in ukraine and russia and in certain baltic countries increased the operating profit of eur 0 8 0 7 million was not at the targeted level the operating profit includes costs from the discontinuation of loss producing operations such as raw material operations in poland operations in eastern markets in particular improved profitability the operating profit rate during the quarter was 2 5 2 1 net sales of bakery raw materials in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased in the fourth quarter by 2 to eur 9 1 8 9 million the operating profit rate was approximately 9 10 net sales in the eastern markets including machinery sales increased by approximately 14 to eur 11 8 10 3 million and the operating profit rate was approximately 10 10 in western markets the total net sales of raw material and foodservice operations were at the comparative period s level the decreasing profitability of the loss producing test cafeteria operations and costs from discontinuation of raw material operations in poland and a test cafeteria had a negative impact on the operating profit in finland the total net sales of raw material and foodservice operations were at the comparative period s level even though the volume of industrial sales fell the net sales of foodservice operations increased in finland from the comparative period as a result of the procurement and logistics services of a new significant chain customer currently foodservice operations do not account for any significant part of net sales the net sales of machinery operations fell by roughly 20 due to the timing of project deliveries in leipurin s own machine production and deliveries of principals equipment cyclicality is typical of leipurin s machinery operations due to the timing of revenue recognition related to bakery lines and projects leipurin s net sales in january december fell to eur 121 0 million 122 3 the net sales of raw material operations decreased by 3 due to the divestment completed at the end of august 2017 where leipurin sold its meat industry raw material business to mp maustepalvelut oy leipurin s operating profit improved to eur 3 3 3 1 million the operating profit during the comparative period included sales gains of eur 0 4 million from the sale of meat industry raw material business and compensation of eur 0 5 million for a project delivery completed by leipurin in 2014 including processing fees the operating profit during january december was strained by the further decrease in loss producing operations such as raw material operations in poland and by costs from the discontinuation of loss producing operations in addition exchange rate losses and increased resources in foodservice operations reduced the operating profit net sales in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased by 3 6 to eur 36 3 35 0 million profitability in this market area remained at the comparative period s level approximately at 8 8 outlook for leipurin for 2019 the market situation is expected to remain challenging in leipurin s key markets the development of leipurin s main customer categories i e bakeries and foodservice chains continues to vary from one customer to the next for example many bakeries in finland announced in 2018 that their operations will discontinue this reduces the net sales of leipurin s operations in finland the market position of leipurin is expected to remain strong in the industrial baking sector in finland russia and the baltic region the operating profit of leipurin is expected to increase in 2019 in russia the national economy and the purchasing power of consumers are in moderate growth while international sanctions and their possible increase have added to the uncertainties regarding the development of the russian economy exchange rate changes have reduced leipurin s price competitiveness in eastern markets however leipurin will continue to develop the procurement of bakery raw materials in the area in order to better respond to any changes in demand leipurin will maintain its high profitability in the region strengthen its market position and look for growth in the bread and pastry sectors as well as in store bakeries the foodservice market is a significant area of growth for leipurin leipurin will continue to invest in the foodservice market particularly in finland and the western markets where leipurin is responding for example to the growing demand of chain customers such as cafés and fast food restaurants the company has further developed its operations targeted at foodservice chains offering both procurement and logistics services to chain customers the large logistics volumes of leipurin as well as its efficiency and expertise allow the development and expansion of its operations in terms of machinery operations bakeries are expected to maintain their current equipment investment level in finland and the baltic countries a moderate increase in investments is expected in russia the expansion of the procurement network for leipurin s own machine production and the development of manufacturing and installation lead times will continue in machinery operations the order book shows variation between quarters currently orders focus on the latter half of 2019 due to customers project schedules the increase in the leipurin s own machine production will be driven by increased industrial investments in leipurin s home markets and elsewhere in europe telko telko is a leading expert and supplier of plastic raw materials and industrial chemicals its

trend however the prices of technical plastics started to decrease clearly during the final quarter the prices of industrial chemicals that are important to telko have remained high in the long term but turned to a slight decrease during the fourth quarter as a result of lower oil prices problems with the availability of products that limited growth have been eliminated which improves telko s potential for growth however the prices of plastic and chemical raw materials were at the comparative period s level despite any decreases in the fourth quarter telko s net sales increased by 6 to eur

kazakhstan and azerbaijan where the initial level was moderate the operating profit rate remained below 5 in the western markets telko s net sales decreased slightly and operating profit improved outlook for telko for 2019 uncertainties over international economic growth have increased the prices of both chemicals and plastics decreased as a result of lower oil prices these prices are expected to continue their slight decrease the prices of volume plastics decreased throughout the second half of 2018 and they are expected to reach the bottom during the first quarter of 2019 in the third quarter of 2018 telko acquired the operations of danish square oil a s square oil is a specialist in lubricants and a distribution company its net sales amounted to approximately eur 3 million the integration of square oil into telko will continue the positive impact of synergy benefits will be fully visible in telko s results during the second half of 2019 telko has launched a significant strategy project to improve the efficiency of procurement telko s raw material purchases comprise the largest expense item and the improved efficiency of the procurement operations is assessed to improve telko s profitability the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 telko s strategic targets for 2020 will remain unchanged the target is to have net sales of eur 300 350 million and an operating profit rate of 6 7 telko can reach these targets by continuing its growth in its current key market areas and by possibly expanding its operations to new geographic areas success in telko s strategic growth projects is another key factor the development of profitability is based on efficient procurement activities technical products offering more added value the development of logistics and more active pricing in russia telko will continue to strengthen its regional organizations according to its strategy telko will increase efforts in special chemicals of a higher processing rate and the life science segment in the eastern markets r d operations have increased in order to develop the range of alternative plastic raw materials furthermore telko aims to increase

and board of directors of aspo group are responsible for the management of corporate responsibility in accordance with the company s risk management policy ensuring corporate responsibility is vital in order to secure the company s long term development aspo acts like a good corporate citizen in all its operating countries for aspo being a good corporate citizen means bearing its social responsibilities as demonstrated by the way aspo always pays its taxes in the country where it has made its profit only a responsibly led growing company can create jobs tax revenue and wellbeing aspo treats all of its employees and stakeholders fairly and equally in all its operating countries aspo group s code of conduct and environmental policy form a common set of rules for all businesses aspo s key operations consist of the development of the trade and logistics businesses it owns above all aspo approaches corporate responsibility through responsible leadership and management key aspects of corporate responsibility in the fields in which the businesses aspo owns operate are reduction in energy consumption and the volume of waste the wellbeing of employees and safe working environment equality and good governance aspo takes climate change seriously and aims to reduce its impact through its actions aspo s businesses continued to develop their responsibility in 2018 all of aspo s businesses have shared and separate indicators that represent the responsibility of their operations aspo s responsibility report will be presented in the year 2018 publication to be released in conjunction with financial statements aspo s application to join the un s global compact initiative was approved in december 2018 and therefore aspo committed to adopting supporting and implementing the ten principles related to human rights working life principles the environment and the prevention of bribery within its scope of influence risks and risk management despite the lower financial indicators the economic outlook is positive in all aspo s market areas economic growth and increased industrial production have decreased financial risks associated with aspo s market areas but general risks can increase when the economic trend reaches its peak increases in political risks are not expected to have any impact on aspo s business operations in the short term import duties imposed by the usa and china which limit international free trade have not affected aspo s operations aspo does not have any business operations that are or would be affected directly by the brexit or its implementation but there may be an indirect impact through the principals or customers of aspo s businesses following the financial crisis the global economy is growing simultaneously in all of aspo s market areas decelerating towards the end of the year in the eurozone development has slowed down partly due to growing political tension related to trade in russia the increase in the gdp and the inflation rate are at the expected levels exports have increased and private consumption and investments have increased slowly general cargo prices in sea transport fluctuated throughout the period under review at the end of the review period the prices started to increase financial risks in all of aspo s businesses have decreased as a result of more stable markets however any unexpected changes in international politics and trade policies combined with rapid changes in exchange rates or commodities markets may have an impact on the demand and competitiveness of the products of aspo s companies the subdued demand for investment commodities which earlier limited growth in both the eastern and western markets has turned into a moderate increase investments have increased in russia even though most of them are still targeted at the energy sector private consumption and export volumes have increased slowly as there have been no structural economic changes economic growth is expected to remain at the previous year s level strategic risks political risks have increased globally which may have a rapid impact on aspo s operating environment and reduce free trade in the short and long term the economic and political situation in aspo s market areas may have made it more difficult to make structural changes as part of aspo s strategy even though some have been implemented recently the situation may continue unchanged but as the economic and political pressure alleviates or increases it may change rapidly the russian economy has stabilized inflation has accelerated slightly and growth is slow deteriorated consumption demand in the long term has affected trade in general but the increase in nominal wages has increased consumption even though inflation has reduced the purchasing power in ukraine the economic situation has stabilized consumer and producer prices are at a moderate level and did not change significantly after the fluctuations early in the year during the review period production volumes were up from the previous year and imports and exports increased albeit at a more moderate rate than in the previous year no signs of weakening have been seen in the financial and payment markets of russia and ukraine but they involve risks that are reflected for example in the russian banking sector companies are now more willing to make investments the promotion of local production has increased the volume of raw materials and items produced in russia in industrial production despite the decrease in quality this may further reduce the position of imported raw materials in the value chain and the margin level but correspondingly an increase in import volumes may increase demand for foreign raw materials and reduce related risks for aspo economic sanctions their increase or other obstacles arising from the economic or political situation in russia may in part reduce transportation volumes originating from russia and the demand for unloading services for large ocean liners at sea protectionist actions may decrease sea transportation in the russian arctic if russia set stricter regulations on internal transportation for example regarding the transport of energy products in finland and the rest of europe social pressures to reduce the use of fossil energy sources in energy production have increased which will reduce coal transportation volumes in the future correspondingly the transportation volumes of replacement energy products will increase due to this change it is difficult to estimate future transportation volumes fluctuations in international freight indices their extended low level and the global increase in the number of vessels particularly in large size categories have increased uncertainty over the long term profitability of shipping companies nevertheless there are signs of an increase in freight indices and of a decrease in the number of vessels in operations in the long term strategic risks may be caused by the deterioration of the global economic situation the political atmosphere protectionism and the outlook and production choices of industrial customers decisions regarding energy production structures affected by environmental policy and other political choices cause changes in industry and energy production that may decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of alternative forms of energy the flow of goods in the baltic sea may change as a result of steel production cost structures changes in the customer structure such as centralization or other reasons these changes may have negative consequences on operations as the need for transportation decreases but they can also be seen as significant opportunities as a result of low cargo prices in international shipping competition over cargoes may also become fiercer in the baltic sea mild ice free winters may also increase competition during the review period esl shipping received two new low emission vessels with better fuel economy for this region and customer base these will also be able to operate in ice conditions the shipping company also completed an acquisition that will significantly improve its competitiveness strategic risks are influenced by long term changes in cargo prices the building of new vessels and the removal of others from the markets investment trends and changes in trade structures especially in western markets in eastern markets risks are increased by such factors as political instability social structures or the lack of reaction to the difficulties encountered by business operations the accumulation and discharge of investments may cause long term changes in the competitive situation and customer behavior trade between eastern and western markets may suffer from restrictions on free trade as a result of which there may be a decrease in the sales of goods and services rapid changes in economic structures may cause risks due to changes in the customer or principal structure or technologies and due to unused opportunities that require a quick response changes in demand as a result of various megatrends may cause changes in the product and service ranges of aspo s subsidiaries due to which it may be difficult to replace their current products disruptive changes may be very rapid aspo s strategic risks are evened out by the distribution of business operations over four segments its engagement in business operations in a broad geographical area and its ability to react quickly to changing situations in addition to western markets aspo operates in areas where economic trends or the political atmosphere may turn rapidly positive or negative which could significantly change the prevailing operating conditions operational risks economic uncertainty in aspo s operating environment was lower during the review period than in the previous year however operational risks remained unchanged these include risks related to supply chains goods and services and persons the threat of different kinds of misuse from outside the company has also increased as a result of the development of electronic media for a long time the focus of aspo s growth has been on emerging market areas where risks decelerating growth are affected by factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates the level of and changes in the global market prices of raw materials industrial and commercial investments customer liquidity changes in legislation and import regulations and inactivity bias or corruption among public authorities economic growth and alternatively any decrease in production may have an impact on demand for raw materials political instability makes commercial activities more difficult and if the situation prolongs it may also decelerate the growth of aspo s businesses consumer behavior and confidence are also reflected in risks associated with b to b customers and their risk levels the growth opportunities presented by emerging markets are encouraging interest among competitors in starting or expanding business operations in these areas the challenging emerging markets and their escalated situations have also caused competitors to withdraw from these markets which has created new potential for aspo s businesses and has increased their market shares hedging against exchange rate changes is not possible in all conditions or in particular at all times changes in exchange rates may reduce profit and equity on the balance sheet as a result of translation differences then again changes in exchange rates may also strengthen results and the balance sheet as changes in credit loss risks are diversified across businesses and customers aspo s businesses have not been subjected to any significant credit losses related to their customers even though credit loss risks have increased and provisions are made for them in accordance with principles of ifrs 9 standard the technical products or applications deployed by aspo s businesses may break or malfunction due to which the increase in profit based on these products or applications may slow down or be delayed sales margins may be reduced and financial claims related to deliveries may emerge if aspo s products are not suited for the customers production processes or do not have the correct technical properties operational risks have also increased as a result of computer related crime malware and the increased number of fraud attempts if realized these risks may mean financial losses for aspo aspo has appropriate information security and internal training arrangements but individual cases may occur due to the decentralized structure of operations any deviations in internal processes may result in losses for example in the form of taxes or official fees the quantity and probability of the group s loss risks are regularly assessed bidding processes are arranged for general insurance policies and the amounts insured are regularly updated the amounts insured are sufficient in view of the scope of aspo s operations but insurance companies may restrict the validity of insurance policies as a result of risks increasing for various reasons such as in war areas internal control and risk management one of the responsibilities of aspo s audit committee is to monitor the efficiency of the group s internal control internal audits and risk management systems the audit committee monitors the risk management process and instructs necessary measures to prevent strategic risks in particular in accordance with the internal control principles approved by the board of directors risk management is part of aspo s internal control and its task is to ensure the implementation of the group s strategy development of financial results shareholder value dividend payment ability and continuity in business operations the operational management of each business is responsible for risk management the management is responsible for specifying sufficient measures and their implementation and for monitoring and ensuring that the measures are implemented as part of day to day operational

discussion of equinix s results and future outlook along with certain supplemental financial information and other data interested parties may access this information through the equinix investor relations website at www equinix com investors additional resources about equinix equinix inc nasdaq eqix connects the world s leading businesses to their customers employees and partners inside the most interconnected data centers in 52 markets across five continents equinix is where companies come together to realize new opportunities and accelerate their business it and cloud strategies non gaap financial measures equinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures accordingly equinix uses non gaap financial measures to evaluate its operations equinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates which are calculated to adjust for acquisitions dispositions integration costs changes in accounting principles and foreign currency equinix presents adjusted ebitda which is a non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda represents income or loss from operations excluding depreciation amortization accretion stock based compensation expense restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs and gain or loss on asset sales in presenting non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda cash cost of revenues cash gross margins cash operating expenses also known as cash selling general and administrative expenses or cash sg a adjusted ebitda margins free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow equinix excludes certain items that it believes are not good indicators of equinix s current or future operating performance these items are depreciation amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges stock based compensation restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs and gain or loss on asset sales equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders investors and the industry analysts who review and report on equinix to better evaluate equinix s operating performance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors equinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of an ibx data center and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business its ibx data centers are long lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years the construction costs of an ibx data center do not recur with respect to such data center although equinix may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional ibx data centers and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to the initial investment this is a trend it expects to continue in addition depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of the ibx data centers these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset are based on historic costs incurred to build out our ibx data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures therefore equinix excludes depreciation from its operating results when evaluating its operations in addition in presenting the non gaap financial measures equinix also excludes amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period we exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods equinix excludes accretion expense both as it relates to its asset retirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges as these expenses represent costs which equinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating equinix s current operations equinix excludes stock based compensation expense as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price and the timing size and nature of equity awards as such equinix and many investors and analysts exclude stock based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other companies equinix excludes restructuring charges from its non gaap financial measures the restructuring charges relate to equinix s decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of its ibx data centers which it did not intend to build out or its decision to reverse such restructuring charges equinix also excludes impairment charges related to certain long lived assets the impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets are not recoverable equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance finally equinix excludes acquisition costs from its non gaap financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons of the financial results to the historical operations the acquisition costs relate to costs equinix incurs in connection with business combinations such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long term performance of equinix in addition the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions management believes items such as restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non core transactions however these types of costs may occur in future periods equinix also presents funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo which are non gaap financial measures commonly used in the reit industry ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit ffo represents net income or loss excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and non controlling interests share of these items affo represents ffo excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non real estate assets accretion stock based compensation restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs an installation revenue adjustment a straight line rent expense adjustment a contract cost adjustment amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums gain or loss on debt extinguishment an income tax expense adjustment recurring capital expenditures net income or loss from discontinued operations net of tax and adjustments from ffo to affo for unconsolidated joint ventures and non controlling interests share of these items equinix excludes depreciation expense amortization expense accretion stock based compensation restructuring charges impairment charges and acquisition costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the other non gaap financial measures mentioned above equinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation equinix includes an adjustment for straight line rent expense on its operating leases since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs incurred to obtain contracts since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight line basis although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid during the period of obtaining the contracts the adjustments for installation revenues straight line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations equinix excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations equinix excludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of equinix s current or future operating performance equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment which represents the non cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that do not relate to the current period s operations equinix excludes recurring capital expenditures which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its ibx data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues equinix also excludes net income or loss from discontinued operations net of tax which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance equinix presents constant currency results of operations which is a non gaap financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to gaap results of operations however equinix has presented this non gaap financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of equinix s business performance to present this information equinix s current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities with functional currencies other than the u s dollar are converted into u s dollars at a consistent exchange rate for purposes of each result being compared non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation but should be considered together with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures equinix presents such non gaap financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core ongoing business operations management believes that the inclusion of these non gaap financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods equinix believes that if it did not provide such non gaap financial information investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze equinix effectively investors should note that the non gaap financial measures used by equinix may not be the same non gaap financial measures and may not be calculated in the same manner as those of other companies investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non gaap financial measures used by us to similarly titled non gaap financial measures of other companies equinix does not provide forward looking guidance for certain financial data such as depreciation amortization accretion stock based compensation net income or loss from operations cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities and as a result is not able to provide a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures for forward looking data without unreasonable effort the impact of such adjustments could be significant equinix intends to calculate the various non gaap financial measures in future periods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially from expectations discussed in such forward looking statements factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to the challenges of acquiring operating and constructing ibx data centers and developing deploying and delivering equinix products and solutions unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to the integration of companies we have acquired or will acquire into equinix a failure to receive significant revenues from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers failure to complete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time competition from existing and new competitors the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or outstanding indebtedness the loss or decline in business from our key customers risks related to our taxation as a reit and other risks described from time to

by spencer p morrison nee steve hanke recently set out to prove why president trump s trade message and protectionist policies are rubbish in a forbes article instead the johns hopkins university economist exposed himself as a word mincing logic twisting sophist just like every other intellectual mercenary associated with the faux libertarian propaganda mill that is the cato institute hanke s argument trade deficits don t exist china is not screwing america and president trump the village idiot is jousting windmills the real problem is lazy americans who shop til they drop and demand welfare gimmies from uncle sam faust s bargain hanke begins his argument by explaining that trade deficits don t really exist instead the goods trade deficit is simply one half of the equation in economics identities play an important role these identities are obtained by equating two different breakdowns of a single aggregate identities are interesting and usually important by definition in national income accounting the following identity can be derived it is the key to understanding the trade deficit imports exports investment savings government spending taxes given this identity which must hold the trade deficit is equal to the excess of private sector investment over savings plus the excess of government spending over tax revenue so the counterpart of the trade deficit is the sum of the private sector deficit and the government deficit federal state and local the u s trade deficit therefore is just the mirror image of what is happening in the u s domestic economy if expenditures in the u s exceed the incomes produced in the u s which they do the excess expenditures will be met by an excess of imports over exports read a trade deficit this is true in his esoteric discussion of identities however hanke neglects to mention the practical consequences of running a goods trade deficit although the books are balanced reality shows us that it matters how they are balanced there are two sides to every coin but heads is not the same as tails i ve explained previously how america sold its soul for chinese trinkets you should read the full article it is my personal favorite if you don t have time here s a quick summary when a nation imports buys more than it exports sells it runs a trade deficit america s goods trade deficit was 796 billion in 2017 sadly there are no free lunches to pay for these goods america sells more services than it buys think banking and tourism this helps but still leaves us 566 billion in the red to balance the books america also sells assets and debt assets include real estate artifacts shares in corporations anything of value that was produced in the past selling assets is not always bad for example selling your mothballed harley to buy a home gym might be wise however pawning your great grandma s wedding ring to buy groceries is not context matters on the whole america s asset sales resemble pawning great grandma s wedding ring consider that foreigners bought 153 billion worth of american real estate in the 2016 2017 fiscal year everything from new york penthouses to nebraskan ranches this has the negative downstream effect of increasing housing prices and rents in addition to the social problems associated with absentee landlords the united states also sells billions in equities ownership of u s corporations and the associated profits as of 2017 foreigners owned roughly 38 percent of american equities when including foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio investments this is up from just 12 percent in 2007 and the number is growing fast america pays for the rest of the deficit by selling debt this is reflected in the endless growth of u s public and private debt levels for example foreign investors own over 44 percent of america s national public debt valued at more than 6 3 trillion hanke is good enough to mention this figure in his article but erroneously reverses the causal sequence further foreign investors own nearly 30 percent of all u s corporate bonds and a large percentage of america s monstrous private debt america pays for foreign goods by selling our inheritance and mortgaging our future in turn we surrender control of our nation to foreign masters conversely if america ran a trade surplus we would be purchasing foreign assets and debts we d be buying up the world like great britain during the 19th century we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us who cares if the books are balanced what matters is how they re balanced skyfall hanke s second line of argumentation is that trade deficits assuming they exist aren t a problem after all the u s has run a trade deficit every year since 1976 and the u s has done relatively well since then hanke needs to get out more the sky isn t just falling it fell not only is the trade deficit largely to blame for america s ballooning debt and skyrocketing housing costs it also costs americans jobs and increases inequality trade deficits destroy jobs consider that the north american free trade agreement displaces a net 840 000 american manufacturing jobs how offshoring led to trade deficits with mexico before nafta tariffs protected american industries from asymmetrical mexican competition by normalizing price externalities in other words tariffs raised the cost of mexican goods to account for the fact that american businesses were subject to higher labor environmental and quality standards essentially tariffs penalized companies that moved abroad to avoid american laws this resulted in balanced bilateral trade nafta eliminated many market barriers and forced american workers to compete directly with cheap mexican labor this created a powerful incentive to move american factories to mexico and move they did lori wallach director of public citizen s global trade watch estimates that nafta redistributed a net 840 000 american manufacturing jobs to mexico meanwhile the economic policy institute estimated in 2013 that nafta displaced a net 700 000 american workers finally u s trade representative robert lighthizer also noted in a press release that nafta cost the united states 700 000 jobs remember these are net figures they include the jobs nafta created by boosting american exports nafta also displaces a large number of service jobs this is because manufacturing is an anchor industry upon which predicate industries depend for example hairdressers and accountants move to towns with mines or factories not vice versa the bureau of economic analysis estimates that each manufacturing job supports roughly 1 5 service jobs because of the multiplier effect in short nafta costs america a net 1 7 million jobs this problem is not to specific to nafta the logic of market asymmetries means that whenever america freely trades with a poorer country the inevitable trade deficit will destroy more american jobs than it creates because labor intensive industries are the most likely to offshore after all they have the most to gain from lower wages the trade deficit also hurts america by increasing economic and therefore political and social inequality the driving force behind inequality is once again offshoring moving millions of manufacturing jobs abroad creates unemployment it also results in more competition for the remaining blue collar jobs therefore decreasing wages for everyone else this is basic supply and demand in action it is not a coincidence that wages have stagnated for the vast majority of americans since our nation began running chronic trade deficits in the 1970s inequality is not merely an economic problem it s a political and social problem why too much inequality destabilizes society aristotle recognized this in his politics and recommended that the state should be governed by a large robust middle class likewise the godfather of modern conservatism edmund burke noted that inequality was one of the primary reasons france succumbed to its bloody revolution the main point here is that societies function best when everyone has something to lose should they collapse ipso facto inequality matters a dragon fed hanke s final point is the trade deficit is not made by foreigners who engage in unfair trade practices instead it is a home grown problem i suppose professor hanke has never heard of china before china s entire trade regime was designed to fleece american consumers for example when china opened its doors to american investment in 1985 it specifically focused on export oriented industries companies that built factories in china with the express purpose of exporting the production were given generous subsidies and access to artificially cheap labor from the beginning of its resurgence china s goal was to be the seller not the buyer a bbc radio program on which i was featured noted that china meticulously follows the dictates of the world trade organization wto today although this point is often made by academics like hanke it s not compelling who cares if china plays by the rules now at this point they ve already secured an insurmountable competitive advantage in manufacturing due to the law of increasing returns the bigger the factory the cheaper its production the chinese abused the rules when it was to their benefit and now attempt to uphold them for their benefit international law is meaningless to china the chinese only care about wealth one of the main reasons america runs a trade deficit with china is that china jealously guards its lucrative domestic market by and large western companies cannot operate in china those granted the privilege are often forced into partnerships with chinese companies which siphon off a portion of the profits and serve as important vectors for intellectual property theft this costs america up to 600 billion annually this practice allowed china to evolve an independent and hugely profitable economic ecosystem just look at china s information technologies sector by blocking amazon china preserved the market niche for a domestic competitor alibaba today alibaba is one of china s most valuable companies and is amazon s only viable global competitor contrary to what hanke claims china is indeed ripping us off that said i am forced to agree with his conclusion china isn t causing the trade deficit the shame rests solely with us america is not a passive actor we could rebuild our tariff walls to halt offshoring and eliminate the trade deficit we simply choose not to

developments include canadian natural gas pipelines coastal gaslink pipeline project in october 2018 we announced that we are proceeding with construction of the coastal gaslink pipeline project following the lng canada joint venture participants announcement that they had reached a positive final investment decision fid to build the lng canada natural gas liquefaction facility in kitimat b c coastal gaslink will provide the natural gas supply to the lng canada facility and is underpinned by 25 year tsas with additional renewal provisions with each of the five lng canada participants coastal gaslink will be a 670 km 416 miles pipeline with an initial capacity of approximately 2 2 pj d 2 1 bcf d with potential expansion capacity up to 5 4 pj d 5 0 bcf d all necessary regulatory permits have been received to allow us to proceed with construction activities which began in december 2018 with a planned in service date in 2023 coastal gaslink has signed project and community agreements with all 20 elected indigenous bands along the pipeline route confirming strong support from indigenous communities across the province of b c in july 2018 an individual asked the national energy board neb to consider whether the coastal gaslink pipeline should be federally regulated by the neb in october 2018 the neb advised that it would consider the question of jurisdiction granted coastal gaslink standing in the matter and reserved the right to decide on the participation of all other potentially interested parties including the individual who raised the question in december 2018 the neb issued a process letter addressing participation and set the schedule which is expected to conclude in the second half of 2019 with a decision to follow the coastal gaslink capital cost estimate is 6 2 billion with the majority of the construction spend occurring in 2020 and 2021 subject to terms and conditions differences between the estimated capital cost and final cost of the project will be recovered in future pipeline tolls as part of the coastal gaslink funding plan we are exploring joint venture partners and project financing the total capital cost includes pre fid costs incurred of 470 million in accordance with provisions in the agreements with the lng canada joint venture participants all five parties elected to reimburse us for their share of pre fid costs totaling 470 million in november 2018 in addition in january 2019 all five partners elected to make cash payments throughout the construction period with respect to carrying charges on costs incurred ngtl system in october 2018 we announced the ngtl system 2022 expansion program to meet capacity requirements for incremental firm receipt and intra basin delivery services to commence in november 2021 and april 2022 this 1 5 billion expansion of the ngtl system consists of approximately 197 km 122 miles of new pipeline three compressor units meter stations and associated facilities applications for approvals to construct and operate the facilities are expected to be filed with the neb in second quarter 2019 and pending receipt of regulatory approvals construction would start as early as third quarter 2020 the ngtl capital program excluding maintenance capital expenditures is now approximately 8 6 billion canadian mainline in december 2018 we announced the north bay junction long term fixed price service nbj ltfp which includes 670 tj d 625 mmcf d of new natural gas transportation contracts from the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb on the canadian mainline upon neb approval of the nbj ltfp service incremental volumes under these long term fixed priced contracts will reach markets in ontario québec new brunswick nova scotia and the northeastern u s using existing capacity on the canadian mainline as well as new compression facilities customers have executed 15 year precedent agreements to proceed with the project with an estimated capital cost of 96 million we filed an application for approval of the nbj ltfp with the neb in january 2019 and expect a decision in third quarter 2019 in october 2018 we concluded the written hearing process for the canadian mainline 2018 2020 toll review with the filing of our reply evidence to the neb in december 2018 the neb 2018 decision was issued approving all elements of the application including our cost and volume forecasts higher depreciation rates and continuation of pricing discretion with the exception of the amortization period for the long term adjustment account ltaa which is now to be amortized over 2018 to 2020 the impact of the decision was reflected in lower tolls effective february 1 2019 as directed by the neb we filed a compliance filing in january 2019 the outcome of which is expected in first quarter 2019 u s natural gas pipelines wb xpress the wb xpress project a columbia gas project designed to transport approximately 1 4 pj d 1 3 bcf d of marcellus gas supply westbound to the

mountaineer xpress mxp a columbia gas project is designed to transport supply from the marcellus and utica shale plays to points along the system and to the leach interconnect with columbia gulf approximately 45 per cent of this project was placed in service on january 18 2019 with the remainder to be placed in service in february and march 2019 along with gulf xpress a columbia gulf project total estimated mxp project costs have been revised upwards to us 3 2 billion reflecting the impact of delays of various regulatory approvals from ferc and other agencies increased contractor construction costs due to unusually high demand for construction resources in the region unusually high instances of inclement weather throughout construction and modifications to contractor work plans to mitigate construction delays associated with these impacts louisiana xpress in november 2018 we sanctioned the louisiana xpress project which will connect supply directly to gulf coast lng export markets with the addition of three greenfield mid point compressor stations along columbia gulf the anticipated in service date is in 2022 and estimated project costs are us 0 4 billion bison contract terminations and asset impairment in the second half of 2018 two customers on bison elected to pay out the remainder of their future contracted revenues and terminate their associated tsas the termination of these agreements was agreed to following the receipt of us 97 million in 2018 which was recorded in revenues as the terminations released us from providing any future services this development coupled with the persistence of unfavourable market conditions which have inhibited system flows on the pipeline led us to determine that the asset s remaining carrying value was no longer recoverable and a non cash impairment charge of us 537 million was recorded in our u s natural gas pipelines segment as bison is a tc pipelines lp asset in which we have a 25 5 per cent interest this impairment charge impacts our net income by 140 million after tax and non controlling interests but is excluded from comparable earnings we continue to explore alternative transportation related options for bison tuscarora goodwill impairment in fourth quarter 2018 tuscarora finalized its regulatory approach in response to the 2018 ferc actions resulting in a reduction in its recourse rates in connection with its annual goodwill impairment analysis we evaluated tuscarora s future revenues as well as changes to other assumptions responsive to tuscarora s commercial environment in doing so we incorporated the outcome of a settlement in principle reached with its customers in january 2019 as a result of these developments we determined that the fair value of tuscarora did not exceed its carrying value including goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of us 59 million within the u s natural gas pipelines segment the remaining goodwill balance related to tuscarora at december 31 2018 was us 23 million as tuscarora is a tc pipelines lp asset in which we have a 25 5 per cent interest this impairment charge impacts our net income by 15 million after tax and non controlling interests but is excluded from comparable earnings mexico natural gas pipelines sur de texas offshore construction was completed in may 2018 and the project continues to progress toward an anticipated in service date in early second quarter 2019 an amending agreement was signed with the cfe that recognizes force majeure events and the commencement of payments of fixed capacity charges began on october 31 2018 liquids pipelines keystone xl we have secured commercial support for all available keystone xl project capacity and commenced certain pre construction activities we continue to address outstanding legal challenges regarding the project the south dakota supreme court dismissed an appeal against the certification of the project we expect the nebraska supreme court to reach a decision in the first quarter of 2019 regarding a challenge to the nebraska public service commission s route approval we continue to participate together with the u s department of justice in lawsuits commenced in montana to defend legal challenges to the u s presidential permit and the exhaustive environmental assessments that support the u s president s actions energy cartier wind in

comparable funds generated from operations comparable distributable cash flow comparable distributable cash flow per common share these measures do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities comparable measures we calculate comparable measures by adjusting certain gaap measures for specific items we believe are significant but not reflective of our underlying operations in the period except as otherwise described herein these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period as applicable our decision not to adjust for a specific item is subjective and made after careful consideration specific items may include certain fair value adjustments relating to risk management activities income tax refunds and adjustments to enacted tax rates gains or losses on sales of assets or assets held for sale legal contractual and bankruptcy settlements impact of regulatory or arbitration decisions relating to prior year earnings restructuring costs impairment of goodwill investments and other assets including certain ongoing maintenance and liquidation costs acquisition and integration costs we exclude the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce our exposure to certain financial and commodity price risks these derivatives generally provide effective economic hedges but do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as a result the changes in fair value are recorded in net income as these amounts do not accurately reflect the gains and losses that will be realized at settlement we do not consider them reflective of our underlying operations the following

distributable cash flow net cash provided by operations comparable ebitda and comparable ebit comparable ebitda represents segmented earnings adjusted for certain specific items excluding non cash

funds generated from operations funds generated from operations reflects net cash provided by operations before changes in operating working capital we believe it is a useful measure of our consolidated operating cash flow because it does not include fluctuations from working capital balances which do not necessarily reflect underlying operations in the same period and is used to provide a consistent measure of the cash generating performance of our assets comparable funds generated from operations is adjusted for the cash impact of specific items noted above refer to the cash provided by operating activities section for a reconciliation to net cash provided by operations comparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per common share we believe comparable distributable cash flow is a useful supplemental measure of performance that defines cash available to common shareholders before capital allocation comparable distributable cash flow is defined as comparable funds generated from operations less preferred share dividends distributions to non controlling interests and non recoverable maintenance capital expenditures refer to the cash provided by operating activities section for a reconciliation to net cash provided by operations maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures incurred to maintain our operating capacity asset integrity and reliability and include amounts attributable to our proportionate share of maintenance capital expenditures on our equity investments we have the opportunity to recover effectively all of our pipeline maintenance capital expenditures in canadian natural gas pipelines u s natural gas pipelines and liquids pipelines through tolls canadian natural gas pipelines maintenance capital expenditures are included in rate bases on which we earn a regulated return and subsequently recover in tolls our u s natural gas pipelines can recover maintenance capital expenditures through tolls under current rate settlements or have the ability to recover such expenditures through tolls established in future rate cases or settlements tolling arrangements in our liquids pipelines provide for the recovery of maintenance capital expenditures as such in 2018 our presentation of comparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per common share only includes a reduction for non recoverable maintenance capital expenditures in their respective calculations we have adjusted our comparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per

compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the net effect of the following higher contribution from canadian natural gas pipelines primarily due to the recovery of increased depreciation as a result of higher rates approved in both the mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement as well as higher flow through taxes and incentive earnings higher contribution from u s natural gas pipelines mainly due to increased earnings from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service additional contract sales on anr and great lakes and amortization of net regulatory liabilities recognized as a result of u s tax reform higher contribution from liquids pipelines primarily due to higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system increased earnings from liquids marketing activities and earnings from intra alberta pipelines placed in service in the second half of 2017 higher revenues from mexico natural gas pipelines as a result of changes in timing of revenue recognition lower earnings from bruce power primarily due to lower volumes resulting from higher outage days comparable earnings increased by 227 million or 0 21 per common share for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and was primarily the net effect of changes in comparable ebitda described above higher depreciation primarily in canadian natural gas pipelines due to increased depreciation rates approved in the mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement these amounts are fully recovered as reflected in the increase in comparable ebitda described above having no net impact on comparable earnings as well as higher depreciation related to new projects placed in service in 2017 and 2018 higher interest expense primarily as a result of long term debt and junior subordinated notes issuances net of maturities lower interest income and other as a result of realized losses in 2018 compared to realized gains in 2017 on derivatives used to manage net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on u s dollar denominated income comparable earnings per common share for the three months ended december 31 2018 also reflect the dilutive impact of common shares issued in 2017 and 2018 under our drp and our corporate atm program 2018 ferc actions and u s tax reform in fourth quarter 2018 the following significant developments with respect to 2018 ferc actions and u s tax reform took place on november 15 2018 ferc issued a policy statement on the accounting and ratemaking treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes adit and treatment following the sale or retirement of an asset a policy statement excess adit policy statement addressing certain issues raised in the notice of inquiry noi issued on march 15 2018 the excess adit policy statement clarifies ferc accounts in which pipelines should record amortization of excess and or deficient adit for ferc reporting and ratemaking purposes the excess adit policy statement also addresses how to disclose reversals of adit account balances in ferc s annual financial report filings in accordance with the form 501 g filings and settlements reached with customers in response to the 2018 ferc actions the adit balances for all pipelines held wholly or in part by tc pipelines lp were eliminated from their respective rate bases therefore regulatory liabilities recorded for these assets pursuant to u s tax reform were written off resulting in a deferred income tax recovery of 115 million in fourth quarter 2018 all of our ferc regulated natural gas pipelines and storage assets have now either filed a form 501 g or an uncontested rate settlement with ferc as directed there has been no significant incremental impact from our third quarter 2018 disclosures regarding the effect of 2018 ferc actions on future earnings and cash flows upon finalizing the 2017 annual tax returns for our u s businesses and clarifying the impact of u s tax reform on our deferred income tax liability at december 31 2017 and as permitted by the sec during the one year measurement period it was determined that an adjustment was required to the estimate originally recorded accordingly a deferred income tax recovery of 52 million was recognized in fourth quarter 2018 to adjust our net regulatory liability and adit balances capital program we

2019 inflation outlook thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe having seen headline inflation moderate from fifteen per cent level in january 2018 to eleven per cent level in december 2018 our outlook on inflation is one of a gentle increase in prices from 11 44 recorded in december 2018 as we expect upside inflationary factors to have a mild effect on general price levels amid efforts by central bank of nigeria to control price increases using appropriate monetary policy tools such as open market operations our inflation outlook is mostly predicated on a number of factors which include economic events in external environment implementation of the new minimum wage locally as well as the planting rainy season among other things we expect the biggest exogenous factor in our opinion the u s china trade war to be resolved to some degree as the march 01 2018 ceasefire deadline could be extended due to lingering issues around intellectual property rights and thus spur business and consumer confidence increase global demand and provide price support to global commodities such as crude oil this is expected to ultimately increase nigeria s foreign exchange supply given the apex bank s commitment to defend the naira and ensure exchange rate stability this we believe is a more likely scenario compared to that formed from softening of global crude oil prices resulting from a lack of resolution to the trade dispute in which case ensuing weakness in global confidence levels would weaken demand for commodities ultimately resulting in inadequate foreign exchange supply and increased foreign exchange volatility with a pass through effect on inflation cost push inflation on the implementation of the new minimum wage of n30 000 per worker the immediate effect would be increased upside risk to inflation due to increased spending power amid relatively lower supply in goods and services leading producers to increase their prices in response however we expect to the monetary authority to embark on mop up of excess financial system liquidity in order to manage increased demand and slow down demand pull inflation in addition the planting rainy season is now underway and so we anticipate a gradual decline in food stockpiles which include grains and tubers among other food commodities this is expected to have a sustained but gentle increase in food prices until the onset of the harvest season around october this year when we anticipate an ease in food prices and ultimately headline inflation finally the federal government recently on monday february 4 2019 repealed the consumer protection act cap 25 laws of the federation of nigeria 2014 to establish the federal competition and consumer protection commission and the competition and consumer protection tribunal for the development and promotion of fair efficient and competitive markets in the nigerian economy pricing of goods and services is one of the key areas the antimonopoly law was designed to address in that it gives powers to the federal government to regulate the prices of goods and services by an order published in the federal gazette on the recommendation of the competition commission we therefore believe that once it takes hold it could serve to reduce incidences of arbitrary hike in output prices and help to ensure general price stability even if in the medium to long term 2019 interest rate outlook in 2018 interest rates generally moderated nibor softened to below 15 per cent level from above 20 per cent level partly due to increase in money supply following improved foreign exchange earnings we expect domestic interest rates to remain in double digits most likely above 15 per cent for nibor given a number of influencing factors such as decisions on the united states fed rate coupled with anticipated increases in nigeria s fiscal deficit as well as general price level monetary policy in the world s largest economy the u s is expected to pose a slightly dovish stance in light of latest global economic realities tinged with uncertainties which informed a slower global growth forecast by the international monetary fund of 2 9 for 2019 from an estimated 3 0 for 2018 it is doubtful that we will see aggressive fed rate hikes given relatively weak global business and consumer confidence levels a stronger dollar vis a vis weaker trading pairs and slower growth expectations for europe and china hence the risk of portfolio outflows appears somewhat abated thus reducing expectations of increasing interest risk to attract foreign portfolio investors in the domestic economy we expect central bank of nigeria to retain the benchmark in interest rate at 14 in line with benign inflation expectations and given the need to support economic growth but we do not see a moderation in this key interest rate in the short term due to the need to accommodate investors appetite for positive real returns meanwhile we expect the main upside risk to inflation to come from anticipated increase in fiscal deficit regardless of the outcome of the february 16 2019 poll due to the simple fact that nigeria s crude oil output has been reviewed downwards thus reducing revenue projections while expenditure is expected to increase this will result in increased borrowings and at higher interest rates which is expected to crowd out the private sector hence we expect money market interest rates as well as bond yields to trend higher especially in the face of possible slower accretion to the external reserves 2019 fixed income strategy we anticipate an increase in fixed income yields in the domestic bond market particularly in h2 2019 partly due to expected increase in borrowings on account of anticipated increase in fiscal deficit this is more so given that foreign borrowings appear to have reached cautionary level as foreign debt stock grew by 137 41 from usd10 72 billion in 2015 and by 29 30 from usd18 91 billion in 2017 to usd24 45 billion in 2018 an amount that has also increased external debt service to revenue ratio while there are expectations of slower accretion to foreign exchange reserves with attendant foreign exchange risk a projected low single digit gdp growth for 2019 should also increase risk premium although we have seen 10 year bond yields decline on average from around 16 per cent in 2017 to about 14 per cent in 2018 we anticipate a reversal to 15 16 per cent levels in 2019 therefore because we expect bond yields to trend higher bonds to be sold at deeper discounts in h2 2019 we recommend being invested at the short end of the yield curve i e treasury bills of low maturities in h1 2019 and to increase duration as we progress into h2 2019 investors in long dated papers could take advantage of anticipated higher interest risk in h2 by tactically selling their holdings currently held at a profit in h1 and reinvesting proceeds in instruments at deeper discounts in the future 2019 equities strategy we see local equities bouncing back into the green territory in the event of a post violence free presidential election and subsequently closing the year on a positive note this is against the backdrop of the turnaround by the us federal open market committee on its decision to further hike the fed rate amid concerns of slower global economic growth as per the effect of the upcoming presidential poll on february 16 irrespective of who eventually emerges victorious we expect the nigerian equities market to still close in positive region at the end of 2019 however we should see the local bourse rebound stronger if a market friendly presidential candidate eventually emerges if these conditions are met we expect foreign investors to return to the nigerian market and take advantage of the cheap value stocks by buying the dip what informs our stock picks 1 we like viable companies that have significant market share or rapidly growing market share in their respective industries 2 we recommend efficiently run companies 3 we also recommend companies with significant cashflow and flexibility to take advantage of expansion opportunities sectors to consider the economy is expected to expand further in 2019 and its impact should be felt across all sectors 1 financial services stocks should benefit from expected increase in interest rates 2 fmcgs are expected to witness increased demand for their products on account of the implementation of the new minimum wage 3 construction sector should be driven by anticipated boost in public works such as construction of roads and bridges housing etc in conclusion we advise a short term equities market investment strategy buying the dip and selling the rally we have seen prices move significantly ahead of the february polls and we anticipate the movement to peak during the corporate earnings season by which time it will be advisable to take profit and invest in short term fixed income instruments however for long term investors we suggest a hold particularly as macroeconomic conditions are expected to improve in the medium to long term and corporate earnings are expected to result in higher accumulated dividend payouts thus translating to higher dividend yields source cowry asset management limited

company s benchmark the msci em latin america index gained 11 3 2 on both a net and gross basis 2 all performance figures are in sterling terms with dividends reinvested all countries within the region ended the month in positive territory as latin america led emerging market outperformance in january the company s gearing facility was a main contributor to performance during the month as we were able to maintain an average 107 9 gross exposure to the market more effectively capitalizing on the region s strong performance our underweight position in peru was among the top contributors to relative returns as the market underperformed the region an off benchmark allocation to argentina also benefitted the company supported by improving investor confidence in aggregate the brazilian selection detracted however brazilian stocks were amongst the month s top individual performers the market performed strongly on positive momentum following the inauguration of the new government and a dovish federal reserve overweight positions in large cap macro sensitive names petrobras and bradesco performed particularly well similarly consumer oriented names like food retailer gpa and online platform b2w also contributed to performance during the month with brazil being the clear outperformer in january our lack of positioning in eletrobras and ccr detracted from performance the former rallied strongly on hopes of further privatization efforts by the bolsonaro administration an overweight position in vale was also one the period s largest detractors following the collapse of a tailings dam at one of their mines in brumadinho positioning was relatively unchanged over the month with brazil remaining our largest overweight we notably exited our position in bancolombia as lower oil prices will make it more difficult to see proper fiscal consolidation on the other hand we have moderately added to our mexican positions we also initiated positions in argentinean lender galicia and energy name ypf as the market has showed improved signs of stability particularly at the currency level valuations are increasingly attractive following last year s market declines and we expect support from inflows following the upcoming reclassification to emerging market status the portfolio ended the month being overweight in brazil and mexico while being underweight chile peru and colombia we also maintain an off benchmark allocation to argentina at the sector level we are overweight in domestic consumer and real estate while being underweight in utilities and financials brazil remains our largest overweight given our positive expectations for the incoming administration so far president elect jair bolsonaro has delivered on his campaign promises looking to reduce the size of government by initially reducing the number of ministries naming sector subject experts to lead cabinets and pointing to a continuation of the reform process initiated two years ago meanwhile the outlook for upcoming corporate results point to a continuation in the economic recovery providing strong momentum for growth into 2019 elsewhere the cancellation of naim the new mexico international airport reminded markets of the concerns regarding increasing populism for the incoming administration in mexico reiterating our cautiousness with mexican equities we remain underweight the andean region due to a combination of unattractive valuation and disappointing growth finally the dramatic sell off in argentina in 2018 leaves the stocks trading at attractive valuations while interest rates and the currency have mostly stabilized providing a foundation for the economy to rebound from the recent downturn sources 1blackrock as at 31 january 2019 2datastream as at 31 january 2019 14

buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film market dynamics are clearer which is anticipated to be at its q1 2019 results release scheduled for may 2 2019 shaun thaxter ceo of indivior commented fy 2018 brought a series of market challenges which resulted in indivior delivering lower net revenue and only slightly higher adjusted net income compared to the prior year as we enter fy 2019 we assume we face the imminent at risk launch of generic rivals to suboxone film in the u s we have prudently prepared for this event planning and taking the required actions to help ensure we can deliver on our strategic priorities despite the near term top line pressures that generic competition to suboxone film will bring specifically we have maintained our focus on cash generation and preserved our balance sheet continued to assert our ip against the anda filers completed steps that have appropriately adjusted our operating structure repaid 235m of outstanding term loan balance to lower the outstanding balance to 243m and of outstanding term loan balance to lower the outstanding balance to and prepared the launch of an authorized generic of buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film to participate in the rapidly forming generic market for buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film together these actions are designed to help us remain compliant with our borrowing covenants and help the group to leverage the profitable long term growth we expect from our new transformational depot technologies in sublocade we are making progress toward a truly new treatment paradigm for oud patients

products will be the future value drivers of indivior and our focus in 2019 will be on their successful commercial execution plus net revenue target with perseris we believe we have a differentiated long acting injectable treatment for schizophrenia a common co occurrence of substance use disorders and the long sought strategic opportunity we have created to diversify our revenue base we are confident these products will be the future value drivers of indivior and our focus in 2019 will be on their successful commercial execution of course we could not drive these new launches together with our base film and tablet business without our talented and committed global workforce we are truly grateful that despite the recent period of disruption and uncertainty the new organization that has emerged this year is energized and optimistic finally in everything we do we think first and foremost about the patient our inspiration is to improve the lives of the many patients across all walks of society who suffer from the chronic relapsing conditions of addiction and its co occurring disorders this relentless patient centricity along with maintaining the highest regulatory and compliance standards provides the foundational elements of indivior s long term success fy operating review u s market update in 2018 market volume for buprenorphine products continued to grow at low teen percentage rates in line with indivior s expectations this volume growth was driven by benefits from legislation and regulatory changes that have increased federal and state funding to expand oud treatment as well as from broader general awareness of the opioid epidemic indivior supports the swift actions the u s government has taken to combat the opioid epidemic including the recent enactment of the support for patients and communities act of 2018 which expands access to buprenorphine medication assisted treatment bmat these regulatory and legislative initiatives are supporting greater treatment capacity for those in most need and are likely to be manifested in continued growth in lower priced government channels such as medicaid as the leader and innovator in the oud category

with formulary access in q4 2018 there was higher suboxone film stocking levels in the u s versus q4 2017 due to increased anticipation by distributor partners of an at risk generic launch after the cafc s decision on november 20 2018 to vacate the preliminary injunction pi previously granted indivior against drl this increase was more than offset by unfavorable mix and higher rebate rates as

statements condensed financial statements reference to the group means the company and all its subsidiaries the financial information herein has been prepared in the basis of the accounting policies set out in the annual accounts of the group for the year ended december 31 2017 and should be read in conjunction with those annual accounts except with regards to ifrs 9 and 15 which were implemented in 2018 no standards or interpretations have been adopted before the required implementation date the group prepares its annual accounts in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and ifrs interpretations committee ifric interpretations as adopted by the european union and the companies act 2006 the act applicable to companies reporting under ifrs in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements the significant judgments made by management in applying the group s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 with the exception of changes in estimates that are required in determining the provision for income taxes and legal provision these consolidated financial statements reflect the group s adoption of ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers and ifrs 9 financial instruments as of january 1 2018 there were no adjustments made in the current period or prior year comparative as a result of the adoption of these new standards there will be a more detailed disclosure related to this in the 2018 annual report the group adopted ifrs 16 on january 1 2019 on adoption of ifrs 16 the group recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as operating leases under the principles of ias 17 leases assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis lease liabilities include the net present value of lease payments which are discounted using the group s incremental borrowing rate as of january 1 2019 the group applied the modified retrospective approach which requires the recognition of the cumulative effect of initially applying ifrs 16 as of january 1 2019 to the retained earnings in 2019 the group will recognize 29 million of right of use assets and 33 million of lease liabilities and an impact to beginning retained earnings of 4 million there will be a more detailed disclosure related to the group s adoption of ifrs 16 in the 2018 annual report the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the group s annual financial statements as at december 31 2017 these condensed consolidated financial statements have been reviewed and not audited these condensed consolidated financial statements were approved for issue on february 13 2019 as disclosed in note 8 the group carries a provision of 438m substantially all relating to the department of justice investigations the final settlement amount may be materially higher than this provision or require payment over a shorter period which together with higher than expected loss of revenue following the at risk launch of generic buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film products or the failure for new products to meet revenue growth expectations could impact the group s ability to operate the directors have taken significant steps to reduce the cost base of the business and manage its capital structure and believe the group has sufficient liquidity influence over near term litigation outcomes and the ability to carry out further measures that may be necessary for the group to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months however a combination of the above risks may require additional measures such as further cost savings or a change to the litigation strategy as such the above factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the group were unable to continue as a going concern the auditors have indicated that consistent with the prior year they expect to include material uncertainty relating to going concern and emphasis of matter in relation to the outcome of litigation sections within their auditors report for the 31 december 2018 statutory accounts the financial information contained in this document does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 and 435 of the act for the group s financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the auditors issued 1 an emphasis of matter dealing with the outcome of the department of justice and federal trade commission investigations and antitrust litigation details of which are included above and in note 8 and 2 a material uncertainty related to going concern dealing with the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the group s involvement in investigations by the department of justice and the federal trade commissions as well as antitrust litigation which would be further adversely impacted should revenues decline and if the uptake of sublocade remains slower than expected the group s statutory financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 were approved by the board

by ambar warrick reuters bullish positions on most asian currencies strengthened over the past few weeks a reuters poll showed reflecting newfound optimism that the united states and china would settle their long drawn trade spat long bets on the chinese yuan singapore dollar indonesian rupiah and the thai baht rose substantially a poll of 12 respondents showed with high level trade talks between beijing and washington kicking off this week markets were hoping for a leeway before the march 1 deadline when u s tariffs on 200 billion worth of imports from china are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent bulls on the yuan and the singapore dollar were at their highest since april 2018 china s trade tiff had battered risk assets across asia owing to the economic superpower s large trade exposure with most of the continent the yuan has also seen some support following the chinese central bank s attempts to stimulate the local economy which has been cooling drastically since last year china s exports clocked a surprise rise in january while its politically sensitive trade surplus with the united states narrowed however imports retreated implying that domestic consumption was still weak long positions on the thai baht were the strongest among its peers and stood at a more than one year high thailand s strong economic fundamentals which consist of steady exports and domestic production have made the baht a bastion of stability in asia the currency outperformed its peers in 2018 and has also done so in 2019 bearish positions on the indian rupee retreated slightly as short term sentiment was bolstered by the indian central bank s unexpected lowering of rates and policy shift last week however the rupee s mid to long term outlook is clouded by perceived political turmoil ahead of india s national elections bearish positions on the taiwan dollar rose slightly after taiwan s government trimmed its 2019 economic growth forecast showing that weakening technology demand and slowing global growth were denting the country s exports and outlook the reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine asian emerging market currencies the chinese yuan south korean won singapore dollar indonesian rupiah taiwan dollar indian rupee philippine peso malaysian ringgit and the thai baht the poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3 a score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long u s dollars the figures included positions held through non deliverable forwards ndfs the survey findings asiaposn are provided below positions in u s dollar versus each currency ddmm cny krw sgd idr twd inr myr php thb 14 2 0 48 0 18 0 39 0 59 0 39 0 35 0 43 0 29 1 2 24 1 0 17 0 08 0 21 0 22 0 29 0 59 0 37 0 20 0 68 10 1 0 08 0 06 0 33 0 21 0 13 0 14 0 06 0 23 0 67 13 12 0 52 0 44 0 54 0 57 0 34 0 72 0 78 0 66 0 15 29 11 1 06 0 74 0 57 0 71 0 73 0 55 0 96 0 70 0 50 15 11 1 28 0 85 0 87 1 37 0 73 1 19 0 97 0 93 0 48 1 11 1 37 0 99 0 75 1 69 0 82 1 37 0 89 1 07 0 53 18 10 1 14 0 82 0 49 1 68 0 60 1 68 0 75 1 36 0 07 4 10 1 11 0 56 0 70 1 65 0 65 1 74 0 74 1 53 0 10 20 9 1 12 0 79 0 95 1 57 0 69 1 72 0 82 1 44 0 33 reporting by ambar warrick aditya soni and shriya ramakrishnan in bengaluru editing by rashmi aich
spread the love harare president emmerson mnangagwa has been forced to intervene in a growing turf war between reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya and his boss finance minister mthuli ncube on the path zimbabwe will take to deal with a deepening currency crisis well placed sources say president mnangagwa met mangudya in a crucial meeting last night that would assist in shaping and finalising the much awaited monetary policy statement mps the mps was expected to have been delivered either in the last week of january or first week of february however disagreements over proposed currency reforms has seen the mps stall to a point that requires executive intervention several options to deal with the currency crisis include redollarisation reintroduction of the local currency rand adoption liberalisation of the rtgs and bond note as well as ringfencing deposits to mop up excess liquidity to lower the premium rates on the us dollar it is believed that while mangudya and his team tabled local currency re introduction as the most viable option under the current circumstances ncube is only prepared to go as far as liberalising the exchanging rate an option preferred by the bretton woods institutions according to ncube a local currency can only be introduced within 12 18 months an international monetary fund technical team which was in the country this week is said to have suggested floating the exchange rate but also warned of the implications this could have on the socio and political environment this follows a similar push by the african development bank the imf team is also said to have forced some revisions on the draft mps sources said mangudya was concerned that devaluation would result in the collapse of bank balance sheets as most banks were borrowing offshore for on lending in rtgs he is also opposed to the move on grounds this will destabilise the economy by putting wage pressure on companies cause inflation and driving the cost of goods up government was however forced to deny the re introduction of the local currency this week based on comments on twitter by former finance minister tendai biti that the reintroduction was due this week although it would not be backed by any fundamentals the rand option is also being thrown around considering that this has been a consistent message from industry which has south africa as its trading partner but government is not too keen on that position contacted for comment mangudya said he was in a meeting later on he was not picking up calls and a message sent had not been responded to by the time of going to press ncube could not be reached for comment but early this week he told journalists that the mps would be presented soon without revealing specific dates traditionally the mps is presented during the first week of february asked when the monetary policy statement would be presented he said let s just say around this time presidential spokesperson george charamba declined to comment saying any comment on monetary issues could destabilise the market the bond note was introduced in 2016 as an export incentive facility and guaranteed by the african export import bank rbz said it was at par to the dollar despite insistence by several sectors that the parity would not work warning that the surrogate currency would quickly lose value against the greenback analysts expectations are not on devaluation nor the introduction of a local currency but rather that the rbz mops up excess liquidity through a long dated bond to strengthen the rtgs rate which is already the pseudo local currency while also introducing a foreign currency auction system in his last monetary policy statement mangudya split bank accounts into nostro foreign currency accounts fcas and rtgs real time gross settlement fcas in what analysts say was an admission that the bond dollar parity could not be sustained the currency crisis has given rise to price distortions particularly on consumer goods prices of some products in rtgs terms are cheaper if one converts using the parallel market rate than what is obtaining in the region while on the other hand prices are beyond reach for the ordinary consumer whose salary has not changed and moreso for the tourists whose transactions on international cards are rated at 1 1 on the us dollar the president s intervention whose details were sketchy at the time of going to print also comes as foreign diplomats accredited to harare are piling on pressure for zimbabwe to come up with an acceptable currency reform policy cognisant of the fact that some of their nationals have technical fees dividends and investment income which are still stuck in the country business times is reliably informed that the foreign diplomats due to meet mnangagwa today at state house told harare to shelve the introduction of a local currency until the right fundamentals are in place information at hand suggests government has been in deliberations with diplomats whose countries are key trading partners with zimbabwe a top diplomat who requested not to be named said he met mangudya recently to discuss a number of issues including the monetary policy statement right now we have dividends stuck in zimbabwe and nothing is moving if you have an environment that makes one investor make a loss then no one else will come and those that are here will close why would investors come when you change policies and start selling equipment of businesses that you licence to invest the diplomat said while the monetary policy statement was crucial government needs to start making tough choices and to create a good environment for business government needs to start talking to business and foreign investors they must listen and make changes that ensure investors make money because they come here for money and if they can t make money then why do they stay the diplomat also added that government and the generality of zimbabweans should stop waiting for foreign bailouts to end the economic crisis this comes as ncube is on the hunt for credit lines he is expected to visit china to discuss bailout options after his visit to the united states next month the solution lies in foreign direct investment and domestic investment not bailouts when you grow investments then you have jobs and a bigger tax base which needs to be preserved and allocated towards reinvestment not recurrent expenditure he said business times share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading

plans are currently being put in place to accelerate our backup program new lead identification and optimization in partnership with addex the group continues in advanced discussions with the u s department of justice doj about a possible resolution to its investigations please see notes 8 9 and 10 beginning on page 22 for further details on provisions and legal proceeding contingency plan indivior has implemented key elements of its contingency plan to help offset the substantial and material near term impact to net revenue that is expected to result from the at risk launch of generic versions of suboxone film the overriding objectives of the contingency plan are to provide for the commercial success of sublocade and perseris while ensuring a minimum cash balance of 250m to remain in compliance with the group s debt covenants key actions include reducing outstanding principal on the term loan by 235m in fy 2018 to 243m in fy 2018 to cash conservation measures resulting in fy 2018 ending cash balance of 924m initiatives to reduce structural operating expenses including headcount reductions r d reprioritization and other committed savings and additionally indivior expects to launch an authorized generic of suboxone film upon confirmation of the launch of generic buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film products the launch is expected to capture share of the generic segment and generate an amount of net revenue in the range of tens of u s millions fy 2019 guidance given uncertainties surrounding how the u s market for both suboxone film and generic alternatives will ultimately develop indivior is unable to provide fy 2019 net revenue and net income guidance at this time however indivior is providing guidance on the following elements of its business for fy 2019 sublocade net revenue of 50m to 70m and to and operating expenses sg a and r d combined of approximately 440m to 460m excluding exceptional items as discussed above indivior has executed key elements of its contingency plan its overriding objectives are to ensure a minimum cash balance of 250m to remain in compliance with its debt covenants and to help provide resources to cover the transition period of expected material and rapid loss of suboxone film net revenue in the u s until combined net revenue from sublocade and perseris along with continued net revenue from the rest of world row is able to return the group to profitable growth indivior intends to provide fy 2019 group net revenue and net income guidance before exceptionals and currency once the total u s buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film market dynamics are clearer which is anticipated to be at its q1 2019 results release scheduled for may 2 2019 shaun thaxter ceo of indivior commented fy 2018 brought a series of market challenges which resulted in indivior delivering lower net revenue and only slightly higher adjusted net income compared to the prior year as we enter fy 2019 we assume we face the imminent at risk launch of generic rivals to suboxone film in the u s we have prudently prepared for this event planning and taking the required actions to help ensure we can deliver on our strategic priorities despite the near term top line pressures that generic competition to suboxone film will bring specifically we have maintained our focus on cash generation and preserved our balance sheet continued to assert our ip against the anda filers completed steps that have appropriately adjusted our operating structure repaid 235m of outstanding term loan balance to lower the outstanding balance to 243m and of outstanding term loan balance to lower the outstanding balance to and prepared the launch of an authorized generic of buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film to participate in the rapidly forming generic market for buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film together these actions are designed to help us remain compliant with our borrowing covenants and help the group to leverage the profitable long term growth we expect from our new transformational depot technologies in sublocade we are making progress toward a truly new treatment paradigm for oud patients and the opioid crisis and the coming year will see us further strengthen our execution in pursuit of our 1bn plus net revenue target with perseris we believe we have a differentiated long acting injectable treatment for schizophrenia a common co occurrence of substance use disorders and the long sought strategic opportunity we have created to diversify our revenue base we are confident these products will be the future value drivers of indivior and our focus in 2019 will be on their successful commercial execution plus net revenue target with perseris we believe we have a differentiated long acting injectable treatment for schizophrenia a common co occurrence of substance use disorders and the long sought strategic opportunity we have created to diversify our revenue base we are confident these products will be the future value drivers of indivior and our focus in 2019 will be on their successful commercial execution of course we could not drive these new launches together with our base film and tablet business without our talented and committed global workforce we are truly grateful that despite the recent period of disruption and uncertainty the new organization that has emerged this year is energized and optimistic finally in everything we do we think first and foremost about the patient our inspiration is to improve the lives of the many patients across all walks of society who suffer from the chronic relapsing conditions of addiction and its co occurring disorders this relentless patient centricity along with maintaining the highest regulatory and compliance standards provides the foundational elements of indivior s long term success fy operating review u s market update in 2018 market volume for buprenorphine products continued to grow at low teen percentage rates in line with indivior s expectations this volume growth was driven by benefits from legislation and regulatory changes that have increased federal and state funding to expand oud treatment as well as from broader general awareness of the opioid epidemic indivior supports the swift actions the u s government has taken to combat the opioid epidemic including the recent enactment of the support for patients and communities act of 2018 which expands access to buprenorphine medication assisted treatment bmat these regulatory and legislative initiatives are supporting greater treatment capacity for those in most need and are likely to be manifested in continued growth in lower priced government channels such as medicaid as the leader and innovator in the oud category indivior has launched its new monthly buprenorphine depot sublocade the group is making good progress in the following kpis that it believes will drive accelerated net revenue growth for sublocade in

revenue decreased 10 to 790m fy 2017 877m and declined 12 in q4 2018 to 182m q4 2017 207m for both comparative periods volume benefits from underlying market growth were more than offset by the combined impacts of unfavorable mix from the continued disproportionate growth in government channels medicaid targeted rebating to maintain formulary access and the decline in suboxone film market share as a result of competitive pricing pressure from generic buprenorphine naloxone tablet providers improved suboxone film pricing was more than offset by tactical rebating activity in connection with formulary access in q4 2018 there was higher suboxone film stocking levels in the u s versus q4 2017 due to increased anticipation by distributor partners of an at risk generic launch after the cafc s decision on november 20 2018 to vacate the preliminary injunction pi previously granted indivior against drl this increase was more than offset by unfavorable mix and higher rebate rates as

austerity measures fy 2018 gross margin was 87 fy 2017 90 and the gross margin was also 85 in q4 2018 q4 2017 88 the decrease in both periods versus the prior year primarily reflects lower net revenue

set out in the annual accounts of the group for the year ended december 31 2017 and should be read in conjunction with those annual accounts except with regards to ifrs 9 and 15 which were implemented in 2018 no standards or interpretations have been adopted before the required implementation date the group prepares its annual accounts in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and ifrs interpretations committee ifric interpretations as adopted by the european union and the companies act 2006 the act applicable to companies reporting under ifrs in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements the significant judgments made by management in applying the group s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 with the exception of changes in estimates that are required in determining the provision for income taxes and legal provision these consolidated financial statements reflect the group s adoption of ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers and ifrs 9 financial instruments as of january 1 2018 there were no adjustments made in the current period or prior year comparative as a result of the adoption of these new standards there will be a more detailed disclosure related to this in the 2018 annual report the group adopted ifrs 16 on january 1 2019 on adoption of ifrs 16 the group recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as operating leases under the principles of ias 17 leases assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis lease liabilities include the net present value of lease payments which are discounted using the group s incremental borrowing rate as of january 1 2019 the group applied the modified retrospective approach which requires the recognition of the cumulative effect of initially applying ifrs 16 as of january 1 2019 to the retained earnings in 2019 the group will recognize 29 million of right of use assets and 33 million of lease liabilities and an impact to beginning retained earnings of 4 million there will be a more detailed disclosure related to the group s adoption of ifrs 16 in the 2018 annual report the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the group s annual financial statements as at december 31 2017 these condensed consolidated financial statements have been reviewed and not audited these condensed consolidated financial statements were approved for issue on february 13 2019 as disclosed in note 8 the group carries a provision of 438m substantially all relating to the department of justice investigations the final settlement amount may be materially higher than this provision or require payment over a shorter period which together with higher than expected loss of revenue following the at risk launch of generic buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film products or the failure for new products to meet revenue growth expectations could impact the group s ability to operate the directors have taken significant steps to reduce the cost base of the business and manage its capital structure and believe the group has sufficient liquidity influence over near term litigation outcomes and the ability to carry out further measures that may be necessary for the group to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months however a combination of the above risks may require additional measures such as further cost savings or a change to the litigation strategy as such the above factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the group were unable to continue as a going concern the auditors have indicated that consistent with the prior year they expect to include material uncertainty relating to going concern and emphasis of matter in relation to the outcome of litigation sections within their auditors report for the 31 december 2018 statutory accounts the financial information contained in this document does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 and 435 of the act for the group s financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the auditors issued 1 an emphasis of matter dealing with the outcome of the department of justice and federal trade commission investigations and antitrust litigation details of which are included above and in note 8 and 2 a material uncertainty related to going concern dealing with the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the group s involvement in investigations by the department of justice and the federal trade commissions as well as antitrust litigation which would be further adversely impacted should revenues decline and if the uptake of sublocade remains slower than expected the group s statutory financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 were approved by the board

film products or the failure for new products to meet revenue growth expectations the group would not continue in business without taking further necessary measures to reduce its cost base and improve its cash flow the directors have taken significant steps to reduce the cost base of the business and manage its capital structure however a combination of the above risks may require additional measures such as further cost savings or a change to the litigation strategy the group also carries provisions totalling 44m for intellectual property related matters 40m of these relate to potential redress for ongoing intellectual property related litigation with drl and rhodes pharmaceuticals and have been classified as exceptional costs see note 3 the final aggregate cost of these matters may be materially higher than the amount provided the group believes that it has strong defences in the antitrust and other litigations and is actively litigating these matters indivior cannot predict with any certainty whether when or at what cost it will reach ultimate resolution of the antitrust and other litigation matters 9 contingent liabilities other than the disputes for which provisions have been taken as disclosed in note 8 provisions or as separately disclosed in note 5 taxation reliable estimates could not be made of the potential range of cost required to settle legal or

otherwise cooperated fully with the department and prosecutors and will continue to do so the group is in advanced discussions with the department of justice about a possible resolution to its investigation however it is not possible to predict with any certainty the potential impact of this investigation on the group or to quantify the ultimate cost of a resolution state subpoenas on

thank you for joining us on this call today as we completed 2018 and started this new year of 2019 it has given me the opportunity to pause and consider what i ve learnt in the past nearly two years since becoming the ceo i have definitely learned a lot first i am fortunate to have a very strong capable and motivated global management team and we are lucky to work with our global sales force which we believe are some of the best and most talented people this world has to offer our relentless focus on customer growing their customer base is working two years ago i truly believe we could grow our business and deliver on our mission to improve lives around the world today i am confident in our capabilities to be successful in this regard and the vision and pathway of how we can unleash our potential is much more clear to me now we will change the world and i look forward to a great year here in 2019 i was particularly encouraged as we closed the year with a solid fourth quarter wherein we generated 7 constant currency revenue growth our reported revenue growth was 3 which included a negative currency impact of 4 these are very promising results as the prior year included a 130 million of revenue from our lumispa product introduction and a quarter in which we reported 25 growth for 2018 our annual revenue was 2 68 billion an 18 improvement for the year and was driven by growth in every region except japan and in japan we actually showed modest improvements throughout the year i was especially pleased also with 16 growth in our customer base which we reported this quarter and the steady growth in our sales force that happen throughout the year this is a direct result of our growth strategy and ryan will speak to this in a few minutes our fourth quarter operating margin was strong and earnings per share were 1 05 when excluding the impact of the previously announced one time impairment and restructuring charge of 1 37 when including the restructuring charge we reported a loss of 0 32 the 1 05 earnings per share includes a 0 04 purchase accounting charge we believe our strategic decision to transform our technology platform allows us to accelerate the execution of our vision to grow this company and reach our potential this transformation of our organization will open the power of cloud technology to significantly advance our capabilities as a customer centric organization at the beginning of 2018 we made the strategic decision to acquire three manufacturing enterprises to secure our supply chain increase our innovation and accelerate our ability to bring products to market during the quarter our manufacturing entities reported revenue of 25 million and we are beginning to see the benefits we anticipated from these partners through improvements in our nu skin gross margin each of these partner company showed strong year over year revenue and profit growth in 2018 and each has great potential to continue to grow going forward we ve also spoken in the past about our investment in indoor growing technology often referred to as cea or controlled environment agriculture our cea vision is to enhance our ability to provide our customers with clean sustainable ingredients give our customers full sourcing transparency and provide us with a competitive advantage in our product development innovation we continue to make significant advancements in our capabilities and technology that empower this vision and we look forward to sharing more insight on our plans including a tour of our facilities for those interested at

everyone we re excited with our growth strategy and what drove in 2018 in terms of strong results and remain focused on the three pillars as we make steady progress in each one first regarding engaging platforms we continue to leverage social sharing which empowers our sales leaders to attract acquire and retain more customers through their use of social media and technology from a company perspective we re also employing social media in various ways to more effectively promote our business for example in the fourth quarter in south korea we successfully reintroduced our nu skin 180 system using the kakao talk social platform and we utilize the popular wechat platform in a similar way in mainland china to launch a new prebiotic product balance plus as ritch noted under the direction of our new technology leadership team we are making some significant changes accelerating our ability to become a more customer obsessed digitally enabled organization key to our progress is our migration to the cloud which expands our scale capacity and flexibility to better service the needs of our customers around the globe on the enabling products front ageloc lumispa continues to perform well and drive customer acquisition with strong demand globally accounting for 11 of nu skin s fourth quarter revenue and more than 250 million for the year during the fourth quarter we also began to extend the lumispa franchise by introducing lumispa accent in a few of our markets accent is a new lumispa attachment which when used with the reformulated idealized treatment serum provides focused benefits for the more delicate skin around the eyes we expect lumispa to remain a key growth brand for us in 2019 finally regarding empowering programs we continue to roll out velocity around the world this compensation enhancement focuses on accelerating rewards to sales leaders on a daily weekly and monthly basis it also provide increased rewards for sharing our products and greater flexibility to appeal to a broader entrepreneurial demographic during the fourth quarter velocity was launched in south korea and we are on pace to have it fully implemented in all markets by mid 2019 with the exception of mainland china which operates under a different business model velocity continues to drive key growth behaviors among our sales force including increased customer acquisition as evidenced by our 16 customer growth this past year so collectively our growth strategy drove solid results in each of our segments in mainland china we grew constant currency revenue for the year by 21 and 2 for the fourth quarter and while there has been some concern about the impact of trade negotiations on the china economy as well as increased media and regulatory scrutiny around the nutrition market we continue to anticipate growth in 2019 in hong kong and taiwan we posted positive year over year growth of 11 and quarterly growth of 4 in constant currency reflecting continued interest in lumispa and social sharing in south korea the business improved from a 15 decline in 2017 to a 1 constant currency growth in 2018 and up 2 in the fourth quarter during the quarter we launched our velocity compensation enhancement which when coupled with the restage of the nu skin 180 system improved both customers and revenue in americas and pacific we grew 20 in constant currency for the year and 3 for the quarter these results were driven by strong growth in the pacific and latin america despite the hyper inflationary environment in argentina which tempered the growth in that market in southeast asia we continue to perform well with 2018 constant currency growth of 18 and 13 for the quarter we continue to anticipate strong results as we focus on our growth strategy which produced improvements of 11 in sales leaders and 25 in customers in japan constant currency revenue decreased 2 for the year which is a trend improvement from prior years and then emea constant currency revenue grew 10 for both the year and the quarter reflecting the continued focus on social sharing throughout the region and improvements in several of our key markets as we look toward 2019 we ll continue to focus on our growth strategy providing the platforms products and programs to empower our sales leaders to attract and retain customers and build stronger sales teams our quarterly and annual results reflect the strength of our focus and execution and the degree of alignment we are creating throughout the organization alignment that we believe will help us continue to grow the business in 2019 and with that i ll turn it over to mark mark lawrence chief financial officer thank you ryan i will now provide some detail regarding our fourth quarter results and give first quarter and full year 2019 guidance additional financial information can be found on our investors section of our website our fourth quarter revenue improved 3 to 683 3 million or 7 to 710 1 million on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year which included a 130 million lumispa introduction our reported revenue was negatively impacted 4 by foreign currency fluctuations for the full year our revenue was 2 68 billion an 18 increase over the prior year marking the second highest revenue year in our history for the full year our core nu skin business grew 14 while our recent acquisitions contributed 4 2018 revenue was impacted less than 1 by foreign currency fluctuations our quarterly reported earnings per share were negative 0 32 or 1 05 when excluding 77 million in primarily non cash charges related to the impairment of information technology infrastructure severance and other related expenses this compares with 0 33 reported earnings per share or 1 20 when excluding the impact of tax reform in q4 2017 please note that the 1 05 includes a 0 04 non cash purchase accounting charge reported earnings per share for 2018 were 2 16 or 3 52 when excluding the impairment and restructuring charges incurred in the fourth quarter this compares to 2 36 or 3 23 when excluding the impact of tax reform in 2017 during the quarter we executed a restructuring program to support our vision of becoming a world leading business platform we took a non cash impairment charge of 48 6 million associated with writing down our technology assets as we transition to a cloud infrastructure additionally we took a 22 1 million charge associated with the changes to our it and other departments within our corporate in americas offices because of our planned investment to transition to the cloud and secure required talent to execute this transition we don t anticipate this restructuring to result in significant cost savings for 2019 gross margin for the quarter was 76 3 compared to 77 7 in the prior year quarter the gross margin of our nu skin business improved 20 basis points to 77 9 selling expense as a percent of revenue was 39 4 compared to 39 8 in the prior year quarter the decrease was largely due to non commissionable revenue associated with our manufacturing entities our nu skin selling expense was 40 9 general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 23 9 compared to 23 in the prior year reported operating margin for the quarter was 2 7 or 14 1 when excluding the restructuring charge compared to 14 9 in the prior year the other income expense line reflects a 4 3 million expense compared to 8 4 million expense in the prior year the increased expense was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar during the quarter we paid 20 2 million in dividends and repurchased 21 3 million of our stock as indicated in a separate release we also increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year to 1 48 annually the tax rate for the quarter was 225 or 35 9 when excluding the restructuring charge compared to 81 5 or 33 1 when excluding the impact of tax reform in 2017 our revenue guidance for the first quarter is 615 million to 635 million reflecting growth of 0 to 3 or 6 to 8 in constant currency with an approximate 5 to 6 currency headwind we project q1 earnings per share of 0 70 to 0 77 and a q1 tax rate of 33 to 36 for 2019 we are projecting revenue in the 2 76 billion to 2 82 billion range or growth of 3 to 5 or 5 to 7 in constant currency this guidance assumes an approximate 2 to 3 currency headwind 2019 earnings per share are projected at 3 80 to 4 05 with a projected tax rate of 33 to 36 we will provide additional details at our upcoming investor day event on february 28th at our corporate headquarters if you would like to attend in person please reach out to our investor relations team with that i ll now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of faiza alwy from deutsche bank your line is now open faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst yes hi good evening so i have a few questions the first one is just on the local currency constant currency growth for fiscal 19 if you could just maybe disaggregate that for us by region china in particular and then maybe the rest of the regions and how we should think about it from a quarterly basis so how the phasing it seems like you re expecting 1q to be better but are there any launch events or anything else that we should be mindful off i ll start with that ritch n wood chief executive officer thanks faiza let me just quickly speak to that appreciate your question we look forward to our analyst investor day where we will lay out more detail by region by growth by quarter and give more detail i think the big question i think on most people s mind is china what do we project for china i think for purposes today we expect high single digit growth in china next year on a constant currency basis and then again we ll lay out the rest of the details at the investor day faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful and then just mark maybe if you could talk a little bit about how you re thinking about gross margins for next year i know this year we had your gross margins declined as you had some sort of made some acquisitions but what is the what are you embedding for next year for 19 mark lawrence chief financial officer yes great question thanks faiza as ritch mentioned we ll breakout of full gross margin walk for you at our investor day but at the highest level we re projecting 19 gross margins roughly in line with 18 as we have a full year impact of our acquired companies so in that 76 to 77 range is where you should model that faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay and then sorry just last one from me is what was the inventory write off for in the quarter mark lawrence chief financial officer so the inventory write off was largely items that were impaired due to our structural changes that we made in our supply chain organization faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay thank you ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you faiza operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of olivia tong with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you i guess in the quarter obviously you announced restructuring program so i d love to get a better understanding of what you re hoping to tackle with that you ve obviously mentioned that there s not an expectation in 2019 of a lot of savings coming out of that it sounds like it s more an efficiency expectation but what expect that obviously with an efficiency program that you would get some savings out of that so a little bit of color behind that and then also what kind of additional capacity you think that now allows you ritch n wood chief executive officer yes thank you olivia good to hear from you and i ll just give a quick update as it relates to our vision and then the other guys can speak specifically to some of the thoughts around the margins and so forth we really believe that in order to a achieve our vision we have to be customer centric we have to be able to support customers in a way we never have before and our old technology just didn t allow us to be flexible and able to move very quickly in terms of making changes and so far so we re really excited about this change which is well under way it s moving along quickly and we ll start to see benefits in 2019 ryan do you want to ryan napierski president yes well and i would simply add to that point in moving to the cloud we will we re really seeking to scale capacity and flexibility that we need in order to service the business and so i mean to your point around efficiencies versus effectiveness this is really a move to create a more effective technology infrastructure and not a cost reduction exercise so that s really what we seek to gain out of it mark lawrence chief financial officer yes and the only thing i would add is the reason why we are not projecting a huge cost savings into next year is it s really a shift from on premise capitalized expense to a more opex cloud expense so that opex that we will incur as we move to the cloud will offset the depreciation that we were taken off the books from taking the capital loss olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and then just if i could move over to cash flow i m not sure if you have the numbers yet given this quarter fiscal year end but if you could provide just cash flow from operations or free cash flow that would be great and then just in terms of returning cash to shareholders obviously you ve done a couple of acquisitions recently but they re not huge dollars so can you talk about your priorities because this dividend raise more recently has been kind of inching up at a slower pace than the earnings growth and there is still obviously a lot of room on your repurchase authorization as well so just a little bit of color into your priorities that would be great mark lawrence chief financial officer sure so i ll tackle the first one cash from operations in the quarter was about 88 million as far as uses of cash and such we re really focused on our priorities which our first priority use of cash is to grow the business the second one is we ll continue to pay dividend we just raised our dividend for the 18th consecutive year it was a modest increase but we believe we re paying healthy dividends and then third we ll balance the debt repayment and share buyback similar to how we did this year and expect our share buybacks to be roughly in line with what we ve done the last two years ritch n wood chief executive officer i think from an overall standpoint olivia we see opportunities to really invest and grow our business maybe more or so than we ve seen in the past for part of that reason we ve been conservative with both our share buyback as well as our dividend just because we think there s opportunities to really look to expand i think moving to the cloud technology is one area that we think opens up a lot of opportunity for us but we re going to go very committed to it and all in and i think we ll get the results we need so leaving some cash available obviously to be able to do those sort of things and not hamper in any way our ability to grow the business ryan napierski president and the only thing i would add is that our capital spend will go up next year we ve talked about building the manufacturing facility in china and that process will really start in earnest in 2019 olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks and then just lastly on in terms of the product initiatives for 2019 i imagine we ll hear a lot more about that in at the analyst day but if you could just give us a little bit of an overview in terms of the new product pipeline are we more focusing on skin care versus nutrition i guess how much of our focus are you going to have on more approachable price points and then also if you could give a little bit of flavor into some of the new initiatives like the indoor growing thank you ryan napierski president yes olivia we just on a couple of those points around product i think we will as you said will be laying out the full plan at investor day or analyst day coming up but generally speaking what you ll see us focusing on are building the brands that we have much more effectively as i mentioned in previously lumispas franchise continues to do well you ll see us continuing to invest in those brands that are really power house brands for us we will continue to explore lower price point products as you re as you noted there social sharing is critical and require certain price points to move well but we also remain focused on the entire portfolio and ensuring that all of our products are socially proficient that way on the news the nutrition versus the skin care side 2019 is well balanced both but continues to skew heavily on a bit heavier on the personal care side although there are many local initiatives including the one i mentioned in china our tr90 line continues to be very very important to us so those types of nutrition related product initiatives are sprinkled throughout the year throughout many of our markets ritch n wood chief executive officer yes good product pipeline with a different philosophy not the big lto plans that we did say two or three years ago but really an opportunity to build these brands with solid customer focused effort and as it relates to indoor growing we look forward to sharing more of that here in a couple of weeks it s an initiative that we believe is really really important to customers going forward they demand transparency they demand clean pure ingredient and it s really hard to be able to guarantee that in the world we live in today so we re going down a path that we believe is going to be very very motivational to our customers i think they re going to love it and we ve made some good progress to the point where we will actually start to see products later this year and so forth we ll talk about that again in two weeks but exciting progress in that front and believe it fits right into our customer demographic and the vision we have for the company olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks you so much ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tim ramey with pivotal research group your line is now open tim ramey pivotal research group analyst thanks so much ritch i m not sure you expressed it in exactly this way but you certainly have emphasized the idea of ramping up the percentage of revenues coming from new products over time do you have anything specific to say on your progress there in terms of metrics of where we re at where we think we might go ritch n wood chief executive officer that s a great question tim and something that we have watched over time but we re really changing our philosophy to be much more agile with our products and building strong brand so for example lifepak is a product that is probably our number two nutrition supplement that really has not been updated for many years that s not the way we want to focus going forward we want to take those strong products and continue to update them regularly so there s consistent new innovation and technology going into our product you ll see it in our new packaging refreshed that s rolling out at the end of last year and into this year so it will look different than the big new product that we did in the path so that s probably not a good comparison to actually try and say what percentage of our revenue will come from new products but again a different strategy it s going to look fresh it s going to look new and i think the exciting to our customers tim ramey pivotal research group analyst great thanks and then also just i m guessing that moving to the cloud makes you somewhat less capex intensive on the it side do you have a forecast for capex yet for 2019 so if you gave it i missed it i m sorry mark lawrence chief financial officer no we didn t give it but i ll give it to you now it s going to be somewhere in the 80 million to 100 million range depending on our factory build out in china tim ramey pivotal research group analyst okay and it will most of that be china mark lawrence chief financial officer no about somewhere in the 30 million to 50 million range would be the factory in china tim ramey pivotal research group analyst okay and then just one on regions i know you wanted to kind of stick to high level there but the south korea has been a slog and it looks like you ve at least bent the curve there in a slightly positive way is that a market where we think we could or should expect growth in 19 ritch n wood chief executive officer well we re very very encouraged with what we saw toward the end of the year so there are two primary initiatives that we did we restaged a really successful product in china which we call nu skin 180 based system product again to the strategy of how we do new products going forward we were able to get great traction around that product at the same time we brought forward our velocity compensation changes and we really were encouraged with the fourth quarter that look positive where we saw customer growth where we ve seen our customer acquisition increase and so we re encouraged for this year but i d say in our forecasting and in our guidance we ve been quite conservative on what korea looks like this year but we do show growth in that market it s low single digit growth is what we probably anticipate as that business continues to turn around but quite encouraged with the results we saw just in the end of this year tim ramey pivotal research group analyst thanks a lot ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of linda bolton weiser with da davidson your line is now open linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst hi i was just wondering in looking at your year over year change in sales leaders there are many regions that are down but that s been the trend in many of these markets so i guess just the only one that really stood out was the americas pacific sales leaders being down 7 can you just kind of talk about that because i think the trend has been that it s been up and i don t know if that s i don t know yes can you just talk about like why that would have become a decline versus increases in the previous quarters ritch n wood chief executive officer yes let me just speak high level and then ryan can add some detail to it the americas is impacted as mark mentioned or maybe ryan i think mentioned in the call that the hyper inflationary environment in argentina which was our fastest growing latin america market has really impacted and slowed that business down to some extent so that s reflected in some of these numbers the other one is just china where we had a really strong response to our lumispa launch a year ago and some incentives that were in place that drove that sales leader number to jump in the end of the year and then come down in the first quarter which is what we projected what we re encouraged about with the sales leader numbers the way it continue to develop throughout the year steady generally and continue to improve nicely so i feel good about the direction of our sales leader number and the year over year comp is not quite as telling in my perspective because of lumispa launched last year would you add ryan to that ryan napierski president i would only add that really as we focus on our customer on customer acquisition growth the kind of the relationships so we re really excited about the customer acquisition growth the race the relationship between the sales leaders and customers has evolved somewhat so it is hard to compare the quarter the q4 activity and impact of that linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst okay so like if you were to just if you were to look at americas pacific and just say look at the us with the sales leaders have been up or down in just the us ritch n wood chief executive officer i m gonna pull that up real quick i think the sales leaders were down a little bit in the us yes down about 11 customers were down 3 so slightly down and i think part of that also is our change to move to velocity there the with requirements are lower in the new compensation plan so we ve seen some consolidation i would say in the number of sales leaders we have overall generally it s very strong but our us business showed that a little bit more than some of the other markets linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst okay and then you ve shown a pattern kind of in recent years of having a major new launch about every two years is that something we can think about possibly for 2020 ritch n wood chief executive officer i think there will definitely be a major new launch of a product the key product brand that we re doing will probably swing over to the nutrition side given our focus has been little bit more personal care i don t it won t be the same as we ve done with ltos in the past but it will be a very key product that we take and put significant investment innovation and relaunch ryan napierski president yes you re just linda you re going to see as ritch mentioned a couple of times you will really see an enhanced focus on innovation across multiple brands in 2019 and beyond and so i would probably be looking less for the one off or the single product initiative that will drive results and we ll be explaining a lot more about this brand strategy of driving multiple brands through multiple key initiatives which we think will be much more powerful and sustainable over time linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst okay thanks that s it for me ritch n wood chief executive officer thanks linda ryan napierski president thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of stephanie wissink with jefferies your line is now open ashley helgans jefferies analyst hi this is ashley helgans on for steph wissink thanks for taking our question regarding the constant currency revenue expectations between 5 to 7 how should we think about cost leverage at the sales level ritch n wood chief executive officer we re really encouraged first of all by that 5 to 7 growth as looking back at what we guided to when we started 2018 and it was similar we felt like we could be confident of 5 to 7 growth rate and so we re starting 2019 with that same growth rate we do believe we ll be able to expand our margins maybe mark from a high level what would you comment on that mark lawrence chief financial officer yes i think what we re modeling in for this year is roughly 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin ashley helgans jefferies analyst okay great thanks that s very helpful ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you ashley operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of doug lane with lane research you may proceed doug lane lane research analyst yes hi thanks i guess we ve talked about the operations and they were certainly pretty impressive 7 organic growth on top of that comparison and the 2 growth in china on a very large comparison so the business continues to perform well in fact the operating income was ahead of where we were looking for but we keep giving it back in these non operating items and so just from a modeling standpoint what exactly where the currencies that impacted the other income this quarter and how should we think about that going into 2019 mark lawrence chief financial officer it s a great question we really are subject to currency in many of our we were in nearly 50 markets and we re subject to currency fluctuations in nearly all of them with most of our profit coming from overseas the big swingers are really the chinese rmb and then we continue to face pressure from argentina being highly inflationary where we have to mark to market all of our assets there intel was being no longer highly inflationary those would be the biggest swingers for us but also southeast asia is becoming an ever important market for us and it s a very large market for us and so we are subject to currency swings in all of those markets as well if you look at our guidance for the year we guided 2 to 3 currency headwind so this is going to be a year particularly in the first half of this year where we re going to be facing an uphill battle from a currency perspective doug lane lane research analyst so when you forecast negative currency number on your top line we can assume there could be a negative impact to other income as well basically would have go together mark lawrence chief financial officer yes they do we ve done a what i think is a fairly good job of trying to mitigate that risk if you remember what happened in q2 and q3 or we have rather large charges as a comparison in the current quarter it was about 0 02 and impact on still a relatively large fx movement in the quarter we ve done our best to try to mitigate our intercompany balances around the world we still have an exposure in china which i think is going to be difficult to manage considering the amount of cash that they need to operate that business doug lane lane research analyst that s make sense so 2 in the quarter marked yet that for the year mark lawrence chief financial officer the impact for the quarter is 5 to 6 the impact for the year is 2 to 3 doug lane lane research analyst no i mean if i m asking the earnings per share impact of the foreign currency translation losses in the other income line mark lawrence chief financial officer for 2018 or next year doug lane lane research analyst for 2018 mark lawrence chief financial officer 2018 we disclosed the 0 13 in q2 and 0 07 in q3 doug lane lane research analyst and did you say what it was in q4 mark lawrence chief financial officer yes right now i d just say it s roughly 0 02 doug lane lane research analyst okay all right and there is going to be so we won t get all that back this year but hopefully will be a number that somewhat smaller than that mark lawrence chief financial officer the goal is that we hopefully mitigated much of that risk doug lane lane research analyst okay all right that s all thanks ritch n wood chief executive officer thanks doug operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of beth kite with citi your line is now open beth kite citibank analyst hi terrific hi everyone i was just thinking about social selling and going back to the idea that in october of 17 we heard at the biennial convention about a lot of new products that were going to be tested in some markets across 18 so now that we have a full year of that can you sort of give us some context around which products were maybe outside successes what you learned from that this past year and how that might inform some of the social selling initiatives that you have for 2019 ryan napierski president yes absolutely beth and you do ask this question quite frequently so we should just work it end of the script we did talk about it s really been a great learning year for us as you mentioned we launched i think something like 14 or 17 product concepts are introduced those at live 2017 and have been really rolling those out one by one many of those many were just concepts to test the market but several of those have been rolled out in various markets at various times and then we re seeing varying results as we learn most notably i d say is powerlips that has become really a good little franchise for us in terms of attracting a new demographic of customers that we historically couldn t attract as effectively so that s been a great one and continues to do well we see great promise in that we ve had dr dana that s gone out into many markets and continues to be rolled out around the world and it seems to be a decent product as well there are others that were really concept driven that have very good favorable i guess interest that we need to continue to work on in order to get margins right and dial in those concepts further so we ll continue to explore and experiment with new product concepts like we did before i think maybe the bigger learning for us is throughout the course of the last year and a half is that every one of our products has the ability to be a socially shareable product and we found that many of our products like lumispa that are maybe higher price points that historically we haven t seen as particularly socially by roll or actually be quite socially by role and so our goal is really to ensure that our entire portfolio has products that are socially shareable and leveraging the learnings from these many of these tests to better the entire portfolio beth kite citibank analyst got it okay great because i m thinking about product like so would raw be one like you only ask that we were seeing in the fourth quarter that sound sort of that test phase if you will ryan napierski president yes exactly i mean raw is very in fact i d argue is one of the best product concepts that we tested in terms of just general consumer response to it we need to continue to work on margins there to ensure that packaging and all of that work well but yes the concept is very good and we just need to make certain we can scale that effectively beth kite citibank analyst great okay perfect thank you very much for that so now we could pivot to access for lumispa are you going to tell us which market are markets that debut in the fourth quarter and then also i think it s sort of the idea of one ageloc more broadly in 19 are there any nuances between the first and second quarter in terms of the roll out of accent to keep in mind ritch n wood chief executive officer yes it will be quick and easy to get the fourth quarter because there are only like three markets that we did it in beth kite citibank analyst okay ritch n wood chief executive officer i think hong kong taiwan and one or two markets in southeast asia it will primarily be a first half 2019 launch with the big difference being that china is april so china will be q2 most of the rest of the markets will start to launch the accent in q1 beth kite citibank analyst okay perfect thank you so much ritch one or two other questions if i may one tr90 back on the second quarter earnings call there was the concept that had the potential for the year to do roughly 200 million in sales can you let us know where tr90 shaped out for full year sales ritch n wood chief executive officer yes it was well over 200 million for the year about 225 million or so mark lawrence chief financial officer 234 million ritch n wood chief executive officer 234 million beth kite citibank analyst to be exact from the cfo great now actually mark quick question on tax rate if you like this what we are looking forward to in 19 is likely a higher tax rate than we ve had at least the last couple of years kind of harkens back to the mid 30s of three and four years ago what s the opportunity there to sort of work the tax rate at least maybe more comfortably into the low 30s is there an opportunity mark lawrence chief financial officer there is an opportunity but i think it ll be a little bit longer term so we did guide 33 to 36 indicating that a our tax rate will be more variable so it will be more fluctuation in the quarter and that will be really driven by where the profit is generated around the world if profits generated in higher tax region for example china or korea the tax rate will be higher in that given quarter we have been and are actively working on adjusting our tax structure to try to bring us down to the lower end of that range or potentially below that range but we re operating against the 30 year tax structure that set up in nearly 50 markets and you need to be very careful as you unravel those things ritch n wood chief executive officer but the bottom line to getting that lower is drive us profit and so we yes we are definitely focused on finding ways to continue to grow our business our profitability and opportunities to increase our profit particularly in the us market beth kite citibank analyst got it okay and one final one if i may on modeling just thinking about g a for the full year are you going to again i assume have your every other year big global convention in the fourth quarter of this year and if so i know g a is kind of moved around it used to be that you could kind of add 10 million roughly to your fourth quarter for the g a in the year that had the event is that sort of still the bright magnitude to think about for incremental spend for the fourth quarter for that event mark lawrence chief financial officer yes that s roughly in line we re obviously in the planning stages of that event now but that s the budget more or less that we re planning for in the 10 million range beth kite citibank analyst okay perfect thank you all very much appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel your line is now open mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst thanks and afternoon everyone ritch n wood chief executive officer hi mark mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst wanted to ask on china so i tuned in late so apologies if this was touched on a bit earlier but i wanted to just try to reconcile the currency neutral sales growth of 2 with the moving parts of the sales leaders and customers and then just try to get a sense of kind of like what was going on there and what drove kind of the variability in there and then just not stronger growth i get that there was a tougher comparison but obviously the customers were up quite a bit and sales leaders were down so if you can just talk about maybe puts and takes and kind of reconcile that with how you get to high single digit growth in 19 that would be helpful ritch n wood chief executive officer yes great thanks mark for that question china continues to be what we see is a really great opportunity and we were happy to be able to grow so of our 130 million of lto in the fourth quarter of 2017 58 million of that was in china so it was a big strong quarter that we re comparing against we ve seen good solid results in both the customers and sales leaders as the year progressed we had a big push right at the end of 2017 and then as we projected and anticipated that number fell down the sales leader number fell down in q1 of 2018 but then was consistent and look good throughout the year where our focus has really been with ryan and his team is really driving our customer base in china so we ve had a number of particularly over the last say three or six months on retention of our customers and that is beginning to show it s really encouraged with the way the customer number increased in the fourth quarter and gives us a good base as we move into next year our success and our ability to grow the business there will be driven by the fact that our customer base has to grow and our sales leaders need to grow so yes i think overall we feel good about the market we feel good about the direction that we ve seen it trend throughout the year and that s what gives us confidence guiding to additional growth here as we enter 2019 mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay got it and then mark just switching to cash flow so roughly 200 million in cash from ops in 2018 how should we think about some of the moving parts there it sounds or seems like working capital was a pretty big headwind does that reverse and if you can give any sort of color on expectations for that number for 19 that d be helpful mark lawrence chief financial officer yes i think that s something that we ll go into a lot of detail around at our analyst day investor day in two weeks i will say that with an lto in q4 of 17 that created a large commissions payable this was in early q1 of 18 so that artificially brought down cash from operations in 18 that should not reflect itself or up be the same in 19 because we didn t have a large lto in the q4 of 18 we ll give you a lot more detail at analyst day mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay all right we ll wait to hear from that i guess i want to go back to the question on china i just try to figure out so the revenue per customer was down a lot more productivity how we want to think about it in the quarter versus it was in q2 and q3 why was that i mean what specifically is going on from a productivity standpoint mix standpoint any view there might be helpful ryan napierski president yes i think really that s more of a function of the denominator growth right to the revenue so if we look at it going back to the point ritch mentioned around some of these retention initiatives we were able to really increase the customer repeat purchase activity which typically by the way the repeat purchases generally are the smaller basket size than the first month order typically so we haven t specifically dialed in on china that way but i m perceiving that that s really what you d be looking as revenue divided by customer mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay so as we go forward the focus will be back on moving the sales leaders not the customers is that what i heard before correctly ryan napierski president no i think maybe better i think better stated would be that while we continue to drive the business our customer acquisition strategy we anticipate sales leaders will correlate to customers i think the issue in q4 was really the year over year comp from the 2017 q4 lumispa introduction there that generated a significant amount of revenue in that quarter and also increased our sales leader based on the amount of volume that went in the quarter so resetting that to q1 and then growing from q1 we ll anticipate that those two are correlated but again the customer activity that we re really looking at and frankly it s quite interesting for us as well over the last call it four five months of 2018 where some of these new retention initiatives in china that are proving out or at least indicating a good benefit to our customer numbers generally ritch n wood chief executive officer i think mark it s important to note that we focus really on both but we have made some efforts specifically in the recent months in china particularly to drive and that s what s shifting that denominator a little bit we ll see how it comes into this year but if we re going to grow this year they both have to grow we have to have sales leader growth and we have to have customer growth mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay thank you ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you mark okay i think that s the end of the questions we sure appreciate all the questions and appreciate your attention on this call and look forward to a great year and look forward to seeing any of you who will be able to make it at our investor day here in two weeks thank you

at the height of the crisis of the 1970s tom nairn the scottish historian and theorist of nationalism published his collection of essays the break up of britain which soon became a key intellectual reference point for the scottish and british left the book s central argument was that the crisis of post war british capitalism had deep historical roots which stretched back to britain s unfinished revolution of the 17th century nairn predicted that britain s trajectory of post imperial decline would be paralleled by the rise of peripheral nationalism reflected in rising demands for scottish self determination which would increasingly challenge the archaic character of the british state and civil society the union did not of course unravel in the decades following the publication of nairn s book but a process of constitutional reform did gather pace throughout the 1980s and 1990s culminating in the re establishment of the holyrood parliament in 1999 and the emergence of scottish nationalism as a pivotal force within british politics today britain is once again entering into a phase of acute constitutional and economic upheaval the uncertainties which brexit has unleashed in combination with the deep structural weaknesses which continue to characterise british capitalism echo the paroxysms of the 1970s economic fragility political polarisation and on going constitutional agitation within the periphery again threaten to pitch the british state and capitalism into turmoil in order to understand the present constitutional moment it is necessary to place the rise of scottish nationalism into historical perspective there is no better place to start than with the historical sociology of tom nairn nairn places the scottish national question within a wider theory of nationalism and uneven development modern nationalism emerged during the great upheavals of the 19th century following the shockwaves unleashed across the continent by the french and industrial revolutions in this context an emergent class of commercial interests urban elites and reformist intellectuals within relatively under developed societies such as germany and italy were faced with a formidable task these societies were increasingly subject to the intense pressures of capitalist modernity to increase agricultural productivity to industrialise and to dispense with backwards social relations which acted as fetters on their economic development however the project of modernisation was persistently frustrated by the archaic character of the absolutist state which predominated across the european continent in response europe s rising commercial elites sought to mobilise the mass of the population behind a programme of industrialisation and constitutional reform these modernising forces drew upon the range of national traditions particular to their host territory in order to mobilise the masses for development as nairn put it the new middle class intelligentsia of nationalism had to invite the masses into history and the invitation card had to be written in a language they understood the rise of nationalism was therefore deeply entangled with the uneven development of industrial capitalism in europe nationalists drew on a mythic past in order to mobilise for the challenges of modernity scotland did not experience an upsurge in 19th century nationalism in line with this standard european model on first sight this was quite peculiar after all scotland had all the characteristics of a nation state in the making ripe for political and constitutional reform not only had scotland s position as an independent state had only recently been relinquished through the act of union in 1707 but it retained a series of autonomous civic institutions including the kirk scots law and its distinctive education system within its ancient universities in edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen scotland had established itself as a key centre of european enlightenment brimming with cosmopolitan intellectuals committed to social reform and moral improvement furthermore scotland had a wealth of national popular myths and folk memories to draw upon built up over centuries of fractious relations with its southern neighbour why then did scotland not experience an upsurge in demands for sovereignty in the nationalist 19th century in line with other european societies nairn s answer was that scotland was a highly peculiar case shaped by its idiosyncratic historical development with the act of union scottish civil society had been effectively integrated into the first capitalist state and society this had profound implications for the subsequent development of scottish nationalism it meant that scotland s economic structure and civil society was already well adapted to the wave of modernisation which unfolded in the 19th century scottish nationalism was peculiarly absent in the classic era of nationalism for the simple reason that it did not face the dilemma of under development encountered by its continental european neighbours in place of an organised politics of self determination residual national sentiment came to be expressed in a primarily cultural form this was symbolised most obviously in the romantic literature of walter scott the proliferation of tartanry and through the fetishization of a lost highland and gaelic culture suitably sanitised and stripped of its jacobite connotations for the polite bourgeois society of lowland scotland the british state consolidated its global role from the mid 19th century onwards through the international status of sterling the rise of the city of london as a hub of global finance and the expansion of the british empire scottish elites and civil society came to be increasingly intertwined with this internationally oriented imperial state form scotland was an active partner in not a victim of british colonial adventurism the participation of scottish elites in the empire was enshrined through colonial business ties one in four elite administrators in the east india company were scots through the famed role of the highland regiments as the shock troops of british militarism and through the economic integration of industrial scotland glasgow s shipyards dundee s jute factories the coalfields of fife and south western scotland into the ebbs and flows of imperial trade scottish nationalism remained quiescent throughout the first half of the 20th century because the external supports of the british state the global projection of its imperial power and its international economic role secured consent north of the border with the post war decline of empire and the onset of britain s economic crisis in the 1970s these external supports rapidly crumbled sterling s status as the leading international reserve currency was lost in the inter war years the second world war decimated britain s industrial base and the suez debacle confirmed britain s subordination to american geo political leadership the british imperial state was unravelling its global economic role was contracting by the 1960s profitability began to decline sharply britain s technology and infrastructure creaked amidst years of under investment the country experienced chronic economic under performance relative to other advanced capitalist states most notably germany japan and the united states british decline intensified in the 1970s as rising stagflation high unemployment combined with rampant price increases led to a rising tide of industrial militancy and social unrest amidst these convulsions huge oil reserves were discovered off the scottish coast in the north sea the discovery of black gold provided a possible escape route for scotland from britain s economic social and political malaise nairn saw this moment as emblematic of a shift to what he termed the new nationalism this form of nationalism was evident across a number of western capitalist societies most notably in the basque and catalan regions of spain the new nationalism was quite distinct from the old nationalism of the 19th century while the old nationalism involved mobilisation in response to the dilemmas of under development the new nationalism involved galvanising support for self determination on the basis of the promise of future over development the new nationalism emerged in areas which sat on a source of potential future prosperity in scotland s case north sea oil which would allow them to insulate themselves from the dysfunctions of their sclerotic metropolitan partner scotland s putative over development played a key role in the political imaginaries and strategies of scottish intellectuals in this era in the red paper on scotland a collection to which nairn contributed gordon brown then a young student radical wrote the rise of modern scottish nationalism is less an assertion of scotland s permanence as a nation than a response to scotland s uneven development in particular to the gap between people s experiences as part of an increasingly demoralised great britain and their oil fired expectations at a scottish level the promise of scotland s vast oil reserves grew as an issue of pivotal political importance in the following decades by the early 1980s thatcher s government had initiated a huge wave of de industrialisation wiping out large swathes of britain s industrial base including in scotland s central belt britain began accumulating huge trade deficits with the rest of the world the cruel irony was that oil revenues helped to counteract the decline in britain s balance of payments and helped to finance the increase in the unemployment payments which occurred amidst this thatcherite restructuring uneven development intensified the abolition of exchange and capital controls and the subsequent big bang of 1986 saw the city of london re emerge as a global financial powerhouse within the de industrialising periphery the north of england the west midlands wales scotland unemployment surged and decline sharpened many of these areas never recovered within scotland thatcher s programme set in train a series of pressures for greater devolution and self government from within civil society devolution as we know it today emerged out of this context the constitutional convention the claim of right and eventually the formation of the scottish parliament were all reflections of an increasingly assertive civic scotland determined to insulate itself from the worst excesses of unchecked westminster power the policymaking powers of the newly formed scottish parliament in turn fostered greater divergence between scotland the rest of the uk during the first decade of the 21st century distinct social policies and political dynamics took hold from 2007 the scottish national party assumed control of the scottish parliament and built itself as the hegemonic political force north of the border securing a majority in the 2011 scottish parliamentary elections and driving through as a result the 2014 independence referendum the emerging politics of brexit within scotland should be understood within this wider historical context the rise of scottish nationalism has been shaped by two long term structural processes britain s relative economic and geo political decline and the on going intensification of uneven development within the union brexit re poses the dilemmas of development which scottish nationalism has faced in the past but in a new form whether brexit will ultimately lead to a second independence referendum and to the long anticipated break up of britain remains to be seen however drawing on nairn we can outline the strategic terrain which scottish nationalism will face in the coming period brexit threatens to further intensify structural weaknesses within british capitalism regulatory divergence from the eu will increase trade barriers between the uk and the single market striking trade deals with non eu states is unlikely to compensate for the consequent decline in economic activity the uk currently trades more with ireland than it does with the brics combined while a trade deal with the united states is expected to add only 0 2 per cent to gdp in the long term as well as limiting access to the single market brexit will lead to a loss of influence over eu regulations confining britain to the status of a rule taker in relation to future eu legislation attempts to reduce net migration are likely to have a negative impact on future economic growth further compounding demographic pressures on britain s already embattled welfare state in combination these pressures are likely to negatively impact upon economic growth and tax revenues further intensifying pressures on britain s ailing economic infrastructure crucially these dynamics are all likely to intensify internal uneven development within britain london and the south east have a far more internationalised export base than the rest of the country while seven per cent of london s gdp is associated with exports to the eu the figure is between 50 and 100 per cent higher in regions outside of the capital in these peripheral regions dependence on eu demand has increased over the recent decades in contrast with areas in the south east most notably london where this dependence has declined european structural funds are similarly concentrated in regions and nations outside of the capital the upshot is that regions outside of the capital including scotland are more vulnerable to the economic shock unleashed by brexit scotland is projected to experience an 9 per cent decline in gdp growth under a no deal scenario compared to only 2 5 per cent in london over the next 15 years under a free trade canada style deal the figure is projected to be 6 per cent in scotland compared to 2 per cent in london these pressures re pose the dilemmas of scottish development which nairn identified in the break up of britain however while it was the discovery of north sea oil which initially fuelled demands for scottish sovereignty today it is the untapped potential of scotland s distinct institutions and political culture which have emerged as the resource ready to be mobilised for future development scottish elites its parliamentary institutions and its civil society are far more amenable to continued integration into the eu and european capitalism as reflected in the 62 per cent vote for remain the strategy of the snp leadership since the june 2016 referendum result has been to leverage scotland s remain vote as a means to build support for a second independence referendum the first element of this strategy is rooted in the claim that brexit lacks a democratic mandate north of the border unionists retort that scotland s 2014 no vote undermines this claim but during that same referendum the better together campaign claimed that only by remaining in the union could scotland guarantee continued membership of the eu brexit has undermined that central premise bringing about the material change in circumstances which justifies a second plebiscite on the independence question crucially this approach has been advanced amidst a wider shift in snp strategy the party s key calculation since 2014 has been that to secure independence a large section of middle scotland the university educated generally better off section of the electorate must be persuaded that its interests are better served by sovereignty lying in holyrood rather than westminster amidst the uncertainties of brexit and the wider instability in the global economy sturgeon has tailored her message to this electoral constituency scotland is projected as an open cosmopolitan and economically responsible member of the international community in contrast to a beleaguered british state increasingly driven by the delusions of the tory backbenches and the atavistic impulses of little england there is of course a clear political logic behind this approach independence as an escape valve from the chaos of brexit has the potential to resonate with a certain section of 2014 no voters but this strategy also comes with grave risks the first independence campaign bolstered by the small but well organised network of left wing groups such as the radical independence campaign has given way to a prospectus of responsible economic policy tailored to the anxieties of scotland s business community and constitutionally conservative middle class this pivot threatens to erode the working class base of support which was in place during the first independence campaign the snp s growth commission published in may 2018 is emblematic of this shift this report chaired by corporate lobbyist and former snp msp andrew wilson and shaped by extensive consultations with scottish business groups and notably without the input of trade unions outlines the economic policy of a future independent scotland under an snp government its headline proposal relates to the issue of currency upon assuming independence scotland would continue to utilise sterling over a lengthy transition period this would assuage fears of devaluation and currency volatility key concerns for middle scotland sitting on savings and assets denominated in sterling there are a number of severe downsides to this proposal first adopting a policy of sterlingisation would mean that scotland would have no control over its future monetary policy the bank of england would set interest rates according to conditions in the rest of the uk irrespective of economic conditions in scotland second scotland would have to secure currency reserves channelled into the new scottish central bank which it would have to secure through running large current account surpluses this would involve restraining imports an objective which would likely have a severe impact on living standards particularly amongst low earners third in order to build international confidence en route to an independent currency the commission recommends that a future snp should reduce its budget deficit from to 3 per cent while maintaining public debt at or below 50 per cent of gdp a level which outstrips even the draconian fiscal criteria of the eurozone in order to do this growth in public expenditure would be held below the rate of growth at 0 5 per cent per annum over a period of five to ten years in a context of rising costs of public service provision this would result in severe real terms constraints on expenditure the commission also recommends that a future independent scotland should lock its corporate tax rate at the uk s internationally low level this strategy of catering to the preferences of the business community and middle scotland is also reflected in the snp s recent domestic policy in the current session of the scottish parliament the snp has only tinkered with income tax while council tax reform once a core snp policy has been delayed the party has dragged its feet on more radical proposals such as a land value tax or reform of landownership this cautious approach comes with considerable risks for those sympathetic to the cause of independence the yes vote in the 2014 referendum was underpinned by the mobilisation of traditional non voting groups and working class communities opting for a decade of expenditure constraint combined with the growth commission s ominous promise to embrace the discipline of international competition is unlikely to mobilise high levels of support amongst low income precariously employed scots in the 2017 election low turnout of working class snp voters contributed to considerable seat losses the party would do well to learn from this chastening experience the rise of scottish nationalism has been intimately tied to two long term historical processes the erosion of the external supports which maintained the british state and capitalism until the post war era and the intensification of internal uneven development which gathered pace in the 1980s from its initial absence in the 19th century to its oil fired emergence in the 1960s to its status as an established force within british politics today the fortunes of scottish nationalism have been closely related to the uneven development of british capitalism brexit is likely to further undermine britain s status as a geo political power and is also likely to deepen regional economic divergence the promise of independence lies in the prospect of charting a different course but the snp s present economic strategy ties independence to the petard of sterlingisation low corporation tax and a decade or more of tight fiscal constraint if scottish independence is going to deliver material social change and command the support of those constituencies at the sharp end of british decline it will have to do much better than this dr scott lavery is a research fellow at the sheffield political economy research institute speri at the university of sheffield

with firming wti pricing the extreme volatility and widened canadian differentials experienced during the fourth quarter weighed heavily on our customers planning as we entered 2019 we see the effects sharply in canada as winter drilling activity is trending down 30 from last winter in canada currently we have 58 rigs operating and do not expect activity to strengthen until the second half of the year as oil inventories decline and takeaway capacity improves canadian differentials have narrowed substantially following the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailment program driving improved cash flows for many of our customers and potentially strengthening the outlook for later in the year despite near term softness our canadian business is well positioned to generate strong cash flow through leveraging our scale with unmatched rig fleet quality and precision s high performance operations in the u s we have 81 rigs operating 16 more than this time last year representing 25 year over year growth while our u s activity is steady our customers are still cautiously assessing 2019 spending plans precision has signed eight term contracts year to date in addition to 11 in

last year while the canadian active land drilling rig count was down approximately 26 to date in 2019 approximately 60 of the canadian industry s active rigs and 81 of the u s industry s active rigs are drilling for oil targets compared with 66 for canada and 80 for the u s at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2019 is expected to be 169 million and includes 53 million for sustaining and infrastructure and 116 million for upgrade and expansion approximately 68 million of which relates to the completion of our sixth new build rig in kuwait we expect that the 169 million will be split 161 million in the contract drilling services

counts revenue from contract drilling services was 392 million this quarter or 27 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 while adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures increased by 22 to 122 million the increase in revenue was primarily due to higher utilization days as well as higher spot market rates in the u s during the quarter we recognized 1 million in shortfall payments in our canadian contract drilling business compared with 13 million in the prior year comparative period in the u s we recognized turnkey revenue of us 11 million compared with us 3 million in the comparative period and we recognized us 0 3 million in idle but contracted rig revenue compared with us 1 million in the comparative quarter of 2017 drilling rig utilization days in canada drilling days plus move days were 4 517 during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 9 compared to 2017 primarily due to decreased industry activity brought on by lower commodity prices and takeaway capacity challenges in canada drilling rig utilization days in the u s were 7 318 or 36 higher than the same quarter of 2017 as our u s activity was up with higher industry activity drilling rig utilization days in our international business were 736 in line with the same quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter in 2017 drilling rig revenue per utilization day in canada decreased 3 as lower shortfall revenue in the current quarter was partially offset by increases in spot market rates and higher expenses recovered through the day rate compared with the prior period drilling rig revenue per utilization day for the quarter in the u s was up 16 compared to the prior year as we realized higher average day rates and turnkey revenue international revenue per utilization day for the quarter was up by 3 compared with the prior year comparative period due to fewer rig moves in canada 15 of our utilization days in the quarter were generated from rigs under term contract compared with 13 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the u s 62 of utilization days were generated from rigs under term contract as compared with 55 in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating costs were 66 of revenue for the quarter one percentage point higher than the prior year period on a per utilization day basis operating costs for the drilling rig division in canada were higher than the prior year period due to timing of equipment certification and equipment maintenance costs and higher expenses recovered through the day rate in the u s operating costs for the quarter on a per day basis were higher than the prior year period primarily due to expenses recovered through the day rate and higher turnkey activity depreciation expense in the quarter was 13 million higher than the prior year comparative period due to the

rig revenue per operating hour in the quarter was 753 or 109 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily the result of increased costs passed through to the customer and rig mix adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily because of higher average rates and improved cost structure partially offset by lower activity operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 78 compared with the prior year comparative quarter of 88 depreciation expense in the quarter was 3 million lower than the prior year comparative period due to the

support functions to our operating segments the corporate and other segment had an adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures of 5 million a 17 million increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower share based incentive compensation and the receipt of the transaction termination fee partially offset by costs associated with our unsuccessful arrangement agreement other items share based incentive compensation plans we have several cash settled share based incentive plans for non management directors officers and other eligible employees the fair values of the amounts payable under these plans are recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the participant becomes entitled to payment the recorded liability is re established at the end of each reporting period until settlement with the resultant change to fair value of the liability recognized in net earnings loss for the period we also have two equity settled share based incentive plans under the executive performance share psu plan which commenced in may 2017 the fair value of the psus granted is calculated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation and that value is recorded as compensation expense over the grant s vesting period with an offset to contributed surplus upon redemption of the psus into common shares the associated amount is reclassified from contributed surplus to shareholders capital the share option plan is treated similarly except that the fair value of the share purchased options granted are valued using the black scholes option pricing model and consideration paid by employees upon exercise of the equity purchase options are recognized in share capital a summary of the amounts expensed recovered under these

recovery was 14 million in the current quarter compared to 2 million in the same quarter in 2017 the increase is primarily due to the declining share price experienced in the current quarter compared to an increasing share price in the comparative 2017 period executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 2 million compared to 1 million in the same quarter in 2017 this increase is a result of the plan being implemented part way through the second quarter in 2017 and from additional grants in 2018 financing charges net financial charges for the quarter were 32 million a decrease of 6 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily because of debt retired in 2017 and mid 2018 partially offset by a weaker canadian dollar on our u s dollar

presentation please note that today s earnings call will run approximately one hour and with that i ll now turn the call over to kare kare if you would please advertisement advertisement kare schultz chief executive officer welcome everybody and thank you for listening in in 2018 we did meet or exceed all the components of our 2018 financial guidance this meant that our revenues came in at 18 9 billion and we did see a stabilization of the quarterly sales between the third and the fourth quarter our non gaap eps came out at 2 92 versus the original guidance which was significantly lower the free cash flow also met the guidance and came in at 3 7 billion and as you all know it s important that we keep generating cash in order to serve the debt that is still significant we deployed a new and unified and simplified organizational structure as a way to reduce the spend base and still keep a very efficient commercial organization manufacturing organization and r d organization we did see the reduction of the spend base of 2 2 billion in 2018 and we also saw a reduction of the net debt by 14 down to 27 1 billion in the united states we launched ajovy we had approval we had launch and we are seeing a very very strong development in the marketplace that we are very satisfied with we are also seeing continuous strong growth of austedo a drop that s been used in huntington s disease and tardive dyskinesia and it continues to gain momentum quarter by quarter advertisement advertisement on copaxone we did see a decline as expected but we are maintaining a high volume share in the u s and european markets and in the north american generic market we did see revenue stabilizing which is significant since we have had a significant decline in the overall north american generic market over the last five years and we talked about this already after the third quarter that we were seeing a stabilization i mentioned it in january at jp morgan and i can confirm it again today that we are seeing stabilization in the total revenues at around the level of roughly usd 1 billion per quarter for our north american generic revenues if we take a look at the spend base then you probably all remember that a bit more than a year ago when we announced the restructuring plan we made it very simplistic we said what was the total spend we had in 2017 we are going to reduce that with 3 billion and we will do it no matter what happens to exchange rates compared to all kind of details to make it simple now we are well on the way to do that we had a gross reduction of 2 3 billion and then we had 0 1 billion of foreign exchange headwind but as i said no matter what the exchange rates are we will meet the target and reduce the spend base in 2019 by 3 billion this of course has not come by easy i already mentioned the one set of plan where we re unifying all our different functions into a classical functional organization as a consequence of this we ve been able to reduce the total manning of the company by more than 10 000 employees since we started the restructuring plan we ve also been reducing the remanufacturing footprint and in 2018 we have been closing seven manufacturing facilities and 11 more will be closed or divested in 2019 if we take a look at the net debt there has been a couple significant movements advertisement advertisement first of all as you probably remember last spring we did a new issuance we used the proceeds from the new issuance and from our cash flow to pay down all term loans meaning that we don t have any term loans any bank loans right now and we also moved some of the bonds into a longer maturity the net effect of all of this was a reduction of the debt by 4 4 billion if we now turn to you could say the future growth drivers then ajovy is of course a key driver as you all know ajovy is a drug in the new class of drugs that treat chronic migraine with fantastic clinical efficacy basically reducing the number of migraine days on average by 50 in some cases up 75 to 100 reduction of migraine days so this is really a fantastic offering to patients first time in 20 years that there is a real new therapy for migraine we are in this class together with two competitors and we are very satisfied with the patient capture we see we see that we roughly now capture around 30 of neutral brain patients and we hope of course to be able to maintain this level going forward a lot of new prescribers are coming every month and we expect to grow the prescriber base on a steady basis over the coming years so ajovy is very important for our future growth and we are very optimistic about the outlook another strong driver is austedo and as i said it s having a high market share in huntington s disease in movement disorders in huntington s but it s also growing strongly in tardive dyskinesia we have one competitor that s also in tardive dyskinesia and this is a new market where there s basically been really no therapy approved before austedo and the competing product so here we are sort of opening up a new market advertisement advertisement and it s a big market probably 0 5 million people in the u s suffer from tardive dyskinesia so we do expect the patient numbers to keep on growing over many years and as a consequence of this we do expect of course also that the revenues of austedo will keep on growing in 18 we exceeded the target we had of 200 million and this is of course to keep growing going forward if we move to the drag we ve had on our revenues for the last year then all of you know that it s copaxone that s the key drag and that the drag is coming due to the expiry of the patent and the fact that we have generic competition both on the 20 milligram since a couple of years and now also on the 40 milligram if you look at the trx count you will see that on a sort of moving annual total we re probably losing around 20 of the scripts and if you look at the revenue you can then detect that we re probably losing on pricing something in the ballpark of 25 altogether around 40 on an ongoing basis we expect this to continue at a similar level during 2019 and as a consequence of that we will of course have a reduction in revenue on copaxone it s important to say that outside of the u s we have a more stable situation we do have a modest decline in europe but it s a lot less than what we re seeing in the u s and we re very happy to conclude that we still at the end of the year had something like 75 volume share of course this will be somewhat reduced during 19 and again in 20 if we look at our focus areas then a key focus is of course to secure the revenue generation i just explained about ajovy and austedo and we have of course not removed the resources during the reorganization from those products which is probably why they re doing so well in the marketplace advertisement advertisement it s also important to mention that we are also going to launch ajovy in europe and that we are also working on broadening the geographical base for austedo and i think i ll just mention here talking about europe that worth mentioning is where we ve had a lot of headwinds in the u s in the last couple of years on copaxone and generics actually europe had its best year ever in terms of operating profit for teva in 2018 we re seeing a stabilization of the generic business but of course as always it only stabilizes as long as you execute new launches that offset the price loss you have on old products but that s what we re seeing right now and what we are striving to maintain we continue to have a drag on revenue from copaxone and from the proair hfa franchise where we do see authorized generics being launched on the expense side we will have to keep on reducing our total spend that s why we are having plans to meet the target of a 3 billion reduction versus 2017 we continue to consolidate our manufacturing sites by closing and divesting some sites and moving production to other sites that continue to be in operation we do have a lot of sites and we also have sometimes challenges with gmp inspections and making sure that we have perfect compliance and quality which is of course what we strive for right now we have had an inspection last year in a site in florida davie where we recently got a warning letter which was expected and we re working to rectify and we don t see it having any short term negative effect on our business we are targeting investments in our pipeline we are targeting investments in biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars and we are constantly optimizing our portfolio of both generic and innovative development projects on the debt side we are committed to utilizing our cash to pay down debt and to continue to do so over the coming years we have 1 7 billion that s scheduled for repayment in 2019 and we will have no liquidity issues with paying down net debt as we will also not have in the coming years so basically we have a financial outlook that is completely in line with the overall plan that we created more than a year ago advertisement advertisement this is a trough year as we are being saying for yes well since the beginning of the plan this is the year where we bottom out on revenue and operating profit and in 2020 we expect to return to growth and continue to do so in the coming years based on the launches of the new products we have set out three long term financial targets and i like to explain just briefly why these are the most important targets for the successful financial performance of our company first of all we need to generate a solid earnings on a long term basis and the only way to do that is to have strong operating income margin right now we are below the 27 but in the coming years we will be improving it it s a combination of improving you could say manufacturing cost for generics by optimizing our manufacturing base and getting the margin lift from launching new and innovative products that typically have a higher margin than generics when we then generate the income we need a high level of cash to earnings in order to have the cash to honor our debt that s why the cash to earnings need to be above 80 which we will ensure in the coming years and of course one of the ways to ensure that is that you don t go out and buy a lot of stuff a lot of things a lot of companies we ll be focused on optimizing our own business rather than adding new businesses to it and as a consequence of these two targets we will be able to reduce our net debt and we do have a target here that we will have a net debt which will be below three times ebitda and we expect to reach that within these three to five years it goes without saying that we are committed to pay down the debt and we do not have any plans to raise equity now having talked about the financial targets i will now hand over to our cfo mike mcclellan advertisement advertisement mike mcclellan chief financial officer thank you kare good morning to everyone i will now take you through the summary of the q4 a brief snapshot on the 2018 results and then follow with our 2019 guidance and important assumptions there we start with a review of our gaap performance we posted a quarterly gaap net loss of approximately 2 9 billion and a loss per share on a gaap basis of 2 85 for the fourth quarter 2018 as i ll detail in the following slides the gaap results were impacted mainly by impairment charges and recurring amortization so if we turn to the next slide you can see here our non gaap adjustments in q4 we saw a significant goodwill and intangible impairments of approximately 2 7 billion mainly related to the international markets coming from a decline of value driven by currency declines as well as negative trends in japan russia and mexico also we see other impairments of approximately 1 billion a large percentage of this is tied to also to japan related to our takayama plant and our long listed products we also have seen a revaluation of intangibles in international markets u s and eu primarily from the actavis acquisition restructuring charges of 46 million in the quarter were significantly lower than the first three quarters of 2018 as the majority of the actions have already been reported so looking at our non gaap performance on slide 15 quarterly revenues were 4 6 billion a decrease of 16 compared to q4 2017 that decrease was mainly attributable to generic competition to copaxone in the u s declines in u s generic products and business divestments of approximately 140 million the majority of which pertain to the women s health and the remaining was a distribution business in europe this was partially offset by new launches in the u s mainly generic sensipar and cialis as well as our brands austedo and our anda business compared to q4 2017 we experienced a negative fx impact of 100 million quarter on quarter net of the fx revenues in q4 2018 decreased 14 gross margin was 51 1 compared to 50 9 in q4 2017 the change in gross margin was driven by an increase in our european generics profitability the discontinuation of our otc jv with procter gamble and higher contribution from new generic launches in north america this was partially offset by the decline in share and profit of copaxone and various specialty products in the u s as well as the divestiture of our women s health business which had a higher gross margin operating profit declined 32 compared to q4 2017 the decrease is mainly attributable to the decline in revenues and the loss of profit from divestitures and discontinued activities we ended with a non gaap eps of 0 53 which declined 0 41 from q4 2017 due to the decrease in operating income partially offset by a lower tax rate we ll talk a bit more about the trends in revenue and cash flow later in the presentation so turning to slide 16 as we guided in november exchange rate movements continue to be a headwind on our revenues in the fourth quarter we see that the exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter of 2018 had a negative impact of 100 million while the impact on operating profits was much more modest the main currencies relevant to our operations decreased and value against the u s dollar were the euro argentinian peso turkish lira and russian ruble turning to slide 17 we ll take a look at some of the revenue trends that we ve been seeing through the different segments in the last quarters our north american generic business had its strongest quarter of the year supported by the launch of generic sensipar and the ongoing exclusive launch of generic cialis copaxone saw its largest sequential quarterly drop as the pace of generic erosion picked up as well as the reserve taken for the 2019 pricing impacts on trade inventories proair revenues in 2018 q4 decreased by 21 compared to 2017 mainly due to the reserve taken in the fourth quarter for utilization shifts in usage and potential return risks following generic competition to the short acting beta antagonist class of drugs including an approved generic version of ventolin hfa and we have launched our own proair authorized generic to select customers in january of 2019 qvar in the u s dropped down to 9 million in the fourth quarter due to net pricing adjustments revenues in europe and in our international markets were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2018 and i ll address both of these markets in a few minutes when i review our assumption for 2019 turning to slide 18 free cash flow for the quarter was 522 million a decrease of 181 million or 182 million versus q3 2018 primarily due to lower net income a higher level of legal settlements and ajovy launch milestone payments for the full year 2018 free cash flow was 3 7 billion which benefited from 1 billion in onetime items in q1 attributable to the working capital adjustment with allergan and the legal settlement with rimsa which we ve mentioned in the previous quarters so if we turn to slide 19 we will see the full year 2018 performance as well as the guidance development for the year despite expected headwinds we were able to exceed our initial guidance our business benefited especially from lower than expected erosion of copaxone as well as our continuing efforts to reduce expenses and tax rate favorability so turning to slide 19 we will now present some of the main assumptions for our 2019 outlook which can also be found in this morning s press release the most notable assumption is our global copaxone revenues which we expect to decline by approximately 900 million versus the full year of 2018 mainly in the u s but we re also seeing in europe competition due to the introduction of competing products putting pressure on prices a few slides ago i spoke about proair and the drop we saw in the fourth quarter we expect 2019 sales to be significantly below 2018 due to the introduction of generic albuterol products somewhat offset by our own launch of an authorized generic version of proair we expect ajovy to grow nicely in 2019 to approximately 150 million in sales based on the momentum we ve seen since our initial launch last september we also see austedo growing to approximately 250 million in sales in 2019 turning to our generics businesses we see a slight decline in north america due to erosion in volume declines offset by our new launches in europe we expect sales will be impacted by our continuing efforts to optimize our portfolio the full year effect of the otc jv dissolution and continued currency headwinds in our international generics we will see pressure on 2019 sales from the adverse impact in japan due to the national health insurance price revision as well as from the continued erosion of long listed products these are products that have lost market exclusivity through the expiration of patent protection and data exclusivity periods international markets will also be continued to be impacted by currency headwinds on slide 21 we ll continue with our assumptions for 2019 including the impact of foreign exchange which we expect to negatively impact sales mainly in the eu and in international markets by 300 million and operating profit by 100 million versus our 2018 full year results and on this slide i d also like to highlight other income which we expect to will significantly decline from the 2018 year total of approximately 200 million so now turning to our financial outlook for 2019 based on the assumptions i just reviewed we expect total 2019 revenues to be between 17 billion and 17 4 billion with the completion of our cost reduction program we expect non gaap operating income to be between 3 8 billion and 4 2 billion while ebitda is expected to be between 4 4 billion and 4 8 billion using a share count of approximately 1 1 billion shares we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 2 20 to 2 50 lastly 2019 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of 1 6 billion to 2 billion this now concludes my presentation we will now open up the call for questions and answers operator if you d please ask the first question questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of jason gerberry your line is open jason gerberry bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning and thank you for taking my questions i guess just first question on 2020 can you talk a little bit about how you drive return to growth there is still pretty fair amount of copaxone in the 19 number so if you can just talk a little bit about how you see broader return to growth and then secondly just on qvar consensus for 19 is about 227 million 4q sales are analyzing at about 35 million so just can you provide a little bit of color on how you re thinking about qvar in 19 thanks kare schultz chief executive officer yes thanks for those two questions i ll address the 2020 and then brendan will give you some color to what s been happening with qvar so you would say if you oversimplify the situation then you can say as you mentioned there is a drag on revenue or pressure on revenue from continued reduction in copaxone sales and let s just assume that they re dropping at around 45 that means that the absolute drag per year goes down so whereas we had a big drop this year we will have a smaller drop in terms of absolute drop in the current year and again next year it will be smaller again now that drop is being offset by the growth of new products the growth of austedo the growth of ajovy and the growth in all of our business in terms of new generic launches so if you look at that total balance then it s pretty clear that this year they re small being lost on copaxone than is being gained on austedo and ajovy and so on whereas in 2020 we ll get to a balance where we believe that at the end of the year we will see that we are significantly growing more than we are losing and that would lead to a marginal growth in revenue and operating profit in 2020 and then once you get into 2021 of course the loss on copaxone is getting close to zero and that means we get the full benefit of the continued growth of austedo ajovy and other products worldwide so that was on the 2020 on qvar brendan could you comment on what we ve seen with qvar and what we expect going forward brendan o grady head of north america commercial yes sure and good morning jason so with qvar obviously last year we transitioned from the mdi product to the redihaler product and that transition occurred in the pipe during the first quarter and it took a little bit longer for the mdi to lean through the system and so you saw some prior period adjustments which is why the net sales ticked down throughout the year in the fourth quarter we got significant medicaid claims that came in which further impacted the net sales but we do see qvar share returning to about 22 which is a very good share for qvar and if we continue to hold that share throughout the year you ll see qvar in that range of 227 million or so as you had noted kare schultz chief executive officer next question please operator the next question comes from the line of david maris please go ahead your line is open david maris wells fargo analyst good morning mike maybe a broad question when you look at the street assumptions of i don t know 600 million or 800 million more in ebitda for 2019 versus your current or your new guidance where do you see the largest difference and then separately were there any expenses that were maybe worked up in 2018 other than maybe a little bit of austedo or ajovy expenses that aren t being repeated and what s the scale of the what were the scale of those expenses thanks mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes so i d take a little bit of a stab at where see differences versus the street expectations we did mention some of these headwinds in our presentation at jp morgan i think our copaxone is a little bit below what the expectations are definitely proair we saw in january that there was a launch of an authorized generic to one of our competitors and we have to look at this class as being generically written for almost majority of the script so that s causing a big change and we see a significant decline coming there i think we also see that we are going to meet the 3 billion cost saving target but i think some of the expectations we would go even a little bit further than that and then again we don t have a repeat of this other income that was out there in 2018 and that s putting a little bit of a pressure so i think those are the main things and you combine that with the currency impact we ve seen that in the second half of 2018 and we see that continuing into 19 being a continued pressure and when we look at some of the external models i don t think the same effect as come through as strong as we see it so those are the main things in terms of expenses we did see a rather flat operating expenses q4 versus q4 but you have to remember that in q4 of 2017 we actually had a period where we reversed the year to date bonuses as we did not pay 17 bonus in 18 so the q4 last year was little a bit artificially deflated we re still on a good path but the majority of the actions have been taken out and we will start to see the spend base in the second half of 19 start to stabilize with the first after the some decline in the first half so those are the things that i see any other points you want to ask we can take from there david maris wells fargo analyst no i think i guess just as a follow up on the pointed guidance i ve gotten a number of emails already that say ok well this just seems sandbagged and so the stock is down 12 premarket just kind of your thoughts on guidance conservatism and how conservative do you think this is on the low end what could go wrong that would get you to that low end kare schultz chief executive officer so in terms of the overall guidance guidance in my mind needs to be realistic and conservative it s not a sort of average gain where if you get it right every second time then it s fine so you can t come out with the guidance that you will meet 50 50 so you need to have some credibility and some assurance that you can meet your guidance and i think that s very important when we discuss it it s also important that you are in a range of what can realistically happen and that you have a downward part of your guidance that covers if most things goes wrong and you could say there s a lot of moving parts here we just talked about some of them you never know how fast the product goes generic we are assuming that copaxone stays on the current trend it could go faster it could go slower you never know how fast you ramp up a product when you have two competitors ajovy could go better ajovy could go worse so you have a lot of moving parts and then when you give a guidance you take a educated estimate of all these moving parts and you explain the assumptions you have and then of course if someone s assumptions turn out to be worse or better that affects the actual result but that s why we explain the assumptions in our guidance next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of louise chen please go ahead louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst hi thanks for taking my questions here quite a few my first question was that you noted 2019 as your trough year so how should we think about the upward inflection in 2019 can you give us a sense of the magnitude even if it s just qualitative and then the second thing is what do you include in your guidance for 2019 in margins in the u s and outside the u s for generics and then just last year in terms of longer vision for teva is a brand of the generics what are you focused on going forward after this trough period thank you kare schultz chief executive officer so i think mike if you take the first question and brendan take the second and i ll take the last one mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes so we do see 2019 as the trough at this point we will see a return to revenue growth in 2020 and i would expect as well an operating profit growth but we re probably talking single digits into 2020 and then starting to accelerate beyond there we still have potential drag in 2020 depending on how the bendeka situation in the u s turns out so that s a little bit of a wild card in that and then of course currencies could be positive or negative versus the 2019 depending on how the markets develop brendan o grady head of north america commercial and so in regard to new generic launches for 2019 i think we see 2019 shaping up very well potentially of course any new generic launches are a mix of legal technical and regulatory success but you never really know where that s going to play out but we do have some significant launches planned for 2019 so i think that overall we should see a fairly good year as far as new generic launches go kare schultz chief executive officer in longer term as for 2019 our vision is to be and continue to be leaders in generics worldwide and to build a strong pipeline and have success in biopharmaceuticals meaning in both biosimilars and innovative biologics and you could say if you want to look at what s then coming then of course there is the rollout of ajovy worldwide with the european launches coming out this year and rest of the world in the coming years there is an exciting development project that we have together with regeneron on pain therapy and if fasinumab turns out come out with good safety data and gets approved then that s an exciting possibility to put people on a non addicted pain therapy which will be really really good and this is a product we will be together with regeneron then launching both in the u s and worldwide so there is a lot of exciting things happening we have a broad pipeline also of biosimilars that we ll be launching in the coming years so it will be in those areas of continued leadership in generics both simple and complex generics and then biopharmaceuticals mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes and to add to the 2019 2020 point we would see the inflection actually starting in the back half of 2019 through the quarterly progression louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst ok thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator thank you the next question comes from the line of greg gilbert your line is open greg gilbert deutsche bank analyst thanks two points of clarification on 2019 guidance on a couple potentially material items one is how are you treating the generic risk to treanda and whether and when that happens and on the positive side are you confident launching or you are assuming you are launching generic forteo later in the year and then kare i certainly understand why you don t want the company to spend cash flow and operational time on large acquisitions what about licensing deals or smaller bolt ons that will help further your franchises particularly on the branded side do you have flexibility to do that and are you focused on that thank kare schultz chief executive officer ok so i suggest that mike if you cover treanda brendan cover forteo and then i ll answer the last question mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes so our guidance doesn t include a material impact from treanda generics because it s not likely they ll launch before the very late part of 2019 so there is just a minor impact if we do see that the orphan drug exclusivity for bendeka keeps the treanda generics off the market there could be a slight upside to what we put forward in 2019 but we don t expect it to be material that is actually being handled by our partner eagle as it is their marketing authorization for bendeka from and we re not directly involved in the legal discussion there brendan o grady head of north america commercial in regards to forteo it is in the second half of the year as per our plan if it continues to proceed as anticipated we have it appropriately risk adjusted in the new overall numbers but it continues to move along kare schultz chief executive officer in terms of acquisitions you re absolutely right we have no plans of doing any significant acquisitions of any kind we spend the money basically on reducing our debt however we do of course fill the pipeline on an ongoing basis and of course we are doing business development work in early in licensing ensuring that we can get early ideas in that can support our biopharmaceutical pipeline going forward and of course we are also open to local deals on complex generics all the opportunities that might arise that makes sense so it s not that we are not active in the business development area it s just not big corporate deals it s a specific product in licensing we re talking about greg gilbert deutsche bank analyst thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator the next question comes from the line of chris schott please go ahead your line is open chris schott j p morgan analyst great thanks very much just had a couple questions on ajovy if i could i guess the first was can you just update us at this point on your expectations for gross to net for the drug and how we should be thinking about the amount of free product that s been provided in the market i m just trying to get a better sense of how to ramp the 4q sales we just saw relative to the 2019 outlook for that drug and then second question on the same topic you ve obviously seen a very strong uptake so far for the product but can you just talk about the impacts that you see from being i think you re nonpreferred on two of the national formularies how does that factor into how you re thinking of the competitive landscape for the product at this point thank you brendan o grady head of north america commercial so just a little bit on the gross to net so as ajovy continues to evolve throughout the year and as we get to 19 one of the things that i think is important to keep in mind is that payer access is going to continue to be fluid a lot of the discussions are still ongoing there is payers that made decisions early in the fourth quarter of 2018 they re going to look at it again in early 2019 i think you ll see some decisions that will change in mid 2019 so i don t think the payer landscape really solidifies until probably 2020 and of course when you have three products like this that all have very similar efficacy all launched at the same time it makes for a rather aggressive payer environment so it will continue to be fluid i think that we have discussions ongoing with many of the payers currently i think that some of the announcements that have come out there are still discussions that are ongoing we are not really excluded anywhere so this is all the balance and you need to balance the access with the appropriate amount of discount in gross to net so i would say that as you look at ajovy today we have about 60 coverage in the commercial sector which i think is fairly good we continue to add plans throughout the first quarter we ve got some wins just recently and overall i think that we ll have the appropriate access that we need to hit the number that we re looking to hit which i think mike communicated earlier around 150 million mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator the next question comes from the line of randall stanicky your line is open randall stanicky rbc capital markets analyst great thanks kare are you guys still committed to net leverage below four times by the end of 2020 and the reason i ask is because wouldn t that imply a notable step up toward 5 billion in ebitda if that s the case and then secondly can you just comment on the u s generic gross margin how much of a step up or a ramp are we going to see from that the pruning of 400 million in unprofitable revenue there i would think should add several hundred basis points to the u s gross margin can you just confirm if that s the case maybe give some directional color going forward thanks kare schultz chief executive officer so your first question on the four times net debt to ebitda at the end of 2020 you re absolutely right that it takes a bit of strong performance in 2020 to get to that at the end of 2020 so i won t be able to tell you firmly that we will for sure hit it exactly at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 it could be that it s slightly later what s most important is of course our long term financial target which is three times so going below three times net debt to ebitda and we ll be progressing toward that over the next three to five years there ll be no change in our strategy so the exact timing remains to be seen but the key important driver is that we are driving toward the constant debt reduction over the coming years when it comes to the gross margin then you would say when you look at the total picture which is i guess what you can see in the numbers then we have a drag on the gross margin from copaxone sales being reduced the fact that we are reducing the price and the volume of this high margin product means that there is a negative effect on our gross margin we ve seen a positive effect on our generics which goes the other way and we will continue to see a marginal positive effect on our u s generics margin in the coming years mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes and if i could add to the debt question first of all we expect to pay down the 1 7 billion maturities in july through operating cash flow and cash on hand we re not expecting to refinance and second we are actively starting discussions with our core banking group to look at reshaping our revolving credit facility to get out in front of getting it to the 12 month window being current so we re working on that and we hope to conclude on that in early 2019 randall stanicky rbc capital markets analyst ok great thanks guys mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator thank you the next question comes from the line of vamil divan your line is open vamil divan credit suisse analyst great thanks so much for taking the question just maybe following up on the ajovy commentary and questions just you mentioned europe also is a target market here and i know you saw some pushback from nice on aimovig so just trying to think about what your expectations there are in terms of timing of launch and sort of the pace that we should expect there and also maybe net pricing as compared to what we re going to see in the u s thanks kare schultz chief executive officer thank you for that question we are of course expecting to have the final eu approval very soon we have positive opinion so that means within two months we will have the actual eu approval and the way you launch in europe is really market by market and that s because not because you don t have the approval but because you need reimbursement and reimbursement is of course something you settle with the governments the healthcare systems in each of the countries so what you will expect is in the markets where it s relatively easy to launch at a good and reasonable and fair price compared to the value of the product you will see early launches so this year for instance countries like some of the scandinavian markets countries like germany you will see us launching the product in other countries it might take negotiations for one to two years before you end up seeing the launch if we look at our competitors then you could say that we have a situation here where the european pricing looks to be very similar to u s pricing so we might actually end up with a situation where the net price per patient is higher in europe than in the u s which would be a first i guess but that s how it s looking right now and the unmet need in europe is huge but however you see it it s a slower ramp up due to the fact that you have these prolonged negotiations especially in the southern european countries but also in u k where you have local organizations even that you get into negotiations with so we will expect a solid and positive uptake but with a slower ramp up than you see in the u s but with a good and healthy operating margin on the business vamil divan credit suisse analyst thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator thank you the next question comes from the line of david amsellem your line is open david amsellem piper jaffray analyst thanks just a couple so first can you talk about this product specifications one is on epipen and on the generic and how are you thinking about the ramp of that product and how the market dynamics for that product will play out and also wanted to circle back to forteo i know it s in the guidance and risk adjusted but i did want to get your thoughts on the potential for other entrants and how crowded that market will be this is more of a 2020 question and beyond but wanted to get your thoughts on the extent to which that s going to be a sustainable stream of cash flows thanks brendan o grady head of north america commercial ok so david thank you for the question so let me i ll address epipen first and then i ll come to forteo as far as epipen goes of course the market is still in an overall shortage of epinephrine and we re continuing to manufacture and build more supply i think you ll see us coming to a more normal supply by the end of the first quarter early second quarter and of course then we launch or we ll have epipen jr late second quarter in the june time frame so we continue to build supply it s getting better and we have it out there and it s available so it s available for customers that they need to order it and we are making nice progress on epipen as it and your question around forteo we ll have to wait and see forteo is not an easy product to make and we ll see who are the competitors coming to the market in 2020 but overall we feel pretty good about forteo and we feel pretty good about the runway that we have with it david amsellem piper jaffray analyst ok and then if i may sneak in just another one in terms of other key launches that you re willing to call out are there any that we should think about that should be on our radar this year or early next year sort of limited competition or exclusivity opportunities thanks brendan o grady head of north america commercial yes i mean i think you can think of couple other ones i think that restasis is hopefully a launch for us this year we ll see where we go with the fda we re awaiting with fda action on that product so that could be a nice product as well as the other one would be nuvaring that we re looking at as well this year david amsellem piper jaffray analyst thanks mike mcclellan chief financial officer all right next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of ken cacciatore your line is open ken cacciatore cowen and company analyst great thank you just wanted to ask back again on the ajovy and austedo where you seem to be doing really well and performing very strongly just specifically on ajovy it s our understanding in talking to some consultants that aimovig may be suffering from a bit of higher constipation than they originally expected so just wanted to understand in the marketplace right now how much you re benefiting from that how big of an issue you think it is or what are you hearing from your sales force as they continue to market ajovy and then on austedo maybe if you could break down the percentage hd versus td at this point and any nuance you can give us on potential dosing advantage what s going on in the td marketplace again you seem to be showing nice acceleration for that product as well thank you kare schultz chief executive officer thanks for those questions ken i ll give just an overall comment and then brendan can give some more details it s of course a well known fact from the labeling and from the clinical trials that aimovig has constipation as a safety issue and that s been documented when it comes to anecdotal evidence it s quite clear that it is you could say an unpleasant side effect on the type of side effects have and in a three player game where you have one product that has it and you have two projects that do not have it because they have a slight different mechanism of action then long term i believe it will be a benefit for us that we don t have this negative side effect it s difficult for us to comment on any specifics where you would because we don t have insight into the ongoing safety follow up and database on that but for sure there is a product differentiation here which we think will work to our benefit both in the u s and in the european market and then i also just like to say that on tardive dyskinesia this is a brand new marketplace and there has never been any drugs before to treat tardive dyskinesia so it s a huge medical benefit that we are bringing to a lot of people and i think it will be going for long time but maybe brendan you can give some more details brendan o grady head of north america commercial yes so just a first a quick comment on ajovy so i think that everything that kare said regarding ajovy is obviously accurate but the other part of it is that with three of these products launching in relative close proximity with aimovig out first i think when the other two were approved with ajovy i think that practitioners and prescribers are going to look at some of the different products and going to use some of the different products to see how they actually result in the real world in patients and see if there are differences we designed ajovy or the launch of the ajovy to make it really easy for physicians to use and access so we put samples in the office of course the prefilled syringe is a very simple way to inject the product so ultimately we are very happy with the uptake there that we re seeing on ajovy and i think that our significant presence in the headache centers and with neurologists bodes well for our early success so we re happy with where we are we re going to continue the launch trajectory around ajovy and we re very happy with what we re hearing back from physicians and patients regarding the overall effectiveness of the drug as we talk about austedo i ll just add that we launched austedo early first for huntington s disease and then came in the market about six months later for tardive dyskinesia and as kare pointed out that s a very underserved market and it s a very large market so we re happy with the potential that we see for tardive dyskinesia we have significant sales force presence around that will continue to drive that indication in that market ken cacciatore cowen and company analyst thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of david risinger your line is open david risinger morgan stanley analyst yes thanks very much i have a couple questions first could you please comment on the international business outlook it appears that the international business is performing worse than expected and i know that you have emphasized the u s stabilization but i didn t hear you previously talk about international weakening and then second with respect to manufacturing i think kare said that when you were when you had recently joined teva you said that if you started the company from scratch you d have 12 facilities globally i think the company is targeting to be at about 65 could you help us understand why that won t go to 45 thank you kare schultz chief executive officer thanks for those two questions if we take the international business first then it s correct that we are some headwind right now which is what we have been reporting and what we have also included in our guidance and i would say i would call out two key things one is the pricing reforms in japan the pricing reforms in japan had led to a bigger drop in the price on what s called long listed products so these are kind of branded generics you could say and there is a tradition of high use of those in japan and the authorities are pushing down pricing on these products more than they ve been doing until recently so that s a negative then there is the whole currency element where you could say there s a lot of markets in the international markets which have had significant weakening of their currencies countries like for instance turkey and many latin american countries have seen a weakening of the currencies so you could say it s really not the underlying volume it s really not the underlying demand in the market that s causing us problems it s these specifics on pricing and currency that is the main driver on the manufacturing side you quoted me absolutely correctly and of course one thing is how you doing a greenfield thing a thing most companies do not have a manufacturing setup that is the same as they would do if they could do it from scratch and that s definitely not the case for us and we did start or we didn t start but when i joined the company we had around 80 manufacturing facilities and as i mentioned today we have closed seven and we re about to close a dozen more so we ll probably get down to around 60 at the end of the restructuring but that of course doesn t mean that we won t do anymore going forward but it s very complex when you close down existing facilities because you have all the regulatory approvals have all the validations sometimes you have specific equipment so it takes time but we will of course continue to consolidate and improve efficiencies in our manufacturing for the next many many years but you will not see the same dramatic reduction as you see in the restructuring period you will see a more modest reduction in the number of manufacturing sites and you will see us striving to improve the gross margin of our generics business on a constant basis mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes let me add one quick thing to the international markets there is about 50 million impact of divestments we still had women s health sales in the first half of 2018 and we have divested recently the teva adapter business which was announced last week that will be another about 30 million drag so overall about 50 million is related to divestments of business david risinger morgan stanley analyst thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question please operator thank you the next question comes from the line of ronny gal your line is open ronny gal bernstein analyst good morning everybody and thank you for taking my questions i have three if i can sneak them in first we just finished analyzing the 2019 formulary covering coverage in multiple sclerosis and it seems there has been quite a big shift starting 1q 19 about access just so we are kind of ready for this volume versus share lot it looks like you lost coverage in tricare united and esi is this what you were saying is this actually the case here we re seeing external is not always right and if so should we be just ready for a significant more volume loss in 2019 second we ve heard that post esi cigna close there has been a pretty sharp demand for concession from all biopharma on the branded side is this true how does this impact your branded product trajectories and does that also extends to your cvs close of aetna essentially are we seeing the consolidation on the insurance side coming in for further demand for especially older products in competitive markets and third more on the financial side you re kind of guiding to like 1 8 billion in free cash flow in 2019 this is the i guess bucket from which you pay your debt down and i m kind of wondering is that number just giving how much it s lower than 2018 includes any assumptions about pay down of some sort of penalties or fines from some of the existing litigation or this is kind of like a pure business decline from which we have to start our 2020 projections brendan o grady head of north america commercial so ronny i ll answer one and two and then i ll let mike take number three as far as overall copaxone formulary access those are the things that we built into the plan this year and i think you can see it in our numbers for copaxone we worked in we anticipated tricare and both unitedhealthcare and i think that express scripts which will bridge us to the next question express scripts is always a little bit of a more of a tricky answer as it goes there so i would necessarily assume depending upon what you see in any particular formulary based on different agreements we have with numerous payers that just because you in the formulary is actually how it is going to play out with the various covered life and any one particular pbm or payer as a result to the as a response to your question with esi and the meeting that they had i wasn t there i think that meeting occurred last week or the week before last where they brought manufactures down and kind of rolled out to then the new landscape with the esi and cigna merger or acquisition as to what their expectations are but i do i have obviously heard we re studying what they ve communicated and what their asks are i think this is pretty aggressive and i think that potentially an overreach there may be some cms medicare price implications to consider and i think that there will be probably significant manufacturer push back from what i know of it but i need to study it a little bit more and given my team is fairly new when we re going to see overall impact so with that i ll hand it over to mike and you can answer the cash flow mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes so if we look at the difference between the 3 7 billion that we actually realized in 2018 and say that 1 8 billion midpoint of the guidance about 1 billion came off from special items that i mentioned earlier the allergan working capital and the rimsa compensation net income is down roughly 600 million to 700 million so that drags we will see less restructuring cash out but we will have bonus payments in 2019 for the 2018 year which we did not in 18 for the 17 year but the thing that is probably abnormal if you re looking for forward cash generation is we do have a little bit of an overhang of all of the increase of rebates that have been happening in the second half of 18 will have a little bit of a drag on the net receivables in 2019 so we ll 300 million to 400 million cash drag that should dissipate over the first couple quarters in 2019 so that s where we get to the 1 8 billion which i think that cash drag on the rebate payments is probably the difference between what you would expect in the external models ronny gal bernstein analyst great thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator thank you the next question comes from the line of liav abraham your line is open liav abraham citigroup good morning kare could you update us on your thoughts on opportunities to rationalize the cost base beyond 2019 you talked a little bit earlier about some opportunities on the plant side anything else that you can comment on and can we expect that 3 billion number to potentially grow and then secondly on ajovy apologizes if i missed this but can you update us what percentage of scripts are being written for the once quarterly formulation thank you kare schultz chief executive officer yes so first in terms of the spend base reduction once we ve completed the current restructuring we will have it reduced by 3 billion and of course there are still opportunities the majority of those will probably be on the gross margin the reason i m saying so is that when i look at our r d spend our commercial spend so sales promotion so on then we are actually very competitive when we look at the situation at the end of 19 so the majority comes from the cost of goods sold from the gross margin we do have a very high level of cost of goods sold due to the fact that we have very very high generic volumes and as i said before this is something we ll be working on long term there is no really quick fix to this because it s very technically complicated we do serve 100 200 million patients every day we do make more than 30 000 different products on an ongoing basis so it s a big parcel but there is certainly possibilities to improve it based on my previous experience and i won t say that we are having a firm number yet we ll of course tell you about this a year from now i would say that you can expect that you can improve the gross margin some 50 to 100 basis points per year if you have a really good optimization program in place when it comes to ajovy and the quarterly dosing we are seeing that roughly in any given week roughly 10 11 of the scripts are for quarterly dosing that basically means that 30 of the patients if you look at it from the point of view are on the quarterly dosing and the reason for the difference is of course that if you get a script for monthly dosing that counts as just one script if you get a script for the quarterly dosing it counts as one script but covers three months so therefore we have this thing we call normalized script numbers normalized patient numbers and in those numbers you could say roughly 30 of the patients are on the quarterly dosing liav abraham citigroup thank you mike mcclellan chief financial officer next question operator thank you the last question comes from the line of esther rajavelu your line is open esther rajavelu deutsche bank analyst thank you for squeezing me in i had one quick one on austedo can you help us understand the sequential change in austedo patient numbers versus reported revenues for the quarter and then also you mentioned growth in ous market for austedo so if you can provide any specifics on what your plans are there that would be helpful as well kare schultz chief executive officer yes so if you want to reconcile the actual growth in patient numbers with the actual revenues then of course there s a little bit of uncertainty on the patient numbers and when you look at the actual revenue there s always the swings you would see in the pipeline in the sense that we ship products to wholesalers to specialty pharmacies they ship it to patients and there can be some minor fluctuations there if you sort of average it out and look at a longer time then you see there is a very strong correlation between the growth in patient numbers the growth in scripts and the growth in revenue and going forward we do expect austedo to be growing strongly you saw in our assumptions for 2019 that we are assuming sales around 350 million up from the rough 200 million we did last year so we expect austedo to keep on growing and the reason why we are also optimistic about the long term growth is that if you compare our actual patient numbers to the fact that more than 500 000 americans suffer from tardive dyskinesia then that gives you a hint about the long term potential of the product mike mcclellan chief financial officer yes when it comes to the ex u s markets there is not going to be any material impact in the near term as we re still looking at the regulatory path to get the product on the market so it s not something that really will have a big factoring in the austedo uptake in the coming years esther rajavelu deutsche bank analyst got it thank you kevin mannix senior vice president investor relations all right thank you everybody i appreciate everybody participating in the call today we ll be around today tomorrow in the coming weeks to take any of your questions and

were 30 million as at december 31 2018 we have classified 22 north american drilling rigs 18 in canada and four in the u s as assets held for sale and reported these assets at their carrying value of 20 million precision s president and ceo kevin neveu stated precision executed on its 2018 business plan and delivered operating and financial results far exceeding our expectations this execution was clear in all key financial and operating metrics delivering strong rig and crew operating and safety performance diligent variable and fixed cost control growth in u s market share and forging the path to commercializing our technology initiatives all while strictly controlling our capital spending precision s execution in 2018 resulted in better than expected cash flow allowing us to accelerate our debt repayment plan well beyond our stated target range for the year retiring 174 million of debt in 2018 in the fourth quarter strong demand for our super series rigs and firm pricing in the u s combined with aggressive cost management in our canadian businesses drove better than expected financial results we enter 2019 with liquidity of over 800 million and remain firmly committed to our deleveraging plan recently increasing our longer term debt reduction target range by 100 million to 400 million to 600 million by the end of 2021 while customer sentiment has recently improved with firming wti pricing the extreme volatility and widened canadian differentials experienced during the fourth quarter weighed heavily on our customers planning as we entered 2019 we see the effects sharply in canada as winter drilling activity is trending down 30 from last winter in canada currently we have 58 rigs operating and do not expect activity to strengthen until the second half of the year as oil inventories decline and takeaway capacity improves canadian differentials have narrowed substantially following the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailment program driving improved cash flows for many of our customers and potentially strengthening the outlook for later in the year despite near term softness our canadian business is well positioned to generate strong cash flow through leveraging our scale with unmatched rig fleet quality and precision s high performance operations in the u s we have 81 rigs operating 16 more than this time last year representing 25 year over year growth while our u s activity is steady our customers are still cautiously assessing 2019 spending plans precision has signed eight term contracts year to date in addition to 11 in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicative of continued strength in high spec rig demand over the last year we have increased our ac super triple 1500 rig fleet in the u s by five including two rigs redeployed from canada and three new builds largely assembled from spare components and vendor credits additionally we completed 31 rig upgrades including pad walking systems third mud pump additions and process automation control upgrades all cash deployed to mobilize build new and upgrade rigs was backed with take or pay customer contracts at leading edge rates and we managed these u s fleet enhancements with relatively modest capital spending currently we have eight rigs operating in the middle east all performing exceedingly well in saudi arabia we expect to sign long term contracts on the two rigs currently up for renewal by the end of the quarter and in kuwait we are on time and on budget to deploy a sixth new build rig in june by mid year we expect to have nine rigs operating in the middle east all under long term contracts providing stable cash flow visibility precision s technology strategy displayed significant progress throughout 2018 with 33 process automation control systems installed 31 of which are active in the field during the year we were able to demonstrate to our customers our system s ability to deliver consistent and repeatable high quality results while improving safety performance and operational efficiency going into 2019 our priorities revolve around further commercialization of the process automation control platform pd apps and pd analytics as precision remains a leader in advanced rig technology offerings precision remains focused on the things in which it can control namely allocating free cash flow toward debt repayment capital discipline cost management and operational excellence commodity price volatility is likely to persist throughout 2019 however we believe we are well positioned across each of our geographies to manage

services was down 4 million or 10 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower activity in our canadian businesses our service rig operating hours in the quarter were down 19 from the fourth quarter of 2017 while rates increased an average of 17 approximately 81 of our fourth quarter canadian service rig activity was oil related during the quarter completion and production services generated 90 of its revenue from canadian operations and 10 from u s operations compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 where 92 of revenue was generated in canada and 8 in the u s average service rig revenue per operating hour in the quarter was 753 or 109 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily the result of increased costs passed through to the customer and rig mix adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily because of higher average rates and improved cost structure partially offset by lower activity operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 78 compared with the prior year comparative quarter of 88 depreciation expense in the quarter was 3 million lower than the prior year comparative period due to the recognition of gains on disposal of capital assets in the current year compared with losses on disposal in the prior year segment review of corporate and other our corporate and other segment provides support functions to our operating segments the corporate and other segment had an adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures of 5 million a 17 million increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower share based incentive compensation and the receipt of the transaction termination fee partially offset by costs associated with our unsuccessful arrangement agreement other items share based incentive compensation plans we have several cash settled share based incentive plans for non management directors officers and other eligible employees the fair values of the amounts payable under these plans are recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the participant becomes entitled to payment the recorded liability is re established at the end of each reporting period until settlement with the resultant change to fair value of the liability recognized in net earnings loss for the period we also have two equity settled share based incentive plans under the executive performance share psu plan which commenced in may 2017 the fair value of the psus granted is calculated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation and that value is recorded as compensation expense over the grant s vesting period with an offset to contributed surplus upon redemption of the psus into common shares the associated amount is reclassified from contributed surplus to shareholders capital the share option plan is treated similarly except that the fair value of the share purchased options granted are valued using the black scholes option pricing model and consideration paid by employees upon exercise of the equity purchase options are recognized in share capital a summary of the amounts expensed recovered under these plans during the reporting periods are as follows three months ended december 31 year ended december 31 stated in thousands of canadian dollars 2018 2017 2018 2017 cash settled share based incentive

recovery was 14 million in the current quarter compared to 2 million in the same quarter in 2017 the increase is primarily due to the declining share price experienced in the current quarter compared to an increasing share price in the comparative 2017 period executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 2 million compared to 1 million in the same quarter in 2017 this increase is a result of the plan being implemented part way through the second quarter in 2017 and from additional grants in 2018 financing charges net financial charges for the quarter were 32 million a decrease of 6 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily because of debt retired in 2017 and mid 2018 partially offset by a weaker canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated interest expense gain on repurchase and redemption of unsecured senior notes during the quarter we redeemed us 30 million of our 6 5 unsecured senior notes due 2021 and repurchased and cancelled us 44 million principal amount of our 5 25 unsecured senior notes due 2024 resulting in a net gain of 7 million income tax income tax expense for the quarter was a recovery of 2 million compared with a recovery of 17 million in the same quarter in 2017 the tax recovery in the quarter decreased over the prior year period due to improved results prior to the non taxable portion of the goodwill impairment liquidity and capital resources the oilfield services business is inherently cyclical in nature to manage this we focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet so we have the financial flexibility we need to continue to manage our growth and cash flow regardless of where we are in the business cycle we maintain a variable operating cost structure so we can be responsive to

on this call today as we completed 2018 and started this new year of 2019 it has given me the opportunity to pause and consider what i ve learnt in the past nearly two years since becoming the ceo i

the best and most talented people this world has to offer our relentless focus on customer growing their customer base is working two years ago i truly believe we could grow our business and deliver

clear to me now we will change the world and i look forward to a great year here in 2019 i was particularly encouraged as we closed the year with a solid fourth quarter wherein we generated 7 constant currency revenue growth our reported revenue growth was 3 which included a negative currency impact of 4 these are very promising results as the prior year included a 130 million of revenue from our lumispa product introduction and a quarter in which we reported 25 growth for 2018 our annual revenue was 2 68 billion an 18 improvement for the year and was driven by growth in every region except japan and in japan we actually showed modest improvements throughout the year i was especially pleased also with 16 growth in our customer base which we reported this quarter and the steady growth in our sales force that happen throughout the year this is a direct result of our growth strategy and ryan will speak to this in a few minutes our fourth quarter operating margin was strong and earnings per share were 1 05 when excluding the impact of the previously announced one time impairment and restructuring charge of 1 37 when including the restructuring charge we reported a loss of 0 32 the 1 05 earnings per share includes a 0 04 purchase accounting charge we believe our strategic decision to transform our technology platform allows us to accelerate the execution of our vision to grow this company and reach our potential this transformation of our organization will open the power of cloud technology to significantly advance our capabilities as a customer centric organization at the beginning of 2018 we made the strategic decision to acquire three manufacturing enterprises to secure our supply chain increase our innovation and accelerate our ability to bring products to market during the quarter our manufacturing entities reported revenue of 25 million and we are beginning to see the benefits we anticipated from these partners through improvements in our nu skin gross margin each of these partner company showed strong year over year revenue and profit growth in 2018 and each has great potential to continue to grow going forward we ve also spoken in the past about our investment in indoor growing technology often referred to as cea or controlled environment agriculture our cea vision is to enhance our ability to provide our customers with clean sustainable ingredients give our customers full sourcing transparency and provide us with a competitive advantage in our product development innovation we continue to make significant advancements in our capabilities and technology that empower this vision and we look forward to sharing more insight on our plans including a tour of our facilities for those interested at our investor day we anticipate another great year in 2019 with projected currency neutral revenue growth of 5 to 7 and earnings per share of 3 80 to 4 05 mark will discuss this guidance further in his commentary i m excited to share more information surrounding our vision for the company at our investor day on february 28th it will be held here at our corporate headquarters in utah and it will be also webcast we look forward to seeing many of you at that time i ll now turn the call over to ryan to provide an update on our global business ryan napierski president thanks ritch good afternoon everyone we re excited with our growth strategy and what drove in 2018 in terms of strong results and remain focused on the three pillars as we make steady progress in each one first regarding engaging platforms we continue to leverage social sharing which empowers our sales leaders to attract acquire and retain more customers through their use of social media and technology from a company perspective we re also employing social media in various ways to more effectively promote our business for example in the fourth quarter in south korea we successfully reintroduced our nu skin 180 system using the kakao talk social platform and we utilize the popular wechat platform in a similar way in mainland china to launch a new prebiotic product balance plus as ritch noted under the direction of our new technology leadership team we are making some significant changes accelerating our ability to become a more customer obsessed digitally enabled organization key to our progress is our migration to the cloud which expands our scale capacity and flexibility to better service the needs of our customers around the globe on the enabling products front ageloc lumispa continues to perform well and drive customer acquisition with strong demand globally accounting for 11 of nu skin s fourth quarter revenue and more than 250 million for the year during the fourth quarter we also began to extend the lumispa franchise by introducing lumispa accent in a few of our markets accent is a new lumispa attachment which when used with the reformulated idealized treatment serum provides focused benefits for the more delicate skin around the eyes we expect lumispa to remain a key growth brand for us in 2019 finally regarding empowering programs we continue to roll out velocity around the world this compensation enhancement focuses on accelerating rewards to sales leaders on a daily weekly and monthly basis it also provide increased rewards for sharing our products and greater flexibility to appeal to a broader entrepreneurial demographic during the fourth quarter velocity was launched in south korea and we are on pace to have it fully implemented in all markets by mid 2019 with the exception of mainland china which operates under a different business model velocity continues to drive key growth behaviors among our sales force including increased customer acquisition as evidenced by our 16 customer growth this past year so collectively our growth strategy drove solid results in each of our segments in mainland china we grew constant currency revenue for the year by 21 and 2 for the fourth quarter and while there has been some concern about the impact of trade negotiations on the china economy as well as increased media and regulatory scrutiny around the nutrition market we continue to anticipate growth in 2019 in hong kong and taiwan we posted positive year over year growth of 11 and quarterly growth of 4 in constant currency reflecting continued interest in lumispa and social sharing in south korea the business improved from a 15 decline in 2017 to a 1 constant currency growth in 2018 and up 2 in the fourth quarter during the quarter we launched our velocity compensation enhancement which when coupled with the restage of the nu skin 180 system improved both customers and revenue in americas and pacific we grew 20 in constant currency for the year and 3 for the quarter these results were driven by strong growth in the pacific and latin america despite the hyper inflationary environment in argentina which tempered the growth in that market in southeast asia we continue to perform well with 2018 constant currency growth of 18 and 13 for the quarter we continue to anticipate strong results as we focus on our growth strategy which produced improvements of 11 in sales leaders and 25 in customers in japan constant currency revenue decreased 2 for the year which is a trend improvement from prior years and then emea constant currency revenue grew 10 for both the year and the quarter reflecting the continued focus on social sharing throughout the region and improvements in several of our key markets as we look toward 2019 we ll continue to focus on our growth strategy providing the platforms products and programs to empower our sales leaders to attract and retain customers and build stronger sales teams our quarterly and annual results reflect the strength of our focus and execution and the degree of alignment we are creating throughout the organization alignment that we believe will help us continue to grow the business in 2019 and with that i ll turn it over to mark mark lawrence chief financial officer thank you ryan i will now provide some detail regarding our fourth quarter results and give first quarter and full year 2019 guidance additional financial information can be found on our investors section of our website our fourth quarter revenue improved 3 to 683 3 million or 7 to 710 1 million on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year which included a 130 million lumispa introduction our reported revenue was negatively impacted 4 by foreign currency fluctuations for the full year our revenue was 2 68 billion an 18 increase over the prior year marking the second highest revenue year in our history for the full year our core nu skin business grew 14 while our recent acquisitions contributed 4 2018 revenue was impacted less than 1 by foreign currency fluctuations our quarterly reported earnings per share were negative 0 32 or 1 05 when excluding 77 million in primarily non cash charges related to the impairment of information technology infrastructure severance and other related expenses this compares with 0 33 reported earnings per share or 1 20 when excluding the impact of tax reform in q4 2017 please note that the 1 05 includes a 0 04 non cash purchase accounting charge reported earnings per share for 2018 were 2 16 or 3 52 when excluding the impairment and restructuring charges incurred in the fourth quarter this compares to 2 36 or 3 23 when excluding the impact of tax reform in 2017 during the quarter we executed a restructuring program to support our vision of becoming a world leading business platform we took a non cash impairment charge of 48 6 million associated with writing down our technology assets as we transition to a cloud infrastructure additionally we took a 22 1 million charge associated with the changes to our it and other departments within our corporate in americas offices because of our planned investment to transition to the cloud and secure required talent to execute this transition we don t anticipate this restructuring to result in significant cost savings for 2019 gross margin for the quarter was 76 3 compared to 77 7 in the prior year quarter the gross margin of our nu skin business improved 20 basis points to 77 9 selling expense as a percent of revenue was 39 4 compared to 39 8 in the prior year quarter the decrease was largely due to non commissionable revenue associated with our manufacturing entities our nu skin selling expense was 40 9 general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 23 9 compared to 23 in the prior year reported operating margin for the quarter was 2 7 or 14 1 when excluding the restructuring charge compared to 14 9 in the prior year the other income expense line reflects a 4 3 million expense compared to 8 4 million expense in the prior year the increased expense was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar during the quarter we paid 20 2 million in dividends and repurchased 21 3 million of our stock as indicated in a separate release we also increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year to 1 48 annually the tax rate for the quarter was 225 or 35 9 when excluding the restructuring charge compared to 81 5 or 33 1 when excluding the impact of tax reform in 2017 our revenue guidance for the first quarter is 615 million to 635 million reflecting growth of 0 to 3 or 6 to 8 in constant currency with an approximate 5 to 6 currency headwind we project q1 earnings per share of 0 70 to 0 77 and a q1 tax rate of 33 to 36 for 2019 we are projecting revenue in the 2 76 billion to 2 82 billion range or growth of 3 to 5 or 5 to 7 in constant currency this guidance assumes an approximate 2 to 3 currency headwind 2019 earnings per share are projected at 3 80 to 4 05 with a projected tax rate of 33 to 36 we will provide additional details at our upcoming investor day event on february 28th at our corporate headquarters if you would like to attend in person please reach out to our investor relations team with that i ll now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of faiza alwy from deutsche bank your line is now open faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst yes hi good evening so i have a few questions the first one is just on the local currency constant currency growth for fiscal 19 if you could just maybe disaggregate that for us by region china in particular and then maybe the rest of the regions and how we should think about it from a quarterly basis so how the phasing it seems like you re expecting 1q to be better but are there any launch events or anything else that we should be mindful off i ll start with that ritch n wood chief executive officer thanks faiza let me just quickly speak to that appreciate your question we look forward to our analyst investor day where we will lay out more detail by region by growth by quarter and give more detail i think the big question i think on most people s mind is china what do we project for china i think for purposes today we expect high single digit growth in china next year on a constant currency basis and then again we ll lay out the rest of the details at the investor day faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful and then just mark maybe if you could talk a little bit about how you re thinking about gross margins for next year i know this year we had your gross margins declined as you had some sort of made some acquisitions but what is the what are you embedding for next year for 19 mark lawrence chief financial officer yes great question thanks faiza as ritch mentioned we ll breakout of full gross margin walk for you at our investor day but at the highest level we re projecting 19 gross margins roughly in line with 18 as we have a full year impact of our acquired companies so in that 76 to 77 range is where you should model that faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay and then sorry just last one from me is what was the inventory write off for in the quarter mark lawrence chief financial officer so the inventory write off was largely items that were impaired due to our structural changes that we made in our supply chain organization faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay thank you ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you faiza operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of olivia tong with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you i guess in the quarter obviously you announced restructuring program so i d love to get a better understanding of what you re hoping to tackle with that you ve obviously mentioned that there s not an expectation in 2019 of a lot of savings coming out of that it sounds like it s more an efficiency expectation but what expect that obviously with an efficiency program that you would get some savings out of that so a little bit of color behind that and then also what kind of additional capacity you think that now allows you ritch n wood chief executive officer yes thank you olivia good to hear from you and i ll just give a quick update as it relates to our vision and then the other guys can speak specifically to some of the thoughts around the margins and so forth we really believe that in order to a achieve our vision we have to be customer centric we have to be able to support customers in a way we never have before and our old technology just didn t allow us to be flexible and able to move very quickly in terms of making changes and so far so we re really excited about this change which is well under way it s moving along quickly and we ll start to see benefits in 2019 ryan do you want to ryan napierski president yes well and i would simply add to that point in moving to the cloud we will we re really seeking to scale capacity and flexibility that we need in order to service the business and so i mean to your point around efficiencies versus effectiveness this is really a move to create a more effective technology infrastructure and not a cost reduction exercise so that s really what we seek to gain out of it mark lawrence chief financial officer yes and the only thing i would add is the reason why we are not projecting a huge cost savings into next year is it s really a shift from on premise capitalized expense to a more opex cloud expense so that opex that we will incur as we move to the cloud will offset the depreciation that we were taken off the books from taking the capital loss olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful and then just if i could move over to cash flow i m not sure if you have the numbers yet given this quarter fiscal year end but if you could provide just cash flow from operations or free cash flow that would be great and then just in terms of returning cash to shareholders obviously you ve done a couple of acquisitions recently but they re not huge dollars so can you talk about your priorities because this dividend raise more recently has been kind of inching up at a slower pace than the earnings growth and there is still obviously a lot of room on your repurchase authorization as well so just a little bit of color into your priorities that would be great mark lawrence chief financial officer sure so i ll tackle the first one cash from operations in the quarter was about 88 million as far as uses of cash and such we re really focused on our priorities which our first priority use of cash is to grow the business the second one is we ll continue to pay dividend we just raised our dividend for the 18th consecutive year it was a modest increase but we believe we re paying healthy dividends and then third we ll balance the debt repayment and share buyback similar to how we did this year and expect our share buybacks to be roughly in line with what we ve done the last two years ritch n wood chief executive officer i think from an overall standpoint olivia we see opportunities to really invest and grow our business maybe more or so than we ve seen in the past for part of that reason we ve been conservative with both our share buyback as well as our dividend just because we think there s opportunities to really look to expand i think moving to the cloud technology is one area that we think opens up a lot of opportunity for us but we re going to go very committed to it and all in and i think we ll get the results we need so leaving some cash available obviously to be able to do those sort of things and not hamper in any way our ability to grow the business ryan napierski president and the only thing i would add is that our capital spend will go up next year we ve talked about building the manufacturing facility in china and that process will really start in earnest in 2019 olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks and then just lastly on in terms of the product initiatives for 2019 i imagine we ll hear a lot more about that in at the analyst day but if you could just give us a little bit of an overview in terms of the new product pipeline are we more focusing on skin care versus nutrition i guess how much of our focus are you going to have on more approachable price points and then also if you could give a little bit of flavor into some of the new initiatives like the indoor growing thank you ryan napierski president yes olivia we just on a couple of those points around product i think we will as you said will be laying out the full plan at investor day or analyst day coming up but generally speaking what you ll see us focusing on are building the brands that we have much more effectively as i mentioned in previously lumispas franchise continues to do well you ll see us continuing to invest in those brands that are really power house brands for us we will continue to explore lower price point products as you re as you noted there social sharing is critical and require certain price points to move well but we also remain focused on the entire portfolio and ensuring that all of our products are socially proficient that way on the news the nutrition versus the skin care side 2019 is well balanced both but continues to skew heavily on a bit heavier on the personal care side although there are many local initiatives including the one i mentioned in china our tr90 line continues to be very very important to us so those types of nutrition related product initiatives are sprinkled throughout the year throughout many of our markets ritch n wood chief executive officer yes good product pipeline with a different philosophy not the big lto plans that we did say two or three years ago but really an opportunity to build these brands with solid customer focused effort and as it relates to indoor growing we look forward to sharing more of that here in a couple of weeks it s an initiative that we believe is really really important to customers going forward they demand transparency they demand clean pure ingredient and it s really hard to be able to guarantee that in the world we live in today so we re going down a path that we believe is going to be very very motivational to our customers i think they re going to love it and we ve made some good progress to the point where we will actually start to see products later this year and so forth we ll talk about that again in two weeks but exciting progress in that front and believe it fits right into our customer demographic and the vision we have for the company olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks you so much ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tim ramey with pivotal research group your line is now open tim ramey pivotal research group analyst thanks so much ritch i m not sure you expressed it in exactly this way but you certainly have emphasized the idea of ramping up the percentage of revenues coming from new products over time do you have anything specific to say on your progress there in terms of metrics of where we re at where we think we might go ritch n wood chief executive officer that s a great question tim and something that we have watched over time but we re really changing our philosophy to be much more agile with our products and building strong brand so for example lifepak is a product that is probably our number two nutrition supplement that really has not been updated for many years that s not the way we want to focus going forward we want to take those strong products and continue to update them regularly so there s consistent new innovation and technology going into our product you ll see it in our new packaging refreshed that s rolling out at the end of last year and into this year so it will look different than the big new product that we did in the path so that s probably not a good comparison to actually try and say what percentage of our revenue will come from new products but again a different strategy it s going to look fresh it s going to look new and i think the exciting to our customers tim ramey pivotal research group analyst great thanks and then also just i m guessing that moving to the cloud makes you somewhat less capex intensive on the it side do you have a forecast for capex yet for 2019 so if you gave it i missed it i m sorry mark lawrence chief financial officer no we didn t give it but i ll give it to you now it s going to be somewhere in the 80 million to 100 million range depending on our factory build out in china tim ramey pivotal research group analyst okay and it will most of that be china mark lawrence chief financial officer no about somewhere in the 30 million to 50 million range would be the factory in china tim ramey pivotal research group analyst okay and then just one on regions i know you wanted to kind of stick to high level there but the south korea has been a slog and it looks like you ve at least bent the curve there in a slightly positive way is that a market where we think we could or should expect growth in 19 ritch n wood chief executive officer well we re very very encouraged with what we saw toward the end of the year so there are two primary initiatives that we did we restaged a really successful product in china which we call nu skin 180 based system product again to the strategy of how we do new products going forward we were able to get great traction around that product at the same time we brought forward our velocity compensation changes and we really were encouraged with the fourth quarter that look positive where we saw customer growth where we ve seen our customer acquisition increase and so we re encouraged for this year but i d say in our forecasting and in our guidance we ve been quite conservative on what korea looks like this year but we do show growth in that market it s low single digit growth is what we probably anticipate as that business continues to turn around but quite encouraged with the results we saw just in the end of this year tim ramey pivotal research group analyst thanks a lot ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of linda bolton weiser with da davidson your line is now open linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst hi i was just wondering in looking at your year over year change in sales leaders there are many regions that are down but that s been the trend in many of these markets so i guess just the only one that really stood out was the americas pacific sales leaders being down 7 can you just kind of talk about that because i think the trend has been that it s been up and i don t know if that s i don t know yes can you just talk about like why that would have become a decline versus increases in the previous quarters ritch n wood chief executive officer yes let me just speak high level and then ryan can add some detail to it the americas is impacted as mark mentioned or maybe ryan i think mentioned in the call that the hyper inflationary environment in argentina which was our fastest growing latin america market has really impacted and slowed that business down to some extent so that s reflected in some of these numbers the other one is just china where we had a really strong response to our lumispa launch a year ago and some incentives that were in place that drove that sales leader number to jump in the end of the year and then come down in the first quarter which is what we projected what we re encouraged about with the sales leader numbers the way it continue to develop throughout the year steady generally and continue to improve nicely so i feel good about the direction of our sales leader number and the year over year comp is not quite as telling in my perspective because of lumispa launched last year would you add ryan to that ryan napierski president i would only add that really as we focus on our customer on customer acquisition growth the kind of the relationships so we re really excited about the customer acquisition growth the race the relationship between the sales leaders and customers has evolved somewhat so it is hard to compare the quarter the q4 activity and impact of that linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst okay so like if you were to just if you were to look at americas pacific and just say look at the us with the sales leaders have been up or down in just the us ritch n wood chief executive officer i m gonna pull that up real quick i think the sales leaders were down a little bit in the us yes down about 11 customers were down 3 so slightly down and i think part of that also is our change to move to velocity there the with requirements are lower in the new compensation plan so we ve seen some consolidation i would say in the number of sales leaders we have overall generally it s very strong but our us business showed that a little bit more than some of the other markets linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst okay and then you ve shown a pattern kind of in recent years of having a major new launch about every two years is that something we can think about possibly for 2020 ritch n wood chief executive officer i think there will definitely be a major new launch of a product the key product brand that we re doing will probably swing over to the nutrition side given our focus has been little bit more personal care i don t it won t be the same as we ve done with ltos in the past but it will be a very key product that we take and put significant investment innovation and relaunch ryan napierski president yes you re just linda you re going to see as ritch mentioned a couple of times you will really see an enhanced focus on innovation across multiple brands in 2019 and beyond and so i would probably be looking less for the one off or the single product initiative that will drive results and we ll be explaining a lot more about this brand strategy of driving multiple brands through multiple key initiatives which we think will be much more powerful and sustainable over time linda bolton weiser d a davidson co analyst okay thanks that s it for me ritch n wood chief executive officer thanks linda ryan napierski president thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of stephanie wissink with jefferies your line is now open ashley helgans jefferies analyst hi this is ashley helgans on for steph wissink thanks for taking our question regarding the constant currency revenue expectations between 5 to 7 how should we think about cost leverage at the sales level ritch n wood chief executive officer we re really encouraged first of all by that 5 to 7 growth as looking back at what we guided to when we started 2018 and it was similar we felt like we could be confident of 5 to 7 growth rate and so we re starting 2019 with that same growth rate we do believe we ll be able to expand our margins maybe mark from a high level what would you comment on that mark lawrence chief financial officer yes i think what we re modeling in for this year is roughly 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin ashley helgans jefferies analyst okay great thanks that s very helpful ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you ashley operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of doug lane with lane research you may proceed doug lane lane research analyst yes hi thanks i guess we ve talked about the operations and they were certainly pretty impressive 7 organic growth on top of that comparison and the 2 growth in china on a very large comparison so the business continues to perform well in fact the operating income was ahead of where we were looking for but we keep giving it back in these non operating items and so just from a modeling standpoint what exactly where the currencies that impacted the other income this quarter and how should we think about that going into 2019 mark lawrence chief financial officer it s a great question we really are subject to currency in many of our we were in nearly 50 markets and we re subject to currency fluctuations in nearly all of them with most of our profit coming from overseas the big swingers are really the chinese rmb and then we continue to face pressure from argentina being highly inflationary where we have to mark to market all of our assets there intel was being no longer highly inflationary those would be the biggest swingers for us but also southeast asia is becoming an ever important market for us and it s a very large market for us and so we are subject to currency swings in all of those markets as well if you look at our guidance for the year we guided 2 to 3 currency headwind so this is going to be a year particularly in the first half of this year where we re going to be facing an uphill battle from a currency perspective doug lane lane research analyst so when you forecast negative currency number on your top line we can assume there could be a negative impact to other income as well basically would have go together mark lawrence chief financial officer yes they do we ve done a what i think is a fairly good job of trying to mitigate that risk if you remember what happened in q2 and q3 or we have rather large charges as a comparison in the current quarter it was about 0 02 and impact on still a relatively large fx movement in the quarter we ve done our best to try to mitigate our intercompany balances around the world we still have an exposure in china which i think is going to be difficult to manage considering the amount of cash that they need to operate that business doug lane lane research analyst that s make sense so 2 in the quarter marked yet that for the year mark lawrence chief financial officer the impact for the quarter is 5 to 6 the impact for the year is 2 to 3 doug lane lane research analyst no i mean if i m asking the earnings per share impact of the foreign currency translation losses in the other income line mark lawrence chief financial officer for 2018 or next year doug lane lane research analyst for 2018 mark lawrence chief financial officer 2018 we disclosed the 0 13 in q2 and 0 07 in q3 doug lane lane research analyst and did you say what it was in q4 mark lawrence chief financial officer yes right now i d just say it s roughly 0 02 doug lane lane research analyst okay all right and there is going to be so we won t get all that back this year but hopefully will be a number that somewhat smaller than that mark lawrence chief financial officer the goal is that we hopefully mitigated much of that risk doug lane lane research analyst okay all right that s all thanks ritch n wood chief executive officer thanks doug operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of beth kite with citi your line is now open beth kite citibank analyst hi terrific hi everyone i was just thinking about social selling and going back to the idea that in october of 17 we heard at the biennial convention about a lot of new products that were going to be tested in some markets across 18 so now that we have a full year of that can you sort of give us some context around which products were maybe outside successes what you learned from that this past year and how that might inform some of the social selling initiatives that you have for 2019 ryan napierski president yes absolutely beth and you do ask this question quite frequently so we should just work it end of the script we did talk about it s really been a great learning year for us as you mentioned we launched i think something like 14 or 17 product concepts are introduced those at live 2017 and have been really rolling those out one by one many of those many were just concepts to test the market but several of those have been rolled out in various markets at various times and then we re seeing varying results as we learn most notably i d say is powerlips that has become really a good little franchise for us in terms of attracting a new demographic of customers that we historically couldn t attract as effectively so that s been a great one and continues to do well we see great promise in that we ve had dr dana that s gone out into many markets and continues to be rolled out around the world and it seems to be a decent product as well there are others that were really concept driven that have very good favorable i guess interest that we need to continue to work on in order to get margins right and dial in those concepts further so we ll continue to explore and experiment with new product concepts like we did before i think maybe the bigger learning for us is throughout the course of the last year and a half is that every one of our products has the ability to be a socially shareable product and we found that many of our products like lumispa that are maybe higher price points that historically we haven t seen as particularly socially by roll or actually be quite socially by role and so our goal is really to ensure that our entire portfolio has products that are socially shareable and leveraging the learnings from these many of these tests to better the entire portfolio beth kite citibank analyst got it okay great because i m thinking about product like so would raw be one like you only ask that we were seeing in the fourth quarter that sound sort of that test phase if you will ryan napierski president yes exactly i mean raw is very in fact i d argue is one of the best product concepts that we tested in terms of just general consumer response to it we need to continue to work on margins there to ensure that packaging and all of that work well but yes the concept is very good and we just need to make certain we can scale that effectively beth kite citibank analyst great okay perfect thank you very much for that so now we could pivot to access for lumispa are you going to tell us which market are markets that debut in the fourth quarter and then also i think it s sort of the idea of one ageloc more broadly in 19 are there any nuances between the first and second quarter in terms of the roll out of accent to keep in mind ritch n wood chief executive officer yes it will be quick and easy to get the fourth quarter because there are only like three markets that we did it in beth kite citibank analyst okay ritch n wood chief executive officer i think hong kong taiwan and one or two markets in southeast asia it will primarily be a first half 2019 launch with the big difference being that china is april so china will be q2 most of the rest of the markets will start to launch the accent in q1 beth kite citibank analyst okay perfect thank you so much ritch one or two other questions if i may one tr90 back on the second quarter earnings call there was the concept that had the potential for the year to do roughly 200 million in sales can you let us know where tr90 shaped out for full year sales ritch n wood chief executive officer yes it was well over 200 million for the year about 225 million or so mark lawrence chief financial officer 234 million ritch n wood chief executive officer 234 million beth kite citibank analyst to be exact from the cfo great now actually mark quick question on tax rate if you like this what we are looking forward to in 19 is likely a higher tax rate than we ve had at least the last couple of years kind of harkens back to the mid 30s of three and four years ago what s the opportunity there to sort of work the tax rate at least maybe more comfortably into the low 30s is there an opportunity mark lawrence chief financial officer there is an opportunity but i think it ll be a little bit longer term so we did guide 33 to 36 indicating that a our tax rate will be more variable so it will be more fluctuation in the quarter and that will be really driven by where the profit is generated around the world if profits generated in higher tax region for example china or korea the tax rate will be higher in that given quarter we have been and are actively working on adjusting our tax structure to try to bring us down to the lower end of that range or potentially below that range but we re operating against the 30 year tax structure that set up in nearly 50 markets and you need to be very careful as you unravel those things ritch n wood chief executive officer but the bottom line to getting that lower is drive us profit and so we yes we are definitely focused on finding ways to continue to grow our business our profitability and opportunities to increase our profit particularly in the us market beth kite citibank analyst got it okay and one final one if i may on modeling just thinking about g a for the full year are you going to again i assume have your every other year big global convention in the fourth quarter of this year and if so i know g a is kind of moved around it used to be that you could kind of add 10 million roughly to your fourth quarter for the g a in the year that had the event is that sort of still the bright magnitude to think about for incremental spend for the fourth quarter for that event mark lawrence chief financial officer yes that s roughly in line we re obviously in the planning stages of that event now but that s the budget more or less that we re planning for in the 10 million range beth kite citibank analyst okay perfect thank you all very much appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel your line is now open mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst thanks and afternoon everyone ritch n wood chief executive officer hi mark mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst wanted to ask on china so i tuned in late so apologies if this was touched on a bit earlier but i wanted to just try to reconcile the currency neutral sales growth of 2 with the moving parts of the sales leaders and customers and then just try to get a sense of kind of like what was going on there and what drove kind of the variability in there and then just not stronger growth i get that there was a tougher comparison but obviously the customers were up quite a bit and sales leaders were down so if you can just talk about maybe puts and takes and kind of reconcile that with how you get to high single digit growth in 19 that would be helpful ritch n wood chief executive officer yes great thanks mark for that question china continues to be what we see is a really great opportunity and we were happy to be able to grow so of our 130 million of lto in the fourth quarter of 2017 58 million of that was in china so it was a big strong quarter that we re comparing against we ve seen good solid results in both the customers and sales leaders as the year progressed we had a big push right at the end of 2017 and then as we projected and anticipated that number fell down the sales leader number fell down in q1 of 2018 but then was consistent and look good throughout the year where our focus has really been with ryan and his team is really driving our customer base in china so we ve had a number of particularly over the last say three or six months on retention of our customers and that is beginning to show it s really encouraged with the way the customer number increased in the fourth quarter and gives us a good base as we move into next year our success and our ability to grow the business there will be driven by the fact that our customer base has to grow and our sales leaders need to grow so yes i think overall we feel good about the market we feel good about the direction that we ve seen it trend throughout the year and that s what gives us confidence guiding to additional growth here as we enter 2019 mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay got it and then mark just switching to cash flow so roughly 200 million in cash from ops in 2018 how should we think about some of the moving parts there it sounds or seems like working capital was a pretty big headwind does that reverse and if you can give any sort of color on expectations for that number for 19 that d be helpful mark lawrence chief financial officer yes i think that s something that we ll go into a lot of detail around at our analyst day investor day in two weeks i will say that with an lto in q4 of 17 that created a large commissions payable this was in early q1 of 18 so that artificially brought down cash from operations in 18 that should not reflect itself or up be the same in 19 because we didn t have a large lto in the q4 of 18 we ll give you a lot more detail at analyst day mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay all right we ll wait to hear from that i guess i want to go back to the question on china i just try to figure out so the revenue per customer was down a lot more productivity how we want to think about it in the quarter versus it was in q2 and q3 why was that i mean what specifically is going on from a productivity standpoint mix standpoint any view there might be helpful ryan napierski president yes i think really that s more of a function of the denominator growth right to the revenue so if we look at it going back to the point ritch mentioned around some of these retention initiatives we were able to really increase the customer repeat purchase activity which typically by the way the repeat purchases generally are the smaller basket size than the first month order typically so we haven t specifically dialed in on china that way but i m perceiving that that s really what you d be looking as revenue divided by customer mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay so as we go forward the focus will be back on moving the sales leaders not the customers is that what i heard before correctly ryan napierski president no i think maybe better i think better stated would be that while we continue to drive the business our customer acquisition strategy we anticipate sales leaders will correlate to customers i think the issue in q4 was really the year over year comp from the 2017 q4 lumispa introduction there that generated a significant amount of revenue in that quarter and also increased our sales leader based on the amount of volume that went in the quarter so resetting that to q1 and then growing from q1 we ll anticipate that those two are correlated but again the customer activity that we re really looking at and frankly it s quite interesting for us as well over the last call it four five months of 2018 where some of these new retention initiatives in china that are proving out or at least indicating a good benefit to our customer numbers generally ritch n wood chief executive officer i think mark it s important to note that we focus really on both but we have made some efforts specifically in the recent months in china particularly to drive and that s what s shifting that denominator a little bit we ll see how it comes into this year but if we re going to grow this year they both have to grow we have to have sales leader growth and we have to have customer growth mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst okay thank you ritch n wood chief executive officer thank you mark okay i think that s the end of the questions we sure appreciate all the questions and appreciate your attention on this call and look forward to a great year and look forward to seeing any of you who will be able to make it at our investor day here in two weeks thank you

toronto sherritt international corporation sherritt or the corporation tsx s a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores today reported its financial results for the three and 12 month periods ended december 31 2018 all amounts are in canadian currency unless otherwise noted ceo commentary sherritt ended 2018 with lower debt and more cash than we started the year with as a result of several initiatives designed to reduce expenses buy back 130 million of outstanding debentures and improve production reliability at our operations said david pathe president and ceo of sherritt international although concerns of international trade disputes and the impacts of tariffs have resulted in recent commodity price volatility we expect to sustain our momentum through 2019 and beyond by capitalizing on the strong market fundamentals and outlook for class 1 nickel completing drilling on block 10 and identifying opportunities where we can bring innovations developed by our technologies group to market added mr pathe highlights for q4 and fy2018 sherritt s share of finished nickel production at the moa joint venture moa jv in q4 2018 was 4 294 tonnes up 4 from last year while finished cobalt was 428 tonnes down 8 from q4 2017 production for q4 2018 was impacted by the disruption in the supply of hydrogen sulphide a key reagent used in the production of finished nickel and cobalt at the refinery in fort saskatchewan as previously disclosed q4 2018 adjusted ebitda 1 was 17 7 million down from 49 6 million in q4 2017 the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower contributions from the oil and gas business lower cobalt sales and higher input costs including higher sulphur and energy prices at the moa jv was 17 7 million down from 49 6 million in q4 2017 the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower contributions from the oil and gas business lower cobalt sales and higher input costs including higher sulphur and energy prices at the moa jv received 6 7 million in distributions from the moa jv in q4 2018 for a total of 11 9 million in distributions for fy2018 q4 2018 marks the second consecutive quarter that the moa jv has made distributions indicative of improved nickel prices over the past several quarters net direct cash cost ndcc 1 at the moa jv for fy2018 was us 2 24 per pound of finished nickel sold in line with the us 1 90 2 40 per pound guidance that sherritt provided for the year ndcc for 2018 ranked the moa jv within the lowest cost quartile relative to other producers and ranked it as the lowest cost nickel hpal operation according to annualized information tracked by wood mackenzie at the moa jv for fy2018 was us 2 24 per pound of finished nickel sold in line with the us 1 90 2 40 per pound guidance that sherritt provided for the year ndcc for 2018 ranked the moa jv within the lowest cost quartile relative to other producers and ranked it as the lowest cost nickel hpal operation according to annualized information tracked by wood mackenzie cash from continuing operations in fy2018 was 7 4 million compared to cash flow used of 9 6 million in fy2017 the improvement was driven largely by the receipt of distributions from the moa jv lower interest payments on debentures and increased fertilizer customer prepayments sherritt ended the year with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 207 0 million up from 203 0 million at the end of 2017 the increase was due to a combination of factors including the receipt of distributions working capital and advance repayments from the moa jv totaling 47 7 million reduced interest payments of 6 3 million and reduced administrative expenses of 6 1 million excluding the reduction of share based compensation the lower administrative expenses were due to various cost savings initiatives including lower consulting fees reduced employee costs and the relocation of the toronto corporate office developments subsequent to year end reached an agreement in principle subject to final approvals with cuban partner on a payment plan to reduce overdue receivables based on a decision to prudently manage drilling and exploration costs drilling on block 10 has been suspended to enable the completion of additional analysis of the geological conditions between the upper and lower target reservoir to date third party industry experts have completed detailed lab analysis of rock cuttings collected during previous operations on block 10 results of the lab analysis which indicated that the rock formation between the upper and lower target reservoirs has unique characteristics are currently being used with the assistance of other third party experts to adjust drilling parameters including modifying the drilling fluid and making use of casing while drilling technology that addresses the challenges of well bore degradation and fractured zones experienced to date drilling on block 10 will resume at the end of march with the new drilling parameters and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019 the adoption of new drilling parameters will not result in any increases to planned capital spending previously disclosed for the oil and gas business any incremental capital spend at the oil and gas business in 2019 will be predicated on successful drill results on block 10 and collections on receivables sherritt intends to explore partnerships for further investment in block 10 following completion of the current drilling 1 for additional information see the

exchange gains and losses in both fy2018 and fy2017 metal markets nickel nickel prices softened in q4 2018 slowing the momentum established over the past year when nickel reached a high of us 7 26 lb the average reference price in q4 2018 was us 5 20 lb down from us 6 01 lb in the preceding quarter the downward price pressure was driven by a number of developments the most notable being ongoing concerns that the international trade dispute between the u s and china would weaken global demand for nickel initial market reaction to news of a planned facility in indonesia that is expected to produce 50 000 tonnes per year of battery grade material also contributed to softening nickel prices market reaction to the construction timelines and funding requirements to build the high pressure acid leach facility has since become skeptical increased availability of nickel pig iron supply was another contributing factor in weakening nickel prices the softening of prices belied the strong underlying nickel fundamentals combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q4 2018 totaled 219 804 tonnes down 8 from the combined total of 240 066 tonnes at the end of q3 2018 the class 1 nickel inventory decline in 2018 was even more dramatic at 55 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years since the start of q1 2019 nickel prices have risen approximately 12 demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2018 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices experienced continued softness in q4 2018 consistent with developments earlier in the year the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers the average reference price for q4 2018 was us 32 23 lb down from us 35 21 lb in the preceding quarter low physical demand and current cobalt oversupply is likely to keep market conditions relatively volatile in the near term the recent softening of prices is expected to be temporary due to the growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s largest source of cobalt supply high cobalt prices are not expected to cause supply chain disruptions or delay the growth of the electric vehicle market given that cobalt prices represent a relatively small percentage of the overall battery pack costs as a result the potential for removing cobalt from electric vehicle battery production in the near term is relatively low especially since cobalt s unique properties give batteries energy stability while battery manufacturers continue to explore alternatives to existing electric vehicle battery chemistry particularly to increase the battery s energy density the likely beneficiary of any changes is expected to be class i nickel review of operations moa joint venture

tonnes of finished nickel in q4 2018 up 4 from 4 134 tonnes produced in q4 2017 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment completed in q3 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year the increase in nickel production in q4 2018 was offset however by the negative impact of a disruption in the supply of hydrogen sulphide a key reagent used by the refinery in fort saskatchewan to produce finished nickel the supply disruption resulted in a temporary reduction in production finished nickel production for fy2018 was 15 354 tonnes down 3 from fy2017 the decline was largely due to the negative effects that the highest level of rainfall in more than 20 years had on the production of mixed sulphides at moa and transportation delays by the railway service provider to the refinery in fort saskatchewan in q1 year over year production decline was also attributable to the disruption of hydrogen sulphide supply in q4 previously referenced the moa jv has taken measures over the past year to mitigate the production challenges experienced in 2018 by building its inventory of mixed sulphides and ore stockpiles deploying new mining equipment and developing contingency plans for alternative supply deliveries finished cobalt production for q4 2018 was 428 tonnes down 8 from last year total finished cobalt for 2018 was 1 617 tonnes down 10 from 2017 in addition to factors already cited cobalt production was also negatively impacted by a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa and in third party feed procured by the refinery in fort saskatchewan revenue for q4 2018 totaled 120 0 million down 2 from last year the decline was largely due to lower cobalt sales volume of 18 from q4 2017 which offset the impact of higher nickel sales volume revenue for fy2018 was 498 1 million up 19 from 417 0 million generated in fy2017 the increase was driven by higher average realized prices for nickel 26 cobalt 40 and fertilizer 7 which offset lower sales volumes mining processing and refining mpr costs for q4 2018 were us 5 34 lb up 9 from us 4 89 lb for q4 2017 mpr costs for fy2018 increased 12 over fy2017 to us 5 37 lb the increases in both periods were primarily due to higher input costs largely as a result of increased sulphur and energy prices the moa jv was required to buy sulphuric acid in q3 during the first bi annual maintenance shutdown of the new acid plant adding costs to the full year period ndcc in q4 2018 was us 2 94 lb compared to us 1 80 lb for the same period last year the increase was due to the impact of higher sulphur and energy costs and a lower cobalt credit as a result of reduced sales volume when compared to the same period of last year ndcc for fy2018 was us 2 24 lb compared to us 2 35 lb in fy2017 as higher cobalt credits in the first months in 2018 more than offset higher sulphur fuel oil and third party feed prices ndcc for fy2018 ranked the moa jv within the lowest cost quartile relative to other nickel producers and ranked it as the lowest cost nickel hpal operation according to annualized information tracked by wood mackenzie the moa jv generated operating cash flow of 50 2 million in q4 2018 up 54 from 32 5 million in the same period of 2017 operating cash flow for fy2018 was 90 7 million in fy2018 up 56 compared to fy2017 the increase was largely due to the year over year improvement in realized prices for nickel and cobalt that offset higher input commodity prices sustaining capital spending in q4 2018 was 10 5 million up from 7 7 million in q4 2017 the increase was due to planned spending including the construction of the new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at moa which was commissioned in january 2019 total capital spend for fy2018 was 37 0 million up 77 consistent with planned higher spending and included the purchase of new mining equipment aimed at reducing ore haulage distance

production at ambatovy in the second half of 2018 was 19 higher than the first half of the year while finished cobalt production was up 35 over the comparable period the production increases were the result of efforts aimed at improving production and increasing reliability of acid production and pal circuits specific initiatives included the replacement of two acid plant economizers replacement of equipment damaged by cyclone ava and efforts to improve autoclave reliability finished nickel production in q4 2018 was 1 253 tonnes and finished cobalt production was 106 tonnes up 13 and 21 respectively from q4 2017 ndcc in q4 2018 was us 3 66 lb 12 higher than in q4 2017 ndcc for fy2018 was us 3 91 lb up 2 from fy2017 the increase for both periods was attributable to lower cobalt sales volume and higher input costs asset write downs of 15 7 million based on sherritt s ownership interest were recorded in q4 2018 following a review of fixed assets and a long term ore stockpile re valuation capital spend at ambatovy based on sherritt s ownership interest was 5 1 million in q4 2018 and 15 3 million for fy2018 capital spend throughout the course of the year was earmarked towards initiatives aimed at improving production increasing asset plant reliability and replacing equipment damaged by cyclone ava sherritt s escrow account to cover funding requirements of the ambatovy jv was depleted following a cash call in october 2018 the escrow account was established as a requirement of the ambatovy restructuring completed in december 2017 when sherritt s ownership interest was reduced to 12 in exchange for the elimination of 1 4 billion of debt any future cash funding requirements will be dependent on ambatovy s production as well as prevailing commodity prices among other items if additional cash funding is required sherritt does not anticipate providing any funding based on ambatovy s current debt structure on february 13 2019 sherritt filed on sedar an updated national instrument 43 101 compliant technical report on ambatovy the new report includes mineral resource and reserve estimates that are based on an updated block model the new estimates which have a lower tonnage and higher overall grade than estimates provided in the 2014 ambatovy technical report largely offset each other the economics of the updated technical report are based on a 10 year average weighted price of us 6 82 per pound of nickel and us 25 50 per pound of cobalt the economics of the 2014 technical report were based on us 7 37 per pound for nickel and us 12 12 per pound for

gross working interest oil production in cuba in q4 2018 was 4 443 barrels of oil per day bopd compared to 10 378 bopd for the comparable period of 2017 gross working interest oil production in cuba for fy2018 was 4 839 barrels per day down 64 from 13 479 barrels per day for fy2017 the declines for the quarter and full year periods of 2018 were primarily due to the expiration of the varadero west production sharing contract psc in november 2017 natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q4 2018 was 8 5 million down 69 compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the expiration of the varadero west psc and decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc the decline in sales volumes was partially offset by higher realized oil prices and by a weaker canadian dollar relative to the u s currency revenue for fy2018 was 44 9 million down 65 from last year unit operating costs in cuba in q4 2018 were 25 16 per barrel up 106 from q4 2017 driven largely by reduced production costs were also negatively impacted by a stronger

capital spending for fy2018 was 26 4 million up 36 from last year capital spending for both q4 and fy2018 increased from last year largely due to block 10 drilling activities based on a decision to prudently manage drilling and exploration costs drilling on block 10 has been suspended to enable the completion of additional analysis of the geological conditions between the upper and lower target

toronto business wire sherritt international corporation sherritt or the corporation tsx s a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores today reported its financial results for the three and 12 month periods ended december 31 2018 all amounts are in canadian currency unless otherwise noted ceo commentary sherritt ended 2018 with lower debt and more cash than we started the year with as a result of several initiatives designed to reduce expenses buy back 130 million of outstanding debentures and improve production reliability at our operations said david pathe president and ceo of sherritt international although concerns of international trade disputes and the impacts of tariffs have resulted in recent commodity price volatility we expect to sustain our momentum through 2019 and beyond by capitalizing on the strong market fundamentals and outlook for class 1 nickel completing drilling on block 10 and identifying opportunities where we can bring innovations developed by our technologies group to market added mr pathe highlights for q4 and fy2018 sherritt s share of finished nickel production at the moa joint venture moa jv in q4 2018 was 4 294 tonnes up 4 from last year while finished cobalt was 428 tonnes down 8 from q4 2017 production for q4 2018 was impacted by the disruption in the supply of hydrogen sulphide a key reagent used in the production of finished nickel and cobalt at the refinery in fort saskatchewan as previously disclosed q4 2018 adjusted ebitda 1 was 17 7 million down from 49 6 million in q4 2017 the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower contributions from the oil and gas business lower cobalt sales and higher input costs including higher sulphur and energy prices at the moa jv was 17 7 million down from 49 6 million in q4 2017 the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower contributions from the oil and gas business lower cobalt sales and higher input costs including higher sulphur and energy prices at the moa jv received 6 7 million in distributions from the moa jv in q4 2018 for a total of 11 9 million in distributions for fy2018 q4 2018 marks the second consecutive quarter that the moa jv has made distributions indicative of improved nickel prices over the past several quarters net direct cash cost ndcc 1 at the moa jv for fy2018 was us 2 24 per pound of finished nickel sold in line with the us 1 90 2 40 per pound guidance that sherritt provided for the year ndcc for 2018 ranked the moa jv within the lowest cost quartile relative to other producers and ranked it as the lowest cost nickel hpal operation according to annualized information tracked by wood mackenzie at the moa jv for fy2018 was us 2 24 per pound of finished nickel sold in line with the us 1 90 2 40 per pound guidance that sherritt provided for the year ndcc for 2018 ranked the moa jv within the lowest cost quartile relative to other producers and ranked it as the lowest cost nickel hpal operation according to annualized information tracked by wood mackenzie cash from continuing operations in fy2018 was 7 4 million compared to cash flow used of 9 6 million in fy2017 the improvement was driven largely by the receipt of distributions from the moa jv lower interest payments on debentures and increased fertilizer customer prepayments sherritt ended the year with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 207 0 million up from 203 0 million at the end of 2017 the increase was due to a combination of factors including the receipt of distributions working capital and advance repayments from the moa jv totaling 47 7 million reduced interest payments of 6 3 million and reduced administrative expenses of 6 1 million excluding the reduction of share based compensation the lower administrative expenses were due to various cost savings initiatives including lower consulting fees reduced employee costs and the relocation of the toronto corporate office developments subsequent to year end reached an agreement in principle subject to final approvals with cuban partner on a payment plan to reduce overdue receivables based on a decision

exchange gains and losses in both fy2018 and fy2017 metal markets nickel nickel prices softened in q4 2018 slowing the momentum established over the past year when nickel reached a high of us 7 26 lb the average reference price in q4 2018 was us 5 20 lb down from us 6 01 lb in the preceding quarter the downward price pressure was driven by a number of developments the most notable being ongoing concerns that the international trade dispute between the u s and china would weaken global demand for nickel initial market reaction to news of a planned facility in indonesia that is expected to produce 50 000 tonnes per year of battery grade material also contributed to softening nickel prices market reaction to the construction timelines and funding requirements to build the high pressure acid leach facility has since become skeptical increased availability of nickel pig iron supply was another contributing factor in weakening nickel prices the softening of prices belied the strong underlying nickel fundamentals combined nickel inventories on the london metals exchange and the shanghai futures exchange at the end of q4 2018 totaled 219 804 tonnes down 8 from the combined total of 240 066 tonnes at the end of q3 2018 the class 1 nickel inventory decline in 2018 was even more dramatic at 55 as demand continues to exceed available supply the nickel market is anticipated to be in a structural deficit in the coming years since the start of q1 2019 nickel prices have risen approximately 12 demand for nickel will continue to be driven by the stainless steel sector according to market research by cru stainless steel demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 4 through 2022 with production emanating largely from china and indonesia demand for nickel particularly class 1 nickel from non stainless steel sectors is also expected to accelerate given the growth of the electric vehicle battery market class i nickel along with cobalt are key metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries beyond 2018 a shortage of class 1 nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new class 1 nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices experienced continued softness in q4 2018 consistent with developments earlier in the year the price decline was driven by increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo as well as by the destocking of inventory by chinese consumers the average reference price for q4 2018 was us 32 23 lb down from us 35 21 lb in the preceding quarter low physical demand and current cobalt oversupply is likely to keep market conditions relatively volatile in the near term the recent softening of prices is expected to be temporary due to the growing demand from the electric vehicle battery market and persistent supply risk concerns linked to the democratic republic of congo which is currently the world s largest source of cobalt supply high cobalt prices are not expected to cause supply chain disruptions or delay the growth of the electric vehicle market given that cobalt prices represent a relatively small percentage of the overall battery pack costs as a result the potential for removing cobalt from electric vehicle battery production in the near term is relatively low especially since cobalt s unique properties give batteries energy stability while battery manufacturers continue to explore alternatives to existing electric vehicle battery chemistry particularly to increase the battery s energy density the likely beneficiary of any changes is expected to be class i nickel review of operations moa joint venture

tonnes of finished nickel in q4 2018 up 4 from 4 134 tonnes produced in q4 2017 growth was largely driven by the deployment of new mining equipment completed in q3 2018 that resulted in improved ore access and reduced equipment downtime compared to the same period of last year the increase in nickel production in q4 2018 was offset however by the negative impact of a disruption in the supply of hydrogen sulphide a key reagent used by the refinery in fort saskatchewan to produce finished nickel the supply disruption resulted in a temporary reduction in production finished nickel production for fy2018 was 15 354 tonnes down 3 from fy2017 the decline was largely due to the negative effects that the highest level of rainfall in more than 20 years had on the production of mixed sulphides at moa and transportation delays by the railway service provider to the refinery in fort saskatchewan in q1 year over year production decline was also attributable to the disruption of hydrogen sulphide supply in q4 previously referenced the moa jv has taken measures over the past year to mitigate the production challenges experienced in 2018 by building its inventory of mixed sulphides and ore stockpiles deploying new mining equipment and developing contingency plans for alternative supply deliveries finished cobalt production for q4 2018 was 428 tonnes down 8 from last year total finished cobalt for 2018 was 1 617 tonnes down 10 from 2017 in addition to factors already cited cobalt production was also negatively impacted by a higher nickel to cobalt ratio in mixed sulphides produced at moa and in third party feed procured by the refinery in fort saskatchewan revenue for q4 2018 totaled 120 0 million down 2 from last year the decline was largely due to lower cobalt sales volume of 18 from q4 2017 which offset the impact of higher nickel sales volume revenue for fy2018 was 498 1 million up 19 from 417 0 million generated in fy2017 the increase was driven by higher average realized prices for nickel 26 cobalt 40 and fertilizer 7 which offset lower sales volumes mining processing and refining mpr costs for q4 2018 were us 5 34 lb up 9 from us 4 89 lb for q4 2017 mpr costs for fy2018 increased 12 over fy2017 to us 5 37 lb the increases in both periods were primarily due to higher input costs largely as a result of increased sulphur and energy prices the moa jv was required to buy sulphuric acid in q3 during the first bi annual maintenance shutdown of the new acid plant adding costs to the full year period ndcc in q4 2018 was us 2 94 lb compared to us 1 80 lb for the same period last year the increase was due to the impact of higher sulphur and energy costs and a lower cobalt credit as a result of reduced sales volume when compared to the same period of last year ndcc for fy2018 was us 2 24 lb compared to us 2 35 lb in fy2017 as higher cobalt credits in the first months in 2018 more than offset higher sulphur fuel oil and third party feed prices ndcc for fy2018 ranked the moa jv within the lowest cost quartile relative to other nickel producers and ranked it as the lowest cost nickel hpal operation according to annualized information tracked by wood mackenzie the moa jv generated operating cash flow of 50 2 million in q4 2018 up 54 from 32 5 million in the same period of 2017 operating cash flow for fy2018 was 90 7 million in fy2018 up 56 compared to fy2017 the increase was largely due to the year over year improvement in realized prices for nickel and cobalt that offset higher input commodity prices sustaining capital spending in q4 2018 was 10 5 million up from 7 7 million in q4 2017 the increase was due to planned spending including the construction of the new slurry preparation plant dump pocket at moa which was commissioned in january 2019 total capital spend for fy2018 was 37 0 million up 77 consistent with planned higher spending and included the purchase of new mining equipment aimed at reducing ore haulage distance

production at ambatovy in the second half of 2018 was 19 higher than the first half of the year while finished cobalt production was up 35 over the comparable period the production increases were the result of efforts aimed at improving production and increasing reliability of acid production and pal circuits specific initiatives included the replacement of two acid plant economizers replacement of equipment damaged by cyclone ava and efforts to improve autoclave reliability finished nickel production in q4 2018 was 1 253 tonnes and finished cobalt production was 106 tonnes up 13 and 21

volume and higher input costs asset write downs of 15 7 million based on sherritt s ownership interest were recorded in q4 2018 following a review of fixed assets and a long term ore stockpile re valuation capital spend at ambatovy based on sherritt s ownership interest was 5 1 million in q4 2018 and 15 3 million for fy2018 capital spend throughout the course of the year was earmarked towards initiatives aimed at improving production increasing asset plant reliability and replacing equipment damaged by cyclone ava sherritt s escrow account to cover funding requirements of the ambatovy jv was depleted following a cash call in october 2018 the escrow account was established as a requirement of the ambatovy restructuring completed in december 2017 when sherritt s ownership interest was reduced to 12 in exchange for the elimination of 1 4 billion of debt any future cash funding requirements will be dependent on ambatovy s production as well as prevailing commodity prices among other items if additional cash funding is required sherritt does not anticipate providing any funding based on ambatovy s current debt structure on february 13 2019 sherritt filed on sedar an updated national instrument 43 101 compliant technical report on ambatovy the new report includes mineral resource and reserve estimates that are based on an updated block model the new estimates which have a lower tonnage and higher overall grade than estimates provided in the 2014 ambatovy technical report largely offset each other the economics of the updated technical report are based on a 10 year

for fy2018 was 4 839 barrels per day down 64 from 13 479 barrels per day for fy2017 the declines for the quarter and full year periods of 2018 were primarily due to the expiration of the varadero west production sharing contract psc in november 2017 natural reservoir declines and the absence of new development drilling revenue in q4 2018 was 8 5 million down 69 compared to last year the decline was attributable to lower total net working interest production due to the impact of the expiration of the varadero west psc and decrease in profit oil percentage to 6 from 45 with the renewal of the puerto escondido yumuri psc the decline in sales volumes was partially offset by higher realized oil prices and by a weaker canadian dollar relative to the u s currency revenue for fy2018 was 44 9

mthuli ncube and mangudya in bitter fight over new zim dollar ed intervenes spread the love president emmerson mnangagwa has been forced to intervene in a growing turf war between reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya and his boss finance minister mthuli ncube on the path zimbabwe will take to deal with a deepening currency crisis well placed sources say president mnangagwa met mangudya in a crucial meeting last night that would assist in shaping and finalising the much awaited monetary policy statement mps the mps was expected to have been delivered either in the last week of january or first week of february however disagreements over proposed currency reforms has seen the mps stall to a point that requires executive intervention several options to deal with the currency crisis include redollarisation reintroduction of the local currency rand adoption liberalisation of the rtgs and bond note as well as ringfencing deposits to mop up excess liquidity to lower the premium rates on the us dollar it is believed that while mangudya and his team tabled local currency re introduction as the most viable option under the current circumstances ncube is only prepared to go as far as liberalising the exchanging rate an option preferred by the bretton woods institutions according to ncube a local currency can only be introduced within 12 18 months an international monetary fund technical team which was in the country this week is said to have suggested floating the exchange rate but also warned of the implications this could have on the socio and political environment this follows a similar push by the african development bank the imf team is also said to have forced some revisions on the draft mps sources said mangudya was concerned that devaluation would result in the collapse of bank balance sheets as most banks were borrowing offshore for on lending in rtgs he is also opposed to the move on grounds this will destabilise the economy by putting wage pressure on companies cause inflation and driving the cost of goods up government was however forced to deny the re introduction of the local currency this week based on comments on twitter by former finance minister tendai biti that the reintroduction was due this week although it would not be backed by any fundamentals the rand option is also being thrown around considering that this has been a consistent message from industry which has south africa as its trading partner but government is not too keen on that position contacted for comment mangudya said he was in a meeting later on he was not picking up calls and a message sent had not been responded to by the time of going to press ncube could not be reached for comment but early this week he told journalists that the mps would be presented soon without revealing specific dates traditionally the mps is presented during the first week of february asked when the monetary policy statement would be presented he said let s just say around this time presidential spokesperson george charamba declined to comment saying any comment on monetary issues could destabilise the market the bond note was introduced in 2016 as an export incentive facility and guaranteed by the african export import bank rbz said it was at par to the dollar despite insistence by several sectors that the parity would not work warning that the surrogate currency would quickly lose value against the greenback analysts expectations are not on devaluation nor the introduction of a local currency but rather that the rbz mops up excess liquidity through a long dated bond to strengthen the rtgs rate which is already the pseudo local currency while also introducing a foreign currency auction system in his last monetary policy statement mangudya split bank accounts into nostro foreign currency accounts fcas and rtgs real time gross settlement fcas in what analysts say was an admission that the bond dollar parity could not be sustained the currency crisis has given rise to price distortions particularly on consumer goods prices of some products in rtgs terms are cheaper if one converts using the parallel market rate than what is obtaining in the region while on the other hand prices are beyond reach for the ordinary consumer whose salary has not changed and moreso for the tourists whose transactions on international cards are rated at 1 1 on the us dollar the president s intervention whose details were sketchy at the time of going to print also comes as foreign diplomats accredited to harare are piling on pressure for zimbabwe to come up with an acceptable currency reform policy cognisant of the fact that some of their nationals have technical fees dividends and investment income which are still stuck in the country business times is reliably informed that the foreign diplomats due to meet mnangagwa today at state house told harare to shelve the introduction of a local currency until the right fundamentals are in place information at hand suggests government has been in deliberations with diplomats whose countries are key trading partners with zimbabwe a top diplomat who requested not to be named said he met mangudya recently to discuss a number of issues including the monetary policy statement right now we have dividends stuck in zimbabwe and nothing is moving if you have an environment that makes one investor make a loss then no one else will come and those that are here will close why would investors come when you change policies and start selling equipment of businesses that you licence to invest the diplomat said while the monetary policy statement was crucial government needs to start making tough choices and to create a good environment for business government needs to start talking to business and foreign investors they must listen and make changes that ensure investors make money because they come here for money and if they can t make money then why do they stay the diplomat also added that government and the generality of zimbabweans should stop waiting for foreign bailouts to end the economic crisis this comes as ncube is on the hunt for credit lines he is expected to visit china to discuss bailout options after his visit to the united states next month the solution lies in foreign direct investment and domestic investment not bailouts when you grow investments then you have jobs and a bigger tax base which needs to be preserved and allocated towards reinvestment not recurrent expenditure he said businesstimes share this

information about the factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the sec which are available on our website also you will find reconciliations between gaap and non gaap measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website now let me introduce tony will our president and ceo anthony will president and chief executive officer thanks martin and good morning everyone last night we posted our financial results for 2018 in which we generated adjusted ebitda of 1 4 billion a 45 increase over 2017 adjusted ebitda of 969 million these results reflect the backdrop of tighter global nitrogen supply demand and generally lower north american natural gas prices but it was the hard work and outstanding execution by the cf team that allowed us to capitalize on the market conditions and even though it was the efforts of the entire cf team that delivered these great results i want to highlight chris and bert s organizations in particular let me call your attention to slide seven of our materials this data taken from an analysis conducted by cru indicates our superior operating performance we ve talked about being great operators in the past but this may be the first time we ve quantified the impact for you we ve been able to achieve a 10 greater utilization in our ammonia plant production than our north american competitors based on the size of our network that translates into roughly 800 000 tons of incremental ammonia per year that we produce versus what our competitors would be able to do with a comparably sized asset base or said another way we basically have a full additional world scale ammonia plant worth of production every year based on our operational capabilities given that a world scale ammonia plant in north america would cost over 1 billion our operational expertise is a significant competitive advantage on the supply side on the supply chain and marketing side we realized higher selling prices across all products year over year we also achieved lower cost of goods sold for the year this execution across all parts of our business enabled us to generate an increase in adjusted ebitda of 45 versus 2017 we operated well and most importantly we did so safely we ended the year with a recordable incident rate of 0 6 incidents per 200 000 hours worked and we accomplished that despite a very heavy turnaround and maintenance schedule i am really proud of the cf team for a truly fantastic year looking ahead we re excited about 2019 as bert will explain in a moment we see a continuation of the favorable market conditions from last year based on january and february actual gas costs along with the forward strip 2019 gas could be lower than 2018 by almost 50 ph million additionally year to date index pricing at the us gulf for major products as reported in the publications is also running ahead of last year and we anticipate a substantial increase in nitrogen demand in north america given our expectations for increases in both corn and wheat acres compared to last year all of that suggests a strong first half of 2019 weather will have a big say as to if that materializes in the first quarter or the second quarter but either way the first half in total should be strong the second half of the year is always a reset and therefore somewhat uncertain as we sit here in february but we continue to be bullish about the long term trends that extend out to 2022 and beyond new global nitrogen capacity is growing more slowly than demand further tightening supply and demand and the forward curve for north american natural gas looks really attractive compared to the rest of the world so our story is more than just about a great opportunity in the first half of 2019 we are very well positioned for the next four to five years in 2018 our business generated 1 5 billion in cash we deployed that cash consistent with our long standing capital allocation philosophy we invested in sustaining and improving our existing assets we grew by acquiring the previously outstanding units of terra nitrogen lp we paid our regular dividend and we returned our excess cash to shareholders by announcing and then completing a 500 million share repurchase program as shown on slide nine of our materials the share repurchases by themselves should drive a roughly 5 accretion in 2019 over 2018 we closed the year with almost 700 million in cash on the balance sheet and given our positive outlook for the next four to five years our board has authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program that runs through 2021 in addition we again reiterate our commitment to retire the 500 million in debt on or before its maturity in may of 2020 with that let me turn it over to bert who ll cover our market outlook and then dennis will discuss our financials before i return for some closing thoughts bert bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain thanks tony the cf team performed well throughout 2018 with total sales of 19 3 million product tons this included a record volume of urea and near record volume for uan ammonia sales while benefiting from higher prices were notably lower in 2018 compared to 2017 this was due both to a higher number of plant turnarounds in 2017 and the fall ammonia season negatively affected by poor weather global prices reached 2018 highs in october since then they have been under pressure first due to moderating energy prices in asia and europe and then due to seasonally low demand in the northern hemisphere we believe that as demand begins to materialize industry fundamentals will support global nitrogen prices in 2019 as a result we see substantial opportunities to build on our 2018 performance net global urea production capacity additions are projected to be modest for the year at approximately 3 5 million metric tons additionally we believe global nitrogen demand will be solid in 2019 most notably we expect strong nitrogen demand in north america during the first half of the year the new crop soybean to corn futures ratio favors a substantial increase in corn plantings in the united states which are projected to rise by 4 million acres to 93 million acres in 2019 we also expect a 1 million acre increase in wheat plantings these acreage shifts should drive incremental nitrogen demand in north america additionally the poor fall ammonia season supports further incremental demand areas that did not apply ammonia in the fall will likely need to make up the resulting nitrogen deficit in the first half of the year with applications of ammonia or upgraded products in the spring with the demand outlook in north america we anticipate barge rail and truck logistic assets will be in high demand and priced at a premium through the second quarter as we look ahead we expect sales volumes to increase compared to 2018 in any given year cf sells around 19 5 million product tons which can be higher or lower based on turnarounds and maintenance inventory levels entering the year and product mix we also expect to continue to benefit from our access to low cost north american natural gas we weathered spikes in the fourth quarter well and the forward curve looks favorable we continue to benefit substantially from basis differentials particularly in oklahoma and alberta and are actively managing our natural gas requirements purchasing forward to lock in basis differentials to remove near term price spike risk each of these factors make us optimistic about 2019 we re well positioned for this environment we have demonstrated our ability to effectively leverage the flexibility of the cf system to navigate market conditions and we re confident in our ability to maximize our overall margin through the year and into the future with that i ll turn the call over to dennis dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks bert the company reported net earnings of 49 million or 0 21 per diluted share and ebitda of 349 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 after taking into account the items detailed in our press release our adjusted ebitda was 341 million as the global nitrogen recovery has taken hold our cash generation has increased in turn this has allowed us to deploy excess cash in line with our long standing capital allocation philosophy as you can see on slide six net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1 5 billion in 2018 we used 422 million for capital expenditures on sustaining and improvement projects we also invested in growth by purchasing all of the publicly traded common units of terra nitrogen in april it also enabled us to return 780 million to shareholders in 2018 which included 280 million in dividend payments and 500 million in share repurchases the repurchase program reduced our share count by approximately 11 million shares as you can see on slide nine taken together these have increased shareholder participation in the underlying assets of the business by approximately 5 or 2 tons of nitrogen per 1 000 shares compared to the end of 2017 as we look ahead we believe will be able to build on this track record we ended 2018 with ample liquidity our cash and cash equivalents were about 682 million and our 750 million revolving credit facility was undrawn we expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be 400 million to 450 million and as tony explained we also expect substantial cash generation in the years ahead as a result the board approved a new 1 billion share repurchase authorization through the end of 2021 we also remain committed to repaying 500 million in debt on or before its maturity date in may of 2020 with that tony will provide some closing remarks anthony will president and chief executive officer thanks dennis before we open the call to questions i want to again thank all of cf employees for their outstanding work in 2018 their commitment and dedication drive everything we achieve as a company we re proud of what we accomplished in 2018 and we re looking forward to the opportunities we see ahead in 2019 and beyond we are well positioned to leverage our considerable strengths and take advantage of the favorable industry fundamentals we see for the foreseeable future we expect this to drive our substantial cash generation capability and enable us to continue to create long term shareholder value with that operator we will now open the call to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from michael piken with cleveland research please proceed michael piken cleveland research analyst yes hi good morning just wanted to find out a little bit about your thoughts on the magellan pipeline potentially being shut down and what that means longer term for both your business as well as the future of fall ammonia bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain thanks on regarding the magellan we are disappointed but not surprised by their decision to shut down the pipeline they ve had operational issues for the past several years which has challenged to support our ship the tons that we ve wanted to move up and see up the midwest we ship about 4 to 5 of our ammonia on the magellan and kind of projecting what we thought would happen we ve been working with our system with our team to create options and different avenues to move our tons up into that market one is barge loading out of verdigris which we re able to do now as well as increasing our storage capabilities in certain terminals and working with our truck providers so we believe that we will be in an ok position moving forward to continue to move those tons into the market and we expect the pipeline to shut down by the end of the year anthony will president and chief executive officer realistically michael it was just the verdigris tons so were the predominant tons that we transported down the magellan and as bert said we ve got some good barge options coming out of there so i think bert s team has done a really nice job of preparing for this eventuality operator thank you and our next question comes from ben isaacson with scotiabank please proceed ben isaacson scotiabank analyst good morning thank you when you think five plus years out can you give us an update on how you see the growth of the us lng market impacting us nitrogen economics and specifically cf s position on the cost curve and do you have kind of strategies to manage that thanks anthony will president and chief executive officer yes ben i think both dennis and i will take a look at this but the good news is from our perspective that construction costs in north america are extremely high and so anybody that s building an lng liquefaction capacity in north america is putting a fair bit of dollars into the ground and are expecting a return on it given that those are all for profit entities over here and the result of that is given an expected rate of return we see gas costs in the rest of the world continuing to be in a position where north america is substantially advantaged relative to our competitors abroad and i think from a resource base in north america if you look at what happened just in the last couple of years we ve gone from high 60s low 70s bcf production into the 80s mid 80s now and the supply response is very quick in north america and gas price is below 3 so we don t think there is an issue of the resource drying up quickly and north american gas spiking and we don t see the new lng capacity dramatically lowering the marginal cost of production elsewhere in the world so for the next four to five years we think it s business as usual for us producers dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yes ben i think the key thing for you to look at on the resource side is what is sort of the resources to production ratio and that s seen at anywhere from 80 to 100 and when you ve got a ratio that high typically and when you ve got when you can tap into the resource with the short cycle time low cost land rig projects the production response can be as tony has talked about or outlined it and so the small increments that we see in lng capacity that have come or that will come are pretty small compared to what the resource base is capable of producing in a fairly short time frame operator thank you and our next question comes from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you given we re approaching the tail end of capacity expansions over the last build cycle last half decade or so how do you believe urea trade flows are going to evolve given the decreasing importance of chinese exports and if you could also touch on how you believe the uan trade flows will evolve in the context of european anti dumping duties both of those would be appreciated thank you bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain so you re right regarding expansions where as i said in my notes that about 3 5 million tons are coming on this year a declining amount of tonnage new tonnage coming on and with expected growth we expect that the urea market will be good and positive going forward however the capacity expansions that have come are from lower cost production areas nigeria northern africa middle east i m not sure about the indian additions that are announced just because they will be having to pay high cost lng and we do believe that china over time is moderating down to this level of about 2 million tons of exports so trade flows i think you ve seen the additions come on and operate well in the united states we re going to move down into a lower level of imports and stay in that range of let s say 4 million tons and we expect growth in brazil as the petrobras plants are shut down so moving from 5 million tons to over 6 million tons still expect india to be in that 6 million to 7 million ton range for the next couple of years and so it s a classic supply and demand and high cost and marginal producer back to those economics and the cost curve will work and that these higher cost or higher lng markets will have to moderate down and absorb the lower cost tons and that s a direct reflection of these eu discussions we re actively participating and cooperating with this analysis we expect an announcement to come out in the next month or month and a half and they could lead to duties no duties or continuation of the same duties which we pay today at 6 5 while millions of tons come this way and pay no duty in the united states so our position on that one is pretty clear the low margins of the european producers is completely unrelated to the us imports that we ve shipped or exports we have shipped over to there but is caused by a combination of what we ve experienced lower price uan and urea global prices and then high european production costs driven by high gas costs whether that be lng or russian imports and so we expect and i would if you re thinking economically and reviewing the economic analysis that we others have provided that analysis should come out that we did something that was shipping tons at prices similar to what the united states were and was not anything close to dumping anthony will president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i think on that point as bert said we re cooperating actively with the commission investigation we are not dumping it is a global price point for uan and our delivered price into france and belgium is above what our netback price would be using the jones act vessel to hit the east coast of the united states so those are very rational kind of moves for us to make and at the end of the day it is not the western european producers that are filing this complaint it is it s not eurochem it s not oci it s not yara it is the eastern european producers lithuania romania poland sort of area that are bringing this lawsuit and as bert said they re running very inefficient very high cost and logistically challenged plants because if you look at where the center of mass of uan consumption is in europe it s france and belgium and where those plants are located in the east they have as high a transportation cost to land that product as we do or even higher so the fact of matter is if the european commission goes forward with some sort of duties what they re basically telling us the french farmers you have to subsidize the high cost eastern european producers and if you re sitting in belgium that s probably not a terribly attractive message to be sending out to the french farmers particularly given the yellow vest situation and so forth so we ll see how it develops but bert you want to talk about plans that we ve made to deal with the situation if it goes that way if the farmers are subsidizing high cost producers bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yeah either way regarding your question on trade flows we re constantly looking at our options and optionality to the system whether that be moving to this market or that market we re ambivalent to where the tons go we like to move them to the highest netback but that being said we ve constantly review we brought on 1 8 million tons of capacity in 16 and 17 of uan and we ve had additional capacity growth because the port neal plant urea plant is running so far above capacity we have extra liquor and we re making extra uan up there also so when you look at the buckets that are available to us it s the production mix that we choose to work with each we can move really on a ship so let s say each day of the week and probably right now we re running a little higher urea mix because that is more attractive we re looking at extra terminalling opportunities in the united states around the coast and we re working with our domestic customers for additional tonnage to remain in this market and then you ve heard us talk about the development of south america argentina brazil chile colombia and mexico all of those markets have grown substantially in the last five years and we re at the forefront of that effort for very attractive margins so we look at at least cf s uan book we think we ll be able to continue the same level or above that we re participating in the market today and see good opportunities going forward operator thank you and our next question comes from joel jackson with bmo capital markets please proceed joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning guys the last few months you saw a lot of volatility around indian tenders which urea tenders which you don t participate in but maybe from your perspective you can comment on what kind of volatility in the market this created among market participants in terms of different trade flows going on between china and india and china and iran but also there s a lot of discussion and maybe some of the bid volume into the tenders were double counts in different ways so maybe talk about how the different play on the indian tender has affected your market that you participate in thanks bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yeah when you look at the indian tenders they do depending on the size and the timing can have a big impact they are the only country in the world that purchases this volume this amount of tons 6 let s say 5 5 million to 7 million tons depending on the year and in the past that came principally from iran and china as we ve talked about over the last couple of years these trade flows are changing and we see a decreasing amount of tonnage coming out of china over the next couple of years and that has happened and then with the sanction on iran that has been difficult if not impossible to participate in the recent iranian tenders so the tonnage has moved to the middle east principally supplied out of qatar saudi arabia and some of those countries as well as nigeria and some northern africa and so i think as traders and producers have participated some producers are going direct and some traders you re right some people took some shorts and then covered later and so that does have a disrupting impact on the overall market when you get in and buy 1 million plus tons in a week and then that ships over a 6 to 8 week period so we look at that for us and how we manage our position and how we manage what we expect to come into north america and i think for us it s a good outcome that indian buyers are buying and the middle eastern producers are shipping it s like a 7 freight to go to india rather than spending 20 to 30 to come to north america but this goes back to my earlier comment that this is just how economics works lower cost providers are providing into a market that s attractive for them and so trade flows will continue to evolve we have some spot tonnage that comes into this market as well as brazil and when that is too much that overwhelms the market that s what happened in brazil and that s what happened to us in the last couple of months we think that will moderate and we ll see a positive market going forward operator thank you and our next question comes from mark connelly with stephens inc please proceed mark connelly stephens inc analyst thanks just a quick follow up on the pipeline issue with cold weather affecting the barge season there s already talk of high barge demand through second quarter is that going to drive your freight costs higher bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain for cf we ve contracted our barge logistics and as well as we have our own railcars for 5 000 and we have our own trucking group just managing increasing amount of our truck logistics you re correct i think with the cold weather the ice and ice block ph will be a little bit later but the volume of water is probably going to be going down the rivers will make barge traffic going up slow so the impact of the magellan for us is ammonia and we do barge ammonia from verdigris as well as donaldsonville and we are already putting that or we believe will have ph into motion and i think we ll be fine but i do think that barge freight probably will go up and we can see with other competitors and customers are doing locking up low points like out of st louis into the upper midwest or securing barge logistics for some of these spot ph vessels that are coming in for its inability to get that that s why i think we ll be impacted by these vessels that are coming without barge service connected to the sale might suffer an inability to get service for a short period of time anthony will president and chief executive officer the other thing i would add mark to what bert just said is generally speaking much of the tightness in the barge market is focused around dry product and we have we own our own ammonia tows and have long term leases on the other ones so we ve got pretty ready access to the vessels and have tower ph on long term lease as well and because of the basis differential favorability in oklahoma we can actually move verdigris ammonia down into norland s for about the same price or even some days cheaper than what we can produce it in donaldsonville and because donaldsonville is already on the nustar what we tend to do when we do an ammonia export is a lot of times end up making that the verdigris tons that go out so the on the glass half full side of the equation high barge costs and freight costs in general just increase the in market premium that we get and so given the in market and network and capacity that we have that s actually a really good thing for us as opposed to a bad thing high oil high freight costs high scarcity of vessel and other options all play to our advantage instead of become a detriment to us operator thank you and our next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america please proceed steve byrne bank of america analyst yes pardon me what would you say contributed to your uan net realized price in the quarter that seems more more below our spot expectations for the quarter it was any particular key end markets you were selling into that weighed on that or maybe it was forward sales and then in terms of your outlook for uan with respect to pricing that has been a little bit weak here in the last two months what gives you the conviction that the channel is not already full your outlook for more corn and the fall application season was light that seems very supportive but how do you know that channel is not already full or your competitors have been already sold forward anthony will president and chief executive officer steve let me answer the first piece of that and then i ll turn it over to bert to handle the forward look so i m going to take you back to our november transcript i m not sure how much clearer we could have been about saying look our forward order book we like the price when we took it we didn t see the huge run up coming in the fall and expect most of the fourth quarter to contain a heavy dose of fill from the summer so i understand that a lot of people sort of have a quote unquote miss out there on uan price but it s not clear to me what we could have done differently to have provided visibility into what people should have been expecting and my only sense is and i say this with the utmost respect for your work like you ve got to listen to what we say instead of what the publications are posting for spot price because we gave you at the script for what was going to happen in terms of the fourth quarter results but that said i ll turn it over to bert and let him talk about our view into the first half of 19 bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yes so looking at it i don t believe it s the channel s fault we ve spent considerable time over the last several years identifying tanks and size of tanks and the ability of the distribution system to absorb the tonnage that is produced and imported today the uan market is we believe for north america will be above 14 million tons and i think demand for specifically uan will be robust given that the fall ammonia season was so light and when you look at the fall ammonia season comparisons 2018 was a very poor year comparable to 2016 the difference being that in 2016 we didn t get a lot in canada and the northern tier but did in the southern tier it was the opposite this time and we did get a lot of movement in product supply to canada and the northern tier and did not in the southern tier which is a bigger consumption area that means that the kind of the industry talk is about 40 went down so 60 did not and that could be conservatively 700 000 to 1 million tons of ammonia it will be impossible for that to all go out as ammonia it will have to go to upgrade a product and so we believe our customers are preparing for that and realizing that they need to get those logistics in place those logistics can reserve and that is with us and others and so competitors may have sold forward that s fine the market in terms of being weak on an end base is actually very strong with urea trading where it is at nola at the current uan price it s trading above its historic premium and we think positioned very well and we re probably i d say four to six weeks away from spring starting and that just plays right into our strengths with our storage network end market production and we think that uan pricing will fare fairly well in q1 and q2 operator thank you and our next question comes from don carson with susquehanna financial please proceed don carson susquehanna financial analyst yes sir a question on your thoughts on the moderation of asian and eu energy prices on the global cost curve normally in your presentation you ve got a cost curve and what the implications are for what you think us pricing would be for example in q3 you re implying that the then cost curve would give you a 260 to 310 nola urea price range in 2019 you went through some of the your cost advantages over ttf and anthracite so can you update us on where we are now compared to what you were talking about in the third quarter given the lower energy prices thanks dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yes don this is dennis when we talked last time we ve been as you said the range was as you laid it out a little bit above 300 what we re seeing today is that basically the floor that we talked about because where the shelf sits is roughly the same sort of that say 260 but the ceiling has come down to say sort of 285 290 to account for what s happened to oil prices and the related effects that they ve had on gas prices so we still face a pretty steep cost curve even with what s happened to energy prices and if you look at those two numbers that i just gave you you can see way up the left hand side of the cost curve that there is still as tony and bert have been discussing a tremendous margin opportunity still left in the business and we ll have to see what happens to oil prices what we see now is that opec compliance has been reasonably good opec plus and prices have come up all right i think at 65 brent today i m not sure exactly what the forward curve is going out but it looks like it s perking up just a little bit anthony will president and chief executive officer and i would just add don on that one you re absolutely right when we published that curve i think brent was at 70 mid 70s and now it s low 60s the one thing that s moderated against that a little bit is internal to china not what they re importing but internal china at least according to wood mac their coal prices have remained relatively flat if not increased a little bit and so as dennis said you may have a couple of those bars on what was otherwise a fairly flat shelf that have changed positions a little bit here or there but and you got compression in terms of the width of that high to low but it s not like the low end of that has collapsed by any stretch of the imagination the other thing that we re pretty excited about honestly is after we published the curve in october you got into november and december and us gas price had spiked for quite a while it looked like the forward into the first quarter was up with a fore ph handle on much of that and when you look today it s come down dramatically we re in the mid 2s now and so there s i think it goes to what we spoke about earlier in terms of the supply response in the us and just how much capacity there is to move gas around here and if anything our cost structure is favorable to when we produce this chart back in october and we ll have to see what happens to the rest of the year but we re very pleased to be largely open gas right now and because i think there is some upside for us out there dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah don here i think i would point out because it s always important i think to remind people who look at the cost curves what they are facing what they are a good indication so what average prices would be for sort of the year if the energy prices that we lay out in the detail were prevalent and it really is a price floor not a price ceiling and so you can get into periods during the year and you can get into years in which demand is a lot stronger than immediate supply and you can get prices on average that rise above the cost curve as we have seen in prior years and one thing that i think that makes us confident in this respect is as you look forward going from 19 through 21 22 the rate of growth in capacity is outstripped by the rate of growth in demand and so the supply demand balance is moving in the right direction for us operator thank you and our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays please proceed duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning two questions off the impact of the four application fall season in north america first is with if we get the big expected spring like you think does that change the mix of nitrogen products between urea uan and ammonia or will the mix be normal and then two what does that do to your inventories both dollar amount that you carried through the year and then how much kind of product do you have pre placed to meet a big demand season bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain so impact for fall you cannot as you enter fall we plan for a normal season and we ve got decades of shows what normal is and some of that s pre sold and some of that is sold spot as we roll through the fall it was evident early like i m talking about by the 10th of november we would not have a fall ammonia season and so we quickly pivot in and redirect the tons to different markets and position the plants differently our intention is always to be able to run our plants full and to then prepare for the spring and position those products for demand starting kind of now in the texas and oklahoma market and as the market moves north those markets come into play so first spring we are planning for a big spring with 93 million acres we re constructively positive looking assets in the corn sector one because of the low stocks to use ratio on corn we believe that the 4 position today of corn has some upside beans probably have downsized with the carryout almost 100 increase in the carryout on soybean so it will be difficult to store and to move and especially if we don t get some resolution to the chinese limitation on imports there plus you re going into the brazilian shipping season now so we are planning on a lower level of soybean exports in the 24 million ton type range going forward and that i think puts pressure on soybean so the attractiveness of corn i think can go to 95 million acres and then moving this additional demand from the fall to the spring will make it difficult to get all those tons out on a timely basis the ammonia season moves in a period of days and weeks and that s where i mentioned earlier truck and other logistics become paramount and so i do believe the mix is going to change let s say as i said earlier 700 000 to 1 million tons of ammonia to not go down in the fall if you bucket that three different positions just dividing it by a third 300 000 tons of ammonia will move to the spring we re ready for that and then you have to multiply it by the n factor because uan is 32 urea is 46 and ammonia is 82 you re going to see a substantial amount of urea and uan being needed in the upper midwest and inventory wise we plan to go in full and prepared and then the challenge will be resupply so we re having our railcars position to move those tons as well as our barging assets and we re up to the challenge operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much in your fourth quarter results can you talk about how much volume was limited by the short season and how much of it was limited by your own turnaround and can you also say something about the level of imports of nitrogen fertilizer you expect into the united states in the first half of 2019 anthony will president and chief executive officer jeff let me handle kind of the first piece of that or at least a piece of the first piece of that and i ll throw it over to bert jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst sure anthony will president and chief executive officer the turnaround activity level is high for us really had we had extra ammonia in the fourth quarter it would have either had to go out as exports which the ammonia exports are are fine they make some money but they re certainly not as valuable as the in market ag sales are and so the volume shortfall on ammonia was really a seasonal issue as opposed to a turnaround issue and we had pretty good movement of the upgraded products and at the end of the day that was a couple of hundred thousand tons we re talking about so it s relatively small number in the context of 19 5 million tons but i would largely point that to the volume of ag ammonia that didn t go out versus what a normal season is as opposed to anything else and then bert i ll let you kind of comment on the rest bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain so looking at the imports where we are to date i would say we re ahead expecting a 4 million tons to 4 1 million tons of urea and 1 probably needed 1 5 million tons of uan and we re currently trending toward above that level that s why i think you re seeing the weakness in nola and you have to remember new orleans is one of the few markets in the world that has liquidity at all times in brazil you have to bring that vessel in and nominate it to have it sold you don t have to do that in nola in india you work off tenders and so we ve seen some traders this is what has happened over the years these traders bring product in market gets lower and they take or somebody taking these losses and we believe that this declined over time as we ve gone from 8 million tons then for us to 4 million tons but it takes time for people to learn lessons i think and so we expect that imports coming in the q2 will be probably lower just because of total demand in position and we think the market will balance that way jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst bert why don t you just comment a little bit on so you do have this extra imports kind of slopping around in nola but the end market premium what s happened to that given the constraints on being able to actually move that product out of the region bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yeah i think a direct reflection of the importance of logistics contracts positioning and timing is where we are on both the end market premium for urea and uan and ammonia for that matter ammonia is trading below 300 in tampa and at 500 in the end market terminals urea is trading at 240 in nola and trading at 290 to 300 in the interior uan is trading at 185 190 in nola trading at say 210 to 240 in the interior depending on the production location so you re exactly right this is something we ve talked about and we plan on continuing because there is a value to being able to pick up and not have such a substantial position taking a vessel of 30 000 tons at prices several million dollars where you take it by the truckloads and i think that s called just appropriate position risk for our customers and we want to provide that opportunity for them operator thank you and our next question comes from p j juvekar with citi please proceed p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning anthony will president and chief executive officer good morning p j juvekar citi analyst so with the lower fall application that goes into spring farmers can decide to apply a little bit of ammonia but maybe more likely urea and uan and how do you think that will play out in terms of volumes of each because your margins are different on each product so how do you maximize your profit while helping your growers and related to that just quickly how much urea did you export during the off season here and what was the netback on the exports thank you bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain okay so looking at that question and we don t sell directly to farmers we work with our retail and channel partners to do the optimal decision making for the farmer and that is directly connected to the four r s supplying the right product at the right rate at the right place at the right time and so we make these products and we can move our products to different places whether that be export domestic up the river on the rail with the trucks through a pipeline with the idea of having or the ideal of having that product in place for our customers to pull and so when you re looking though at our corn farmer who is planting for a yield and the trend yield this year is 176 bushels an acre if you re in the i ph states iowa illinois indiana and probably nebraska so the irrigation areas your target is probably 220 to 280 bushels an acre and that s what was pulled off last year so you re as you are planting you re pulling nutrients off the soil and those nutrients will be needed and especially to foresee optimal feed growth what we re seeing is a combination of applications but ammonia plays the pivotal role in the initial growth stage of the corn crop and then either urea or uan or a combination thereof with applications and so yes margins are different for upgraded products as we go but we re driven i think to serve the needs of the farm center and retail center and that s what we ll continue to do on the urea exports what we kind of we re ambivalent to where our products go and it s netback driven for that market also so when there is an attractive opportunity we will export and we did that last week we took a vessel to chile or we re going to be loading in next week and that was a positive netback compared to what the domestic market was giving us last year we exported a little over 400 000 tons of urea about 450 000 tons and uan close to 1 5 million tons focused on europe and south america but we shipped to australia and ukraine also and so those are great opportunities for us we re happy to build our customer base as a global participant in this market and as those opportunities come to us we will execute against them anthony will president and chief executive officer and in particular on urea i would say much of the year last year the us was a little bit of the port of last resort for a number of international producers and so what you saw was nola trading at a bit of a discount to international parity and so on virtually every one of those exports that we conducted last year the netback was substantially above what nola was offering and so i think from the standpoint of urea in particular export is a great option for us operator thank you and our next question comes from john roberts with ubs please proceed john roberts ubs analyst thank you was the buyback activity in the fourth quarter about the max rate that you could do in an open market program or could you buy back a lot more stock and just want to i think about the pace of buyback that we might expect anthony will president and chief executive officer so john we had an authorization that was capped at 500 million and in mid october we were the share price was trading in the mid 50s and then as you wound toward the end of the year we had dropped to the low 40s so i think what you saw was a an increased activity that was reflective of where the share price was and the fact that taking shares out in the low 40s is also providing about a 3 after tax yield for us given the dividend on on the shares so we think that s a great opportunity to take that down and going forward i think what you ll see is a pace that is going to be reflective of market conditions and cash generation as well as where the share price is and with lower share price expect us to buy more in so that s kind of the how we think about the world john roberts ubs analyst and then on slide 16 in the back on the expected closures in china about half of the expected closures are assumed rather than actually announced could you talk a little bit about the assumptions behind that estimate anthony will president and chief executive officer yeah the assumptions that weigh into that is looking at where the coal prices are as well as electricity price and the internal pricing versus being able to get kind of import parity what are the number of plants that are below breakeven from the standpoint of cash flow perspective and so we have a sense of the aggregate loss from a cash perspective on a number of those plants and that s what goes into that assessment we can t tell you which are the ones that are going to turn off the lights first but we see that as likely coming and we think there s going to be about ph 5 million tons of closures as we make our way through this year and a lot of those plants may not be producing today they could be on curtailment or shut down but because they haven t been announced as closures they haven t yet in the list yet but it certainly wouldn t surprise me if it doesn t change the net balance from a chinese production demand standpoint it s just they re going to be moved into the permanent closure as supposed to temporarily curtailed operator thank you and our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed jeremy rosenberg morgan stanley analyst hi this is jeremy rosenberg on for vincent thanks for taking my question just had a question on just from a modeling perspective for 2019 any puts and takes to think about whether it be the tax rate or really just anything to flag from modeling perspective would be helpful thank you dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean from a tax perspective what we re looking at is probably a federal tax rate of around 25 we sort of said mid 20s so there is a 21 statutory rate plus some state and foreign taxes remember that our largest foreign jurisdiction canada has a higher tax rate than we have here today that however is for provision purposes from a cash perspective you ll see in the 10 k we have a substantial amount of net operating loss carried forwards which are laid out there but in addition to that we have the ability to take bonus depreciation as to deduct 60 of the cost of capital in year and we ve got a capital budget next year for 400 million to 450 million so i m not sure how good the our earnings and so from a tax perspective it will turn out you all have different perspectives but we ve got ways to shelter those i wouldn t expect that in 2019 we d be paying a significant amount of federal cash taxes despite that what we have in the provision operator thank you and our next question comes from jonas oxgaard with bernstein please proceed jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning guys thank you anthony will president and chief executive officer you re welcome jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst sorry you mentioned in your press release you ve been monitoring the iranian sanction and the chinese reexporting i was wondering is there a role for you to take a more active stance than just monitoring you do have pretty active market intelligence as far as i know how do you see this playing out can the chinese traders keep the exporting with no interfering from the us government anthony will president and chief executive officer well i think there certainly is the option for some of that to continue and then more recently there has been i think some discussions about doing direct business with india and trying to do some currency payments and movements that don t touch the international wire system so that would allow some of that activity to happen our view all along has been that the gas is virtually free the plants are built they re going to run those plants and those tons are going to find a way into the international market through some vehicle and it does create a bit of an overhang and some disruption but our view is that that was just part of the global supply picture and we weren t counting on them not happening i would say that the us government is well aware that those tons are coming out and some of the stuff is just outside the areas that we can provide or the government can provide appropriate pressure against but i do think longer term the as long as the sanctions stay in place whether it s access to technical expertise access to new parts particularly some of the more exotic materials that need to be fab ed in europe or other places that are more directly affected you may see either a reduction in operating rate or slowness for like the lordegan plant coming up kind of thing so i think what s running is going to continue to run but depending upon how long this goes on that could drop off a little bit operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew wong with rbc capital markets please proceed andrew wong rbc capital markets analyst hi good morning so just regarding the 500 million of 500 million of debt that s due next year do you plan to repay that or do you plan to roll it over and maybe just more of a general question on capital allocation aside from debt repayments and share repurchases is there anything else that you look at investing into maybe expansions or m a thanks dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer well i mean if you go back to our capital allocation philosophy we would like to invest in growth for our business where we can do that and have it be accretive on a cash flow per share basis and above our cost of capital there are however not a million of those things for us to do and we re pretty picky about the projects in the m a prospects that we look at so absent anything of significance in that area we want to return the cash to shareholders but we want to do that within a frame in a framework that reflects our commitment to long term investment grade metrics and so what we ve committed to the market is we are going to repay on or before its maturity date which is in may of 2020 the last of the 500 million of the 2010 or i think it s 2010 bond those are big carrier coupon rate of about 7 125 so when we finally get that done we ll be sitting at an interest cost per year cash interest cost of below 200 million per year this is a significant reduction in fixed charges i think it s also important as tony pointed out that we also do share repurchases as a means of returning cash to shareholders and it has like a 3 ish after tax yield on that and it does eliminate a lot of fixed charges as well so we believe that both taking the debt out and also reducing the fixed charge associated with dividends are credit positive operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions for today i d like to turn the call back to martin jarosick for closing remarks martin jarosick vice president investor relations thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to

compares to a net loss of 47 million 0 16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 during the quarter we incurred goodwill impairment charges totaling 208 million that after tax reduced net earnings by

see non gaap measures of 93 million versus 28 million in the prior year comparative quarter during the fourth quarter we reduced the principal amount of our outstanding debt by us 74 million through redemptions and repurchases for a gain of 7 million fourth quarter ending cash balance was 97 million up 32 million from the december 31 2017 balance of 65 million fourth quarter capital expenditures were 30 million as at december 31 2018 we have classified 22 north american drilling rigs 18 in canada and four in the u s as assets held for sale and reported these assets at their carrying value of 20 million precision s president and ceo kevin neveu stated precision executed on its 2018 business plan and delivered operating and financial results far exceeding our expectations this execution was clear in all key financial and operating metrics delivering strong rig and crew operating and safety performance diligent variable and fixed cost control growth in u s market share and forging the path to commercializing our technology initiatives all while strictly controlling our capital spending precision s execution in 2018 resulted in better than expected cash flow allowing us to accelerate our debt repayment plan well beyond our stated target range for the year retiring 174 million of debt in 2018 in the fourth quarter strong demand for our super series rigs and firm pricing in the u s combined with aggressive cost management in our canadian businesses drove better than expected financial results we enter 2019 with liquidity of over 800 million and remain firmly committed to our deleveraging plan recently increasing our longer term debt reduction target range by 100 million to 400 million to 600 million by the end of 2021 while customer sentiment has recently improved with firming wti pricing the extreme volatility and widened canadian differentials experienced during the fourth quarter weighed heavily on our customers planning as we entered 2019 we see the effects sharply in canada as winter drilling activity is trending down 30 from last winter in canada currently we have 58 rigs operating and do not expect activity to strengthen until the second half of the year as oil inventories decline and takeaway capacity improves canadian differentials have narrowed substantially following the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailment program driving improved cash flows for many of our customers and potentially strengthening the outlook for later in the year despite near term softness our canadian business is well positioned to generate strong cash flow through leveraging our scale with unmatched rig fleet quality and precision s high performance operations in the u s we have 81 rigs operating 16 more than this time last year representing 25 year over year growth while our u s activity is steady our customers are still cautiously assessing 2019 spending plans precision has signed eight term contracts year to date in addition to 11 in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicative of continued strength in high spec rig demand over the last year we have increased our ac super triple 1500 rig fleet in the u s by five including two rigs redeployed from canada and three new builds largely assembled from spare components and vendor credits additionally we completed 31 rig upgrades including pad walking systems third mud pump additions and process automation control upgrades all cash deployed to mobilize build new and upgrade rigs was backed with take or pay customer contracts at leading edge rates and we managed these u s fleet enhancements with relatively modest capital spending currently we have eight rigs operating in the middle east all performing exceedingly well in saudi arabia we expect to sign long term contracts on the two rigs currently up for renewal by the end of the quarter and in kuwait we are on time and on budget to deploy a sixth new build rig in june by mid year we expect to have nine rigs operating in the middle east all under long term contracts providing stable cash flow visibility precision s technology strategy displayed significant progress throughout 2018 with 33 process automation control systems installed 31 of which are active in the field during the year we were able to demonstrate to our customers our system s ability to deliver consistent and repeatable high quality results while improving safety performance and operational efficiency going into 2019 our priorities revolve around further commercialization of the process automation control platform pd apps and pd analytics as precision remains a leader in advanced rig technology offerings precision remains focused on the things in which it can control namely allocating free cash flow toward debt repayment capital discipline cost management and operational excellence commodity price volatility is likely to persist throughout 2019 however we believe we are well positioned across each of our geographies to manage

subsequent accelerated depreciation of a portion of our spare equipment in 2018 general and administrative expenses this quarter were 21 million 1 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease is due to lower share based incentive compensation expense tied to the price of our common shares see other items later in this release partially offset by a weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs during the quarter we terminated an arrangement agreement to acquire an oil and gas drilling contractor subsequent to the termination a transaction fee was paid to us which net of transaction costs amounted to 14 million under international financial reporting standards we are required to assess the carrying value of our assets in cash generating units containing goodwill annually due to the decrease in oil and natural gas well drilling in canada and the outlook for activity in canada and in our directional drilling division in the u s we recognized a 208 million goodwill impairment charge in the quarter the charge represents the full amount of goodwill attributable to our canadian contract drilling operations and our u s directional drilling operations net finance charges were 32 million a decrease of 6 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to debt retired in 2017 and

relative to this time last year in u s and decreased in canada according to industry sources as of february 8 2019 the u s active land drilling rig count was up approximately 7 from the same point last year while the canadian active land drilling rig count was down approximately 26 to date in 2019 approximately 60 of the canadian industry s active rigs and 81 of the u s industry s active rigs are drilling for oil targets compared with 66 for canada and 80 for the u s at the same time last year industry conditions we expect tier 1 rigs to remain the preferred rigs of customers globally the economic value created by the significant drilling and mobility efficiencies delivered by the most advanced xy pad walking rigs has been highlighted and widely accepted by our customers the trend to longer reach horizontal completions and importance of the rig delivering these complex wells consistently and efficiently has been well established by the industry we expect demand for leading edge high efficiency tier 1 rigs will continue to strengthen as drilling rig capability has been a key economic facilitator of horizontal unconventional resource exploitation development and field application of drilling equipment process automation coupled with closed loop drilling controls and de manning of rigs will continue this technical evolution while creating further cost efficiencies and performance value for customers capital spending capital spending in 2019 is expected to be 169 million and includes 53 million for sustaining and infrastructure and 116 million for upgrade and expansion approximately 68 million of which relates to the completion of our sixth new build rig in kuwait we expect that the 169 million will be split 161 million in the contract drilling services

counts revenue from contract drilling services was 392 million this quarter or 27 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 while adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures increased by 22 to 122 million the increase in revenue was primarily due to higher utilization days as well as higher spot market rates in the u s during the quarter we recognized 1 million in shortfall payments in our canadian contract drilling business compared with 13 million in the prior year comparative period in the u s we recognized turnkey revenue of us 11 million compared with us 3 million in the comparative period and we recognized us 0 3 million in idle but contracted rig revenue compared with us 1 million in the comparative quarter of 2017 drilling rig utilization days in canada drilling days plus move days were 4 517 during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 9 compared to 2017 primarily due to decreased industry activity brought on by lower commodity prices and takeaway capacity challenges in canada drilling rig utilization days in the u s were 7 318 or 36 higher than the same quarter of 2017 as our u s activity was up with higher industry activity drilling rig utilization days in our international business were 736 in line with the same quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter in 2017 drilling rig revenue per utilization day in canada decreased 3 as lower shortfall revenue in the current quarter was partially offset by increases in spot market rates and higher expenses recovered through the day rate compared with the prior period drilling rig revenue per utilization day for the quarter in the u s was up 16 compared to the prior year as we realized higher average day rates and turnkey revenue international revenue per utilization day for the quarter was up by 3 compared with the prior year comparative period due to fewer rig moves in canada 15 of our utilization days in the quarter were generated from rigs under term contract compared with 13 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the u s 62 of utilization days were generated from rigs under term contract as compared with 55 in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating costs were 66 of revenue for the quarter one percentage point higher than the prior year period on a per utilization day basis operating costs for the drilling rig division in canada were higher than the prior year period due to timing of equipment certification and equipment maintenance costs and higher expenses recovered through the day rate in the u s operating costs for the quarter on a per day basis were higher than the prior year period primarily due to expenses recovered through the day rate and higher turnkey activity depreciation expense in the quarter was 13 million higher than the prior year comparative period due to the

rig revenue per operating hour in the quarter was 753 or 109 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily the result of increased costs passed through to the customer and rig mix adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures was higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily because of higher average rates and improved cost structure partially offset by lower activity operating costs as a percentage of revenue was 78 compared with the prior year comparative quarter of 88 depreciation expense in the quarter was 3 million lower than the prior year comparative period due to the

support functions to our operating segments the corporate and other segment had an adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures of 5 million a 17 million increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower share based incentive compensation and the receipt of the transaction termination fee partially offset by costs associated with our unsuccessful arrangement agreement other items share based incentive compensation plans we have several cash settled share based incentive plans for non management directors officers and other eligible employees the fair values of the amounts payable under these plans are recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the participant becomes entitled to payment the recorded liability is re established at the end of each reporting period until settlement with the resultant change to fair value of the liability recognized in net earnings loss for the period we also have two equity settled share based incentive plans under the executive performance share psu plan which commenced in may 2017 the fair value of the psus granted is calculated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation and that value is recorded as compensation expense over the grant s vesting period with an offset to contributed surplus upon redemption of the psus into common shares the associated amount is reclassified from contributed surplus to shareholders capital the share option plan is treated similarly except that the fair value of the share purchased options granted are valued using the black scholes option pricing model and consideration paid by employees upon exercise of the equity purchase options are recognized in share capital a summary of the amounts expensed recovered under these

recovery was 14 million in the current quarter compared to 2 million in the same quarter in 2017 the increase is primarily due to the declining share price experienced in the current quarter compared to an increasing share price in the comparative 2017 period executive psu share based incentive compensation expense for the quarter was 2 million compared to 1 million in the same quarter in 2017 this increase is a result of the plan being implemented part way through the second quarter in 2017 and from additional grants in 2018 financing charges net financial charges for the quarter were 32 million a decrease of 6 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily because of debt retired in 2017 and mid 2018 partially offset by a weaker canadian dollar on our u s dollar

remarks operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the fourth quarter 2018 cf industries holdings earnings conference call my name is stephanie and i ll be your coordinator for today at this time all participants are in a listen only mode we will facilitate a question and answer session toward the end of the presentation operator instructions advertisement advertisement i would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today mr martin jarosick with cf investor relations sir please proceed martin jarosick vice president investor relations good morning and thanks for joining the cf industries 2018 full year and fourth quarter earnings conference call i am martin jarosick vice president investor relations for cf with me today are tony will ceo dennis kelleher cfo bert frost senior vice president of sales market development and supply chain and chris bohn senior vice president of manufacturing and distribution cf industries reported its full year and fourth quarter 2018 results yesterday afternoon on this call we ll review the cf industries results in detail discuss our outlook and then host a question and answer session advertisement advertisement statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward looking statements these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements more detailed information about the factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the sec which are available on our website also you will find reconciliations between gaap and non gaap measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website now let me introduce tony will our president and ceo anthony will president and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks martin and good morning everyone last night we posted our financial results for 2018 in which we generated adjusted ebitda of 1 4 billion a 45 increase over 2017 adjusted ebitda of 969 million these results reflect the backdrop of tighter global nitrogen supply demand and generally lower north american natural gas prices but it was the hard work and outstanding execution by the cf team that allowed us to capitalize on the market conditions and even though it was the efforts of the entire cf team that delivered these great results i want to highlight chris and bert s organizations in particular let me call your attention to slide seven of our materials this data taken from an analysis conducted by cru indicates our superior operating performance we ve talked about being great operators in the past but this may be the first time we ve quantified the impact for you we ve been able to achieve a 10 greater utilization in our ammonia plant production than our north american competitors based on the size of our network that translates into roughly 800 000 tons of incremental ammonia per year that we produce versus what our competitors would be able to do with a comparably sized asset base or said another way we basically have a full additional world scale ammonia plant worth of production every year based on our operational capabilities given that a world scale ammonia plant in north america would cost over 1 billion our operational expertise is a significant competitive advantage on the supply side on the supply chain and marketing side we realized higher selling prices across all products year over year we also achieved lower cost of goods sold for the year this execution across all parts of our business enabled us to generate an increase in adjusted ebitda of 45 versus 2017 we operated well and most importantly we did so safely we ended the year with a recordable incident rate of 0 6 incidents per 200 000 hours worked and we accomplished that despite a very heavy turnaround and maintenance schedule i am really proud of the cf team for a truly fantastic year advertisement advertisement looking ahead we re excited about 2019 as bert will explain in a moment we see a continuation of the favorable market conditions from last year based on january and february actual gas costs along with the forward strip 2019 gas could be lower than 2018 by almost 50 ph million additionally year to date index pricing at the us gulf for major products as reported in the publications is also running ahead of last year and we anticipate a substantial increase in nitrogen demand in north america given our expectations for increases in both corn and wheat acres compared to last year all of that suggests a strong first half of 2019 weather will have a big say as to if that materializes in the first quarter or the second quarter but either way the first half in total should be strong the second half of the year is always a reset and therefore somewhat uncertain as we sit here in february but we continue to be bullish about the long term trends that extend out to 2022 and beyond new global nitrogen capacity is growing more slowly than demand further tightening supply and demand and the forward curve for north american natural gas looks really attractive compared to the rest of the world so our story is more than just about a great opportunity in the first half of 2019 we are very well positioned for the next four to five years in 2018 our business generated 1 5 billion in cash we deployed that cash consistent with our long standing capital allocation philosophy we invested in sustaining and improving our existing assets we grew by acquiring the previously outstanding units of terra nitrogen lp we paid our regular dividend and we returned our excess cash to shareholders by announcing and then completing a 500 million share repurchase program advertisement advertisement as shown on slide nine of our materials the share repurchases by themselves should drive a roughly 5 accretion in 2019 over 2018 we closed the year with almost 700 million in cash on the balance sheet and given our positive outlook for the next four to five years our board has authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program that runs through 2021 in addition we again reiterate our commitment to retire the 500 million in debt on or before its maturity in may of 2020 with that let me turn it over to bert who ll cover our market outlook and then dennis will discuss our financials before i return for some closing thoughts bert bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain thanks tony advertisement advertisement the cf team performed well throughout 2018 with total sales of 19 3 million product tons this included a record volume of urea and near record volume for uan ammonia sales while benefiting from higher prices were notably lower in 2018 compared to 2017 this was due both to a higher number of plant turnarounds in 2017 and the fall ammonia season negatively affected by poor weather global prices reached 2018 highs in october since then they have been under pressure first due to moderating energy prices in asia and europe and then due to seasonally low demand in the northern hemisphere we believe that as demand begins to materialize industry fundamentals will support global nitrogen prices in 2019 as a result we see substantial opportunities to build on our 2018 performance net global urea production capacity additions are projected to be modest for the year at approximately 3 5 million metric tons additionally we believe global nitrogen demand will be solid in 2019 most notably we expect strong nitrogen demand in north america during the first half of the year the new crop soybean to corn futures ratio favors a substantial increase in corn plantings in the united states which are projected to rise by 4 million acres to 93 million acres in 2019 we also expect a 1 million acre increase in wheat plantings these acreage shifts should drive incremental nitrogen demand in north america additionally the poor fall ammonia season supports further incremental demand areas that did not apply ammonia in the fall will likely need to make up the resulting nitrogen deficit in the first half of the year with applications of ammonia or upgraded products in the spring with the demand outlook in north america we anticipate barge rail and truck logistic assets will be in high demand and priced at a premium through the second quarter as we look ahead we expect sales volumes to increase compared to 2018 in any given year cf sells around 19 5 million product tons which can be higher or lower based on turnarounds and maintenance inventory levels entering the year and product mix advertisement advertisement we also expect to continue to benefit from our access to low cost north american natural gas we weathered spikes in the fourth quarter well and the forward curve looks favorable we continue to benefit substantially from basis differentials particularly in oklahoma and alberta and are actively managing our natural gas requirements purchasing forward to lock in basis differentials to remove near term price spike risk each of these factors make us optimistic about 2019 we re well positioned for this environment we have demonstrated our ability to effectively leverage the flexibility of the cf system to navigate market conditions and we re confident in our ability to maximize our overall margin through the year and into the future with that i ll turn the call over to dennis dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks bert the company reported net earnings of 49 million or 0 21 per diluted share and ebitda of 349 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 after taking into account the items detailed in our press release our adjusted ebitda was 341 million as the global nitrogen recovery has taken hold our cash generation has increased in turn this has allowed us to deploy excess cash in line with our long standing capital allocation philosophy as you can see on slide six net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1 5 billion in 2018 we used 422 million for capital expenditures on sustaining and improvement projects we also invested in growth by purchasing all of the publicly traded common units of terra nitrogen in april it also enabled us to return 780 million to shareholders in 2018 which included 280 million in dividend payments and 500 million in share repurchases the repurchase program reduced our share count by approximately 11 million shares advertisement advertisement as you can see on slide nine taken together these have increased shareholder participation in the underlying assets of the business by approximately 5 or 2 tons of nitrogen per 1 000 shares compared to the end of 2017 as we look ahead we believe will be able to build on this track record we ended 2018 with ample liquidity our cash and cash equivalents were about 682 million and our 750 million revolving credit facility was undrawn we expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be 400 million to 450 million and as tony explained we also expect substantial cash generation in the years ahead as a result the board approved a new 1 billion share repurchase authorization through the end of 2021 we also remain committed to repaying 500 million in debt on or before its maturity date in may of 2020 with that tony will provide some closing remarks anthony will president and chief executive officer thanks dennis before we open the call to questions i want to again thank all of cf employees for their outstanding work in 2018 their commitment and dedication drive everything we achieve as a company we re proud of what we accomplished in 2018 and we re looking forward to the opportunities we see ahead in 2019 and beyond we are well positioned to leverage our considerable strengths and take advantage of the favorable industry fundamentals we see for the foreseeable future we expect this to drive our substantial cash generation capability and enable us to continue to create long term shareholder value with that operator we will now open the call to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from michael piken with cleveland research please proceed michael piken cleveland research analyst yes hi good morning just wanted to find out a little bit about your thoughts on the magellan pipeline potentially being shut down and what that means longer term for both your business as well as the future of fall ammonia bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain thanks on regarding the magellan we are disappointed but not surprised by their decision to shut down the pipeline they ve had operational issues for the past several years which has challenged to support our ship the tons that we ve wanted to move up and see up the midwest we ship about 4 to 5 of our ammonia on the magellan and kind of projecting what we thought would happen we ve been working with our system with our team to create options and different avenues to move our tons up into that market one is barge loading out of verdigris which we re able to do now as well as increasing our storage capabilities in certain terminals and working with our truck providers so we believe that we will be in an ok position moving forward to continue to move those tons into the market and we expect the pipeline to shut down by the end of the year anthony will president and chief executive officer realistically michael it was just the verdigris tons so were the predominant tons that we transported down the magellan and as bert said we ve got some good barge options coming out of there so i think bert s team has done a really nice job of preparing for this eventuality operator thank you and our next question comes from ben isaacson with scotiabank please proceed ben isaacson scotiabank analyst good morning thank you when you think five plus years out can you give us an update on how you see the growth of the us lng market impacting us nitrogen economics and specifically cf s position on the cost curve and do you have kind of strategies to manage that thanks anthony will president and chief executive officer yes ben i think both dennis and i will take a look at this but the good news is from our perspective that construction costs in north america are extremely high and so anybody that s building an lng liquefaction capacity in north america is putting a fair bit of dollars into the ground and are expecting a return on it given that those are all for profit entities over here and the result of that is given an expected rate of return we see gas costs in the rest of the world continuing to be in a position where north america is substantially advantaged relative to our competitors abroad and i think from a resource base in north america if you look at what happened just in the last couple of years we ve gone from high 60s low 70s bcf production into the 80s mid 80s now and the supply response is very quick in north america and gas price is below 3 so we don t think there is an issue of the resource drying up quickly and north american gas spiking and we don t see the new lng capacity dramatically lowering the marginal cost of production elsewhere in the world so for the next four to five years we think it s business as usual for us producers dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yes ben i think the key thing for you to look at on the resource side is what is sort of the resources to production ratio and that s seen at anywhere from 80 to 100 and when you ve got a ratio that high typically and when you ve got when you can tap into the resource with the short cycle time low cost land rig projects the production response can be as tony has talked about or outlined it and so the small increments that we see in lng capacity that have come or that will come are pretty small compared to what the resource base is capable of producing in a fairly short time frame operator thank you and our next question comes from christopher parkinson with credit suisse please proceed christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you given we re approaching the tail end of capacity expansions over the last build cycle last half decade or so how do you believe urea trade flows are going to evolve given the decreasing importance of chinese exports and if you could also touch on how you believe the uan trade flows will evolve in the context of european anti dumping duties both of those would be appreciated thank you bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain so you re right regarding expansions where as i said in my notes that about 3 5 million tons are coming on this year a declining amount of tonnage new tonnage coming on and with expected growth we expect that the urea market will be good and positive going forward however the capacity expansions that have come are from lower cost production areas nigeria northern africa middle east i m not sure about the indian additions that are announced just because they will be having to pay high cost lng and we do believe that china over time is moderating down to this level of about 2 million tons of exports so trade flows i think you ve seen the additions come on and operate well in the united states we re going to move down into a lower level of imports and stay in that range of let s say 4 million tons and we expect growth in brazil as the petrobras plants are shut down so moving from 5 million tons to over 6 million tons still expect india to be in that 6 million to 7 million ton range for the next couple of years and so it s a classic supply and demand and high cost and marginal producer back to those economics and the cost curve will work and that these higher cost or higher lng markets will have to moderate down and absorb the lower cost tons and that s a direct reflection of these eu discussions we re actively participating and cooperating with this analysis we expect an announcement to come out in the next month or month and a half and they could lead to duties no duties or continuation of the same duties which we pay today at 6 5 while millions of tons come this way and pay no duty in the united states so our position on that one is pretty clear the low margins of the european producers is completely unrelated to the us imports that we ve shipped or exports we have shipped over to there but is caused by a combination of what we ve experienced lower price uan and urea global prices and then high european production costs driven by high gas costs whether that be lng or russian imports and so we expect and i would if you re thinking economically and reviewing the economic analysis that we others have provided that analysis should come out that we did something that was shipping tons at prices similar to what the united states were and was not anything close to dumping anthony will president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i think on that point as bert said we re cooperating actively with the commission investigation we are not dumping it is a global price point for uan and our delivered price into france and belgium is above what our netback price would be using the jones act vessel to hit the east coast of the united states so those are very rational kind of moves for us to make and at the end of the day it is not the western european producers that are filing this complaint it is it s not eurochem it s not oci it s not yara it is the eastern european producers lithuania romania poland sort of area that are bringing this lawsuit and as bert said they re running very inefficient very high cost and logistically challenged plants because if you look at where the center of mass of uan consumption is in europe it s france and belgium and where those plants are located in the east they have as high a transportation cost to land that product as we do or even higher so the fact of matter is if the european commission goes forward with some sort of duties what they re basically telling us the french farmers you have to subsidize the high cost eastern european producers and if you re sitting in belgium that s probably not a terribly attractive message to be sending out to the french farmers particularly given the yellow vest situation and so forth so we ll see how it develops but bert you want to talk about plans that we ve made to deal with the situation if it goes that way if the farmers are subsidizing high cost producers bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yeah either way regarding your question on trade flows we re constantly looking at our options and optionality to the system whether that be moving to this market or that market we re ambivalent to where the tons go we like to move them to the highest netback but that being said we ve constantly review we brought on 1 8 million tons of capacity in 16 and 17 of uan and we ve had additional capacity growth because the port neal plant urea plant is running so far above capacity we have extra liquor and we re making extra uan up there also so when you look at the buckets that are available to us it s the production mix that we choose to work with each we can move really on a ship so let s say each day of the week and probably right now we re running a little higher urea mix because that is more attractive we re looking at extra terminalling opportunities in the united states around the coast and we re working with our domestic customers for additional tonnage to remain in this market and then you ve heard us talk about the development of south america argentina brazil chile colombia and mexico all of those markets have grown substantially in the last five years and we re at the forefront of that effort for very attractive margins so we look at at least cf s uan book we think we ll be able to continue the same level or above that we re participating in the market today and see good opportunities going forward operator thank you and our next question comes from joel jackson with bmo capital markets please proceed joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning guys the last few months you saw a lot of volatility around indian tenders which urea tenders which you don t participate in but maybe from your perspective you can comment on what kind of volatility in the market this created among market participants in terms of different trade flows going on between china and india and china and iran but also there s a lot of discussion and maybe some of the bid volume into the tenders were double counts in different ways so maybe talk about how the different play on the indian tender has affected your market that you participate in thanks bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yeah when you look at the indian tenders they do depending on the size and the timing can have a big impact they are the only country in the world that purchases this volume this amount of tons 6 let s say 5 5 million to 7 million tons depending on the year and in the past that came principally from iran and china as we ve talked about over the last couple of years these trade flows are changing and we see a decreasing amount of tonnage coming out of china over the next couple of years and that has happened and then with the sanction on iran that has been difficult if not impossible to participate in the recent iranian tenders so the tonnage has moved to the middle east principally supplied out of qatar saudi arabia and some of those countries as well as nigeria and some northern africa and so i think as traders and producers have participated some producers are going direct and some traders you re right some people took some shorts and then covered later and so that does have a disrupting impact on the overall market when you get in and buy 1 million plus tons in a week and then that ships over a 6 to 8 week period so we look at that for us and how we manage our position and how we manage what we expect to come into north america and i think for us it s a good outcome that indian buyers are buying and the middle eastern producers are shipping it s like a 7 freight to go to india rather than spending 20 to 30 to come to north america but this goes back to my earlier comment that this is just how economics works lower cost providers are providing into a market that s attractive for them and so trade flows will continue to evolve we have some spot tonnage that comes into this market as well as brazil and when that is too much that overwhelms the market that s what happened in brazil and that s what happened to us in the last couple of months we think that will moderate and we ll see a positive market going forward operator thank you and our next question comes from mark connelly with stephens inc please proceed mark connelly stephens inc analyst thanks just a quick follow up on the pipeline issue with cold weather affecting the barge season there s already talk of high barge demand through second quarter is that going to drive your freight costs higher bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain for cf we ve contracted our barge logistics and as well as we have our own railcars for 5 000 and we have our own trucking group just managing increasing amount of our truck logistics you re correct i think with the cold weather the ice and ice block ph will be a little bit later but the volume of water is probably going to be going down the rivers will make barge traffic going up slow so the impact of the magellan for us is ammonia and we do barge ammonia from verdigris as well as donaldsonville and we are already putting that or we believe will have ph into motion and i think we ll be fine but i do think that barge freight probably will go up and we can see with other competitors and customers are doing locking up low points like out of st louis into the upper midwest or securing barge logistics for some of these spot ph vessels that are coming in for its inability to get that that s why i think we ll be impacted by these vessels that are coming without barge service connected to the sale might suffer an inability to get service for a short period of time anthony will president and chief executive officer the other thing i would add mark to what bert just said is generally speaking much of the tightness in the barge market is focused around dry product and we have we own our own ammonia tows and have long term leases on the other ones so we ve got pretty ready access to the vessels and have tower ph on long term lease as well and because of the basis differential favorability in oklahoma we can actually move verdigris ammonia down into norland s for about the same price or even some days cheaper than what we can produce it in donaldsonville and because donaldsonville is already on the nustar what we tend to do when we do an ammonia export is a lot of times end up making that the verdigris tons that go out so the on the glass half full side of the equation high barge costs and freight costs in general just increase the in market premium that we get and so given the in market and network and capacity that we have that s actually a really good thing for us as opposed to a bad thing high oil high freight costs high scarcity of vessel and other options all play to our advantage instead of become a detriment to us operator thank you and our next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america please proceed steve byrne bank of america analyst yes pardon me what would you say contributed to your uan net realized price in the quarter that seems more more below our spot expectations for the quarter it was any particular key end markets you were selling into that weighed on that or maybe it was forward sales and then in terms of your outlook for uan with respect to pricing that has been a little bit weak here in the last two months what gives you the conviction that the channel is not already full your outlook for more corn and the fall application season was light that seems very supportive but how do you know that channel is not already full or your competitors have been already sold forward anthony will president and chief executive officer steve let me answer the first piece of that and then i ll turn it over to bert to handle the forward look so i m going to take you back to our november transcript i m not sure how much clearer we could have been about saying look our forward order book we like the price when we took it we didn t see the huge run up coming in the fall and expect most of the fourth quarter to contain a heavy dose of fill from the summer so i understand that a lot of people sort of have a quote unquote miss out there on uan price but it s not clear to me what we could have done differently to have provided visibility into what people should have been expecting and my only sense is and i say this with the utmost respect for your work like you ve got to listen to what we say instead of what the publications are posting for spot price because we gave you at the script for what was going to happen in terms of the fourth quarter results but that said i ll turn it over to bert and let him talk about our view into the first half of 19 bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yes so looking at it i don t believe it s the channel s fault we ve spent considerable time over the last several years identifying tanks and size of tanks and the ability of the distribution system to absorb the tonnage that is produced and imported today the uan market is we believe for north america will be above 14 million tons and i think demand for specifically uan will be robust given that the fall ammonia season was so light and when you look at the fall ammonia season comparisons 2018 was a very poor year comparable to 2016 the difference being that in 2016 we didn t get a lot in canada and the northern tier but did in the southern tier it was the opposite this time and we did get a lot of movement in product supply to canada and the northern tier and did not in the southern tier which is a bigger consumption area that means that the kind of the industry talk is about 40 went down so 60 did not and that could be conservatively 700 000 to 1 million tons of ammonia it will be impossible for that to all go out as ammonia it will have to go to upgrade a product and so we believe our customers are preparing for that and realizing that they need to get those logistics in place those logistics can reserve and that is with us and others and so competitors may have sold forward that s fine the market in terms of being weak on an end base is actually very strong with urea trading where it is at nola at the current uan price it s trading above its historic premium and we think positioned very well and we re probably i d say four to six weeks away from spring starting and that just plays right into our strengths with our storage network end market production and we think that uan pricing will fare fairly well in q1 and q2 operator thank you and our next question comes from don carson with susquehanna financial please proceed don carson susquehanna financial analyst yes sir a question on your thoughts on the moderation of asian and eu energy prices on the global cost curve normally in your presentation you ve got a cost curve and what the implications are for what you think us pricing would be for example in q3 you re implying that the then cost curve would give you a 260 to 310 nola urea price range in 2019 you went through some of the your cost advantages over ttf and anthracite so can you update us on where we are now compared to what you were talking about in the third quarter given the lower energy prices thanks dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yes don this is dennis when we talked last time we ve been as you said the range was as you laid it out a little bit above 300 what we re seeing today is that basically the floor that we talked about because where the shelf sits is roughly the same sort of that say 260 but the ceiling has come down to say sort of 285 290 to account for what s happened to oil prices and the related effects that they ve had on gas prices so we still face a pretty steep cost curve even with what s happened to energy prices and if you look at those two numbers that i just gave you you can see way up the left hand side of the cost curve that there is still as tony and bert have been discussing a tremendous margin opportunity still left in the business and we ll have to see what happens to oil prices what we see now is that opec compliance has been reasonably good opec plus and prices have come up all right i think at 65 brent today i m not sure exactly what the forward curve is going out but it looks like it s perking up just a little bit anthony will president and chief executive officer and i would just add don on that one you re absolutely right when we published that curve i think brent was at 70 mid 70s and now it s low 60s the one thing that s moderated against that a little bit is internal to china not what they re importing but internal china at least according to wood mac their coal prices have remained relatively flat if not increased a little bit and so as dennis said you may have a couple of those bars on what was otherwise a fairly flat shelf that have changed positions a little bit here or there but and you got compression in terms of the width of that high to low but it s not like the low end of that has collapsed by any stretch of the imagination the other thing that we re pretty excited about honestly is after we published the curve in october you got into november and december and us gas price had spiked for quite a while it looked like the forward into the first quarter was up with a fore ph handle on much of that and when you look today it s come down dramatically we re in the mid 2s now and so there s i think it goes to what we spoke about earlier in terms of the supply response in the us and just how much capacity there is to move gas around here and if anything our cost structure is favorable to when we produce this chart back in october and we ll have to see what happens to the rest of the year but we re very pleased to be largely open gas right now and because i think there is some upside for us out there dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah don here i think i would point out because it s always important i think to remind people who look at the cost curves what they are facing what they are a good indication so what average prices would be for sort of the year if the energy prices that we lay out in the detail were prevalent and it really is a price floor not a price ceiling and so you can get into periods during the year and you can get into years in which demand is a lot stronger than immediate supply and you can get prices on average that rise above the cost curve as we have seen in prior years and one thing that i think that makes us confident in this respect is as you look forward going from 19 through 21 22 the rate of growth in capacity is outstripped by the rate of growth in demand and so the supply demand balance is moving in the right direction for us operator thank you and our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays please proceed duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning two questions off the impact of the four application fall season in north america first is with if we get the big expected spring like you think does that change the mix of nitrogen products between urea uan and ammonia or will the mix be normal and then two what does that do to your inventories both dollar amount that you carried through the year and then how much kind of product do you have pre placed to meet a big demand season bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain so impact for fall you cannot as you enter fall we plan for a normal season and we ve got decades of shows what normal is and some of that s pre sold and some of that is sold spot as we roll through the fall it was evident early like i m talking about by the 10th of november we would not have a fall ammonia season and so we quickly pivot in and redirect the tons to different markets and position the plants differently our intention is always to be able to run our plants full and to then prepare for the spring and position those products for demand starting kind of now in the texas and oklahoma market and as the market moves north those markets come into play so first spring we are planning for a big spring with 93 million acres we re constructively positive looking assets in the corn sector one because of the low stocks to use ratio on corn we believe that the 4 position today of corn has some upside beans probably have downsized with the carryout almost 100 increase in the carryout on soybean so it will be difficult to store and to move and especially if we don t get some resolution to the chinese limitation on imports there plus you re going into the brazilian shipping season now so we are planning on a lower level of soybean exports in the 24 million ton type range going forward and that i think puts pressure on soybean so the attractiveness of corn i think can go to 95 million acres and then moving this additional demand from the fall to the spring will make it difficult to get all those tons out on a timely basis the ammonia season moves in a period of days and weeks and that s where i mentioned earlier truck and other logistics become paramount and so i do believe the mix is going to change let s say as i said earlier 700 000 to 1 million tons of ammonia to not go down in the fall if you bucket that three different positions just dividing it by a third 300 000 tons of ammonia will move to the spring we re ready for that and then you have to multiply it by the n factor because uan is 32 urea is 46 and ammonia is 82 you re going to see a substantial amount of urea and uan being needed in the upper midwest and inventory wise we plan to go in full and prepared and then the challenge will be resupply so we re having our railcars position to move those tons as well as our barging assets and we re up to the challenge operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan please proceed jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much in your fourth quarter results can you talk about how much volume was limited by the short season and how much of it was limited by your own turnaround and can you also say something about the level of imports of nitrogen fertilizer you expect into the united states in the first half of 2019 anthony will president and chief executive officer jeff let me handle kind of the first piece of that or at least a piece of the first piece of that and i ll throw it over to bert jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst sure anthony will president and chief executive officer the turnaround activity level is high for us really had we had extra ammonia in the fourth quarter it would have either had to go out as exports which the ammonia exports are are fine they make some money but they re certainly not as valuable as the in market ag sales are and so the volume shortfall on ammonia was really a seasonal issue as opposed to a turnaround issue and we had pretty good movement of the upgraded products and at the end of the day that was a couple of hundred thousand tons we re talking about so it s relatively small number in the context of 19 5 million tons but i would largely point that to the volume of ag ammonia that didn t go out versus what a normal season is as opposed to anything else and then bert i ll let you kind of comment on the rest bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain so looking at the imports where we are to date i would say we re ahead expecting a 4 million tons to 4 1 million tons of urea and 1 probably needed 1 5 million tons of uan and we re currently trending toward above that level that s why i think you re seeing the weakness in nola and you have to remember new orleans is one of the few markets in the world that has liquidity at all times in brazil you have to bring that vessel in and nominate it to have it sold you don t have to do that in nola in india you work off tenders and so we ve seen some traders this is what has happened over the years these traders bring product in market gets lower and they take or somebody taking these losses and we believe that this declined over time as we ve gone from 8 million tons then for us to 4 million tons but it takes time for people to learn lessons i think and so we expect that imports coming in the q2 will be probably lower just because of total demand in position and we think the market will balance that way jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst bert why don t you just comment a little bit on so you do have this extra imports kind of slopping around in nola but the end market premium what s happened to that given the constraints on being able to actually move that product out of the region bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain yeah i think a direct reflection of the importance of logistics contracts positioning and timing is where we are on both the end market premium for urea and uan and ammonia for that matter ammonia is trading below 300 in tampa and at 500 in the end market terminals urea is trading at 240 in nola and trading at 290 to 300 in the interior uan is trading at 185 190 in nola trading at say 210 to 240 in the interior depending on the production location so you re exactly right this is something we ve talked about and we plan on continuing because there is a value to being able to pick up and not have such a substantial position taking a vessel of 30 000 tons at prices several million dollars where you take it by the truckloads and i think that s called just appropriate position risk for our customers and we want to provide that opportunity for them operator thank you and our next question comes from p j juvekar with citi please proceed p j juvekar citi analyst yes hi good morning anthony will president and chief executive officer good morning p j juvekar citi analyst so with the lower fall application that goes into spring farmers can decide to apply a little bit of ammonia but maybe more likely urea and uan and how do you think that will play out in terms of volumes of each because your margins are different on each product so how do you maximize your profit while helping your growers and related to that just quickly how much urea did you export during the off season here and what was the netback on the exports thank you bert frost senior vice president sales market development and supply chain okay so looking at that question and we don t sell directly to farmers we work with our retail and channel partners to do the optimal decision making for the farmer and that is directly connected to the four r s supplying the right product at the right rate at the right place at the right time and so we make these products and we can move our products to different places whether that be export domestic up the river on the rail with the trucks through a pipeline with the idea of having or the ideal of having that product in place for our customers to pull and so when you re looking though at our corn farmer who is planting for a yield and the trend yield this year is 176 bushels an acre if you re in the i ph states iowa illinois indiana and probably nebraska so the irrigation areas your target is probably 220 to 280 bushels an acre and that s what was pulled off last year so you re as you are planting you re pulling nutrients off the soil and those nutrients will be needed and especially to foresee optimal feed growth what we re seeing is a combination of applications but ammonia plays the pivotal role in the initial growth stage of the corn crop and then either urea or uan or a combination thereof with applications and so yes margins are different for upgraded products as we go but we re driven i think to serve the needs of the farm center and retail center and that s what we ll continue to do on the urea exports what we kind of we re ambivalent to where our products go and it s netback driven for that market also so when there is an attractive opportunity we will export and we did that last week we took a vessel to chile or we re going to be loading in next week and that was a positive netback compared to what the domestic market was giving us last year we exported a little over 400 000 tons of urea about 450 000 tons and uan close to 1 5 million tons focused on europe and south america but we shipped to australia and ukraine also and so those are great opportunities for us we re happy to build our customer base as a global participant in this market and as those opportunities come to us we will execute against them anthony will president and chief executive officer and in particular on urea i would say much of the year last year the us was a little bit of the port of last resort for a number of international producers and so what you saw was nola trading at a bit of a discount to international parity and so on virtually every one of those exports that we conducted last year the netback was substantially above what nola was offering and so i think from the standpoint of urea in particular export is a great option for us operator thank you and our next question comes from john roberts with ubs please proceed john roberts ubs analyst thank you was the buyback activity in the fourth quarter about the max rate that you could do in an open market program or could you buy back a lot more stock and just want to i think about the pace of buyback that we might expect anthony will president and chief executive officer so john we had an authorization that was capped at 500 million and in mid october we were the share price was trading in the mid 50s and then as you wound toward the end of the year we had dropped to the low 40s so i think what you saw was a an increased activity that was reflective of where the share price was and the fact that taking shares out in the low 40s is also providing about a 3 after tax yield for us given the dividend on on the shares so we think that s a great opportunity to take that down and going forward i think what you ll see is a pace that is going to be reflective of market conditions and cash generation as well as where the share price is and with lower share price expect us to buy more in so that s kind of the how we think about the world john roberts ubs analyst and then on slide 16 in the back on the expected closures in china about half of the expected closures are assumed rather than actually announced could you talk a little bit about the assumptions behind that estimate anthony will president and chief executive officer yeah the assumptions that weigh into that is looking at where the coal prices are as well as electricity price and the internal pricing versus being able to get kind of import parity what are the number of plants that are below breakeven from the standpoint of cash flow perspective and so we have a sense of the aggregate loss from a cash perspective on a number of those plants and that s what goes into that assessment we can t tell you which are the ones that are going to turn off the lights first but we see that as likely coming and we think there s going to be about ph 5 million tons of closures as we make our way through this year and a lot of those plants may not be producing today they could be on curtailment or shut down but because they haven t been announced as closures they haven t yet in the list yet but it certainly wouldn t surprise me if it doesn t change the net balance from a chinese production demand standpoint it s just they re going to be moved into the permanent closure as supposed to temporarily curtailed operator thank you and our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley please proceed jeremy rosenberg morgan stanley analyst hi this is jeremy rosenberg on for vincent thanks for taking my question just had a question on just from a modeling perspective for 2019 any puts and takes to think about whether it be the tax rate or really just anything to flag from modeling perspective would be helpful thank you dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean from a tax perspective what we re looking at is probably a federal tax rate of around 25 we sort of said mid 20s so there is a 21 statutory rate plus some state and foreign taxes remember that our largest foreign jurisdiction canada has a higher tax rate than we have here today that however is for provision purposes from a cash perspective you ll see in the 10 k we have a substantial amount of net operating loss carried forwards which are laid out there but in addition to that we have the ability to take bonus depreciation as to deduct 60 of the cost of capital in year and we ve got a capital budget next year for 400 million to 450 million so i m not sure how good the our earnings and so from a tax perspective it will turn out you all have different perspectives but we ve got ways to shelter those i wouldn t expect that in 2019 we d be paying a significant amount of federal cash taxes despite that what we have in the provision operator thank you and our next question comes from jonas oxgaard with bernstein please proceed jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning guys thank you anthony will president and chief executive officer you re welcome jonas oxgaard sanford c bernstein analyst sorry you mentioned in your press release you ve been monitoring the iranian sanction and the chinese reexporting i was wondering is there a role for you to take a more active stance than just monitoring you do have pretty active market intelligence as far as i know how do you see this playing out can the chinese traders keep the exporting with no interfering from the us government anthony will president and chief executive officer well i think there certainly is the option for some of that to continue and then more recently there has been i think some discussions about doing direct business with india and trying to do some currency payments and movements that don t touch the international wire system so that would allow some of that activity to happen our view all along has been that the gas is virtually free the plants are built they re going to run those plants and those tons are going to find a way into the international market through some vehicle and it does create a bit of an overhang and some disruption but our view is that that was just part of the global supply picture and we weren t counting on them not happening i would say that the us government is well aware that those tons are coming out and some of the stuff is just outside the areas that we can provide or the government can provide appropriate pressure against but i do think longer term the as long as the sanctions stay in place whether it s access to technical expertise access to new parts particularly some of the more exotic materials that need to be fab ed in europe or other places that are more directly affected you may see either a reduction in operating rate or slowness for like the lordegan plant coming up kind of thing so i think what s running is going to continue to run but depending upon how long this goes on that could drop off a little bit operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew wong with rbc capital markets please proceed andrew wong rbc capital markets analyst hi good morning so just regarding the 500 million of 500 million of debt that s due next year do you plan to repay that or do you plan to roll it over and maybe just more of a general question on capital allocation aside from debt repayments and share repurchases is there anything else that you look at investing into maybe expansions or m a thanks dennis kelleher senior vice president and chief financial officer well i mean if you go back to our capital allocation philosophy we would like to invest in growth for our business where we can do that and have it be accretive on a cash flow per share basis and above our cost of capital there are however not a million of those things for us to do and we re pretty picky about the projects in the m a prospects that we look at so absent anything of significance in that area we want to return the cash to shareholders but we want to do that within a frame in a framework that reflects our commitment to long term investment grade metrics and so what we ve committed to the market is we are going to repay on or before its maturity date which is in may of 2020 the last of the 500 million of the 2010 or i think it s 2010 bond those are big carrier coupon rate of about 7 125 so when we finally get that done we ll be sitting at an interest cost per year cash interest cost of below 200 million per year this is a significant reduction in fixed charges i think it s also important as tony pointed out that we also do share repurchases as a means of returning cash to shareholders and it has like a 3 ish after tax yield on that and it does eliminate a lot of fixed charges as well so we believe that both taking the debt out and also reducing the fixed charge associated with dividends are credit positive operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions for today i d like to turn the call back to martin jarosick for closing remarks martin jarosick vice president investor relations thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to

accelerate our debt repayment plan well beyond our stated target range for the year retiring 174 million of debt in 2018 in the fourth quarter strong demand for our super series rigs and firm pricing in the u s combined with aggressive cost management in our canadian businesses drove better than expected financial results we enter 2019 with liquidity of over 800 million and remain firmly committed to our deleveraging plan recently increasing our longer term debt reduction target range by 100 million to 400 million to 600 million by the end of 2021 while customer sentiment has recently improved with firming wti pricing the extreme volatility and widened canadian differentials experienced during the fourth quarter weighed heavily on our customers planning as we entered 2019 we see the effects sharply in canada as winter drilling activity is trending down 30 from last winter in canada currently we have 58 rigs operating and do not expect activity to strengthen until the second half of the year as oil inventories decline and takeaway capacity improves canadian differentials have narrowed substantially following the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailment program driving improved cash flows for many of our customers and potentially strengthening the outlook for later in the year despite near term softness our canadian business is well positioned to generate strong cash flow through leveraging our scale with unmatched rig fleet quality and precision s high performance operations in the u s we have 81 rigs operating 16 more than this time last year representing 25 year over year growth while our u s activity is steady our customers are still cautiously assessing 2019 spending plans precision has signed eight term contracts year to date in addition to 11 in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicative of continued strength in high spec rig demand over the last year we have increased our ac super triple 1500 rig fleet in the u s by five including two rigs redeployed from canada and three new builds largely assembled from spare components and vendor credits additionally we completed 31 rig upgrades including pad walking systems third mud pump additions and process automation control upgrades all cash deployed to mobilize build new and upgrade rigs was backed with take or pay customer contracts at leading edge rates and we managed these u s fleet enhancements with relatively modest capital spending currently we have eight rigs operating in the middle east all performing exceedingly well in saudi arabia we expect to sign long term contracts on the two rigs currently up for renewal by the end of the quarter and in kuwait we are on time and on budget to deploy a sixth new build rig in june by mid year we expect to have nine rigs operating in the middle east all under long term contracts providing stable cash flow visibility precision s technology strategy displayed significant progress throughout 2018 with 33 process automation control systems installed 31 of which are active in the field during the year we were able to demonstrate to our customers our system s ability to deliver consistent and repeatable high quality results while improving safety performance and operational efficiency going into 2019 our priorities revolve around further commercialization of the process automation control platform pd apps and pd analytics as precision remains a leader in advanced rig technology offerings precision remains focused on the things in which it can control namely allocating free cash flow toward debt repayment capital discipline cost management and operational excellence commodity price volatility is likely to persist throughout 2019 however we believe we are well positioned across each of our geographies to manage

of unamortized debt issue costs summary for the three months ended december 31 2018 revenue this quarter was 427 million which is 23 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase in revenue is primarily the result of higher activity and higher average day rates in our u s contract drilling business compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 our activity for the quarter as measured by drilling rig utilization days increased 36 in the u s decreased 9 in canada and remained constant internationally revenue from our contract drilling services segment increased over the comparative prior year

quarter of 2017 our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 31 compared with 26 in the comparative quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda was positively impacted by higher activity and day rates in the u s the receipt of a transaction fee and lower share based incentive compensation partially offset by lower activity in our canadian contract drilling operations versus the comparative prior year period total share based incentive compensation recorded in the quarter was a recovery of 12 million compared to a recovery of 0 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 see discussion on share based incentive compensation under other items later in this release for additional details operating earnings see non gaap measures were 35 million compared with an operating loss of 19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the operating items impacting adjusted ebitda see non gaap measures we realized increased depreciation in our contract drilling segment from a review and subsequent accelerated depreciation of a portion of our spare equipment in 2018 general and administrative expenses this quarter were 21 million 1 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease is due to lower share based incentive compensation expense tied to the price of our common shares see other items later in this release partially offset by a weakening of the canadian dollar on our u s dollar denominated costs during the quarter we terminated an arrangement agreement to acquire an oil and gas drilling contractor subsequent to the termination a transaction fee was paid to us which net of transaction costs amounted to 14 million under international financial reporting standards we are required to assess the carrying value of our assets in cash generating units containing goodwill annually due to the decrease in oil and natural gas well drilling in canada and the outlook for activity in canada and in our directional drilling division in the u s we recognized a 208 million goodwill impairment charge in the quarter the charge represents the full amount of goodwill attributable to our canadian contract drilling operations and our u s directional drilling operations net finance charges were 32 million a decrease of 6 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a reduction in interest expense related to debt retired in 2017 and

re established at the end of each reporting period until settlement with the resultant change to fair value of the liability recognized in net earnings loss for the period we also have two equity settled share based incentive plans under the executive performance share psu plan which commenced in may 2017 the fair value of the psus granted is calculated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation and that value is recorded as compensation expense over the grant s vesting period with an offset to contributed surplus upon redemption of the psus into common shares the associated amount is reclassified from contributed surplus to shareholders capital the share option plan is treated similarly except that the fair value of the share purchased options granted are valued using the black

financial statements for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 in fourth quarter 2018 stated net income reached 1 008 million euros up sharply x2 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 387 million euros which notably saw the effects of the finance act in france namely a corporate tax surcharge 256 million euros net of the refund of the dividend tax and a revaluation of deferred taxes to take account of the expected decrease in corporate income tax rate in france and in the united states 128 million euros there are few specific items for the quarter which had a limited negative effect of 59 million euros on net income these primarily involve a fine imposed by the italian competition authority agcm on fca bank with an impact on the group this quarter of 67 million euros which factors in the previous provisions booked to settle a dispute the other specific items are far smaller amounts and partially offset each other see the detail on p 16 in the fourth quarter of 2017 specific items were much more substantial particularly due to the effects of the measures planned under the 2018 finance act in france referred to above these had an impact on net income of 490 million euros of which 403 million euros related to tax adjustments also of note during the quarter was the recognition of negative goodwill linked to the consolidation of the three italian banks in the amount of 312 million euros 408 million euros before non controlling interests which was offset by the impairment of all goodwill on the polish entities in the amount of 222 million euros other specific items recorded for the quarter include the integration costs of pioneer and the three italian banks total impact of 54 million euros on net income the penalty associated with the cheque image exchange 58 million euros and specific recurring accounting items comprising the rest for 65 million euros excluding these specific items underlying net income for fourth quarter 2018 came to 1 067 million euros

2 70 2 4 1 pp 65 9 65 5 0 4 pp the strong growth of underlying net income was achieved despite a much less favourable environment than in fourth quarter 2017 and in the first three quarters of 2018 especially for the activities related to capital markets and in particular for asset and wealth management and for capital markets investment banking these are the only business lines that saw their contribution decline compared to fourth quarter 2017 the other business lines more than offset this under performance thanks to excellent underlying revenues very positive jaws effects in most of the business lines less sensitive to the market environment and the decline of the cost of credit risk in all financing business lines the large customers division benefited from net provision write backs as it did in the previous two quarters it should be noted that the group decided to recognise a non specific legal provision of 75 million euros in fourth quarter 2018 booked in the corporate centre the strong pick up in growth between income before tax and net income group share in both stated and underlying figures is attributable to a sharp decrease in tax expense in stated figures owing mostly to the non recurring tax surcharge which had affected the fourth quarter of 2017 and was classified as a specific item and in underlying figure thanks to a higher share of the revenue generated in countries other than france with a lower tax rate and to the different effects of tax consolidation recognised in the fourth quarter but relating to the whole of the 2018 fiscal year due to their negligible impact on net income the scope and foreign exchange effects are not provided in detail this quarter however it should be noted that the acquisition of the three italian banks which were consolidated only in late december 2017 produced a scope effect on revenue expenses and provisions which could not however be calculated after the merger of the legal entities in the third quarter of 2018 an analysis of the fourth quarter 2018 income statement is provided below standing at 4 814 million euros underlying revenues were stable 0 1 thanks to the good resistance of business lines vulnerable to the unfavourable market environment and the growth of other business lines in particular insurance 6 0 retail banking in italy 17 5 primarily related to the effect of the integration of the three banks other international retail banking 7 2 leasing factoring 7 8 and consumer finance 1 7 asset management and capital markets and investment banking were the two business lines most affected by the market environment amundi saw a decline in revenue of 18 2 134 million euros compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due mainly to the sharp drop in performance fees 75 1 61 million euros and financial income change of 50 million euros with asset management fees also declining albeit more modestly by 2 9 capital markets and investment banking operating mostly on the bond markets in advisory and in equity origination saw a decline of 29 3 in its revenues on the back of contracting credit volumes bond issues in euros falling 12 more satisfactory on foreign exchange and swaps and a squeeze on customer margins also of particular note is the very negative impact of fva fair value adjustment in contrast the large customers division s financing activities saw virtually no change in their revenues 0 7 despite the high comparison base in fourth quarter 2017 with the last quarter of 2018 closing out an excellent year for these activities revenue up 7 6 compared to 2017 as well as for commercial banking and structured finance lcl saw a slight drop in its revenues compared to fourth quarter 2017 of 0 6 5 million euros virtually unchanged excluding renegotiation and early repayment fees but including impairments of some equity interests excluding which revenues would have been up notable activity developments among the business lines in the fourth quarter include a further upward trend in the lending activity of retail banking in the group s domestic markets with continuing growth in loans to businesses for lcl compared to 31 december 2017 11 and home loans 6 6 for lcl and 10 for ca italia note that this last figure is like for like since the outstandings of the three italian banks acquired in late 2017 had already been consolidated at 31 december 2017 since their integration these banks have been recording sharp sequential increases in their loan origination the number of new home loans granted was up 29 in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and doubled compared to the first quarter the net inflows of the asset gathering insurance division were uneven for the quarter although the retirement savings segment of the insurance business line recorded strong net inflows up compared to the previous quarters at 2 1 billion euros including 1 3 billion euros 62 in unit linked policies 69 over the full year 2018 wealth management was more modest at 0 6 billion euros and significantly asset management recorded net outflows of 6 5 billion euros due primarily to institutional customers while retail reported positive net inflows of 0 5 billion euros this net outflow was due to a particularly adverse environment in all markets this quarter reflected in a market effect in assets under management of 43 7 billion euros in the last three months of the year completely erasing the effects of the excellent net inflows reported by amundi throughout 2018 namely 42 0 billion euros including 36 3 billion euros in medium long term assets the insurance business also continued its very strong growth 7 9 in property casualty policies with total policies outstanding having increased 5 4 year on year for net growth of 700 000 policies the excellent growth reported by specialised financial services consumer finance surpassed 10 billion euros in origination of managed outstandings in every quarter of 2018 including 11 2 billion euros in the fourth quarter as a result managed outstandings rose 7 2 compared to end december 2017 to 88 5 billion euros driven by automotive partnerships 11 2 and group networks consolidated gross financial leasing outstandings were up 3 1 for the same period to 14 6 billion euros driven in particular by a 10 increase internationally factored turnover grew by 4 1 year on year in fourth quarter 2018 a high level of activity in cib financing activities with a sharp increase in commercial banking driven by activity on all product lines and a sustained level of activity in structured finance in line with previous quarters it should be noted again this quarter that this good performance did not translate into an increase in risk weighted assets which have decreased compared to end september excluding one regulatory change thanks to good syndication activity and risk transfer applying its distribute to originate model financing recorded an average primary syndication rate of 39 in the last 12 months stable versus 2017 and up 13 percentage points compared to 2013 the year in which it ramped up this policy of note since the last quarterly publication is the extension of the partnership between agos and banco bpm giving agos access to the distribution of consumer credit within the banca popolare di milano network which merged with banco popolare to create banco bpm the third largest bank in the country a distribution agreement with the entire banco bpm network for a period of 15 years is expected to be signed when this agreement is finalised before 30 september 2019 details of the other highlights are provided in the section of this press release on crédit agricole group stable revenues in a less favourable environment in the fourth quarter are combined with tight control of costs which registered an underlying increase of only 0 8 compared to fourth quarter 2017 note that this increase of 25 million euros between the two periods is more than accounted for by the corporate centre whose costs rose by 68 million euros between the two periods given the investments in payment and information systems additional costs that were mostly charged back as corporate centre revenue to other business lines underlying operating expenses of the group s business lines were down 1 5 despite the scope effect of the three italian banks and the provisions for macron grants 15 million euros in all for the crédit agricole s a group all the business lines played a role in the decrease except for retail banking due to ca italia which bore the brunt of the scope effect of the three banks the fall in underlying gross operating income was therefore limited to 1 2 compared to fourth quarter 2017 the underlying cost income ratio stood at 65 9 the cost of risk declined sharply down 26 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 to a very low level 246 million euros versus 335 million euros in fourth quarter 2017 this decline came almost entirely from businesses exposed to credit risk only lcl and leasing factoring were up slightly by 8 million euros and 2 million euros respectively retail banking in italy continued on a downward trend 14 0 and cib financing is again in a situation of net provision write back in buckets 1 and 2 ifrs9 while provisions for specific risks are at a very low level this reflects a further improvement in credit risk indicators npl ratio coverage ratio in all the vulnerable businesses crédit agricole s a group s cost of risk relative to outstandings fell 6 basis points compared to fourth quarter 2017 to 23 basis points it remains stable quarter on quarter for lcl 17 basis points and consumer finance 118 basis points but continued its decline for retail banking in italy ca italia 67 basis points crédit agricole s a group s npl ratio is down 0 4 point at 2 8 compared to end december 2017 and the coverage ratio is up 7 0 points at 74 3 it was decided this quarter to recognise a non specific provision for legal risk in the corporate centre in the amount of 75 million euros the underlying contribution of equity accounted entities rose by 7 2 to 74 million euros and reflects the sharp increase in profitability of automotive partnerships in consumer finance and the asset management joint ventures in asia net income from asset disposals reached 56 million euros this quarter compared to just 16 million euros in fourth quarter 2017 mainly at lcl 47 million euros from the disposal of two operating buildings underlying pre tax income before discontinued operations and non controlling interests increased by 2 8 to 1 450 million euros by contrast income tax charge fell sharply by 42 9 notably as a result of the adjustment of annual tax rates in the last quarter of the year and a stronger than expected increase in revenues in countries with lower taxes than those in france underlying net income before non controlling interests therefore rose 22 9 non controlling interests increased by 31 9 or 39 million euros mainly attributable to corporate centre in connection with the effect in 2017 of a newly consolidated subsidiary fireca with an accumulation of losses offset in part by the buy back of non controlling interests in caceis last december underlying net income therefore increased by 21 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 to 1 067 million euros stated net income for full year 2018 amounted to 4 400 million euros compared to 3 649 million euros in 2017 an increase of 20 6 specific items in full year 2018 had a negative impact of just 5 million euros on stated net income the fourth quarter items already mentioned above more than cancelled out the impact of those in the first nine months of 2018 namely a positive impact of 54 million euros including the adjustment of negative goodwill recognised at the time of acquisition of the three italian banks totalling 66 million euros 14 million euros for the costs of integrating pioneer 30 million euros before tax and non controlling interests and recurring volatile accounting items for 3 million euros 2 million euros before tax specific items for full year 2017 had an impact of 276 million euros on net income in contrast to the aforementioned numerous negative specific items in the fourth quarter of 2017 the specific items for the first nine months of 2017 had an impact on net income of 214 million euros these comprised the share of the liability management operations for 26 million euros 39 million euros before tax the impact of the disposal of bsf for 114 million euros and of eurazeo for 107 million euros recurring volatile accounting items namely issuer spread for 69 million euros 121 million euros before tax dva for 39 million euros 61 million euros before tax loan portfolio hedges in the large customers division for 34 million euros 53 million euros before tax and provisions for home purchase savings plans for 166 million euros 256 million euros before tax the detail for the two periods can be found on p 16 of this press release since 1 january 2018 and the transition to ifrs9 the impact of issuer spread on the fair value of liabilities has been recognised directly under equity without any impact on prudential capital this effect in group share terms amounts to 193 million euros for fourth quarter 2018 and 397 million euros for full year 2018 excluding these specific items

excluding the srf improved by 0 7 percentage point to 62 1 the cost of credit risk excluding non specific legal provisions fell 23 4 306 million euros compared to 2017 this drop is primarily due to

1 27 million euros and lcl 7 5 15 million euros but a decrease for international retail banking 16 7 72 million euros both in italy and in the other regions it should be noted that the group decided to recognise a non specific legal provision of 75 million euros in 2018 in the fourth quarter versus 115 million euros in 2017 the 38 3 200 million euros decrease in underlying net income from equity accounted entities can be explained by the deconsolidation of bsf and to a lesser extent of eurazeo in the amount of 249 million euros after restatement for this item growth was recorded in the asset management and consumer finance joint ventures it should be noted that the equity accounted entities contributed just 7 to underlying net income compared with 13 in 2017 and almost one third in 2015 the increase in the share of fully consolidated income was a significant step in simplifying crédit agricole s a and in improving its cash control enabling better coverage of dividends underlying pre tax income increased by 10 9 to 6 500 million euros tax charge increased by 2 7 due to stronger than expected growth in pre tax income in countries with lower tax rates net income increased by 13 0 while the stronger increase in non controlling interests 18 9 notably attributable to the sharp increase in amundi s contribution after the integration of pioneer brought growth in underlying net income to 12 2 at 4 405 million euros stripping out the substantial increase in the srf net income rose 12 8 in fourth quarter 2018 crédit agricole s a s solvency remained very solid with a fully

on the fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and activity of crédit agricole s a as follows in 2018 crédit agricole s a s business lines surpassed the main objectives of the medium term plan one year ahead of schedule this is proof of the strength of its universal banking model which is the foundation of a strong sustainable relationship the group is well equipped to handle the rising uncertainty which was witnessed in the fourth quarter with a much more unfavourable market backdrop this strength and the progress made together with the regional banks on the group s customer project are assets for the next medium term plan which will be unveiled on 6 june at crédit agricole s a s evergreen campus crédit agricole group credit agricole group s stated net income for 2018 totalled 6 8 billion euros up 4 7 compared to 2017 adjusted for specific items in particular the exceptional tax surcharge in france in 2017 stated net income was still 6 8 billion euros down 3 8 the excellent level of customer acquisition throughout the year especially for retail banking in france and in italy 1 8 million in new business relationships and continued cross selling efforts have offset the negative effects of prolonged low interest rates weak economic growth in europe and an unfavourable market environment in the fourth quarter to deliver underlying revenue growth growth investments and especially the increase in the contribution to the single resolution fund srf and the cost of risk compared to a low comparison base in 2017 account for the slight decrease in pre tax income and underlying net income 3 8 the regional banks confirm the stabilisation of their revenues but their net income suffered from the effects of the market environment on their portfolio revenue and a virtual tripling of their cost of risk compared to the write backs of collective provisions in 2017 the same trends were seen throughout the quarter for the group and regional banks intensified by more difficult underlying revenue generation due to the market environment financial solidity further appreciated in the fourth quarter with an improvement in the fully loaded cet1 ratio of 0 1 percentage point to 15 0 550 basis points above the regulator s requirements in line with the strategic ambition 2020 medium term plan mtp the group s stable diversified and profitable business model drove organic growth in all its business lines largely through synergies between the specialised business lines and the retail networks and ensured a high level of operating efficiency while generating leeway to invest in development for the whole of 2018 the following highlights must be taken into account the integration of the three italian banks acquired at the end of 2017 cr rimini cr cesena cr san miniato was completed with the merger of each of the legal entities with ca italia and the migration of their it systems cost optimisation and cross selling efforts have begun to have a positive impact and the year on year increase in revenue of the new entity now surpasses that of the costs in the fourth quarter while the falling cost of risk is confirmed the first full year of the integration of pioneer following its acquisition by amundi on 3 july 2017 generated 110 million euros in cost synergies i e 63 of the revised target of 175 million euros by 2020 and most of the integration costs i e 192 million euros were recognised in 2017 and 2018 this integration allowed amundi to better withstand the unfavourable market environment in the fourth quarter ca assurances caa delivered on its new strategy to expand its distribution network to its international partners outside the crédit agricole group by signing two international bancassurance partnership agreements the first with credito valtellinese creval 1 million customers in italy achieved by the acquisition by caa of 100 in creval s insurance brokerage firm an exclusive 15 year distribution agreement for the

restriction level concerning the litigation matter with ofac the us authorities united states attorney s office for the district of columbia and district attorney of the county of new york decided on 19 october 2018 to cease the pursuit of criminal sanctions which had been deferred for three years in line with the deferred prosecution agreement signed between cacib and said authorities in october 2015 the authorities acknowledged that cacib has fulfilled all the obligations required of it under such agreements which have now expired the us authorities thus acknowledged the improvements in compliance implemented by cacib which remains fully committed to strengthening its procedures and internal controls to ensure compliance with international economic sanctions in 2018 stated net income increased 4 7 to 6 844 million euros the comparison base of stated net income in 2017 was impacted by some very substantial specific items amounting to 587 million euros in net income of which 671

the group and the regional banks 98 million in cheque image exchange fines 153 million in changes in issuer spread and offsetting this 131 million in changes in goodwill negative goodwill of the three italian banks net of the impairment of goodwill in poland and 205 million in capital gains on the disposal of bsf and eurazeo the other items almost entirely offset each other for 2018 as a whole specific items were offset resulting in a net impact on net income of only 5 million euros see the detail of specific items for all periods on p 17 excluding these specific items underlying net income for 2018 was down 3 8 compared to 2017 and 2 4 excluding the very sharp rise in the srf 36 2 to 389 million euros it should be noted that while a calculation on a like for like basis is no longer possible after the merger of the legal entities of the three italian banks the scope effect on growth over the full year is negative the sales and de consolidations of bsf and eurazéo led to a loss in contribution to net income of 203 million euros while the contribution of pioneer to be reintegrated consolidated only in the second half of 2017 had a positive impact on year on year growth of just 75 million euros and the three italian banks and banca leonardo in their first year of consolidation are not yet making a significant positive contribution underlying revenues increased by 1 5 underlying operating expenses excluding the srf rose 2 7 and the cost of credit risk excluding non specific legal provisions of 115 million euros in 2017 and 75 million euros in 2018 allocated to the

operating expenses excluding the contribution to the srf saw a modest increase of 1 8 compared to fourth quarter 2017 owing mainly to the change in the scope of consolidation of crédit agricole s a with the integration of the three italian banks and with respect to the regional banks to growth investments and macron grants 45 million euros i e a total of 60 million euros for the whole crédit agricole group the underlying cost income ratio stood at 67 5 underlying gross operating income decreased by 9 3 compared to fourth quarter 2017 the cost of credit risk rose sharply by 18 0 to 499 million euros versus 423 million euros in fourth quarter 2017 this rise is solely attributable to the regional banks which had recorded write backs of collective provisions in the third quarter of 2017 ahead of the transition to ifrs 9 however at 14 basis points the cost of risk relative to outstandings is very low for the regional banks crédit agricole group s cost of credit risk relative to

items underlying pre tax income fell by 14 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 to 2 175 million euros the drop in underlying tax charge 41 4 and the absence of contribution from discontinued operations which was negative in fourth quarter 2017 moderated the downward trend of underlying net income which declined 3 9 to 1 626 million euros the regional banks continue to pursue the universal customer focused banking model customer savings standing at 692 billion euros rose 2 7 year on year this growth was driven by the solid growth in on balance sheet deposits outstandings of 434 billion euros at the end of december 2018 5 0 year on year growth continued to be driven by demand deposits 8 6 year on year and livret a deposit accounts 9 9 off balance sheet deposits 258 billion euros fell by just 1 0 attributable to a difficult market environment in the fourth quarter which impacted the amount of securities held on behalf of customers 8 2 versus december 2017 life insurance assets under

december 2017 loans outstanding rose by 6 7 versus 31 december 2017 to 487 billion euros the growth of loans outstanding was underpinned by all credit categories home loans 7 8 versus 31 december 2017

formed online this commercial performance made a significant contribution to growth in crédit agricole s a s business lines which distribute a large number of products as the group s main distribution network and the leading retail banking network in france for full year 2018 the contribution to crédit agricole group s underlying net income from the regional banks came to 2 403 million euros a decrease of 21 9 compared to 2017 this drop is due to the fall in underlying revenues of 1 9 primarily attributable to the lesser performance of investment portfolio income of the regional banks and the low interest rate environment their underlying revenues saw a more moderate decline of 0 9 compared to 2017 operating expenses excl srf climbed to 2 0 from 1 5 mainly as the result of the macron grants 45 million euros this increase is attributable to growth investments the underlying cost income ratio excluding srf came out at 66 3 for the period lastly the cost of risk nearly tripled year on year i e 416 million euros reflecting substantial write backs of collective provisions in 2017 in anticipation of the transition to ifrs9 the cost of risk relative to outstandings remains at a very

achieved in the final four months of 2018 mill throughput availability and recoveries are expected to improve throughout the year as follows overall mill availability has been a key area of focus in recent quarters which will continue into the first quarter the replacement of the ball mill trunnion was recently completed and several additional upgrades are expected to be completed during the first quarter that are designed to correct and improve all circuits with a particular focus on grinding stripping and carbon regeneration as such availability is expected to remain lower during the first quarter with the objective of achieving an average of 90 during the second half of the year following the replacement of the ball mill trunnion efforts will be directed on maximizing efficient use of the semi autogenous grinding sag and ball mills as well as on commissioning the pebble crusher with the overall objective of optimizing both throughput and grind size a finer grind size combined with continued optimization of stripping and carbon regeneration will result in a potential reduction of total gold losses in solids and solutions a targeted 90 92 recovery is planned for 2019 with january averaging 91 the company is confident in reaching the targeted average daily throughput rate of 24 000 tonnes per day during the second half of the year once the overall mill run rate and increased availability are achieved operating expense and cash costs on a per ounce basis are expected to be higher in 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the higher planned strip ratio and lower planned grades as described above however overall unit costs will continue to decrease throughout the year as mine and mill efficiencies improve and cost controls and procurement

in his book the curse of cash leading economist ken rogoff suggests that excessive reliance on paper money is responsible for ills ranging from tax evasion to terrorism he also believes that monetary policy would be more effective in a largely cashless society cryptocurrencies are not an effective replacement for paper money he says but gold s role is likely to increase as cash fades from view first there were cheques then debit and credit cards then electronic transfers and most recently smartphone applications with each innovation cash has become less relevant at the turn of the century for example 35 of all legal transactions by value were conducted in cash in the united states today that figure has declined to 7 and it is expected to fall to around 2 in the next decade at the same time however the supply of paper money keeps rising as ken rogoff professor of economics and professor of public policy at harvard university explains cash is totally in decline but supply keeps going up it is almost all in large denomination notes and it is mainly used for tax evasion regulatory evasion and of course crime eventually these notes will be so little used in legal transactions that people won t be able to launder them anymore and then the central banks will just have to buy them back but i think the process should be accelerated he adds fair taxation is one of the principal reasons that rogoff cites in favour of a largely cashless society the us internal revenue service estimates that around 15 of all taxes owed are never collected cash intensive businesses account for about half of those uncollected revenues in europe the figures are much higher particularly in italy spain greece and germany and the problem is that this makes taxes higher for the rest of us he says fewer notes more taxes in the us alone the sums involved are substantial around us 500 billion bn at a federal level and a further us 200 300 billion at local and state level according to rogoff the federal reserve makes around us 80bn from printing cash but if it could recoup even a portion of those unpaid taxes that would more than compensate for the loss of printing revenues and in a modern digital world central banks will have plenty of opportunities to make money as trusted parties clearing houses of last resort and such like rogoff suggests also if we kept smaller bills in the united states which account for 5 10 of total bills in circulation the fed would still be making up to us 8bn a year and the chances are that if we got rid of larger notes the number of smaller notes would rise a lot so central banks would continue as profit centres even if we became largely cashless he adds rogoff suggests too that if the only cash in circulation comprised small notes and coins central banks would be more able to introduce negative interest rates if and when appropriate because savers would not have much option but to keep most of their money in the bank this could have widespread economic implications monetary policy is an essential fine tuning tool fiscal policy is obviously critical too but it s highly political and it s always going to be that way quantitative easing is mostly smoke and mirrors so being able to introduce effective negative interest rates is very important at certain times and it would be much easier to do in a cashless economy he says crypto sceptic some people believe that cryptocurrencies could and possibly should replace cash over time they are digital they refute the need for banks and they are virtually anonymous rogoff is highly sceptical however the idea that a few geniuses in silicon valley can create a world that governments can t touch is stupefyingly naïve and the idea that cryptocurrencies will replace the dollar is equally foolish he says rogoff suggests that if cryptocurrencies became more pervasive they could limit the effectiveness of fiscal policy and ultimately monetary policy but he does not believe this will ever happen cryptocurrencies are not a currency and they will be regulated we see regulation starting to happen in the uk and the us and it will keep ramping up the only reason it hasn t done so already is because cryptocurrencies just don t matter that much rogoff suggests that regulation is relatively straightforward governments simply need to limit the outlets where bitcoin and its ilk can be spent most people want to be able to use it in a store or take it into a bank so that s the way to limit its development he says this does not mean digital currencies have limited potential just that the systems behind them are likely to be rather different in future money supply will increasingly be digital in 20 years time pretty much all the central banks will be issuing digital retail currencies of a sort and you should be able to hold at least a digital savings account with your central bank cryptocurrency enthusiasts talk about permissionless and permissioned systems blockchain is permissionless because it does not rely on or need a central trusted authority i think the digital currencies of the future will operate via a permissioned system with a central party so they may be encrypted but they won t be anonymous rogoff predicts a history lesson even as cash becomes a dwindling resource and regulation changes the nature of cryptocurrencies rogoff believes that gold will retain and almost certainly increase its value if you look at the history of currency gold has a unique role and i don t think it s accidental some people say that if gold hadn t been selected as a currency thousands of years ago it would not have a role today i don t agree gold has a lot of useful properties and unique features so i don t think its status is in any way accidental it s a monetary asset and i think if you replayed history another way you would come out with gold again he says as we have less and less paper currency there will still be a need to store wealth to have privacy and to carry out transactions between parties who don t trust one another gold fills that role it s probably the best substitute for paper currency so it s hard to imagine its transaction value won t go up over time and there are all kinds of uses for gold in new technology that nobody even thought of years ago so overall it s hard to see gold s role diminishing he adds in addition to gold being a store of wealth rogoff takes the view that it is a valuable long term investment too both as a diversification and risk mitigation tool more gold needed he is particularly concerned about the amount of gold held by emerging market central banks suggesting they should increase their gold reserves by several percentage points emerging market central banks should hold fewer dollars and more gold as a way of diversifying their portfolio it s a simple question of diversification at the moment most emerging market central banks hold 1 2 of their reserves in gold with 70 80 in dollars and the rest in euros and other currencies i think a 5 allocation seems a natural position to take as part of an effective diversification policy although it could be higher after all the us share of the global economy is shrinking power is being centralised and we don t know what the future holds he says rogoff s rationale is clear the us dollar is increasingly dominant on the global stage yet us deficits are increasing and may well continue to do so the dollar is more widely used than ever a growing chunk of european corporate bonds are in dollars not in euros whenever asian countries issue debt abroad they do so in dollars reserves are in dollars and numerous goods are priced in dollars so the dollar is more dominant today than under bretton woods but that doesn t mean it s stable he says we already have trillion dollar deficits right now and they re manageable but if corporate local state and federal debt is allowed to grow there will come a point when the us gets stressed and if deficits have doubled or tripled by then inflation is bound to ensue our system is not built for high inflation so it would cause incredible financial turmoil and stress it may take decades but these things always tend to blow up at some point and as the us economy becomes proportionately smaller and the dollarisation of the global economy becomes larger the equilibrium becomes increasingly fragile he adds risk mitigation against this backdrop the rationale for holding gold becomes even clearer the point is treasury bills are not a riskless asset they may be for two to three years but not necessarily for the long term so if you want to build a 40 year plan you should have some diversification let s face it if you re a hedge fund manager and there is a 3 4 chance you will get wiped out and a 96 chance you will get very rich that s a bet worth taking if you re a country that s not such a smart bet rogoff explains he believes that institutional investors and wealthy individuals should also allocate a proportion of their portfolio to gold as a hedge gold has enormous value you never know what s going to happen and when something really bad happens gold is probably going to be worth a lot to you so it makes sense for high net worth hnw individuals and perhaps even for some pension funds to hold a small percentage of their assets in gold he says looking ahead rogoff suggests that gold is also likely to increase in value as its global role evolves i suspect gold s value will go up in real terms i think the trend towards digital currencies will strengthen the value of gold as emerging markets expand and trust the us less that will also strengthen the value of gold so as part of a larger portfolio allocation it seems very reasonable to me he concludes this article was

income was very strong at 956 million but our net gains on investments were affected by net investment losses in the fourth quarter of 664 million which arose primarily as a result of marking the

current convergence between business cycle and the long term debt cycle empathize the benefits of tail hedging as a means to shield from capital loss we began implementing this strategy in q4 2018 to protect the fund from significant market downturns similar in scale to the ones seen in 2000 and 2008 the fund could even see positive returns in a big stock market crash get the full series in pdf

is an ideal investment alternative to steer clear from permanent capital loss at a time when the business cycle is shifting without missing out on possible gains from market upturns see my interview with valuewalk for further details on my investment philosophy and 2 recent investment ideas the fund global quality edge fund is a concentrated equity fund that invests only in extraordinary companies with global focus sustainable competitive advantages high recurring revenue good capital allocators aligned interest with ceo and shareholders and with preference for smid cap stocks the fund manager speaks regularly with the management of the companies in portfolio regardless of their geographic location the fund uses tail risk strategies as a hedge only when the business cycle changes from deceleration to recession phase buying otm put index options that trade 20 30 below current market prices macroeconomic negative positive views what are today s market concerns european economic slowdown fiscal stimulus promoted by the u s administration coming to an end in 2019 hawkish message warnings by the fed drop in oil prices increased geopolitical risk italy france brexit among others european economic slowdown fiscal stimulus promoted by the u s administration coming to an end in 2019 hawkish message warnings by the fed drop in oil prices increased geopolitical risk italy france brexit among others what is today s reality world growth is slowing but the ocde remains optimistic by forecasting 3 7 and 3 5 in 2019 and 2020 even though the american economy shows signs of slowing down the underlying fundamentals profits remain intact trade tensions between china and the u s remain high but a resolution could be agreed during q1 2019 between the 2 countries the drop in oil prices could delay the federal reserve s plans for raising interest rates amid inflation concerns despite the decline in leading economic indicators for the u s and europe there is no clear evidence we are heading towards a recession leading economic indicators in china suggest a slight improvement in its economic outlook macro view u s leading indicators and the business cycle we use the u s conference board and the oecd leading indicators to determine the phase of the current business cycle the key is to analyze and establish how the economy will grow in relation to its growth potential u s 2 5 2 75 to achieve this we divide the business cycle in 4 phases in our view the economic cycle has recently entered into deceleration but not into recession as some sectors in the stock market may suggest autos commodities small caps etc macro view europe and china europe shows continued economic decline from the start of the summer in 2018 while emerging markets in asia have stabilised and indicate early stages of improvement macro what happens during the 3rd or deceleration phase of the business cycle profits are reaching all time highs and could eventually begin to drop chart 1 interest and inflation rates begin to rebound chart 2 asset inflation are at high levels stocks bonds etc central banks reduce the money supply credit and therefore the liquidity in the system chart 3 the cost of labor shows a steep rise and companies will be forced to reduce it in the long term chart 4 phase 3 is perhaps the most risky for investors because stock markets will tend to correct previous excesses in terms of monetary policy macro what happens during the 3rd economic cycle macro what about the level of main central bank balance sheet assets in japan total assets are above 100 of gdp the u s and europe are below 50 we see the same dynamic in the main central banks across the world which is why it seems that their running out of ammunition if they haven t already macro are there any other risks yes we need analyse the long term debt cycle the long term debt cycle 50 75 years made up of mini cycles lasting 5 to 7 years show how central banks follow the same pattern reducing interest rates and when no other measure is possible by printing money and buying up debt 1929 1933 and 2008 2009 as a result the previous scenario increases prices on financial assets disproportionately 1933 1937 and 2009 2018 forcing banks to apply a more hawkish or restrictive monetary policy everything seems to indicate that we are entering the final phase of the economic cycle which also coincides with the final phase of long term debt when financial assets and the economy are more vulnerable to a reduction in credit and central banks are left will very few tools to stimulate growth how is the global debt level going to be decreased without hindering economic growth if debt is used to generate returns on feasible projects there is an overall benefit for the economy if projects are not profitable and there are no other means to reduce debt houston we have a problem savings rate at its lowest leading to lower payment capacity debt principal interest taxes etc for consumers and lower forecast on future spend consumption remember that consumer spending accounts for 70 of the u s total gdp artificially low interest rates have led to low interest expense but this may well change soon macro will monetary expansion therefore carry its own risks yes a few source fred economic data website central banks have created a large fake monetary stock debt which has not been of any or little help in spurring gdp growth especially in europe printing money should only ever be an extraordinary measure and not a recurring one the cape ratio serves as a good measure to see how much financial assets markets are overvalued a situation which could last a number of years within a range of all time highs macro business cycle and long term debt cycle total u s debt to gdp 3 32x april 18 debt breakdown in the u s corporate 45 62 government 32 87 families 21 51 a slowdown in the business cycle added to unsustainable debt to gdp levels lead to exponential rises in risk for financial assets the debt of non financial companies has not stopped growing since the last financial crisis 2008 although interest rates remain low a slowdown in the economic cycle or a rate hike could have a direct impact on corporate profits although today the coverage of financial expenses seems manageable it would not be in a recessionary environment from a long term point of view we identify a potential risk although to date there are still no tensions in loan defaults and credit spreads macro what options do governments and central banks have 1 austerity 2 debt defaults and restructuring 3 print money to buy government debt 4 transfer money from wealthier classes to less well off the solution lies in finding the right balance for all options despite the fact governments never achieve to do so in light of the current situation we decided to trigger our tail risk hedging strategy in the last quarter of 2018 which will continue until 1 restrictive monetary policies come to an end and leading indicators return to the expansion phase the economic cycle is not always lineal and 2 the economy enters into recession and stock prices broadly reflect this new scenario tail risk hedging strategy the stock market will always rise in the long term over time even though shares are perhaps the most profitable assets in which to invest there are periods where our portfolio requires hedging as the market experienced in the crisis at the end of 90s 2002 dot com bubble and 2008 financial crisis tail risk hedging strategy how is the idea initially conceived at global quality edge fund we implement a tail risk hedging strategy inspired by mark spitznagel famous value investor of universia investments lp to shield investments in a similar fashion as an insurance policy would however the strategy would only be put into practice when the economy slows and there is a reasonable probability of dipping into recession the main difference with sptiznagel s strategy is that we use the u s conference board leading indicators to better predict changes in the economic cycles whereas spitznagel himself relied on the cape and q ratio the latter is a measure devised by nobel laureate in economics james robin that examines the over under valuation of the market in the long term we are pleased to announce our close collaboration with a private institution renowned internationally in the derivate market in a detailed study of tail risk strategy we believe this will be truly groundbreaking in spain and continental europe and significantly relevant especially at a time when we are experiencing the end of the business cycle in u s tail risk hedging strategy how to build and implement the strategy involves buying out of the money otm put options with the whole purpose of hedging against a significant market downturn caused by a recession it is not however triggered to protect from market corrections less than 20 premium costs to be paid are low 1 3 annually and do not excessively penalize the total return of the fund if these keep rising or there is no dip into recession theoretical exercise to shield from risk with different strategies involving options and long spy across an entire year these may vary according to the value hypothesis used when applying black scholes s formula the first strategy assumes a partial hedging 2 spy options the second applies a full hedge 4 spy options the 3rd strategic scenario assumes hedging levels over 100 8 spy options the collar assumes the purchase of a put option financed by selling a call option the tail risk assumes buying a put on spy 30 out of the money otm to select the options we used the underlying etf of the spx spy the cost of the premiums is a proxy but this will range from 1 5 to 3 annually depending on the implicit volatility when buying and selling options the strategy simulates buying 2 months option expiration monthly roll over expiration and held during one year source zerohedge tail risk hedging strategy we believe it is a novel and good alternative for a pure equity fund given the current business cycle we are experiencing at global quality edge fund investors can continue to enjoy market increases through a portfolio of extraordinary high recurrent revenue and cheap shares but unlike other pure equity funds it has an insurance that protects the fund from a permanent loss of capital governments they think they can borrow for free but they have had to borrow a lot we have had to borrow more than 1trillion dollars and we re paying some 300billion in interest you can enter a spiral in my mind it s when governments have to borrow more and more to pay interest like a madoff scheme years ago we had a debt crisis in 82 it started in latin american countries today it s hitting the core it s no longer the periphery look at countries like italy but it s getting close to us in 2008 we transferred debt from individuals to the states now the years later we re starting to raise rates we have to raise rates it s unhealthy to keep rates at zero so someone is going to have to pay the price nassim taleb 11 04 2018 this article first

during the quarter in order to repair the semi autogenous grinding sag mill starter and to address the ball mill trunnion which was replaced during the first quarter of 2019 mill gold recovery for the quarter was 89 during the quarter considerable efforts were deployed to improve the carbon regeneration and stripping circuits allowing for an improved overall recovery of more than 90 during the second half of december mill recoveries are expected to continue to improve over the next two quarters as ongoing mill upgrades and the optimization of the grinding circuit are completed a total of 10 3 million tonnes were mined during the quarter for an average of 111 507 tonnes per day including 2 53 million tonnes of medium and high grade ore grade reconciliation for the quarter continued to be in line with the resource and dig shape models providing additional confidence in the deposit consistent with the renewed vision of repositioning the rainy river mine for long term success the company has adopted a disciplined approach to capital allocation as well as mine life optimization accordingly management has deferred the 2019 underground mine development plan to 2020 during 2019 the

the united states securities and exchange commission as such certain information contained in this news release concerning descriptions of mineralization and mineral resources under canadian standards is not comparable to similar information made public by united states companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the united states securities and exchange commission an inferred mineral resource has a great amount of uncertainty as to its existence and as to its economic and legal feasibility under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher confidence category readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable under united states standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve estimation is made readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves in addition the definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves under cim standards differ in certain respects from the standards of the united states securities and exchange commission non gaap financial performance measures cash costs per gold ounce all in sustaining

which notably saw the effects of the finance act in france namely a corporate tax surcharge 256 million euros net of the refund of the dividend tax and a revaluation of deferred taxes to take account of the expected decrease in corporate income tax rate in france and in the united states 128 million euros there are few specific items for the quarter which had a limited negative effect of 59 million euros on net income these primarily involve a fine imposed by the italian competition authority agcm on fca bank with an impact on the group this quarter of 67 million euros which factors in the previous provisions booked to settle a dispute the other specific items are far smaller amounts and partially offset each other see the detail on p 16 in the fourth quarter of 2017 specific items were much more substantial particularly due to the effects of the measures planned under the 2018 finance act in france referred to above these had an impact on net income of 490 million euros of which 403 million euros related to tax adjustments also of note during the quarter was the recognition of negative goodwill linked to the consolidation of the three italian banks in the amount of 312 million euros 408 million euros before non controlling interests which was offset by the impairment of all goodwill on the polish entities in the amount of 222 million euros other specific items recorded for the quarter include the integration costs of pioneer and the three italian banks total impact of 54 million euros on net income the penalty associated with the cheque image exchange 58

2 70 2 4 1 pp 65 9 65 5 0 4 pp the strong growth of underlying net income was achieved despite a much less favourable environment than in fourth quarter 2017 and in the first three quarters of 2018 especially for the activities related to capital markets and in particular for asset and wealth management and for capital markets investment banking these are the only business lines that saw their contribution decline compared to fourth quarter 2017 the other business lines more than offset this under performance thanks to excellent underlying revenues very positive jaws effects in most of the business lines less sensitive to the market environment and the decline of the cost of credit risk in all financing business lines the large customers division benefited from net provision write backs as it did in the previous two quarters it should be noted that the group decided to recognise a non specific legal provision of 75 million euros in fourth quarter 2018 booked in the corporate centre the strong pick up in growth between income before tax and net income group share in both stated and underlying figures is attributable to a sharp decrease in tax expense in stated figures owing mostly to the non recurring tax surcharge which had affected the fourth quarter of 2017 and was classified as a specific item and in underlying figure thanks to a higher share of the revenue generated in countries other than france with a lower tax rate and to the different effects of tax consolidation recognised in the fourth quarter but relating to the whole of the 2018 fiscal year due to their negligible impact on net income the scope and foreign exchange effects are not provided in detail this quarter however it should be noted that the acquisition of the three italian banks which were consolidated only in late december 2017 produced a scope effect on revenue expenses and provisions which could not however be calculated after the merger of the legal entities in the third quarter of 2018 an analysis of the fourth quarter 2018 income statement is provided below standing at 4 814 million euros underlying revenues were stable 0 1 thanks to the good resistance of business lines vulnerable to the unfavourable market environment and the growth of other business lines in particular insurance 6 0 retail banking in italy 17 5 primarily related to the effect of the integration of the three banks other international retail banking 7 2 leasing factoring 7 8 and consumer finance 1 7 asset management and capital markets and investment banking were the two business lines most affected by the market environment amundi saw a decline in revenue of 18 2 134 million euros compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due mainly to the sharp drop in performance fees 75 1 61 million euros and financial income change of 50 million euros with asset management fees also declining albeit more modestly by 2 9 capital markets and investment banking operating mostly on the bond markets in advisory and in equity origination saw a decline of 29 3 in its revenues on the back of contracting credit volumes bond issues in euros falling 12 more satisfactory on foreign exchange and swaps and a squeeze on customer margins also of particular note is the very negative impact of fva fair value adjustment in contrast the large customers division s financing activities saw virtually no change in their revenues 0 7 despite the high comparison base in fourth quarter 2017 with the last quarter of 2018 closing out an excellent year for these activities revenue up 7 6 compared to 2017 as well as for commercial banking and structured finance lcl saw a slight drop in its revenues compared to fourth quarter 2017 of 0 6 5 million euros virtually unchanged excluding renegotiation and early repayment fees but including impairments of some equity interests excluding which revenues would have been up notable activity developments among the business lines in the fourth quarter include a further upward trend in the lending activity of retail banking in the group s domestic markets with continuing growth in loans to businesses for lcl compared to 31 december 2017 11 and home loans 6 6 for lcl and 10 for ca italia note that this last figure is like for like since the outstandings of the three italian banks acquired in late 2017 had already been consolidated at 31 december 2017 since their integration these banks have been recording sharp sequential increases in their loan origination the number of new home loans granted was up 29 in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and doubled compared to the first quarter the net inflows of the asset gathering insurance division were uneven for the quarter although the retirement savings segment of the insurance business line recorded strong net inflows up compared to the previous quarters at 2 1 billion euros including 1 3 billion euros 62 in unit linked policies 69 over the full year 2018 wealth management was more modest at 0 6 billion euros and significantly asset management recorded net outflows of 6 5 billion euros due primarily to institutional customers while retail reported positive net inflows of 0 5 billion euros this net outflow was due to a particularly adverse environment in all markets this quarter reflected in a market effect in assets under management of 43 7 billion euros in the last three months of the year completely erasing the effects of the excellent net inflows reported by amundi throughout 2018 namely 42 0 billion euros including 36 3 billion euros in medium long term assets the insurance business also continued its very strong growth 7 9 in property casualty policies with total policies outstanding having increased 5 4 year on year for net growth of 700 000 policies the excellent growth reported by specialised financial services consumer finance surpassed 10 billion euros in origination of managed outstandings in every quarter of 2018 including 11 2 billion euros in the fourth quarter as a result managed outstandings rose 7 2 compared to end december 2017 to 88 5 billion euros driven by automotive partnerships 11 2 and group networks consolidated gross financial leasing outstandings were up 3 1 for the same period to 14 6 billion euros driven in particular by a 10 increase internationally factored turnover grew by 4 1 year on year in fourth quarter 2018 a high level of activity in cib financing activities with a sharp increase in commercial banking driven by activity on all product lines and a sustained level of activity in structured finance in line with previous quarters it should be noted again this quarter that this good performance did not translate into an increase in risk weighted assets which have decreased compared to end september excluding one regulatory change thanks to good syndication activity and risk transfer applying its distribute to originate model financing recorded an average primary syndication rate of 39 in the last 12 months stable versus 2017 and up 13 percentage points compared to 2013 the year in which it ramped up this policy of note since the last quarterly publication is the extension of the partnership between agos and banco bpm giving agos access to the distribution of consumer credit within the banca popolare di milano network which merged with banco popolare to create banco bpm the third largest bank in the country a distribution agreement with the entire banco bpm network for a period of 15 years is expected to be signed when this agreement is finalised before 30 september 2019 details of the other highlights are provided in the section of this press release on crédit agricole group stable revenues in a less favourable environment in the fourth quarter are combined with tight control of costs which registered an underlying increase of only 0 8 compared to fourth quarter 2017 note that this increase of 25 million euros between the two periods is more than accounted for by the corporate centre whose costs rose by 68 million euros between the two periods given the investments in payment and information systems additional costs that were mostly charged back as corporate centre revenue to other business lines underlying operating expenses of the group s business lines were down 1 5 despite the scope effect of the three italian banks and the provisions for macron grants 15 million euros in all for the crédit agricole s a group all the business lines played a role in the decrease except for retail banking due to ca italia which bore the brunt of the scope effect of the three banks the fall in underlying gross operating income was therefore limited to 1 2 compared to fourth quarter 2017 the underlying cost income ratio stood at 65 9 the cost of risk declined sharply down 26 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 to a very low level 246 million euros versus 335 million euros in fourth quarter 2017 this decline came almost entirely from businesses exposed to credit risk only lcl and leasing factoring were up slightly by 8 million euros and 2 million euros respectively retail banking in italy continued on a downward trend 14 0 and cib financing is again in a situation of net provision write back in buckets 1 and 2 ifrs9 while provisions for specific risks are at a very low level this reflects a further improvement in credit risk indicators npl ratio coverage ratio in all the vulnerable businesses crédit agricole s a group s cost of risk relative to outstandings fell 6 basis points compared to fourth quarter 2017 to 23 basis points it remains stable quarter on quarter for lcl 17 basis points and consumer finance 118 basis points but continued its decline for retail banking in italy ca italia 67 basis points crédit agricole s a group s npl ratio is down 0 4 point at 2 8 compared to end december 2017 and the coverage ratio is up 7 0 points at 74 3 it was decided this quarter to recognise a non specific provision for legal risk in the corporate centre in the amount of 75 million euros the underlying contribution of equity accounted entities rose by 7 2 to 74 million euros and reflects the sharp increase in profitability of automotive partnerships in consumer finance and the asset management joint ventures in asia net income from asset disposals reached 56 million euros this quarter compared to just 16 million euros in fourth quarter 2017 mainly at lcl 47 million euros from the disposal of two operating buildings underlying pre tax income before discontinued operations and non controlling interests increased by 2 8 to 1 450 million euros by contrast income tax charge fell sharply by 42 9 notably as a result of the adjustment of annual tax rates in the last quarter of the year and a stronger than expected increase in revenues in countries with lower taxes than those in france underlying net income before non controlling interests therefore rose 22 9 non controlling interests increased by 31 9 or 39 million euros mainly attributable to corporate centre in connection with the effect in 2017 of a newly consolidated subsidiary fireca with an accumulation of losses offset in part by the buy back of non controlling interests in caceis last december underlying net income therefore increased by 21 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 to 1 067 million euros stated net income for full year 2018 amounted to 4 400 million euros compared to 3 649 million euros in 2017 an increase of 20 6 specific items in full year 2018 had a negative impact of just 5 million euros on stated net income the fourth quarter items already mentioned above more than cancelled out the impact of those in the first nine months of 2018 namely a positive impact of 54 million euros including the adjustment of negative goodwill recognised at the time of acquisition of the three italian banks totalling 66 million euros 14 million euros for the costs of integrating pioneer 30 million euros before tax and non controlling interests and recurring volatile accounting items for 3 million euros 2 million euros before tax specific items for full year 2017 had an impact of 276 million euros on net income in contrast to the aforementioned numerous negative specific items in the fourth quarter of 2017 the specific items for the first nine months of 2017 had an impact on net income of 214 million euros these comprised the share of the liability management operations for 26 million euros 39 million euros before tax the impact of the disposal of bsf for 114 million euros and of eurazeo for 107 million euros recurring volatile accounting items namely issuer spread for 69 million euros 121 million euros before tax dva for 39 million euros 61 million euros before tax loan portfolio hedges in the large customers division for 34 million euros 53 million euros before tax and provisions for home purchase savings plans for 166 million euros 256 million euros before tax the detail for the two periods can be found on p 16 of this press release since 1 january 2018 and the transition to ifrs9 the impact of issuer spread on the fair value of liabilities has been recognised directly under equity without any impact on prudential capital this effect in group share terms amounts to 193 million euros for fourth quarter 2018 and 397 million euros for full year 2018 excluding these specific items

to recognise a non specific legal provision of 75 million euros in 2018 in the fourth quarter versus 115 million euros in 2017 the 38 3 200 million euros decrease in underlying net income from equity accounted entities can be explained by the deconsolidation of bsf and to a lesser extent of eurazeo in the amount of 249 million euros after restatement for this item growth was recorded in the asset management and consumer finance joint ventures it should be noted that the equity accounted entities contributed just 7 to underlying net income compared with 13 in 2017 and almost one third in 2015 the increase in the share of fully consolidated income was a significant step in simplifying crédit agricole s a and in improving its cash control enabling better coverage of dividends underlying pre tax income increased by 10 9 to 6 500 million euros tax charge increased by 2 7 due to stronger than expected growth in pre tax income in countries with lower tax rates net income increased by 13 0 while the stronger increase in non controlling interests 18 9 notably attributable to the sharp increase in amundi s contribution after the integration of pioneer brought growth in underlying net income to 12 2 at 4 405 million euros stripping out the substantial increase in the srf net income rose 12 8 in fourth quarter 2018 crédit agricole s a s solvency remained very solid with a fully loaded common equity tier 1 cet1 ratio of 11 5 at 31 december 2018 stable compared to 30 september 2018 despite the adverse effect of the declining market on oci reserves 13 basis points this effect virtually offset the quarter s capital generation 14 basis points after the deduction of coupons on additional tier 1 securities accrued during the quarter and the factoring in of the dividend of 0 69 euros per share to be proposed to the upcoming general shareholders meeting on 21 may at 307 billion euros the stability of risk weighted assets this quarter conceals unfavourable regulatory changes

of basel 4 regarding non financial operational risks compulsory standard method for 3 billion euros 12 basis points excluding these two regulatory impacts risk weighted assets linked to business

agricole s a s average lcr ratio over twelve months stood at 133 3 at end december 2018 i e higher than the medium term plan target of over 110 for 2018 as a whole crédit agricole s a issued 14 1 billion euros in medium term debt instruments i e 2 1 billion euros more than the annual financing plan 118 it raised the equivalent of 7 3 billion euros in senior preferred debt uncollateralised and collateralised senior debt and the equivalent of 6 8 billion euros in tier 2 and senior non preferred debt the latter amounting to 5 2 billion euros philippe brassac chief executive officer commented on the fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and activity of crédit agricole s a as follows in 2018 crédit agricole s a s business lines surpassed the main objectives of the medium term plan one year ahead of schedule this is proof of the strength of its universal banking model which is the foundation of a strong sustainable relationship the group is well equipped to handle the rising uncertainty which was witnessed in the fourth quarter with a much more unfavourable market backdrop this strength and the progress made together with the regional banks on the group s customer project are assets for the next medium term plan which will be unveiled on 6 june at crédit agricole s a s evergreen campus crédit agricole group credit agricole group s stated net income for 2018 totalled 6 8 billion euros up 4 7 compared to 2017 adjusted for specific items in particular the exceptional tax surcharge in france in 2017 stated net income was still 6 8 billion euros down 3 8 the excellent level of customer acquisition throughout the year especially for retail banking in france and in italy 1 8 million in new business relationships and continued cross selling efforts have offset the negative effects of prolonged low interest rates weak economic growth in europe and an unfavourable market environment in the fourth quarter to deliver underlying revenue growth growth investments and especially the increase in the contribution to the single resolution fund srf and the cost of risk compared to a low comparison base in 2017 account for the slight decrease in pre tax income and underlying net income 3 8 the regional banks confirm the stabilisation of their revenues but their net income suffered from the effects of the market environment on their portfolio revenue and a virtual tripling of their cost of risk compared to the write backs of collective provisions in 2017 the same trends were seen throughout the quarter for the group and regional banks intensified by more difficult underlying revenue generation due to the market environment financial solidity further appreciated in the fourth quarter with an improvement in the fully loaded cet1 ratio of 0 1 percentage point to 15 0 550 basis points above the regulator s requirements in line with the strategic ambition 2020 medium term plan mtp the group s stable diversified and profitable business model drove organic growth in all its business lines largely through synergies between the specialised business lines and the retail networks and ensured a high level of operating efficiency while generating leeway to invest in development for the whole of 2018 the following highlights must be taken into account the integration of the three italian banks acquired at the end of 2017 cr rimini cr cesena cr san miniato was completed with the merger of each of the legal entities with ca italia and the migration of their it systems cost optimisation and cross selling efforts have begun to have a positive impact and the year on year increase in revenue of the new entity now surpasses that of the costs in the fourth quarter while the falling cost of risk is confirmed the first full year of the integration of pioneer following its acquisition by amundi on 3 july 2017 generated 110 million euros in cost synergies i e 63 of the revised target of 175 million euros by 2020 and most of the integration costs i e 192 million euros were recognised in 2017 and 2018 this integration allowed amundi to better withstand the unfavourable market environment in the fourth quarter ca assurances caa delivered on its new strategy to expand its distribution network to its international partners outside the crédit agricole group by signing two international bancassurance partnership agreements the first with credito valtellinese creval 1 million customers in italy achieved by the acquisition by caa of 100 in creval s insurance brokerage firm an exclusive 15 year distribution agreement for the

senior long term credit rating for the group and its main subsidiaries by one notch on 19 october from a to a with a stable outlook having factored in the improvement in the group s risk profile and its resilience capacity despite the less favourable environment for its activities the results of the eba european banking authority stress tests published on 2 november show a solid group financial position and solid business lines with crédit agricole group s cet1 ratio at 10 2 even in an adverse scenario remaining well above the required srep level of 9 5 without ever hitting the distribution restriction level concerning the litigation matter with ofac the us authorities united states attorney s office for the district of columbia and district attorney of the county of new york decided on 19 october 2018 to cease the pursuit of criminal sanctions which had been deferred for three years in line with the deferred prosecution agreement signed between cacib and said authorities in october 2015 the authorities acknowledged that cacib has fulfilled all the obligations required of it under such agreements which have now expired the us authorities thus acknowledged the improvements in compliance implemented by cacib which remains fully committed to strengthening its procedures and internal controls to ensure compliance with international economic sanctions in 2018 stated net income increased 4 7 to 6 844 million euros the comparison base of stated net income in 2017 was impacted by some very substantial specific items amounting to 587 million euros in net income of which 671 million linked to heavy non recurring tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 83 million in integration costs for pioneer and the three italian banks 123 million in liability management costs of the group and the regional banks 98 million in cheque image exchange fines 153 million in changes in issuer spread and offsetting this 131 million in changes in goodwill negative goodwill of the three italian banks net of the impairment of goodwill in poland and 205 million in capital gains on the disposal of bsf and eurazeo the other items almost entirely offset each other for 2018 as a whole

for 2018 was down 3 8 compared to 2017 and 2 4 excluding the very sharp rise in the srf 36 2 to 389 million euros it should be noted that while a calculation on a like for like basis is no longer possible after the merger of the legal entities of the three italian banks the scope effect on growth over the full year is negative the sales and de consolidations of bsf and eurazéo led to a loss in contribution to net income of 203 million euros while the contribution of pioneer to be reintegrated consolidated only in the second half of 2017 had a positive impact on year on year growth of just 75 million euros and the three italian banks and banca leonardo in their first year of consolidation are not yet making a significant positive contribution underlying revenues increased by 1 5 underlying operating expenses excluding the srf rose 2 7 and the cost of credit risk excluding non specific legal provisions of 115 million euros in 2017 and 75 million euros in 2018 allocated to the

operating expenses excluding the contribution to the srf saw a modest increase of 1 8 compared to fourth quarter 2017 owing mainly to the change in the scope of consolidation of crédit agricole s a

items underlying pre tax income fell by 14 6 compared to fourth quarter 2017 to 2 175 million euros the drop in underlying tax charge 41 4 and the absence of contribution from discontinued operations

focused banking model customer savings standing at 692 billion euros rose 2 7 year on year this growth was driven by the solid growth in on balance sheet deposits outstandings of 434 billion euros at the end of december 2018 5 0 year on year growth continued to be driven by demand deposits 8 6 year on year and livret a deposit accounts 9 9 off balance sheet deposits 258 billion euros fell by just

network and the leading retail banking network in france for full year 2018 the contribution to crédit agricole group s underlying net income from the regional banks came to 2 403 million euros a decrease of 21 9 compared to 2017 this drop is due to the fall in underlying revenues of 1 9 primarily attributable to the lesser performance of investment portfolio income of the regional banks and the low interest rate environment their underlying revenues saw a more moderate decline of 0 9 compared to 2017 operating expenses excl srf climbed to 2 0 from 1 5 mainly as the result of the macron

resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are recognized and required by canadian securities regulations they are not defined terms under standards of the united states securities and exchange commission as such certain information contained in this news release concerning descriptions of mineralization and mineral resources under canadian standards is not comparable to similar information made public by united states companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the united states securities and exchange commission an inferred mineral resource has a great amount of uncertainty as to its existence and as to its economic and legal feasibility under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher confidence category readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable under united states standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve estimation is made readers are cautioned not to assume that all or

gold defines all in sustaining costs per ounce as the sum of total cash costs capital expenditures that are sustaining in nature corporate general and administrative costs capitalized and expensed exploration that is sustaining in nature and environmental reclamation costs all divided by the ounces of gold sold to arrive at a per ounce figure new gold believes this non gaap financial measure

suppliers of gold and gold products that ceased operations in 2002 adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies new gold reports total cash costs on a sales basis the company believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the company s performance and ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future capital expenditures and working capital needs this measure along with sales is considered to be a key indicator of the company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing and administration costs royalties production taxes and realized gains and losses on fuel contracts but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital and exploration costs and net of by product sales total cash costs are then divided by ounces of gold sold to arrive at a per ounce figure co product cash costs remove the impact of other metal sales that are produced as a by product of gold production and apportion the cash costs to each metal produced on a percentage of revenue basis and subsequently divides the amount by the total ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper sold as the case may be to arrive at per ounce or per pound figures unless otherwise indicated all total cash cost information in this news release is net of by product sales this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial

quarter and full year 2018 earnings call i d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning with me today is aaron jagdfeld our president and chief executive officer we will begin our call today by commenting on forward looking statements certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by generac or its employees may contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward looking statements please see our earnings release or sec filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors in addition we ll make reference to certain non gaap measures during today s call additional information regarding these measures including reconciliation to comparable u s gaap measures is available in our earnings release and sec filings i will now turn the call over to aaron advertisement advertisement aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks york good morning everyone happy valentine s day thank you for joining us today our fourth quarter results capped off a fantastic year for generac in 2018 as we again experienced record quarterly sales through strong core organic growth of approximately 12 overall net sales increased 14 compared to the prior year when including the contribution from the selmec acquisition which was slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts during the quarter for the full year net sales grew more than 20 to over 2 billion with ebitda margins expanding 210 basis points over the prior year to 21 or approximately 425 million continued strength in all of our end markets underpin the increases in 2018 with demand for home standby generators in particular remaining very robust throughout the year as increased power outage activity over the last two years alongside the impact of our initiatives to grow the market resulted in continued penetration gains shipments of c i products were also significantly higher year over year driven by continued recovery in domestic mobile products and growth in demand for backup power in the telecom and healthcare sectors in addition strong organic sales growth was again experienced within the international segment which was leverage into further improvement in adjusted ebitda margins for the year advertisement advertisement awareness for the home standby generators has benefited from elevated baseline power outage activity during the past two years with end user activations remaining very strong in the fourth quarter and the full year particularly in the northeast and southeast regions our residential dealer base continued to expand during the year to an all time high of more than 6 000 production levels of home standby generators were at all time highs for the company during the quarter and demand for these products remain strong heading into 2019 shipments of portable generators were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year which included the impacts of major hurricane activity but were up significantly for the full year driven by the elevated outage activity replenishment of channel inventories and additional retail placement experience demand for domestic mobile products remained strong during the quarter and for the full year as the equipment rental markets further recovered in 2018 with the rebound in the oil and gas markets and increased construction activity both contributing to the continuing fleet refresh cycle demand for stationary domestic c i generators also increased in the fourth quarter as the elevated power outage environment drove broad based growth across a number of end markets in particular certain of our telecom account customers are investing heavily in hardening their networks in response to their customers needs for consistent uptime demand for natural gas fueled generators was particularly strong during the quarter and for the full year while diesel gensets remain the dominant choice for c i backup power globally natural gas generators continues to gain acceptance as a substitute due to their economic and operational advantages in addition to the growth experienced domestically in the fourth quarter and for the full year our international business also saw a strong growth in mainland europe latin america australia brazil and china adjusted ebitda margins for the full year for our international segment continued to expand with improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes being the biggest contributor to the improvement we re also seeing success with the introduction of our gaseous fuel products into markets outside the u s and canada with both residential and c i products experiencing impressive growth rates during the year albeit off a small base advertisement advertisement we achieved a number of significant milestones in 2018 that we believe are important to the execution of our strategy in may we launched the latest version of our flagship home standby generator product line with wi fi connectivity as a standard feature as an industry first we believe that the ability for a consumer or a dealer to remotely monitor a generator is a great first step toward enhancing the customer experience as well as enabling a deeper relationship with both end users and distribution partners with this new functionality we have also introduced a new software platform known as fleet specifically for our dealers that allows them to track the status of every single one of their customers generators by providing real time information about the status of each machine as well as dramatically enhancing the level of diagnostic information available we believe the dealers will be able to better track and schedule needed repairs or maintenance and we ll be able to do so with greater precision and speed with the outcome being to maximize the uptime of generators under their care we also believe that the connectivity layers we are building and now deploying could have an important impact on other future opportunities by creating a gateway to the electrical system of a home or business the market for certain services related to energy monitoring and management is rapidly developing and we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in electronics and electrical systems our broad distribution our global footprint and our brand to participate in this exciting new space in 2018 we also expanded our position as the largest global manufacturer of gaseous fuel backup generators with the introduction of a 750 kilowatt machine the largest output unit in our lineup we are very pleased with the initial acceptance of the product as interest has been strong since its release mid year the substitution of natural gas power gensets for traditional diesel fuel products has accelerated in recent years as the performance of newer gas machines equals or exceeds that of diesel generators while providing some tangible benefits for the end user by mitigating the need for fuel delivery lower overall operating costs and cleaner emissions advertisement advertisement a core component of generac strategy is to build on its leadership position in the market for natural gas gensets and throughout 2018 we introduced a number of new products new programs and innovative technologies related to gaseous generators during the year 2018 was also a record year for sales volumes outside the u s and canada for generac with 22 of our overall revenues being generated primarily through our pramac ottomotores tower light and motortech entities building on our success in globalizing the company we closed on the acquisition of a mexican genset company selmec in june of last year recall that selmec is located in mexico city and is a designer and manufacturer of commercial and industrial generators serving latin america with a particular focus on the telecommunications market and strong service capabilities the integration of selmec with our existing ottomotores operations is well under way with the latest milestone achieved earlier this month as we opened a new headquarters facility in mexico city to consolidate our commercial and administrative teams into a single location further integration activities are planned for 2019 as we look to realize the synergies of combining the systems and production activities of the two businesses in addition in early 2019 pramac acquired a majority share of captiva energy solutions captiva founded in 2010 and headquartered in kolkata india specializes in customized industrial generators while relatively small in size this acquisition gives us a physical presence in the important indian backup power generation market and provides a platform to execute on the potential revenue and sourcing synergies that exist by integrating the captiva operation into the broader pramac business advertisement advertisement finally i d like to spend a minute this morning to tell you about some exciting enhancements we re making to our long term strategy that we call powering ahead over the last 10 years we have used powering ahead as our blueprint for making investments and prioritizing our resources in that time we ve effectively more than tripled the revenues of generac while simultaneously quadrupling our served markets as our business evolves from being a smaller more narrowly focused company to that of a larger globally focused leader in the power products industry we believe that our strategy must also evolve last year you may recall that we added the strategic pillar of lead gas to powering ahead as we believe that our continued leadership in gaseous fuel generator technology has a critical element of our future growth and focus as we continue to think about other areas of our business and the markets that we serve that present significant opportunities for us we can see the connectivity in the technologies and markets associated with the internet of things will play a vital role in the way we interact with customers and distribution partners well into the future the ability to connect will have a profound impact on the way we develop new products the way we think about our customer service models the opportunities to better monetize our products over their entire lifecycle and the exciting prospects around potentially creating entirely new business models around energy monitoring and energy management as a result we re adding a new pillar to our strategic plan simply called connect and we are updating the name of our enterprisewide strategy to be called powering our future as we have done for the last 10 years we intend to continue to prioritize our resources and our efforts around our strategic plan with powering our future the four strategic objectives we have established of growing the residential generator market globally gaining share in our existing markets leading in gaseous generator technologies and using connectivity to develop new opportunities with our customers and distribution partners will guide our focus and investments for the future i d now like to turn the call over to york to provide further details on the fourth quarter results york advertisement advertisement york ragen chief financial officer thanks aaron before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail recall that effective january 1 2018 generac adopted the new gaap revenue recognition accounting standard for comparability purposes the full retrospective method was elected under the standard which requires application to all periods presented although the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements so the prior year 2017 figures that we are discussing this morning have been adjusted accordingly in addition upon finalizing our revenue recognition accounting under the new standard we made certain immaterial prior quarter reclassifications to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to extended warranties there was no impact on income from operations or net income as a result of these prior quarter reclassifications see our press release for more information related to these prior quarter reclassifications now looking at our fourth quarter 2018 results in more detail net sales for the quarter increased 14 3 to 563 4 million as compared to 493 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the 13 3 million of contribution from the june 1 2018 selmec acquisition and the slightly negative impact from foreign currency core growth rate during the quarter was approximately 12 advertisement advertisement looking at consolidated net sales by product class residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 10 3 to 293 9 million as compared to 266 6 million in the prior year quarter despite the fact that the prior quarter included the immediate after effects of hurricanes harvey irma and maria the current year quarter still experienced very strong growth in shipments of home standby generators as end market demand for these products continues to be robust the elevated frequency and duration of power outages in recent years coupled with our initiatives to drive adoption of automatic home standby generators on an everyday basis has helped to make the category more mainstream in the marketplace resulting in record shipments of home standby generators during the current year fourth quarter switching to portable generators the prior year fourth quarter included the impact of hurricane maria and significant replenishment of portable generators with our retail partners on the back of the active hurricane season last year as a result shipments of portable generators while still strong were down in the current year fourth quarter versus prior year looking at our commercial and industrial products net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 17 5 to 223 2 million as compared to 189 9 million in the prior year quarter with core growth being approximately 15 when excluding the m a contribution from selmec and unfavorable foreign currency impacts domestically as aaron mentioned we are seeing very strong growth in the telecom market a certain of our national telecom customers are in the middle of a large investment cycle for backup power equipment to harden their cell tower networks in addition demand for our mobile c i products continues to be strong as our rental account customers both nationals and independents continue to replace their support equipment fleets for general rental and oil and gas purposes advertisement advertisement finally shipments and order rates from our industrial distributors continue to be very strong during the current year quarter in particular for natural gas fuel generators as the strong economic environment and the low natural gas prices are driving significant investment in non residential construction and the adoption of natural gas as a cost effective fuel source for backup power internationally our pramac tower light and motortech businesses grew modestly during the quarter despite headwinds from the weakening euro as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe particularly in mainland europe australia brazil and china in latin america we also saw modest shipment growth for the quarter even with the certain geopolitical headwinds that are impacting that region as we continue to make progress on the ottomotores and selmec integration and execute on synergies between the two companies net sales for the other products category primarily made up of service parts and extended warranty deferred revenue amortization increased 26 5 to 46 3 million as compared to 36 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 with core growth of approximately 13 this strong core growth rate tracks with the rest of our business as the installed base of our products has expanded around the globe and replacement part demand increased due to the elevated power outage activity in recent quarters higher amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue also drove this increase gross profit margin was 36 3 compared to 37 1 in the prior year fourth quarter a modestly favorable sales mix shift toward higher margin on standby generator sales and price increases implemented since prior year were more than offset by higher logistics and labor costs as well as the realization of unfavorable commodity and currency fluctuations relative to prior year levels operating expenses increased 7 9 million or 9 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as a percentage of net sales operating expenses excluding intangible amortization declined 30 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes the increase in operating expense dollars over the prior year was primarily driven by incremental variable opex on the strong sales volumes an increase in employee costs including long term incentive compensation recorded during the current year quarter and additional recurring operating expenses from the selmec acquisition these increases were partially offset by lower warranty and intangible amortization expenses adjusted ebitda attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was 123 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 109 9 million in the same period last year adjusted ebitda margin before deducting for non controlling interests was 22 4 in the quarter as compared to 22 8 in the prior year this 40 basis point decline compared to prior year was mostly due to the previously mentioned higher input cost that impacted gross margins offset by improved operating leverage on the organic increase in sales for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda before deducting for non controlling interests came in at 424 6 million resulting in a 21 margin and an impressive 34 increase over prior year i will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments domestic segment sales increased 14 3 to 437 8 million as compared to 382 9 million in the prior year quarter as i previously discussed strong broad based end market demand driven by higher power outages severity and favorable economic conditions drove increased shipments across our residential and c i products in the current year fourth quarter adjusted ebitda for the segment during the quarter was 115 5 million or 26 4 of net sales as compared to 101 9 million in the prior year or 26 6 of net sales for the full year 2018 domestic segment sales increased 21 over the prior year while adjusted ebitda margins increased 230 basis points international segment sales increased 14 to 125 6 million as compared to 110 2 million in the prior year quarter including 13 3 million of contribution from the selmec acquisition and a foreign currency headwind of approximately 4 core sales growth was approximately 6 when you exclude both selmec and currency impacts as i previously discussed this overall core growth compared to the prior year was due to broad based growth across our international subsidiaries as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe note that we were still able to execute relatively strong year over year core growth in the international segment despite the prior year benefiting from larger project activity across certain of pramac s global sales branches adjusted ebitda for the segment during the quarter before deducting for non controlling interest was 10 6 million or 8 4 of net sales as compared to 10 5 million or 9 6 of net sales in the prior year higher margin larger project activity in the prior year quarter and higher input costs drove the year over year decline for the full year 2018 international segment sales increased 17 9 over the prior year with core sales growth of approximately 13 adjusted ebitda margins for the segment before deducting for non controlling interests increased to 8 1 of net sales during 2018 compared to 7 2 of net sales in the prior year we believe we are on track with our strategic plans to reach double digit adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment in the coming years now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2018 on a consolidated basis gaap net income for the company for the quarter was 75 6 billion as compared to 80 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the prior year net income includes the impact of 28 4 million of non cash gains largely from the revaluation of the company s net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the tax reform act as a result gaap income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2017 were only 2 million when excluding the aforementioned gain gaap income taxes in q4 2017 would have been 30 4 million or an effective tax rate of 36 1 on an adjusted basis this compares to gaap income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2018 of 20 million or an effective tax rate of 20 7 the large year over year decline in the gaap tax rate on an adjusted basis is primarily due to the enactment of the tax reform act which resulted in lower federal tax rates in the united states in addition a favorable provision to return adjustment was recorded in the current year fourth quarter related to the finalization of our 2017 federal and state income tax returns diluted net income per share for the company on a gaap basis was 1 20 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 1 29 in the prior year with the prior year earnings impacted by the aforementioned 28 4 million non cash gain related to the tax reform act or 0 45 per share the specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was 88 1 million in the current year quarter or 1 42 per share versus 87 1 million in the prior year or 1 39 per share the strong sales growth and related improvement in operating earnings just discussed were mostly offset by higher cash income taxes during the quarter with regards to cash income taxes the fourth quarter of 2018 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of 15 4 million as compared to 6 million in the prior year quarter the current year reflects the cash income tax rate of 15 for the full year 2018 with the prior year fourth quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 12 5 for the full year 2017 higher pre tax earnings in 2018 in excess of our tax yield coupled with the fact that 2017 benefited from certain incremental tax deductions that were accelerated into the 2017 tax return resulted in a higher cash tax rate in 2018 cash flow from operations was 108 2 million as compared to 136 7 million in the prior year fourth quarter and free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was 87 3 million as compared to 121 8 million in the same quarter last year higher operating earnings were more than offset by increased working capital investment due to the strong organic growth incremental inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes and higher capital expenditure levels free cash flow for the full year 2018 was 204 million as compared to 228 million for 2017 during the current year quarter we also made a voluntary 50 million payment on our abl revolving credit facility paying off the entire outstanding balance as of december 31 2018 with cash on hand as of december 31 2018 we had a total of 924 million of outstanding debt net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2 2 times on an as reported basis a healthy decline for the 3 0 times at the end of 2017 given our strong earnings and cash flow generation we ve demonstrated the rapid deleveraging capabilities of the company additionally at the end of the year we had 224 million of cash on hand and there was approximately 277 million available on our abl revolving credit facility both our term loan and abl now mature in the year 2023 uses of cash during 2018 included 48 million for capital expenditures 65 million for m a 24 million for the repayment of debt and approximately 26 million for stock repurchases with that i d now like to turn the call back over to aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2019 aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks york as we have previously discussed this morning end market demand for our products has continued to be strong as we enter 2019 as such we expect net sales in the first half of the year to grow approximately 10 to 12 on an as reported basis and 8 to 10 on a core basis with higher growth rates in the first quarter compared to the second quarter this assumes an average baseline level of power outages during the period looking at the second half of 2019 net sales could range from low single digit declines to low single digit increases depending on the severity of power outages during the year the low end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment while the high end of the range would assume more elevated outage activity which could include a major power outage event during the year overall for the year given these assumptions net sales are expected to increase between 3 to 7 compared to the prior year on an as reported basis and 2 to 6 on a core growth basis net income margins before deducting for non controlling interests are expected to be between 11 to 12 for the full year 2019 with adjusted ebitda margins also before deducting for non controlling interest expected to be between 20 to 21 for the year the low end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment and the high end of the range would assume more elevated power outage conditions furthermore mix operating leverage and our level of promotion and marketing spend will all vary depending on the severity of power outages during the year 2019 margins are also expected to be impacted by a number of other factors realization of higher input costs coming into the year along with the impact of regulatory tariffs are expected to be largely offset by price increases favorable trends with respect to commodities currencies and logistics costs and benefits from our profitability enhancement program throughout the year consistent with historical seasonality we expect adjusted ebitda margins in the second half of the year to be higher relative to the first half with the sequential improvement being approximately 350 basis points to 500 basis points depending on the power outage environment experienced during the year this 2019 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long term strategic priorities and now i d like to turn the call back over to york to walk through some additional guidance details for 2019 york york ragen chief financial officer thanks aaron for 2019 our gaap effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 25 to 27 as compared to the 22 5 full year rate for 2018 based on our guidance provided for 2019 our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately 52 million to 60 million depending on the outage environment which translates into an an anticipated full year 2019 cash income tax rate of approximately 17 to 18 that compares to the 15 cash income tax rate for full year 2018 the expected increase in our gaap and cash tax rates compared to 2018 relates to certain favorable deductions that were accelerated and reflected in the 2018 rates in response to the tax reform act that aren t expected to repeat in 2019 as a reminder we still have a favorable tax shield as a result of a significant intangible amortization deduction in our corporate tax return that results in our cash income tax rate being notably lower than our gaap income tax rate with the passage of the tax reform act the tax affected annual value of this tax shield is expected to be approximately 30 million per year and expires fully in 2021 in 2019 we expect interest expense to be approximately 41 million to 42 million assuming no additional principal payments during the year and one expected rate increase in 2019 our capital expenditures for 2019 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity and our forecast to be approximately 2 5 of our forecasted net sales for the year depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately 30 million in 2019 given our assumed capex guidance gaap intangible amortization expenses in 2019 is expected to be similar to 2018 levels at approximately 21 million to 22 million during the year stock compensation expense is also expected to be similar to 2018 at 14 million to 15 million per year for full year 2019 operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be over 90 in 2019 this concludes our prepared remarks at this time we d like to open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from ross gilardi of merrill lynch you may proceed with your question ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst yeah thanks good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning ross york ragen chief financial officer good morning ross ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst hey aaron i was wondering if you could kick it off just talking a little bit more about your balance sheet i mean at the midpoint of your guidance for ebitda and free cash flow and i think your net debt to ebitda is going to be like 1 1 times by the end of 19 if you hit the numbers i mean usually the i think the lowest since the ipo so what s the plan i mean obviously you had a lot of options like how are you thinking about dividends buybacks versus m a aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah i think ross it s a great question and one that obviously internally as a company we given the position we re in and given that the prospects for the company going forward there s we look at that and we say ok how can we best create an environment for our not only our future growth here at the company but obviously for our shareholders and all stakeholders and that s a there s a number of things you can do and we step through priority uses of cash every time and we ve been very consistent even since the ipo on that and the first thing we want to do is grow continue to grow organically and now thankfully it doesn t take a tremendous amount of capital to do that so we re pretty efficient that way but that being said we do have there is a number of capex things that we continue to look at in terms of scaling the company right through some capacity expansion things that we re focused on this year you ll notice the capex guide that we gave here this morning is a little bit higher than maybe historically we ve been around the 2 of net sales this morning closer to 2 5 and there is some capacity type of expansion things in there you can imagine growing we grew 15 year before 20 last year and when you do that there s a lot of things that you need to do to get your capacity up so that s one thing beyond that we ve said that there are some very interesting things to accelerate our strategy through acquisitions through m a activity and we ve done 12 acquisitions over the last six or seven years and we have a pipeline that would indicate that additional acquisition activity in the future is something that could happen if we find the right asset at the right price that fits our strategy and we think it can accelerate things and help us grow that s certainly something where we re looking to and there s the universe of potential acquisition targets for us is it s pretty big there s a lot of things i think we could do there not only from an international standpoint where some of things have been focused like the selmec acquisition last year and the captiva acquisition announced earlier this year but also i think around some of these other potential business models and other opportunities we ve been talking about that i mentioned in my prepared remarks after you step through those things then you start talking about return of capital to shareholders and you can do that in a number of different ways we ve done some special dividends in the past i think we ve done some buybacks in the past both of those are vehicles to do that paying down debt i think we look at that and we ve got a really cost effective liability structure it doesn t mature until 2023 we really think we ve got it we wouldn t get a great return honestly from taking out a lot of debt so we think putting the capital to work or returning it to shareholders is a better is a better way to go but we ll evaluate those priorities as we kind of have in the past and we ll have to we ll have to figure out where we go from here but we i really like the set up we ve got a lot of we ve got a lot of dry powder here and we ve got a lot of cool things that we re looking at that i m pretty excited about ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst okay so you mentioned regular quarterly dividend i mean does that still feel like something and you re not that interested in doing and then obviously you have inaudible specials in the past aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah i would say that s about a quarterly dividend i mean it s something we ve talked about we ve discussed dividends and that s certainly one possibility but i think at this stage the way i think about the company as a growth company the kind of growth we ve experienced here i think of regular dividend i don t know that we re in the right part of the cycle yet to be thinking about that and there are far too many opportunities for us to i think get a to continue to grow the company and get an overall longer term better return with investing in whether again whether it s organic or whether it s through m a activity i just see too many potential areas where we can invest and use that capital for the benefit of all of our stakeholders and so i m just i m not ready to say that we don t have enough opportunities there and i think that we ve been we ve been pretty clear on this point since our ipo and maybe there is a point in the cycle where that s going to make sense and we ll talk about that as a board but today i m just too excited about the future to say we should be thinking about deploying our capital that way versus through growth ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst okay and then just last inaudible topic and then i ll hand it over this captiva transaction with pramac i mean can you talk a little bit more about the mechanics of that and aaron you seem sort of interested in the indian market for a long time and this gives you a foot in the door i mean do you potentially use this to create a much bigger platform in a market like india or is this at this point we think of it as kind of exploratory learn about the market and just sort of see what happens for the next three to five years aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question ross and we kind of look at it as a giving us a toehold in a part of the world in india that we haven t really had any operations we ve done some sourcing there but really no commercial activity and it s a huge generator market there s a couple of markets like that around the world where we think we need to participate and there we could have went in could have kind of pushed all the chips into the middle and gone all in with a much larger acquisition if we wanted to go that route but i think given our limited knowledge of the market we felt it better to try this first and if it works i think it could be a springboard for something bigger i think we re looking at it from this standpoint there is as we ve been talking in our prepared remarks this morning the substitution of natural gas generators for diesel gensets is something that s been going on for the last 20 or 30 years here in the united states we re starting to see that pattern repeat in other parts of the world india eventually we ll do that as well the economics of natural gas infrastructure and the usage of natural gas for heating and cooking and other baseload power needs and things of that nature the economic arguments are far too compelling in favor of natural gas got a lower emissions profiles and many of the fuels that are burned in many other parts of the world and we re going to need natural gas for a long time for baseload power production everywhere in the world india is starting to realize this and they ve got a lot of projects on the drawing board for natural gas pipeline infrastructure as that infrastructure gets deployed the opportunity to connect a backup power system like a generator to that pipeline becomes a reality and we think that being there and having a footprint in india to begin to push on that is an important part of our overall lead gas strategic pillar and so that s really where we re we want to start out in india it could be bigger for us long term but i think it s a way for us to cut our teeth there ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst got it thanks very much aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer you bet operator thank you and our next question comes from charley brady of suntrust robinson you may proceed with your question charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey guys thanks good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning charley york ragen chief financial officer good morning charley charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i was wondering obviously on the m a this new powering our future and inaudible you re kind of adding in there i m wondering does that add sort of an additional pipeline to m a and can you maybe talk about what would be potential ideas of you branching out beyond we were at into that area aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s it s a great question charley anytime we only made a few adjustments to strategy over the last 10 years and any time you do that you have to evaluate again we use m a to help us accelerate our strategy so and i think we ve been very consistent on that point and as we add this new pillar of connect to our strategy and kind of rebranding the strategy powering our future absolutely the m a funnel now is starting to fill up with different ideas some of them technology oriented some of them when you talk about other kind of monitoring type of opportunities it s actually for our business development teams here and our corporate development teams it s been interesting because we ve we find that we ve had to kind of interface with different parties and different people than we ve been traditionally doing in the kind of i ll call it traditional equipment spaces right so many of these business models are more around services the business models can be very as i ve mentioned before technology oriented we re not ready to discuss details about the pipeline itself but i think what you re going to see from us over the next several years is interesting and again this is what i ve been at i ve been here a long time 25 years and i can t remember a time i ve been more excited about the future of the company and what s going on in the industry i think the utilities the energy markets there is going to be a tremendous amount of change coming in the next decade the next 10 years is going to present just some amazing changes to all of that and we think we should have an opportunity to participate in how that market develops i don t know that anybody knows exactly how it s going to develop or what s going to what s going to happen but people have ideas i think that the traditional model of delivering power by utility to your home or your business so i think that s going to change radically here in the next few years and whether that s because of the addition of renewables or storage or decentralization of the grid and on site power generation distributed generation there s a lot of different formats that this is going to take but i think that the focus that we have on natural gas gensets and the focus that we re now putting on connectivity i think a really important parts of putting ourselves in the middle of many of those conversations down the line charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst great that s good color and just i don t know if i missed it but do you talking about the florida nursing home assisted living facility situation swing on there with providing the generators is that bleeding into 2019 as you kind of alluded to in prior calls aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah there was about a third of the facilities in florida that were granted waivers for the end of the year deadline to get a backup power system in place and so that will undoubtedly lead to some spillover here into 2019 the first half most likely in each of those waivers a little different depending on the situation in the size of the facility but it s been nice florida has been a great market as you can imagine not only for the residential markets that we serve but also in the c i space and not just for healthcare i mean we ve seen a marked increase in a number of other kind of commercial and industrial type applications for backup power there as you know it was a state that went up what 10 11 years without any kind of this major disruptions in the grid there and then we ve had a number of different things happen in the last few years so it s back on the radar screen florida is doing well and there will be some spillover i don t think it s going to be it s not to be major but our guidance does contemplate some amount of spillover charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right thanks and just one more for me on the price cost you talked about i guess neutralizing that but i m just trying to get a little more color on or can you put through price increases obviously and particularly on the home standby market development but pricing is a sensitive issue to that whole dynamic of the growth there are you going to be fully neutral for the year and is a ramp or are you fully neutral now today thanks york ragen chief financial officer charley this is york so yeah i think there are input cost headwinds and it s and it s not just tariffs that we re talking we re inaudible the realization of just higher steel costs and aluminum and copper and logistics costs have really spiked up in q4 labor cost the realization of all higher costs are going to spill into the front half of 2019 so you re probably going to have some headwinds on the price cost side in the front half of 2019 but what we see though is today as those input costs are starting to moderate if you look at steel copper aluminum and if you look at our currencies with the euro and rmb and then logistics cost we see moderating and then you layer on the price increases relative to the tariff situation and then also combined that with all of these profitability enhancement initiatives that we have collectively we think that s going to flip around in the back half of the 19 to neutralize that fully for the full year so we are cognizant on the price increase side of relative to home standby and price elasticity but i think with relative to tariffs that s just something that the market will bear should show the tariffs come to fruition are at least at the 25 level on march 1 charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from jerry revich from goldman sachs you may proceed with your question jerry revich goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everyone york ragen chief financial officer jerry good morning jerry revich goldman sachs analyst you folks have really focused on the analytics and one interesting element that i m wondering if you could talk about is if you re starting to see in your residential standby business any replacement demand of units that were installed 15 to 20 years ago just to give us a sense for what the replacement market could look like once we get to the sweet spot of the units that were installed in the call it mid 2000s plus when the business really start to ramp for you any analytics that you could share with us in terms of the contribution from replacement or the ramp in replacements at all for that part of business would be helpful york ragen chief financial officer yeah jerry it s we haven t talked about it much because the market is only 20 25 years old it is interesting i mean we do track all that information and it s a very reliable steady march up in terms of the percentage of products that we sell today that go into a replacement as a replacement and so today we re sitting at about 5 6 of our volume there on the residential side is for replacement but i think you may have hit an interesting nail on the head there which is there are because of the nature of the way that market has grown there s faster points in the penetration curve that have happened over the last 10 to 20 years and when you hit one of those patches and you hit that kind of replacement cycle you should see this similar kind of offset in increase in the replacement cycle in terms of that growth and we re seeing that so as an example with florida again it was 10 11 years ago but there was prior to that there were some pretty interesting up cycles around katrina back in 2005 you had the big power outages in northeast in 2003 we re starting to get into those kind of time frames a generator should last you between 15 to 20 years if well cared for so like it s typical like a typical piece of your homes infrastructure like an hvac system something like that very similar but we do see that it s starting to show up and we re kind of excited about that long term because as we build this market out now we ve got our installed base is well over a 1 5 million machines actually getting closer to 2 million here there s a nice opportunity there longer term for replacement jerry revich goldman sachs analyst i appreciate the disclosures and you mentioned really the 6 000 dealer network now can you just talk about your efforts to continue to drive high engagement in some of the newer dealers where after the post storm enthusiasm might potentially fade as you laid out call it into the back half of 19 what are you folks doing to drive continued engagement to make sure those 6 000 dot some of the newer ones stay green for you aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s a challenge every time right because you add dealers they generally come on board as the market is market demand cycle is higher and then when demand relaxes you ve got it effectively train the dealers on how to market and many of these dealers are in the electrical trades or hvac trades and marketing maybe for an electrician doesn t come as kind of a standard part of your business practices right so it s a new skill set that has to be learned and we have a progression for dealer there is there we do a lot of training i think one of the things that is just an amazing part of this business and i don t know that whether it s investors or others that maybe don t get it is that distribution that we ve built that 6 000 dealers we ve built that over 20 years and we have poured countless dollars time blood sweat and tears into building that out and to making these dealers our representatives out in the market for a new product category like home standby generators and that just takes we burn a lot of calories it s an ongoing effort you can t relax at all you have to constantly be coming up with new programs i would say that one element of that we talked about this in our prepared remarks but with our connectivity initiatives now this new platform that we re introducing called fleet the software platform that our team has been working on here we just rolled that out we had our annual dealer conference a couple weeks ago in las vegas 2 500 people there it was a massive event and we talk about new programs fleet being one of them but fleet is you can kind of think of that as a obviously it by its name you can see all of the generators under a dealer s care right there they re customers products but and then can get a lot of diagnostic information things like that but the way we think about fleet longer term is a really important way to engage with dealers it could potentially be a totally different platform any of these dealers there their erp system is a spiral notebook on the dashboard of their van or truck and you could think of fleet as being a potential platform for dispatch for billing for other things that we could inventory control things of that nature we see it as a really interesting way to interact with our dealers on a go forward basis so it s things like that help us keep the engagement up even after the initial surge of excitement and demand passes after an event jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay yeah thank you i appreciate the discussion aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks jerry operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff hammond from keybanc capital please proceed with your question jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst hey good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning jeff york ragen chief financial officer good morning jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst so just on the 2 to 6 core is there anyway to parse it out between commercial and residential york ragen chief financial officer yeah so if you the 2 to 6 core is collective so on the c i business i think our prepared remarks talked about the strong end market demand we re seeing both domestically and internationally there is a number of verticals that are turned on and we see those continuing that strong demand into 2019 and pretty consistent throughout the year so for c i purposes we re seeing that high single digit low double digit growth really consistently throughout the year at least that s our what our guide shows and it s really consistent across domestic and international so i think the theme there is broad based strong demand for c i on the resi side what that would mean is probably flat to down slightly the down slightly is mainly due to headwinds with regards to portables so still seeing resi flat to slightly down with portables being the headwind there for the full year jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst okay and then does that inform some of the margin dynamic where commercial would be lower mix york ragen chief financial officer yeah yeah so on if you look at i talked a little bit about price cost on the mix side that probably be there would be a slight negative mix hit on the margin side relative to from 19 from 18 to 19 jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst okay and then last question inventories moved up quite a bit and was a big drag on working capital can you just speak to how much of that is some of this pre buy ahead of tariffs what does your finished good inventory look like and then just separately how you re feeling about channel inventories thanks york ragen chief financial officer yeah so i mean the way i think about inventory levels because they did increase during the year so when you think about portable generators so last year at this time we had just lived through hurricanes harvey irma and maria our inventory portable inventory level was wiped out there so throughout 2018 here we ve actually been investing in replenishment in our warehouses of our portable inventory level so just sort of every day portable replenishment thing with that way on the tariff side so we saw as we were entering the year there was the threat of tariffs going to 25 from 10 to 25 relative to chinese imported goods on january 1 so as a management team we said look we to be smart to bring in some extra components on the across the board across our product lines those impacted by that could be impacted by those tariffs and we decided to invest in pre buy of that inventory prior to that potential tariff change and then the third piece of the puzzle is really just our strong 20 growth we re going to be just investing in more inventory to facilitate our growth so i think that maybe one third one third one third when you think of those categories that are driving that inventory increase on the field inventory side on the portable side i think we re field inventory stocked ready to go ready for a storm on the home stand by side i think it s actually seasonally appropriate seasonally consistent with where we should be very manageable where we re at this point of the curve coming into 2019 so we re feeling ok on where our field inventories are for home stand by jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst okay thanks guys york ragen chief financial officer thanks aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks jeff operator thank you and our next question comes from mike halloran from baird you may proceed with your question michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning mike york ragen chief financial officer good morning mike michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst so first just clarify on the guidance to make sure i m thinking about it right in terms of assumptions on outage activity but thinking about the first half it feels like you re essentially saying momentum for the back half of 18 plus an average underlying outage environment and then when you think about the back half of the year it s in the average underlying environment and then the range of outcomes is based on nominal larger opportunities versus the high end being more significant opportunities is that how you guys are breaking that out front half to back aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah that s exactly it mike michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst okay perfect and then regional variances obviously you said southeast northeast are doing very well on the areas that aren t seeing as much impact from the larger scale things over the last couple of years maybe track how awareness is in those areas and what growth looks like dealer distribution penetration and things like that aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yes so i mean it s a it is interesting because you see this oscillation that ll happen where you get events like we had down in the southeast and we had the the nor easters that were in the beginning of 2018 or in march 2018 the consecutive nor easters that have been i think kind of turning the northeast to up has been if you think the u s is a heat map it s actually very interesting we watch just even all the way down to the individual states but even even actually more granular than that of course but it is interesting that midwest was a really good market for us a year ago and this year there were quite a few storms and events in michigan in ohio illinois and that didn t repeat this year to the same level and so that cooled off as an example but it is interesting because what s going like if you look at it right now today there s actually quite a bit more activity out west so the west and the north west the recency of a lot of the storms that are going on out there i was just i was looking at outages this morning we track them everywhere and there was a 130 000 people in california without power this morning from the latest event that was rolling through and so that s just one state one area and yeah very predictably and we now have as you can imagine from a data perspective we have a fair amount of data and there is a fair level of predictability around some of this that we could say reliably at this point over the next 12 months in california we re going to have it s going to be it s going to be the growth rate will be better than its been same will happen in northwest as well so but it s it does move puerto rico was really hot couple years ago now now it s not i mean there s it s it really does cycle and oscillate but it s interesting that that being said they grow these this is a step function growth that we ve talked about you get to this baseline level of growth that you kind of grow rapidly and then it tops out at a kind of a baseline level or bottoms out if you want to call it that and then it stays there but it s materially higher than where it was prior to the event and then you get another event successively after that and it grows again and so it s really quite amazing for mathematically speaking how you can start to model that out michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst now makes sense and then i know it s early days just customer and dealer receptivity to the connectivity solution as you re putting it out there and then thoughts on that resi versus the c i side and now implementation could phase variably between the two areas aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah no it s a good question right now a good chunk of our focus has been on the residential side so i ll start there receptivity has been good we you don t have a the challenge in that if there is a challenge is like anything we roll out to our distribution partners is there is an adoption rate right they have to adopt that there s a learning curve i mean it s like it s not like anything else in life unlike anything else in life it s the same and again we re talking about mainly electrical contractors here they re not used to working with customers with their wi fi networks and passwords and so there is there has been a bit of learning that s going on there s a lot of learning cycles going on in the market but we have tens of thousands of units connected already in a very short period of time and the data that it s giving us is amazing it s great and the interaction level the way we re able to increase the interaction with our customers we can look at customers products we can understand what s going on we can now this is a really cool thing we can deliver over the air firmware updates to our machines so as new features get developed in the products we can deliver those features to customers so there is additional future benefit potential coming from that it also then leads right into that fleet comment i made previously it allows for our dealers to have a much better view of all of the products under their care to affect repairs a lot quicker and more accurately and that s been a really good upside the c i piece is the next piece for us and we ve got our control platforms there we ve introduced a brand new control platform on our industrial products that are that s going to roll into products here over the next 12 to 24 months as we kind of cycle through it it s a lot of product to get the new platform in we call it our power zone control platform but it s state of the art and it is it s by far and away the coolest generator control platform in the industry and it was all developed internally and again we this is i think one of the great benefits of the focus we bring to the market is we do a lot of this stuff internally and it s the same with the remote monitoring we re doing it all internally we re not leaving that to some other third party we feel that at the oem we want to have that direct conversation with our customers and our distribution partners michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst thanks for the time i appreciate it aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks mike york ragen chief financial officer thanks mike operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from chip moore of canaccord you may proceed with your question chip moore canaccord genuity analyst thanks hey guys york ragen chief financial officer hey chip chip moore canaccord genuity analyst on the 8 to 10 core in the first half can you talk a bit more on visibility i think you said it was more q1 weighted so some of the puts and takes there and then maybe just remind us on baseline outage activity expectations does the events of the past couple of years that push that up or are you thinking how do we think about that thanks york ragen chief financial officer yeah i think our prepared remarks the assumption there at least for the first half is that we re assuming just sort of long term average levels which if you actually if you do the math that would actually be lower than what we experienced in 2018 so that 8 to 10 core growth that we were talking about in the first half it actually it spreads across resi and c i relatively consistently so we re seeing strength both in resi and c i as i mentioned and then as we said in the prepared remarks q1 year given the strength that we re seeing coming into the year we expect those q1 growth rates to be higher than the second quarter so i think that was the level of commentary we were providing on that chip moore canaccord genuity analyst got it that s helpful thanks and good to hear you talking more on this new connect strategy obviously it s a robust ecosystem a lot of things you could go after can you talk about your appetite for partnerships and organic development versus the m a which you can clearly use to accelerate it thanks aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah chip it s great question the i think that again i think about my time here at the company and just all the things that we ve done over the years and i don t think i ve been more excited about the potential area of growth in a way for us to really explore some of the great things that we ve done here in terms of distribution i talked about that before the build out of distribution our brand and the position we ve gotten in the marketplace and take that in concert with our technical expertise around electrical systems and this unique opportunity that we have every one of our machines these backup generators is connected to a home or businesses electrical panel and their electrical system there are very few companies that can probably claim that space other than the panel manufacturers themselves and certainly the claim that space but i think that the opportunity there to do something with that and our distribution and our brand and this connectivity layer is really exciting so to your question about organic versus m a m a certainly can help us do some of those things faster and there may be some technical skill sets and the people in particular that we might need to be successful in that could come to us through m a but make no mistake we re putting a lot of effort organically the current system that we rolled out the fleet system the wi fi connectivity systems that act as this gateway that was all built internally we didn t partner we have a team of people here in waukesha wisconsin we re doubling the size of that team this year and it s not a small team it s a big team and we re going to double that because we believe in the future of this being a really critical part of the future and moving generac into more of a i ll call it more of a solutions based provider as opposed to just the products based company more around services these subscription models like we re already selling through our through our mobile linked subscription which is a monitoring subscription for generators the amount of potential business models and things that we could do with this are just there almost where we ve got too many things we have to prioritize what exactly we want to go after and how we want to do it but we re going to be in the middle of that conversation and i think it s going to have a profound impact on this company over the next decade chip moore canaccord genuity analyst that s great thanks a lot aaron aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks chip operator thank you and our next question comes from brian drab of william blair you may proceed with your question york ragen chief financial officer anybody home aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer we might have lost him york ragen chief financial officer he might be on mute brian drab william blair analyst that s my bad good morning york ragen chief financial officer very good hey brian how you re doing brian drab william blair analyst i was wondering why you didn t say good morning back usually they say good morning back sorry so can we just zoom back out and can you talk about did something change in terms of how you were viewing the first half of 19 where we stand today versus where we were at the on the third quarter call do you feel a little if they ve seen more demand then you would have expected in the first half slightly and what are the can you kind of rank order the factors that drove that storm activity recently et cetera aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah brian i think for sure that as we get or another 90 days plus away from that third quarter call and that has galvanized our view on the first half because we re closer to it and in fact we re almost two months into it here and we came into the year feeling good about 2019 it s playing out at this point as you indicate maybe even a little bit stronger and i think our guidance reflects that and over what we were kind of maybe talking about on the third quarter even though we weren t really giving full year guidance i think we said the next we felt pretty good about the next three to six months for sure and that definitely is how we feel about this and i think maybe more importantly what we really like is what we re seeing in the c i space c i markets for us have been have remained strong both stationary and mobile some of our large accounts in the rental markets some of our large accounts in the telecom markets we ve got some customer concentration the buying signals there and the there are kind of plans as they roll them out for the full year and there are some of these companies are public companies really kind of fit well with how we were thinking about the year playing out and so we re pleased to see that capex spending for these customers is going to continue the hardening of their networks if it s a telecom customer is going to continue and the overall c i business has just been it s felt very strong and i think that our guidance reflects how we re feeling about that and then resi of course as we said activations were just at amazing levels in q4 and what we look at in that particular business we look at the leading indicators we call them ihcs in home consultations and in home consultations have been up dramatically over the prior year prior year s run rate in the first 45 days of the year here so we re very excited about that because we think that that portends to a stronger again it s all reflected in the guidance but it portends to a pretty good first half brian drab william blair analyst got it you mentioned telecom in there too have you seen any signs of a pause there s some companies that supply into that market have said they ve seen a pause someone obviously at t is having some issues and some other issues going on in the industry aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s certainly customer specific i think the ones that where you re hearing positives and seeing positives and i think in that it is interesting how that tends to rotate from one customer to another for us one year it might be one customer is doing a lot of build out in a network and maybe another customer that was doing a lot of build out the year before has as pulled back for whatever reasons sometimes it s m a on their part sometimes there are other business factors or economic factors that drive that but we have i think we feel pretty good about remaining at some of the same levels that we saw in 2018 as it relates to telecom and it was strong in 2018 nothing at this point gives us pause now that can change as we said before but i think that the realization from all of these providers that the uptime of their networks is just absolutely critical right i mean most people are paying now by the bit and the byte that goes across those networks and so if the network is down it s not just an inconvenience for customers there s an economic impact to the to carrier as well and then you couple that with just the critical nature of the communications and things that are going on across these networks it has become a vital part of our infrastructure as a country and we re also seeing that around the world i mean we ve got some great things from a telecom perspective going on in brazil and we ve got some great things going on in mexico we ve got some really interesting possibilities going on in mainland europe around telecom and we see the opportunity to take our expertise here in the u s and telecom and extend that based on our expanded geographical footprint through all these acquisitions that was always part of the original strategy and we re starting to see some of that come to fruition brian drab william blair analyst and then thanks and the last one from me is just how far away are we from seeing maybe starting to see a material impact from the implementation of your strategy with motortech and getting more into continuous power and some of these things that you ve laid out at the analyst day and are you seeing that now or is that still coming aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer we re actually starting to see some of that brian we have in fact we have a dedicated commercial resources here now at the company that are focused on building that market out alongside motortech and alongside some of our partners in the rest of the world markets where you will see more of those applications frankly but it is really interesting because we re seeing some really neat opportunities even in places like canada time of use programs from utility providers are taking natural gas generators customers are taking natural gas generators and using them where they would have normally had a backup system anyway they re using that generator to reduce their utility bills and this is some of the things that we talked about at our investor day a year and half ago and we see that market developing but as we said at that investor day that s a long play right we know that it s going to take time to build out an important part of our future success there is continuing to roll our products and programs and the support structures needed to be successful in that market we also have to grow our brand in other parts of the world where we re quite well known here in the u s market and maybe in latin america as well but maybe not so much in other places in china or india or the african continent or even the european continent so we ve got some brand building to do some awareness to do but we like the prospects for that long term and it will be long term but we re seeing some really interesting things starting out some really good interest around that brian drab william blair analyst so is that more an international opportunity than it is a u s opportunity aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer i think initially that s probably right i think it s the u s power markets as they evolve those opportunities will become more evident here as well but i think they will become more evident in other parts of the world quicker there is a lot of factors that drive that some of it is stability of grid where you have again like in india where you have a lot of outage events and a natural gas generator because when you have a lot of outage events and a generator is going to run a lot or if you re talking 8 to 10 hours a day the input costs meaning the fuel matters and natural gas costs are roughly half the cost of diesel fuel and so that really adds into the total return of the machine and the way that a customer would view that and that has a stronger payback or roi outside the u s today than it does inside the u s that may change as the energy markets develop here but again over the longhaul but as we go out the gas market even further but that s kind of how we think it s going to play out brian drab william blair analyst okay perfect thanks a lot aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer you bet thanks brian operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would not like to turn the call back over to aaron jagdfeld for any further remarks aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks operator we want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and we look forward to reporting on our first quarter 2019 earnings results which we anticipate will be at some point in early may with that we ll leave you here today thank you very much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today s conference this does conclude today s program

will 2019 be the year of the big breakout for gold in each of the last three years gold has gotten off to a strong start only to fizzle as the year moved along will 2019 be the year gold finally breaks the pattern a good many investors fund managers and analysts think that 2019 might very well be the year when gold breaks the restraints and pushes to higher ground one of those is carter worth of cornerstone macro in new york who cnbc s melissa lee refers to as the chart master in a recent interview with lee worth referred to the long term chart below saying that there is a well defined set up and a lot of tension which he says is going to resolve to the upside a breakout to all time highs with respect to gold s relationship to the dollar worth says gold s got its own momentum now it is all setting up for higher gold prices and trouble for equities trouble for the economy the far left s next great monetary experiment mmt this mmt sounds like a recipe for immense inflation even hyperinflation says daily reckoning s bill maher you are spending all this money directly into the economy it will drive consumer prices through the attic roof you say this is crackpot a witch s sabbath of inflation would surely result yes but here the mmt crowd meets you head on they agree with you they agree mmt could cause a general inflation possibly even a hyperinflation modern monetary theory mmt is neither modern nor a theory john law the scottish financier tried a version of it exactly 300 years ago 1717 18 in france he did so with the blessing of the french monarchy and with a rationale very similar to mmt s proponents today in the end law s theories to his surprise if we are to believe the historical account bankrupted the french people and the government reduced the economy to ashes and created such a distaste for paper scrip among the citizenry that it took 80 years for france to reintroduce paper money as a circulating medium the shrewder speculators became alarmed they began to sell their shares of stock and hoard in gold the enormous wealth they had acquired this resulted in a demand on the government for metal in exchange for its paper and soon the government had no metal to give then the crash came those who had the government paper could buy nothing with it those who held the mississippi stock could scarce give it away it was worthless the government itself refused to accept its own paper for taxes a few lucky speculators had made vast fortunes but thousands of families especially among the wealthier classes were ruined edward s ellis and charles f home the story of the greatest nations 1900 please see this link for a summary of law s mississippi company land scheme funds institutions push gold etf stockpiles to the highest level in five years when this year s davos conference attendees boarded their private jets for the long ride home they left the swiss mountain resort with a sense that all is not well in the global economy and that financial markets might be in for some unpleasant times that sense of foreboding has big money led by some of the top names in the money management business paring its exposure to stock and bond markets and deploying that capital in the gold market gold etfs the favorite haunt for funds and institutions taking a stake in the gold market have started the year by adding 72 tonnes of gold to their stockpiles the influx has pushed the combined etf total to 2 513 tonnes the highest level since 2013 china builds up gold reserves in shift away from dollar as reported in the south china morning post yi gang the current central bank governor said in 2013 when he headed the state administration of foreign exchange safe that beijing was unable to diversify significantly into gold because the gold market is too small for china s us 3 trillion foreign reserves but things may start to change though it remained to be seen whether the modest gold purchases in the last two months represented a fundamental shift in china s attitude towards the precious metal analysts said i mentioned this south china morning post article in a recent daily market report but i did not pass along or comment on the portion highlighted above which may be the most interesting aspect of xin and yeung s report to give you an idea of china s dilemma with respect to gold and perhaps an inkling of just how undervalued gold is at current prices consider that all the gold ever mined according to world gold council data is worth about 7 5 trillion at a 1250 gold price china in other words could buy 40 of all the world s gold with its 3 trillion in reserves the market value of the 8 133 5 tonne u s gold reserve at 1250 per ounce is 335 billion thus china could buy america s gold reserve almost ten times over or put another way could swap its entire dollar reserves for the stockpile at 12 500 per ounce if by this time you have come to the conclusion that something is critically out of joint in this mathematical construct you are correct it is the price of gold silver forecast shortage to send silver prices soaring above 20 in 2019 surprisingly since gold and silver started their uptrend late last summer both are up the same number roughly 13 in other words silver has not outperformed gold as many thought it would at least so far that doesn t mean it won t in the future the gold silver ratio is still nearly 83 to one and still bumping along near its highs since 1970 that could all be changing now writes jason hamlin in a silver phoenix article as silver has become increasingly attractive to investors looking for undervalued asset classes or safe haven investments silver is benefiting from the persistent trade war government shutdown weakening dollar and a more dovish federal reserve venezuela s hyperinflation by the charts and numbers when a combination of currency debasement and inflation strikes an economy the effects can be sudden and severe as indicated in the two charts shown below i had to smile when i read this matter of fact summation of the situation from trading economics not that i fail to empathize with how these numbers translate to everyday life for venezuela s average citizen consumer prices in venezuela jumped 1 300 000 percent year on year in november of 2018 up from a 833 997 climb in october according to estimates from venezuela s opposition led congress inflation rate in venezuela averaged 3 268 55 percent from 1973 until 2018 reaching an all time high of 833 997 percent in october of 2018 and a record low of 3 22 percent in february of 1973 the usdveb traded at 248 520 9000 on wednesday january 23 historically the venezuelan bolivar reached an all time high of 248 520 90 in august of 2018 and a record low of 0 05 in january of 1989 it does not take a great deal of imagination to contemplate what the effects might have been on the price of gold in bolivars the charts below tell the tale of hyperinflation in venezuela charts and above commentary courtesy of tradingeconomics com gold sentiment reading on the mend climbing pretty steadily recently we touched base with sentiment trader s jason goepfert to ask about his latest reading on gold market sentiment we thought it might be a good time to check to see if there were any changes now that the price is approaching the 1300 level he graciously sent over the chart posted below along with the following comment our measure reached a point of maximum pessimism in august and has been climbing pretty steadily ever since it reached the upper end of neutral recently before falling off a bit bull markets tend to see optimism stay above 40 during the pullbacks so the next one will be interesting to watch we got the surge off of the extreme pessimism and now if it can hold above 40ish and starting bouncing again it would argue strongly that the longer term trend has changed for the better chart courtesy of sentimentrader com jason

financial expectations for 2019 and then as usual take any questions that you may have i m very pleased to say that 2018 proved to be a historic year in a long and successful history of iff as we recently celebrated our 130th year birthday we delivered on all of our key financial metrics and completed the acquisition of frutarom the largest deal in our industry to date all while successfully navigating a challenging and dynamic market environment we achieved strong advancements in both top and bottom line results in 2018 but we re in line with our guidance range that we set forth highlights include our record setting sales of approximately 4 billion which was a 17 increase over last year this performance was driven by mid single digit growth in both taste and scent as well as additional sales related to frutarom we also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of 6 28 as adjusted operating profit growth and a lower year over year fx rate more than offset higher interest expense and shares outstanding most related to the frutarom acquisition throughout 2018 we had many strategic accomplishments that drove significant value creation to highlight just a few with the acquisition of frutarom we established ourselves as a global leader in taste scent and nutrition this combination helps us create a truly differentiated portfolio with an increased focus on naturals and health and wellness it also provides us opportunities to expand into attractive and faster growing categories and broadens our complementary and growing customer base we believe this plus strong sales and cost synergies will translate into accelerated financial performance as a combined company beyond the transaction we continue to strengthen our innovation platforms by successfully commercializing three new natural taste modulators two new fragrance molecules 41 new natural fragrance ingredients and fragrance body care capsules as critical to driving future growth through the execution of our vision 2020 strategy we re truly the partner of choice as we expanded our cordless ph with key global scent customers this expanded access will help fortify our market leading position and offer significant future growth opportunities as we now can compete on incremental business opportunities we also leveraged our exposure to faster growing small and mid sized customers to drive results as tastepoint in north america continued its strong performance by growing double digits productivity continues to be paramount to our way forward as cost and productivity initiative once again contributed approximately 5 percentage points of adjusted currency neutral adjusted operating profit and currency neutral adjusted eps growth in 2018 and in terms of sustainability iff continued its global sustainability leadership as we exceeded already three out of four of our 2020 eco efficiency targets we also established our 2025 goals which focuses on emission reductions zero waste to landfill and water stewardship i m pleased that we continue to be acknowledged externally for our sustainability efforts in 2018 we were named to barron s 100 most sustainable companies an honor we received again in 2019 and we were named to the euronext vigeo world 120 index most recognizing companies for exceptional environmental social and governance performance more recently in january 2019 we were once again included on cdp s a list for climate change our fourth consecutive year and we received an a for water security for the first time naming iff as a global leader on environmental responsibility we also made tremendous progress as it relates to our integration of frutarom first and foremost we instilled an integration management office to provide visibility for all critical initiations and enhance decision making this key group of individuals the best of iff and frutarom have been instrumental in developing go forward plans and supporting the day to day execution we also refined and confirmed our plan to achieve approximately usd145 million of cost synergies by 2021 synergies are expected to come from procurement footprint optimization and streamlining of overhead expenses in addition we identified initial cross selling opportunities to drive incremental growth going forward these opportunities are expected to provide revenue synergies which we believe will further value create to the shareholders over time as we mentioned last quarter we ve already capitalized on a few quick wins we integrated frutarom s north america taste business in our north america business and we ll leverage our tastepoint go to market strategy for small and mid sized customers at the same time we combine frutarom s cosmetic active ingredients business called ibr into our lucas meyer s cosmetics business concurrently we moved all savory solution capabilities and innovation on a single leader to form frutarom global savory solutions group this will enable the group to work together in a unified direction from a global footprint standpoint we have already begun to execute the optimization of our manufacturing sites in order to realize significant cost synergies this plan has already led to closings in the uk as we consolidated our inaudible while this is the first step in the process and we have much more work to be done we are moving forward as planned lastly we are finalizing plans for next stage of taste integration like we did in north america combining like taste businesses together to build a strong platform more to be shared in due course i would like now to turn it over to rich richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you andreas i d like to now give you more in depth review of taste scent and nutrition turning to this taste business in the fourth quarter 2018 currency neutral sales grew inaudible with 3 of the 4 regions expanding year over year this performance was led by mid single digit growth in north america and greater asia all categories contributed to growth led by dairy and beverage segment profit was challenged due to higher rsa expenses and several other ongoing costs which i don t expect to be continuing in a more of a one off nature in the quarter for the full year 2018 currency neutral sales increased 5 driven by growth in all regions and across all categories improvements were led by high single digit growth in north america with strong double digit growth at tastepoint mid single digit growth in eame led by double digit growth in africa and the middle east and in latin america led by strong double digit growth in argentina taste currency neutral segment profit on a full year basis grew approximately 6 led by volume growth and the benefits from our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives in terms of segment profit margin we continue to see margin expansion improving 60 basis points to an industry leading 22 7 in the scent business fourth quarter 2018 currency neutral sales grew 3 performance was driven by mid single digit improvements in fragrance ingredients and low single digit growth in consumer fragrances fine fragrances were down slightly year over year reflecting strong double digit growth in the year ago comparison for the year 2018 currency neutral sales grew 4 with the strongest improvement coming in fragrance ingredients which grew high single digits this was led by price increases and strong double digit growth in cosmetic active ingredients consumer fragrances grew mid single digits including price as performance was driven by double digit growth in hair care and mid single digit growth in fabric care home care and toiletries all led by innovation platforms scent currency neutral segment profit decreased approximately 2 as the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to input costs reflecting unprecedented raw material inflation including the previously announced citral supply issue as well as higher manufacturing costs due to these supply chain challenges it should be noted that over the course of 2018 due to external events we continued to be impacted by incremental pressures in raw material costs our pricing as expected accelerated throughout the year and was near 3 in the fourth quarter however it was not enough to cover the cost increases as always we ll continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate the cost increases in terms of segment profit margin year over year performance was pressured however profit margins remained strong at 17 5 turning to frutarom in the fourth quarter sales totaled approximately 360 million please note and as a reminder we closed the acquisition on october 4th and the financial results for frutarom reflect the closing date and as such does not include a full quarter s activity we re pleased to report that frutarom returned to growth in the fourth quarter as like for like sales increased 3 driven by strong improvements in natural product solutions and fnf ingredients the core business which excludes trade and marketing grew 4 versus the prior year on a like for like basis in terms of segment profit the frutarom division delivered 27 million and 66 million excluding amortization the margin profile for frutarom in the fourth quarter was strong at 18 5 excluding amortization this was a strong improvement when you compare to what they reported in q4 2017 as a stand alone company in terms of cash flow operating cash flow increased 46 million or 12 to 437 million compared to 391 million in 2017 the year over year increase was driven by increased earnings depreciation and amortization and lower pension contributions offset by increased inventories core working capital was impacted by higher inventory to ensure business continuity during the supply chain challenges as well as higher raw material prices from a capital allocation standpoint we spent approximately 170 million in capital expenditures or about 4 3 of sales driven by new plant and capacity investments mainly in greater asia as we discussed in the past some of these investments include a flavors manufacturing facility in the zhangjiagang free trade zone which opened on october 9th 2018 and a natural products research lab located in the nanjing life science park which opened on october 15th 2018 the flavors plant is our second in china and is designed to supplement our existing flavors and manufacturing operations in guangzhou the naturals lab is our first outside of the us china is a critical component of our long term research strategy the opening of these new facilities will support our efforts to be a partner of choice and grow in this exciting region regarding cash returned to shareholders we paid approximately 230 million or about 50 of adjusted net income in dividend payout and 15 million on share repurchases with that i d like to turn the call back over to andreas andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich i wanted to spend a few moments to highlight our integration priorities moving forward as we enter year one of this three year journey as we spoke about earlier integrating ibr into lmc is imperative to strengthen the product offering and drive accelerated growth in cosmetic active ingredients as a reminder cosmetic active ingredients is a very high growth and high profitable sector that we have prioritized moving forward we want to ensure a seamless combination of the global savory solutions group to address customer needs by leveraging the technologies and expertise in our various categories by establishing a globally coordinated team we will support strong local presence with global expertise as we offer a full range meat ingredient provider novel flavors functionality and technical expertise and texture color oxidation plant protein and are almost to our entire customer base we will continue to consolidate the frutarom taste business under the iff taste leader as we move to capitalize on efficiencies and drive accelerated growth the plan is to leverage our strong blueprint of our tastepoint north america go to market approach to strengthen our exposure with small and mid tier customers in every market around the world in terms of synergies which i will touch more in a moment we plan to capitalize on significant make versus buy initiatives across our spend to drive strong year one cost synergies and we will continue to execute our global site rationalization for improved efficiency lastly we will broaden our cross selling activities and begin the execution on opportunities a cross functional global team has been established and is working diligently to generate incremental opportunities to capture greater value as i ve said previously i continue to believe this will provide the largest value creation opportunity in the medium to long term slide 16 provides an overview on the anticipated cost synergies in year one of our three year integration plan our integration program is well under way developing and refining the work plans to unlock these value creation opportunities as you can see we anticipate approximately 30 million to 35 million of expected savings in year one the 30 million to 35 million will come from accelerating the rationalization and harmonization of our procurement spend we will leverage higher spend on overlapping direct raw materials and rationalize we will also leverage production capabilities where we are currently buying materials or intermediates at a higher price we will also continue to rationalize the global footprint to optimize our global sites note that over time the contribution of our manufacturing rationalize will increase as it takes time to work with site closures lastly we will be streamlining overhead expenses by reducing non strategic costs and eliminating redundant expenses this will ensure that we create an organization that focuses and direct spend to the most value enhancing opportunities i would now like to turn the call back over to rich who will give us an outlook for 2019 richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks andreas over the last few years we ve seen the global operating environment continued to be volatile there are several things that have direct implications on our industry and business in 2019 that i d like to highlight a clear headwind within our industry is the continued rise of raw material costs in 2019 we expect mid single digit inflation on our legacy iff business as synthetic materials continued to rise driven by several supply chain disruptions that we have faced over the last 12 to 15 months these market disruptions continue to disproportionately impact the scent business and is more as it is more broadly exposed to these raw materials it should be noted that when you combine 2018 and 2019 raw material cost inflation in the scent division is near 20 our strategic priority is to protect our customers business which we were successful in doing in 2018 however this comes at an incremental cost this will require us to continue to work with our customers taking additional price increases as we move through 2019 to ensure that we ultimately recover these cost increases over time it should be noted that natural ingredients costs like vanilla and citrus markets remain elevated near historical levels we expect to see more muted cost increases for taste in 2019 from an economic perspective gdp growth on a global basis remains positive however many estimates were recently revised downward there continues to be geopolitical tension and uncertainties around the world with examples like trade wars and brexit all in all we are optimistic about our top line but recognize that there is risk given the constantly changing operating environment the us dollar continues to fluctuate versus the world currency as we are in generally a strong usd environment year over year the euro to usd exchange rate is the most relevant to iff so you ll see the euro to usd exchange rates stabilizing it is positive from a profitability perspective the euro represents approximately 30 of our profits including the addition of frutarom our rolling hedging program helps limit any volatility as we are currently hedged approximately 45 at an average rate of 1 21 lastly we ve seen improved global consumer staples volumes in 2018 which we expect to continue in 2019 at the same time local and regional customers continue to grow rapidly a great opportunity as this is even more prevalent to our business when incorporating 30 000 small and mid sized customers that we acquired from frutarom before reviewing full year expectations for 2019 i want to highlight a few go forward modeling assumptions first of all we will be referencing a combined 2018 result as if all aspects of the frutarom transaction were retroactive to the start of 2018 first in 2019 we expect a modest benefit from m a and yes an additional week of sales or 53rd week currency is expected to be a headwind in 2019 we expect the headwind of approximately 3 percentage points on a combined sales growth and approximately 2 percentage point on adjusted eps ex amortization we expect approximately 30 million to 35 million in cost synergies in 2019 coming from procurement operations and overhead expenses as andreas explained following successful debt raise for the frutarom acquisition our debt outstanding is about 4 4 billion and combined interest expense associated with this debt is approximately 150 million currently we are assuming an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19 for 2019 but the dynamics around this remain fluid for the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted eps on a going forward basis we estimate that there will be approximately 113 million shares outstanding including 6 3 million shares related to the tangible equity units annual amortization of intangible assets is expected to be about 190 million to 195 million down from our previous estimate given the several moving parts we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers between combined 2018 and 2019 sales in terms of sales growth we are targeting to achieve 5 2 billion to 5 3 billion in sales during 2019 representing a combined growth of 5 to 7 in the chart as you can see from second bar approximately 9 months of frutarom adds 1 1 billion to our combined 2018 sales in the third bar we ve estimated approximately 45 million of divestitures related to non core frutarom businesses in central europe and the us that takes us to a combined full year 2018 sales of 5 1 billion in the fifth bar we estimate approximately 150 million of headwinds due to currency resulting in a currency neutral combined sales number of 4 95 billion if you then use our expected 2019 growth of 5 to 7 you get our guidance of 5 2 billion to 5 3 billion in sales during 2019 we expect broad based growth across all of our segments with pricing driving scent and volumes a key component of taste and food performance moving onto a reconciliation of our 2019 adjusted eps we expect adjusted eps of 4 90 to 5 10 and adjusted eps ex amortization of 6 30 to 6 50 on the left side of the slide you can see what we ve you can see that we expect 10 to 15 of growth in 2019 for adjusted eps to get us to a range of 4 90 to 5 10 for adjusted eps ex amortization i ll walk you through the key drivers starting with the second bar in that section 2 06 will be added to our full year 2018 number representing the first nine months of frutarom on the next bar you can see that the full effect of the 4 4 billion debt issuance has a negative 0 55 impact when you add that together with the share count dilution from the equity issuance going forward from approximately 80 million before issuance to approximately 113 million shares outstanding it has approximately 1 71 share dilution impact on full year combined results combine that with approximately 0 13 related to other impacts including tax rate frutarom minority interest and lower other income and expense in 2019 it gets you to 5 95 for the combined 2018 year we expect approximately 0 12 related to currency in 2019 to bridge it to a currency neutral combined adjusted eps of 5 83 when you apply the 2019 expected growth rates of 8 to 11 our guidance for 2019 comes out to be 6 30 to 6 50 while we expect to see solid top line growth across the entire business scent profitability is being adversely impacted by the additional raw material cost inflation where pricing actions take time to achieve given the nature of our business as we move beyond 2019 we would expect to see the results to accelerate as raw materials tend to begin to trends begins to normalize and we generate the majority of integrations related in 2020 debt repayment continues to be a critical focus of ours we are committed to reaching a 3 times leverage ratio by 2020 down from our current 3 6 times our intent is to retain an investment grade rating and our management teams and centers are now aligned with the repayment repayment debt metrics with that let me turn it back over to andreas andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich that was a very complicated slide but i hope it helps as we look to the future we are reconfirming our long term targets we expect to deliver between 5 to 7 currency neutral combined sales growth cagr between 2019 and 2021 we also expect to deliver 10 plus adjusted eps ex amortization combined gross for the same period so 2019 is a first very important step in the journey and the foundation to achieve our long term targets in summary we are pleased with our financial performance for 2018 as we delivered on all of our key metrics we made strong advancement in both top and bottom line results as we recorded record setting sales and adjusted eps ex amortization we also built an organization for accelerated profitable growth combining two strong organizations to create a truly global leader in taste scent and nutrition as we look forward full year 2019 we expect sales to be between 5 2 billion to 5 3 billion adjusted eps to be between 4 90 and 5 10 and adjusted eps ex amortization in between 6 30 and 6 50 as rich said the coming together of iff and frutarom was a momentous achievement in 2018 and we are excited to be moving forward as one company and pursuing new opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders around the world and with that i would now like to open up the call to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mark astrachan from stifel your line is open mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst wanted to ask about frutarom so sales growth improved sequentially but was still below longer term expectations i guess given tough comparisons in the business prior to the deal i assume it doesn t meaningfully accelerate until 2q so maybe just verify if that s kind of what you believe and then what gives confidence that 6 remains achievable the only thing that you ve seen so far that would increase confidence in that and i guess sort of related to that any idea what shipments looked like in that business relative to demand in quarters prior to the deal close meaning like could they have over shipped demand andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer okay mark so first of all good morning let me answer the question first of all from a technical point of view we certainly have much easier comparables in the second half of the year so that s something which makes us very optimistic we are also happy that after a softer third quarter last year the fourth quarter was turning around people are again focusing on the business after we have done the close on the 4th of october we have started the integration very very well and as we said before we were happy that we could close a deal a couple of weeks ahead of our original timing and that pays off because everything is going according to plan so people can go back and focus on the customers i believe that s super important leadership is clear and we really can make sure that we see the customers and sell what makes me optimistic is that first of all we are in some of the faster growing segments which is super helpful particularly in the adjacent business you know that we are with some of the faster growing customers as well and particularly in europe and in the us and we haven t even tapped into the cross selling opportunity but we see already that our teams are generating really good ideas and having implemented a couple of pilots and that makes us pretty optimistic on the frutarom piece so all in all a very very positive picture from our point of view richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think mark from as you said i think q1 will be the most challenging from a comp standpoint a little bit better in q2 obviously q3 and the second half is andreas talked about will be we ll see the fastest acceleration i think the other thing to me is clearly north america was one of the challenged markets i think we ve done we ve put the leadership in place now there was vacancy particularly prior to the closing and i think now we are getting much much more alignment and integration between frutarom s business taste business in north america and our tastepoint business so that i think that will enable us to accelerate growth i think we ve already seen very very quickly some real opportunities in terms of where we combine our two capabilities to drive growth on projects that these two companies individually weren t able to tackle mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst got it ok so just to be clear then 6 remains the target and then i just want to switch to a separate question on free cash flow rich richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst it s diverged from net income in recent years does this normalize in your view in 2019 i think you d mentioned inventories be inflated given the supply chain challenges so does the inventory piece specifically improve and are there any other anticipated items that will impact cash generation in 19 as far as you can tell richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think to your first comment our expectations in terms of the 6 certainly are that s still our expectations for the frutarom business going forward in terms of cash flow yeah i think that in the last two years if i look at cash flow from operations compared to adjusted net income it was in the 80 to 90 range 19 was or 18 was clearly challenged by the inventories which were up 130 million something in 19 i would expect the inventory number to stabilize i don t think it s going to get better yet we re going to be challenged with the mid single digit cost increases that i alluded to on our legacy business but i think that s where we see going forward stabilization in 19 and then improvements beginning in 20 going forward overall i would expect that cash from working capital impacts in 2019 to actually be favorable versus a big outflow in 2018 and overall i would say when you take that into consideration plus the increased d a i would expect our conversion of cash from operations versus adjusted net income to be above 100 so much better than what we have been for the last two years mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst great thank you richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of faiza alwy from deutsche bank your line is open faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst to talk about the flavors business i think the organic growth of 2 in the quarter was a bit disappointing relative to what it had done in the rest of 2018 so just as you talked about your expectation for the frutarom business i d love to hear how you re thinking about your base business so flavors and fragrances it seems like you re embedding a bit of an acceleration in 2019 so if you could just break those two components out that would be helpful richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah faiza it s rich i mean i think that clearly there has been q4 was a disappointment but i think you also got to keep in mind the prior year comparable is in a very strong q3 i think that with 2020 hindsight it looks like a portion of the strong growth that we saw in q3 is some element of inventory because we see we saw a positive impact from volume erosion which was actually favorable in q3 in the taste business and it turned unfavorable in q4 so i think there s clearly an element associated with inventory adjustments and movements on the part of our customers on a two year basis growth for flavors is probably around 4 and on a full year basis growth rates for on a two year basis are probably in the 5 range so i think partly the fundamentals of our taste business haven t changed our expectations haven t changed we are clearly seeing particularly in the fourth quarter some volume erosion and lower volumes with global customers large cpgs it s hard to say right now whether that s again a continuation of inventory correction but i think overall our expectations are going forward have not changed significantly i think it s still going to be a challenging year but the potential of the business hasn t changed andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer and on the fragrance side we can say we are winning good businesses we had for the fine fragrance business a very tough comparison for the fourth quarter but looking forward in particular if you look at the win rates we have in house already we re very optimistic on the fine fragrance business i think for for the fragrance and scent business it is not too much about the let s say the growth rate in terms of sales and the win rate i think we re doing extremely well here it s more about managing the raw material crisis making sure that we can realize our price and what makes us super optimistic on it is that that we have won three more global inaudible we never had we didn t have before and that gives us just a more expanded reach of our business opportunities whether we can big times already capitalize in 19 i m not sure because it takes a little bit of time but on the mid term i m very optimistic on this one because these were significant wins the team brought in end of last year faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay so andreas you mentioned managing the pricing amid this raw material inflation like what is sort of what is embedded in your outlook for 19 for pricing and how much of that pricing have you already taken and how much do you have to go back to your global customers and try to get that pricing richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean faiza that process is already under way i think when you look at the guidance and our expectations excuse me for 2019 it s about a point and a half of pricing and all in the scent business and that process is already under way i think it s it s the same thing if i rewind button it s a tough discussion but nicolas teams have done an they understand the importance our customers understand that we work through the normal mechanisms of price and other activities to do that i think we did an excellent job in 2018 and our price realization was in line with our expectations what was the surprise was the cost impact as we progressed through the year continued to increase and accelerate so i m confident in the medium and long term that we re going to recover the price increases but 19 is going to be another challenging year andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer and actually if you compare ourselves to one of our bigger competitors then you see that the erosion of the ebitda margin was actually less so that basically is a testament for me that the teams are doing a good job here operator our next question comes from the line of kate grafstein from barclays your line is open kate grafstein barclays analyst thanks if we could just talk a little bit about gross margins for 2019 if you could walk through some of the moving pieces and how should we think about incremental pricing needing to cover inflation in fragrances and we assume gross margins could actually be up as that pricing comes through in the back half of the year richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean actually no i think as i said we ve got about a point and a half built in to the target for our objectives for 2019 in terms of pricing again all of that substantially all of that in the scent business i think on the t side it s more flat from a pricing standpoint from a margin standpoint it s going to be dilutive because we re going to have the sales and we re recovering we re looking to cover the cost increases and we re playing catch up again versus what we the way we exited 2018 and then on top of that we ve got additional increases expected in 2019 so there s going to be a time lag as it has been and in time there is a level of this magnitude of 20 over a 2 year basis from an overall margin standpoint i think the other thing to keep in mind is a mix impact between the three businesses and so you ve got frutarom that s going to represent about a third about 30 of the overall total from a sales standpoint their margins inaudible when you look at how we report from a us standpoint us gaap standpoint they are in the high 30s about call it 38 in that range in that high 30s so that has a dilutive impact so our margin year to year is going to be it s going to be diluted and kind of go up in 2019 i think it will help some of the synergies will help but that synergies are going to get split between overhead expenses as well as cost of goods sold i think we ll get some but it s not going to be a significant step up from 18 to 19 andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer you will see it probably in 2020 because the synergies on the manufacturing sides are kicking in and taking into let s say taking the assumption which i think is fair that the raw material inflation hopefully will stop this year then you will see a significant improvement in 2020 operator our next question comes from the line of mike sison from keybanc your line is open mike sison keybanc analyst hey guys in terms of frutarom could you walk us through what the expectation should be for sales in 19 i guess from the 1 1 billion that you noted in the presentation and then i guess when you report operating income for 19 what should that look like if you ll be reporting it with amortization right richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer correct yeah so if you take the 1 1 billion we ve got we ve adjusted for the you basically take out about as i said about 45 million of business that we the biggest piece that we sold in the fourth quarter there is a small piece that will be discontinued and we expect to be discontinued in early 2019 so then the basis net of that to those two elements and then from there i would say the 6 that we ve talked about is our expectation for 2019 from a profitability standpoint the amortization will be included in the division results as it is for all three divisions we do that to maintain that s how we measure the business performance it s how we look at it from an incentive comp standpoint and it s how we keep things tied back to our economic profit principles and that s why we look at it both at a division level on a segment profit basis including amortization and on a corporate level we ve added the element of ex amortization from an overall cash flow standpoint operator our next question comes from the line of gunther zechmann from bernstein your line is open gunther zechmann bernstein analyst he andreas hey mike and rich two questions just can you talk a bit about the sales leverages that we are expecting from the frutarom business i think i remember you saying 50 bps when do you see that really kick in and also if you can discuss what the incremental margins are that you expect from that that s the first one the second one is pretty quick i have in the 5 to 7 sales growth guidance for 2019 that you put is it fair to assume that s organic sales growth or is it just local currency with some bolt ons as well thanks andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer maybe you take the last one and then i ll take the other one richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah do you want me go to first andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer yeah richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer okay so out of the in the 5 to 7 there is as i said about point and a half related to price there is about little bit between 50 basis points and 100 basis points of call it a middle 75 of impact related to the 53rd week and a small amount of m a and the balance is organic volume andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer yeah and on the cross selling we will be first of all we will be more let s say concrete on it when we do our investor day in the middle of the year but what we see and the teams are working on it that we have the first let s say pilots running we had the first couple of wins small ones but we see that they are really good and significant sizable opportunities so i believe it will actually start probably at the end of the year and then going into 2020 that we see an impact on the cross selling which is really really good and we will make sure on the margin side to answer that question that we go into these more higher margin business that we certainly put our resources behind the areas and categories where we can earn better margin than we have and we probably let that some of the lower margin business go so that s as an answer and by the way on the growth rate as rich said in one of his bridges we have lost a couple of sales as well because we have sold or we are selling some of the smaller business from frutarom just as an fyi operator our next question comes from the line of john roberts from ubs your line is open john roberts ubs analyst thank you in the frutarom shareholder filings they had a 2018 projected revenue number of 1 75 billion and so on slide 20 if i take your 1 1 billion and add your fourth quarter of 360 million i m coming up about 300 million short did they finish the year like the was the fourth quarter 300 million below what they were thinking earlier in the year that seems like way too big a gap like the math is wrong here somehow michael deveau head of investor relations yeah hi john it s mike just remember from a frutarom guidance standpoint pre the acquisition that was a 2020 guidance right so that 300 million was a number they had that was going to go out another couple of years but look clearly john i mean third quarter built in at that point in the numbers they were not expecting to have a negative growth in q3 and they were not expecting i don t think those numbers were based on having 3 4 growth in q4 so the second half of the year was clearly weaker than what that was projected there is a currency element between that and what we ve built into our assumptions for 2019 and clearly there s i think there was m a that they had expected to occur during 2018 that has not occurred so i think it s a combination of all of that that much but it s not 300 million in the fourth quarter that s causing the difference operator our next question comes from the line of daniel jester from citi your line is open daniel jester citi analyst yeah hi good morning everyone just on the cost synergy side now that you ve had the asset for a couple of months can you talk about your confidence level in getting that 145 million target and if we do see a slowdown from a macro perspective is there anything you can do to accelerate those cost savings andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me take it first of all our confidence level on the synergies is very very high because we see it already on the run rates we have for some of these elements like procurement and even the footprint rationalization i m saying run rate because of p l impact we have to go circa to inventory in 2019 to make it happen but confidence levels is very very very high if the economy is going down or is not growing as fast as we saw it in 2019 we have other levers to play here as well to make sure that we will reach our numbers richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think built into the guidance that we have for 2019 is investments that we want to make to drive future growth i mean nicolas andres talked about nicolas business and the new core list that we ve gained access to in order to realize that potential we ve got to invest in resources whether it s commercial people boots on the ground c a resources consumer insights and research that s embedded in our guidance for 2019 it s probably 300 to 400 basis points of investment if the year unfolds differently we can certainly slow that down and make choices as we ve done over the last two to three years as particularly in 16 and 17 we slowed back investment and we cut it back to try to mitigate the impacts of weaker top line that will always be part of our management process and the trade offs that we have to evaluate part of that 300 to 400 that i talked about is really playing catch up and we will as we progress through 2019 that s the first thing we will do is say are we on track from an external in looking viewpoint and what do we do as a result of that operator our next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas from jpmorgan your line is open jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much just a couple of questions on frutarom in your descriptions of the taste and scent business you talk about local currency growth or currency neutral growth but in the frutarom business you talk about 3 growth on a like for like basis can you remind me what like for like means and how that factors in acquisitions currencies or whether it does or doesn t and then secondly frutarom s sales were much higher in the first and second quarter they were 385 and 401 why were the sales for frutarom so much higher in the first and second quarters than they were in the third and the fourth andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer you do the first piece richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me take i ll take the first one jeff yeah you re right it is it s a different methodology i mean they ve always used like for like and we ll evaluate as we go forward if there s a way to combine the two methodologies like for like represents that if what they do is they then back in and say if there is an acquisition that was done in the middle of any year they take the prior year growth and put it back prior year sales and compare prior sales for the acquisition to current year sales for the acquisition so again it s almost on it s measuring on a pro forma basis as if the acquisition any current year acquisition was affected as of the first of the prior year so they re looking at the organic growth of that business plus the organic growth of the existing businesses so it s a slightly different methodology it s almost like same store sales it is a bit different than what we re doing but it was the most practical way for the time being for us to look at it on a combined basis andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer okay and i think that s important that we have to let s say bring it all at the same level that we can compare apples to apples let me take the second piece of your question jeff is on frutarom first half to second half certainly seasonality plays a role second we are had an unfavorable currency situation at the second half of the year as well because it s a lot of euro denomination in the sales for the consolidation to our numbers the three days we re missing because we close on october 4th and then what we should not underestimate particularly in the third quarter that there was certainly a distraction of the organization to get the closing of the deal done we are happy that we closed actually ahead of time as we said but that we re certainly a couple of weeks or months even though the organization whether we re more focused getting the closing done than selling to those customers and we are very happy and actually optimistic because it turned around already in the fourth quarter and that s a very good sign so that s the explanation for the sales first compared to second half of 2018 operator our next question comes from the line of jonathan feeney from consumer edge research your line is open jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst good morning thanks very much just a quick one andreas you were on the board and i know rich you were there i think you were controller for a lot of the cultural changes under doug and kevin that took place i think just focusing on more profitable brief like that sort of business process stuff could you compare the culture at frutarom and the integration challenges or integration opportunities you see just as far as the cultural organizing from most profitable least profitable basically risk adjusting all of that to what you went through back then and if there is that kind of opportunity how that plays into your synergy plan thank you andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer i would say jon a very interesting and good question because here are certainly opportunities for us to look at the profitability of the different businesses and we are doing it even much broader that we look into all categories and all customers right now and we will present to the board in may by the way to look where we put all the dollars behind and where we might walk away or make sure that we don t invest too much money to make sure that we re really going after the opportunities which are giving us the best yield for our dollar so that s good in terms of the culture what is good is that with the acquisition we got a lot of energy from a company which is very commercially focused and that will help us as well to focus on our customers and make sure that we get the best out of the customers and that we have a good service in place here as well so that would be my answer but rich you please supplement richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think jon it s in some ways the fundamentals of the cultural change are similar in the sense that the biggest thing back under doug kevin was a shift in focus in understanding from just topline growth to profitability and margins and accretive business the whole ep focus and i think i can clearly tell you that the frutarom mentality frutarom dna is all about profitable growth and they focus on margins day in day out you ve heard me talk about their executive information system and they lived through that day in day out they re focused on what s the margin expansion what s the mix improvement so i think from that standpoint it s very similar in terms of we both companies recognize the importance of profitable growth i think the challenge that we were going to have to manage through as an executive team is now we have a much bigger business and the choices that we have are much bigger and so we re going to have to manage through that because we don t have analyst resources so it s both a benefit and a challenge that now we have to allocate those resources and prioritize across a much wider spectrum of businesses andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer and that was actually one of the reasons for the acquisition that we said we wanted to increase the option space for us because now as rich said we can we have natural colors we have health ingredients we have food protection we have flavors we have fragrances we ve active cosmetics and that gives us good choices and actually it helps us as well to balancing very good global environment as well so we believe it s good to have options and we have now more options than we had ever before probably more options than many of our competitors and we believe that has positioned us actually in a very very very good good spot with that i think mike we will close the call for today but i would like to remind you that we are at cagny next week and we have a cagny dinner where we will display all of these new franchises and categories we have now in store and we ll give you an explanation what we can do with it and you can experience it you can taste it you can smell it and we believe it will be great so i hope to see a lot of you next week in boca actually it was much warmer and better weather and you will see it will be spectacular thank you very much take care operator

i am a buy and hold investor when i invest in a company i am typically looking for companies that i can own for a lifetime i want companies that are stable produce growing cash flows and are in wide moat industries that i am confident will not be easily replaced when i built my portfolio there were a number of considerations that i took into account most important to me was the long term sustainability of my investments as a patient person i invested in brookfield renewable partners nyse bep because they checked all of my boxes let s take a deeper look to see if they check yours company overview bep investor presentation brookfield renewable partners is a part of brookfield asset management bam and is considered one of the largest pure play renewable businesses in the world started in 2013 as a spin off of their parent company bep owns and operates 879 power generating facilities globally these facilities are divided primarily into hydroelectric wind and solar operations although the company also has operations including pumped storage battery storage and biomass the key being their operations create clean renewable energy that should be prioritized by governments and people around the world as deep moat businesses go it does not get much deeper than this bep has 76 of its generation capacity coming from hydroelectric power located on 82 river systems around the world hydroelectricity is the gold standard for energy production because it can be switched on and off as needed 24 hours per day once installed it has minimal environmental impact and the nature of the assets mean that they can operate for more than 100 years without the need for major capital investment to keep them functioning the other thing to consider is that there are only so many river systems that lend themselves to hydro production and most of the great rivers have already been utilized this means there is a scarcity of the resource attaching premium valuations to those already in place that also means that there will not be many additional hydro dams installed especially in developed areas like north america and europe where the rights of the few seem to take priority over the greater good that drove these projects in the past through the acquisition of terraform companies in 2017 brookfield also expanded their footprint into wind and solar this acquisition also allowed the company to expand their presence geographically into europe and asian markets adding to their global diversification an important component in their future growth strategy bep investor presentation building on uncertainty most companies look at uncertainty as a negative but brookfield looks at uncertainty from an opportunistic standpoint brookfield renewable is a value investor and as such is always looking for new opportunities to acquire assets at deep discounts to their replacement value this can be seen in 3 transformative purchases that they have made bord gais in 2014 isagen in 2016 and terraform companies in 2017 all three of these purchases have resulted in returns of between 18 20 these acquisitions were all considered distressed assets caught up in unique situations in each of these acquisitions bep was able to flex its considerable corporate might to close deals that very few companies could in the case of bord gais the wind farm assets were purchased from the irish government as part of a mandated restructuring made by the european union connected to a government bailout with isagen bep was able to purchase the assets from the colombian government in a multi year process that found the government selling off quality assets in exchange for needed capital to fund additional infrastructure improvements within the country with terraform bep was able to secure more quality assets as part of the bankruptcy procedures initiated against sun edison in all three situations bep through the support of its parent company brookfield asset management was able to opportunistically acquire these companies at preferred pricing and in each case was able to drive above expected returns benefiting bep and their shareholders also important was that each of these companies brought significant capital projects with them that when complete will provide important visibility going forward 2018 was an okay year since 2014 bep has been able to deliver total combined returns to shareholders of approximately 15 which by any metric is great 2018 saw that drop to 14 as the share price stalled which is a disappointment to shareholders who are used to steady gains with the share price lagging in 2018 the company chose to repurchase 2 million units mostly in the fourth quarter at an average price of 27 per share enhancing shareholder value on their fourth quarter conference call the company also announced a 5 increase to the dividend rate which is currently yielding close to 7 despite the drop in share price in 2018 the company has still been able to deliver on their targeted 12 15 total return to shareholders over the past 5 years bep investor presentation 2018 also saw the company standing pat with no major acquisitions during the year rather choosing to raise significant capital in order to better position themselves for future opportunities when they exist on the call ceo sachin shah restated the companies approach to acquisitions choosing patience while waiting for the right opportunities to present themselves the company was able to raise additional capital by recycling some of its mature assets selling operations that yield single digit returns in order to re position into higher yielding opportunities in addition to building their capital base they were also focusing on operations by improving efficiencies during the year the company was able to increase their ffo by 16 focusing on improving the efficiencies of their existing operations particularly those acquired in the terraform transaction by stabilizing these assets the company was able to renegotiate existing loan obligations extending maturities out beyond 2023 these actions had positive impacts to the bottom line by allowing the company to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment but also providing cost certainty should rates continue to rise in the short to medium term as expected the company was also able to extend out their purchase power agreements in columbia and brazil allowing them to take advantage of improved pricing but also creating greater certainty for revenues going forward this certainty then allowed the company to renegotiate preferred rates on debt outstanding with existing lenders who prefer the clarity long term ppa s provide brookfield also has done a good job hedging their foreign currency exposure during the year providing more cost certainty 2018 was also a good year in terms of the company being able to bring down their payout ratio to a more manageable 95 of ffo from a peak that exceeded 120 in previous years this was achieved through a combination of factors including improved efficiencies increased ffo and share repurchases also worth noting is that ffo does not include asset sales which are an important component of the brookfield business model and is often overlooked with 2 billion of current liquidity the company also finds itself in a good position to fund future growth from internally generated cash flows without the need to issue additional equity this has been an issue for shareholders in the past as increasing share count has been a drag on share valuation as brookfield has looked to raise additional capital to fund previous acquisitions balancing the security of western markets with the growth potential of emerging economies on the most recent call a number of issues were discussed highlighting the global reach of their business there are advantages to owning hydro assets in north america as they provide transparent and steady income flows through ppas that generally extend for decades the quality of their customer base is generally investment grade including government utilities and large industrial users for this reason these assets attract premium valuations among institutional investors seeking steady cash flows to meet their payout needs the drawback is that these assets have to compete with the currently low rates for electricity being driven by record low natural gas prices which benefit gas fired electricity production this is particularly evident in the us northeast where brookfield operates many of its facilities in one of the most productive shale gas regions in the world the result is single digit returns for many of these operations which does not support their goal of being able to generate 12 15 returns for shareholders bep investor presentation the alternative is to invest in faster growing emerging markets like latin america and asia where higher double digit returns are possible returns also differ by technology with hydro producing lower returns when compared to wind and solar the challenge associated with emerging markets is that you are dealing with currency fluctuations political and economic uncertainties as well as the lack of experience when dealing with new foreign markets for brookfield this creates an opportunity because many traditional institutional investors lack the confidence or experience to take on these challenges within emerging markets there also exists a tremendous need for capital as governments are often stretched financially and are increasingly relying on private investment to complete needed infrastructure development with the backing of bam there are very few opportunities brookfield cannot entertain giving them an advantage over many of their competitors this was the case with isagen in 2016 and the same opportunities may be playing out today in india on their conference call sachin shah said that when the company first started looking at india a few years back they were hesitant because of the high valuations that they were seeing being the patient investors that they are things have begun to change and within the last 6 months opportunities are beginning to present themselves as capital begins to dry up in the region this would be a great opportunity for brookfield as india battles with china to convert the massive potential of southeast asia into economic prosperity brookfield also continues to dip their toes into china as well through a joint venture with glp 35 mw are coming online this year but due to uncertainty in the political environment bep is choosing to slow things down and take a longer steady approach looking ahead in the last 5 years bep has doubled the size of their hydro business tripled their wind assets in 2018 alone and added significantly to their solar business as well this diversification has meant that they are less concerned with individual weather patterns allowing for greater consistency in terms of revenue streams i see this movement towards an expanding global business continuing to play out high valuations in north america have created opportunities to recycle capital as evidenced by the group of canadian hydro assets that bep has packaged for sale and continues to advance this capital will be reinvested into higher yielding opportunities around the globe there are other opportunities in spain as well as pockets of the us market where capital constraints are creating opportunities for brookfield to participate through ma activity they also continue to advance development opportunities including new hydro construction in brazil additional projects in columbia and europe as well of concern however is a changing commitment to carbon emission reduction being led by the current us administration and their pulling out of the paris climate accord this denier mentality is being adopted in other countries as well where green energy incentives are drying up stagnating new development where wind and solar were being widely promoted to replace traditional coal fired generation a few years ago now cleaner burning natural gas is increasingly being adopted for baseload generation also of concern is the inability to attract the premium pricing that was hoped for in areas like the northeast us as gas keeps hydro rates low that said things can change quickly and the next election cycle could create tremendous opportunity for a company like brookfield i also like brookfield as a hedge against a potential slowdown in the economy with their long term revenue generators in place they are less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn for that reason i believe brookfield renewable is a good investment to hold and their willingness to act on the uncertainty of today should create greater returns tomorrow making bep an ideal investment for the long term investor as well in the meantime i have no problems spending the 7 yield that makes its way into my bank account every 3 months

next three to five years these results were also a testament to our extraordinary team who demonstrate our principles and beliefs and show the enthusiasm and dedication in always putting the customer first i want to thank everyone for making a difference each and every day our number one priority remains driving healthy profitable sales growth across the portfolio beginning in 2016 we took the necessary steps to reduce discounting while also investing in incremental levers to accelerate growth this includes 50 million of food and service enhancements shifting media spend from mass marketing to digital personalization the dine rewards loyalty program and the rapidly growing off premise business these investments have helped to fortify the core business and expand our reach to new and existing customers we will continue to leverage our scale portfolio of brands and data analytics to enhance engagement with higher returns importantly the significant upfront investments that we have made in the 360 degree customer experience are largely behind us we are now beginning to fully monetize the benefits of these efforts our patients has paid off and as we enter 2019 we are confident this momentum will lead to sales growth and meaningful margin expansion now turning to the brands outback comp sales were up 2 9 in the fourth quarter on top of an already strong 4 7 increase in q4 2017 this is outback s eighth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales the investments we have made to elevate the customer experience are driving healthy sales growth as a reminder we have made customer facing improvements across food quality and portion enhancement service upgrades and improved ambience last year we also made significant investments back into our people as the war for talent remains high these actions have resulted in increased partner engagement higher satisfaction and helped contribute to the lowest turnover levels of the brand in the past ten years ensuring our assets are current remain a top priority we completed the multi year rollout of the outback exterior remodel program and have now shifted to interior remodels outback is testing multiple design prototypes that incorporate new design elements to modernize our look while expanding the off premise room to handle the higher expected order volume we are also relocating outback s restaurants as quickly as quality sites become available we completed 14 relocations in 2018 looking ahead to 2019 we expect to relocate another 11 restaurants given the strength of the pipeline this relocation program continues to deliver impressive results and recent relocations are generating sales lift well in excess of 30 we are very bullish about outback and the brand is well positioned to further take market share at bonefish q4 comp sales were down 1 1 largely driven by a 10 reduction in discounting we have now largely cycled through our deliberate plan to reduce discounting going forward bonefish will focus on driving healthy traffic by leveraging its strength with fresh fish innovative cocktails and superior service we continue to see success with the specials board which offers local fresh fish and seafood entrees that are selected by our partners in addition we have migrated our marketing resources away from national toward more impactful local programs this local philosophy helped define bonefish as the unchanged chain and it s paying off as the brand achieved record profitability in 2018 at carrabba s comp sales were up 80 basis points in the quarter carrabba s remains focused on driving healthy sales and providing a great authentic italian meal at affordable prices we continue to simplify the core execution while investing back into experience with larger portions and service enhancements we are also targeting more proprietary programs such as our successful wine dinners and amore mondays in addition our growing off premise business via family bundles catering and delivery platforms represents a significant incremental opportunity in 2019 in q4 fleming s comp sales were down 0 4 driven by a planned 20 reduction in discounting we made the conscious decision at fleming s to move away from legacy value offerings such as our 567 bar menu and non holiday gift card distributions while these actions have a short term negative impact on traffic they have had a positive impact on profitability moving forward fleming s will work on differentiating the brand from the traditional high end steakhouses through localized menu selection and customer segmentation the successful dine rewards loyalty program now has 8 million members this program is performing very well and driving strong engagement across the portfolio we will evolve the program to further leverage the customer segmentation opportunities provided by the rich data we have collected over the years our investments in crm strengthen engagement through more customer centric communication while providing a higher return from marketing spending for perspective these investments have enabled us to reduce advertising spend by 25 million over the past two years while improving return on investment turning to off premise in q4 we completed the roll out of an additional 200 delivery locations across outback and carrabba s delivery is now available in over 450 locations as of the end of the year we are very pleased with the progress and these locations continue to perform well against several key metrics including delivery times and deliveries per location this continues to give us confidence in the potential and expect to complete the roll out to the remaining delivery locations by the end of 2019 we are very excited about the incremental opportunity it represents as we capitalize the growing consumer demand for enjoying restaurant meals at home moving to international brazil comp sales were up 2 4 in the quarter we are very pleased about these results as the country experienced a difficult environment last year this reaffirms our belief that the advance of q2 and q3 were temporary and not indicative of long term fundamentals the economy in brazil is beginning to see signs of stabilization since the presidential election and underlying health indicators are improving gdp is set to have its strongest performance in four years and reduced inflation and interest rates are having a positive impact on consumer demand and disposable income we remain optimistic about the long term potential of the market the demand and love for our restaurants remain high and we are well positioned to continue to grow and take share in an under penetrated casual dining market in summary 2018 was an excellent year as our multi year effort of investing behind the consumer is paying off in the form of healthy underlying traffic and margin expansion the incremental sales layers we have qualified across loyalty digital and off premise will position us to capitalize on the continued sales momentum and monetize the benefits of these investments as we enter 2019 and beyond our long term strategies remain intact and you can expect the following priorities in 2019 the first priority is to grow quality sales and profitability in the us the benefits of our strategic investments have gained momentum over time data personalization will help us engage more efficiently and effectively with consumers across each sales layer including the dine rewards loyalty program in addition to remodels and relocations we also believe we have a very attractive opportunity for domestic new unit growth at outback and fleming s and are building the pipeline that will be pursued in a disciplined manner our second priority is executing against the growing off premise opportunity we believe off premise represents a structural tailwind for the category and has the potential to reach 25 of total sales in our restaurants over time given this potential we have built the infrastructure technology and capabilities to support these elevated sales volumes we are offering delivery in over 450 restaurants today and expect to fully complete the roll out in 2019 third we will continue to allocate capital to maximize the international growth opportunity this includes leveraging the success in brazil with outback and abbraccio in addition we will pursue the growing franchise opportunities in latin america and in asia with our portfolio of brands and our final priority is to maximize total shareholder return we remain committed to reviewing all potential opportunities and we ll evaluate them through the lens of maximizing shareholder value since the beginning of 2015 we have returned nearly 1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases given our cash flow we expect 2019 to represent another strong year of returning cash to shareholders we are excited about the prospects ahead as we have transitioned to a strong differentiated growth model and look forward to providing more details at our march 11 investor day and with that i ll turn the call over to dave deno to provide more detail on q4 and 2019 dave david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer well thank you liz and good morning everyone i ll kick off with a discussion around our sales and profit performance for the quarter i d like to remind everyone that when i speak to results i ll be referring to adjusted numbers that exclude certain costs and benefits please see the earnings release for reconciliations between non gaap metrics and their most directly comparable us gaap measures we also provide a discussion of the nature of each adjustment before i begin it is important to note that our q4 2017 results included 14 weeks versus q4 2018 which had 13 weeks the additional week in 2017 fell between christmas and new years and includes many of the business days of the year this week had the following impacts to our fourth quarter 2017 reported results total revenues improved by 80 million fourth quarter gaap and adjusted eps improved by 0 12 and gaap and adjusted operating margins benefited by 190 basis points and 170 basis points respectively for purposes of today s call when i refer to fourth quarter of 2017 results i ll be referring to comparable 13 week results that remove the impact of the additional week from my discussion for additional reference both the reported and the comparable financial metrics for revenues eps and operating margin technical difficulty in the q4 earnings release issued this morning with that in mind our fourth quarter financial results versus the prior year were as follows gaap diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 12 versus 0 01 in 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 30 versus 0 18 last year this represents an impressive 67 year over year increase the primary difference between our gaap and adjusted eps is related to certain impairment restaurant closing costs and severance excluded from the 2018 and 2017 fourth quarter results total revenues increased 1 7 to 1 billion in the fourth quarter and us comp sales were up 1 6 this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales for our company adjusted operating income margin was 4 3 in q4 versus 2 2 in the comparable period a year ago this was primarily driven by increases in us comp sales the investments in customer experience are driving higher quality sales which is improving margins in addition our margins continued to benefit from the ongoing productivity efforts to help offset inflation in 2018 we made great progress in reducing food waste and optimizing the labor model ongoing productivity efforts will play a role in 2019 margin expansion efforts also we had a 5 million favorable change in year over year q4 incentive compensation this change had a 50 basis point positive impact on our q4 2018 margins as compared to last year in our international segment adjusted operating margins improved from 10 in q4 of 2017 to 12 2 in q4 of 2018 this was driven by a strong margin quarter in brazil as they rebounded from the truckers strike and political uncertainty that negatively impacted their second and third quarter results q4 adjusted tax rate was 7 8 this was lower than expected due primarily to the benefit of certain tax items this has a 0 02 favorable eps impact versus our expectations on the development front we opened five systemwide locations in the fourth quarter including four international locations and one domestic outback franchise location before i discuss 2019 it s important to reflect on some of the key accomplishments in 2018 first as liz mentioned the us business finished the comp sales up 2 5 for the year with positive comps at all us brands outback posted a 4 comp for the year significantly outpacing the casual dining industry our eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps underscores our confidence in the sustainability of their growth trajectory second we finished 2018 up 25 in adjusted eps well above our original guidance of 11 to 16 on a comparable calendar basis third we finished the year with positive year over year operating margins on a comparable calendar basis our efforts to drive healthier traffic through higher roi marketing activities such as digital are working and have set us up to make significant improvements in operating margins going forward fourth our business in brazil has proved to be extremely resilient the fourth quarter comp sales result of positive 2 4 came after two quarters of uncertainty leading up to the october presidential election there is renewed optimism in the country and the brazilian consumers love of outback remains strong finally in 2018 we repurchased 5 1 million shares of common stock for a total of 114 million since 2015 we returned nearly 1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases at our most recent meeting the board of directors approved another share repurchase authorization of 150 million the share repurchase program has been a big win for our shareholders our strong performance has given us the financial flexibility to balance returning cash to shareholders with prudently managing our capital structure and credit metrics 2018 was a strong year for our company and has set us up for continued success in 2019 before we discuss 2019 guidance i want to briefly review the impact that the adoption of the new lease accounting standard will have in our business beginning in q1 2019 this standard will be reflected in our results among its impacts we will no longer recognize gains on sale leaseback transactions in our financial statements as you may recall in 2017 we largely completed a very successful sale leaseback initiative that generated nearly 700 million in gross proceeds we used the net proceeds to pay down 300 million of debt and repurchased over 300 million of stock these transactions did have a negative impact on operating income as we had recorded the rent expense from these new leases we were able to offset a portion of this additional rent expense with deferred gains realized on the sale of these properties both the rent expense and the amortization of the deferred gain were included in the other operating expense line in our income statement under the new lease accounting standard we will no longer be able to recognize the deferred gain in our financial statements this accounting change will have the following impacts in our 2019 results first there will be a non cash 12 3 million increase in other restaurant operating expenses in 2019 second this represents a 0 10 reduction in eps for the fiscal year third it represents a 30 basis point reduction in operating income margin for the year with that context i will now discuss our 2019 guidance keep in mind we have provided a table in the earnings release to help with the discussion as it relates to eps we expect gaap eps to be between 1 44 and 1 52 we expect adjusted eps to be between 1 53 and 1 61 if you exclude the 0 10 impact of the new lease accounting standard on 2018 results our adjusted eps would have been approximately 1 40 on that basis our 2019 adjusted eps guidance range represents 10 to 15 growth we expect the 2019 gaap effective income tax rate to be between 6 and 7 and the adjusted income effective income tax rate to be between 7 and 8 as it relate to other aspects of our guidance we expect us comp sales to be up 2 to 2 5 we will leverage our numerous sales layers such as off premise remodels relocations loyalty and digital marketing to continue our momentum from 2018 on the cost of sales line we are seeing some inflation across several key commodity categories including beef and seafood we also have increased transportation costs driven by a tight labor market and high demand commodities are expected to be up approximately 2 in 2019 as compared to approximately 3 in 2018 labor will continue to be a headwind in 2019 persistent labor pressures have been a reality in the industry for several years approximately 4 labor inflation is expected in 2019 given these ongoing inflation pressures food and labor cost productivity will be an important part of our 2019 financial model with our sales growth in these productivity efforts we do anticipate meaningful margin expansion in 2019 we expect adjusted operating income margin to be between 4 8 to 5 which is an increase of 20 to 40 basis points from 2018 if you exclude the 30 basis points impact of the new lease accounting standard from our 2018 results our adjusted operating income margin would have been 4 3 on that basis this is a 50 to 70 basis point improvement in adjusted operating income margins from 2018 in 2019 we are confident the margin benefits associated with our prior investments will accelerate capital spending is expected to be between 175 million and 200 million we will continue to make high return investments in areas such as new units in brazil and renovating the outback fleet through our exterior and interior remodel and relocation programs we ll open approximately 20 restaurants with the majority being international in summary q4 was a fantastic finish to a very strong year for bloomin brands clearly our investments in the core customer experience are paying off and we are have entered a new growth cycle we remain disciplined stewards of capital and our improving capital structure provides increased flexibility to return cash to shareholders and with that we will now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator operators instructions our first question comes from the line of michael gallo with cl king please proceed with your question michael gallo c l king associates analyst hi good morning elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president good morning michael michael gallo c l king associates analyst yeah i just wanted to delve in a little bit on margin guidance obviously you re guiding to a significant improvement again in margins despite a meaningful labor and other headwind so i was wondering if you can give us some more color on what some of the bigger buckets of productivity initiatives are and as you look beyond 2019 how we should think about further productivity opportunities all things being equal to move that operating margin up thanks david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure good morning michael first of all we were very pleased with the operating margin expansion in q4 of 210 basis points it s something we pointed to during the year and they came through in a big way so we see that momentum continuing on into 2019 first and foremost we re as liz has mentioned in our remarks that we re going to be driving traffic at a nice margin so that s going to be number one because we ve invested in the core experience and a lot of those investments are behind us and it s important now to monetize those investments we see off premise growth at outback and carrabba s our loyalty program and some of our crm engagement to help us build sales so as i mentioned earlier we re now past a lot of our large cycle investments and we see margin expansion coming forward but beside sales the productivity piece is a big part of it and we expect at least 50 million of productivity this year and we ll see that in the years ahead how are we doing that by simplifying continue to simplify our operations we are making the investments in technology we re doing a really great job in improving our management of our actual versus theoretical food cost management program we have an opportunity to work we re continuing to work with our suppliers and that s been coming through for us we ve opportunity in managing our beer wine and liquor business labor costs have been good for us in a tough labor market because our turnover especially at outback is among the lowest it s ever been and it s just a hats off to the outback team in accomplishing that so and then we also have opportunity on the facility side in our restaurants which was a big opportunity for us in q4 liz has mentioned the advertising piece which we ve gotten higher rois with lower spending especially on digital and finally we continue to be dedicated to holding flat on our overhead structure as we go forward and then lastly as you saw that s with the us and lastly as you saw 220 basis point expansion i believe in our operating margin in brazil and that s a higher margin business for us and they had a really great fourth quarter and we expect that to continue on this year so those are the components of our margin piece for 2019 and beyond michael gallo c l king associates analyst thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays please proceed with your question jeffrey bernstein barclays capital analyst great thank you very much looking more at the the top line looking at 2019 your guide 2 to 2 5 i m wondering if you can maybe prioritize what you think of the biggest sustainable drivers just wondering where you think the industry compares to that 2 to 2 5 and then if you can maybe just give an update i know you mentioned qualitatively the off premise and the dine rewards and remodels but can you just quantify where we stand in terms of mix of off premise and contribution from dine rewards and delivery thank you elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so just kind of unpack that on the industry front we see the industry environment as being a comfortable environment for the consumer you see all the metrics that we see so low unemployment there s high disposable incomes so we think there will be a positive macro environment however we do expect to see negative traffic in the industry again and we expect to have positive traffic across of our portfolio so we and what gives us that confidence well that s exactly what you said we ve spent the last 2 5 years removing discounting and qualifying significant incremental sales layers and that large investment is behind us and we re seeing the momentum and we re able to monetize that number one you always have to go with how are we executing and the core experience in the box and all the 50 million that we ve spent you re going to see more we re taking more at during the analyst day about other food and investment qualities but you re going to see the elevated customer experience is driving really healthy traffic in the box and we certainly have seen the in dining experience traffic strengthen significantly and that s going to continue the second is that we have qualified incremental layers that differentiate us we re really pleased with how our off premise business is doing we are on track for that 25 to 35 of sales in q4 the off premise business grew about 18 for us okay and a total of 11 2 we see that continuing all the investments we ve made to build our database infrastructure and shift from what i call mass marketing which is less efficient to more mass personalization is really driving high return on investments on our advertising and we ve built a pretty formidable database and infrastructure now to be able to monetize and speak directly and continue to raise that roi you see that reflected in the ongoing gains that we record quarter after quarter in the dine rewards program which has really succeeded at the top end of our expectations we re in the first quarter there now that we have those data in those profiles we can monetize and speak directly to them so kind of more on that to come so i think it s this confidence in the core business confidence in the incremental sales layers that we ve done and confidence in the overall platform that we ve built to support it jeffrey bernstein barclays capital analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jeff farmer with gordon haskett please proceed with your question jeff farmer gordon haskett research advisors analyst great thanks just have a follow up and then a question on the follow up you touched on this but advertising as a percent of sales in 2018 and where do you think that number can go in 2019 david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah we don t disclose in great detail as far as what advertising as a percent of sales will be but we expect as a percent of sales to continue to move downward a bit much like it has in the last few years we re really pleased with return on investments jeff that we re getting on the digital piece and also helping us manage our advertising costs jeff farmer gordon haskett research advisors analyst and then similar vein but again you hit on this with bonefish with some color but where do you stand at outback in terms of reduced marketing levels that the reduced discounting and couponing and again what sort expectation as you move into 2019 from those things elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so across the portfolio and outback was on that journey as well we have reduced discounting over the last two years by 25 which is a huge amount over the past two years we believe that journey is completed in 2018 and now we have the ability to lap and monetize that plus the investments as we go forward so we don t see that reduction continuing we took the difficult but right decision over the last two years it s behind us and now we can enjoy the healthy traffic benefits in high margin benefits that come to healthy traffic growth jeff farmer gordon haskett research advisors analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley please proceed with your question john glass morgan stanley co analyst hi thanks good morning liz can you talk a little bit about specifically the benefits you re seeing right now from dine rewards in the quarter if you re willing to quantify kind of what benefit you think to the portfolio or outback that s contributing to comps and secondly you mentioned off premise but can you maybe provide some detail on specific to delivery those units that have delivery what kind of sales lift you re getting from those at this point i ve got one follow up elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so the benefits of dine rewards and again john what i m really excited about is the ability to go in even more detail when we have time on march 11 to really unpack kind of what it means that be on this data journey that we ve been on and the benefits that accrue to that so i ll answer that and then i ll turn it over to dave to talk about the delivery question we currently have 8 million customers we are reaching new and existing users with that we are introducing and cross fertilizing customers across our brands so the portfolio is working beautifully and we re introducing people to our other brands we re increasing existing customers frequencies we re seeing our lifts off the program as we said at the high end of any of our expectations don t want to break that out we also see ourselves very much in the first inning of this and what do i mean by that well we now have 21 million customer profiles and we know what they like when they like and how they like it that gives us the ability now to market directly to them on one on one in a personalized manner and we ll start doing that this year and that we ll be able to drive enhancements to the loyalty program which make it continue to keep building so it s been a terrific program for us over the last 2 5 years we ve got a lot of growth ahead of it same thing on off premise which i ll turn to dave an incremental high growth business and he can talk the particulars david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure good morning john we had 18 growth in off premise in q4 we have delivery in 488 restaurants it s now 14 of our business we saw a good growth in the restaurants in restaurants that have delivery just like in restaurants that don t have delivery so we feel very good about the incrementality we ve been talking about the 80 to 85 range now for quite some time so like i said we have a very good feel for what s going on with delivery and expect to grow that business as we go forward john glass morgan stanley co analyst and then just unpacking the margin comments about 19 you mentioned anniversarying number of your investments you made in 18 you re getting to healthy traffic that helps margins are there any offsetting investments that you re making i mean in other words do you is there is the 50 million is that a net number and you ve got some investments to make particularly in delivery or do you think a lot of those investments are now behind you and in the base of the margins david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah the real big investments that we made in the restaurants over the last few years are behind us but we will always to help grow traffic we will always use some of the productivity and some of the traffic to continue to grow our business but our margin expansion guide includes that but the big investments are behind us john so we will continue to do that and also embedded in our guidance is very prudent pricing we want to make sure that we give the customer great value and so that will be a part of our that s part of our guide as well so the big investments are behind us we will always look to improve the customer experience and productivity is a big part of that along with traffic and prudent pricing john glass morgan stanley co analyst go it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan please proceed with your question john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst hi thank you two different ones if i may first dave you mentioned in an answer to a previous question about margins beyond fiscal 19 and i m maybe a little bit of a preview on the march 11 analyst day because i think it s the question a lot of us want answered what do you think i mean at this point i mean as you see the current cycle and your overall best outlook what an annual margin gain expectation for bloomin should be longer term and i ll ask that question should we get it from the store level should we get it through g a leverage should we really expect it to be top line driven so i mean are you beginning to think about you kind of and maybe an annual basis point increase is there a longer term margin increase or margin turn a longer term level excuse me that you re targeting when might that level be achieved whether in three or five years so really just asking at this point to help us think a little bit longer term because that s obviously be a very key part of your story at this point jeffrey bernstein barclays capital analyst absolutely and as we ve mentioned we felt that we ve had a 200 basis point opportunity in margins and we ll lay out all that in great detail on march 11th but let me just talk a little bit about how we re looking at today and that is first of all healthy traffic at the restaurants as we made our investments and continue to improve service as a big part of it but as this also john it s productivity so your question about it if it s coming out of the restaurant p l absolutely it will come out of the restaurant p l as well especially if we look at facility management energy management food cost management all things i talked about earlier is an important part of it and then we also are working very hard and have worked very hard to doing to manage our overhead costs so we will see leverage on our maintaining our overhead flat going forward and the teams here in the non customer facing business are really really really it s really important so that will be part of the overall overhead management as well and then i oftentimes we don t get questions about this let me just add brazil is a big part of our company and they ve got high margins and growth and that mix will continue to help us so it s restaurant margins overhead brazil as we move forward over the next few years and i think you saw a major down payment on that in q4 and as we go forward into 2019 john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst that s great and do you think to just holding on to that 200 basis point number i mean are you willing to say at this point i mean is that a five year type of expectation 10 year expectation medium or long term i mean is there i mean at this point in time frame that you re willing to give us a heads up on david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer i d say medium term john i don t think it will take five years john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst okay right well that s helpful color in and of itself and in terms of your business composition or portfolio management obviously brazil kind of being in the place that it is and hopefully benefit from some stability in that economy i m going to ask the question about bonefish i mean at least it wasn t from our perspective it wasn t necessarily clear that that was going to remain a long term part of your portfolio but there are some earlier comments that were made fiscal 18 i think was a record profit year for the brands and you ve obviously just made a very high profile of hiring jeff carcara so can you talk about what you think what the opportunity is for that brand and maybe what jeff can bring with his exposure to not that level of dining and even higher level than bonefish dining might mean for that brand over the next couple of years elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so bonefish had a terrific year we knew the traffic was going to be down we planned for that it was anticipated all you re wrong on our guidance because we were really pulling that discounting out and getting back to our roots of being the unchanged chain shifting to all fresh fish returning rights to the local markets getting out of national giving the menu and fish buying rights back to the managing partner and returning to its roots of fresh fish served at really really attractive prices what s the heart and soul of bonefish has always been the ambience and the vibe and we are really excited to have jeff to join us we think he will be a wonderful addition to the team we ve made great strides in the experience and simplification but jeff will continue to elevate that in restaurants periods as he has proven to his career his most recently as you know was head of barteca and so i think you know the vibe the energy it s all coming back he certainly is tremendously excited about the opportunity and the potential on we are looking for positive traffic and positive growth from bonefish this year and excited about that we re blessed to have versatile leaders across the organization and so after having a record year at bonefish driven by our dave schmidt our president of bonefish we ve been able now to ask dave to go over and be cfo of outback and apply his deep operational and financial expertise on that on our largest brand and so all around we re feeling really good about the portfolio of having the right people in the right seats at the right time so we re very bullish john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst thank you go ahead david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we also had a the cfo at outback we had a retirement in supply chain and we have a really talented executive going down there to lead that function so it really is a combination of talented people coming together john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst excellent thanks operator our next question comes from the line of brian vaccaro with raymond james please proceed with your question brian vaccaro raymond james analyst thanks and good morning i just wanted to circle back to the margins and maybe we can level set a bit starting with 18 and could you quantify or be a little more specific on the savings that you realized in 18 and sort of across the p l and on labors could you give a few examples of where you found some efficiencies in that line david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah on labor i mentioned earlier it s been a big robust labor market but one of the things that our teams have done especially at outback is our old our turnover is really really down they re doing a great job managing the teams and everything and moving forward and that saves on training costs and other things like in a big way and so not only we re able to pay our people incent our people but we ve experienced some talented people remaining with our company and that s a big impact brian on the p l brian vaccaro raymond james analyst yeah understood would you be able if you would want to quantify where hourly turnover is these days at outback david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer it s below the industry elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president well below david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer well below and prefer not to get into that given it s a competitive advantage but well below the industry brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right fair enough and as i think about the opportunities in 19 speaking with the productivity inaudible has been a source of savings for a couple of years how much is left there and i guess as we re thinking about simplifying ops further you mentioned as an initiative in 19 maybe just a couple of examples there david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah i think for us we re looking at putting a new pos device for instance and that will help simplify operations in our restaurants carrabba s just did a fantastic job putting in a new kitchen line that really simplified operations and helped on productivity i think on the food cost management not only with our suppliers brian but also managing our actual versus theoretical food waste management but also beer wine and liquor we have you know frankly over tens of millions of dollars left to go i mean that s a big part of our 50 million a year in productivity is managing suppliers work from our suppliers managing beer wine and liquor and continuing to manage our food cost i m not going to get into details by year and those kind of things because again it s proprietary but it s a big part of our 50 million of productivity we re committing to brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right that s helpful and then last one dave you said on the g a front the goal to keep overhead flat just wanted to confirm that means dollars you re talking about sort of dollars similar in 19 to 18 and a lot of moving pieces and g a what s the adjusted base we should be thinking about in 18 that you re comparing that to thank you david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we will be in dollars flat not percent of revenue flat dollars flat and we re looking at 276 million ph brian vaccaro raymond james analyst perfect thank you david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer uh huh operator our next question comes from the line of alex slagle with jefferies please proceed with your question alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst thanks you talked about some of the drivers behind the same store sales outlook for 19 but in terms of the brand performance do you still expect outback to dominate or should we expect this to balance out more in 19 perhaps if there is one of the brands you see having the best opportunity for a near term inflection elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president yeah great question so we see continued strength on outback but the other brands we are we see comp store growth and traffic gains across the portfolio as we have now finished the journey of removing discounting which has tough traffic results over 17 and 18 and are able to monetize those investments so we re looking for growth across all the brands and traffic growth across the portfolio and again we ve talked about this thing the elevated experience the healthier traffic dine rewards the data personalization the strong local marketing feeling really good about the portfolio as we enter 19 in the prospects for each brand do i have one course that i think we ll have a breakout will they get mad at me if i picked one because i think they re all enthusiastic about the year and i think you re going to see strength across the portfolio alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst great and one question on delivery if you could sort of talk about your confidence in the ability to operationally manage all this incremental traffic i guess some of it at peak and maybe a little bit more about elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president we re doing it alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst the changes you plan to make with the interior remodels david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure the good news is we re doing it and it s interesting some of our highest volume restaurants also have the highest volume delivery there were some concern with the high volume restaurants to be able to take it and it s just so great to see and when we look at our interior and exterior remodel programs we will make sure we have the room available for our partners to be able to in their pump out rooms for off premise to be able to execute the concept that s a big part of our remodel program so it s across the portfolio and we already are doing it and we track speed of service we track all those kind of things customer satisfaction and we re pleased to say that we re continuing to make progress each and every quarter on all those key measures elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president i think if you ve ordered just if you ve ordered our delivery i think you can see that leaps and bounds improvements in technology and efficiency and kind of where we re going and that s driving momentum across all of the stores so i m really proud of the team alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gregory francfort with bank of america please proceed with your question gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst hey guys i have two questions the first is just where have you been running on blended pricing either in the fourth quarter or the full year of 18 and then my other question is it seems like a lot of the messaging is it the margin expansion is going to come from the store level expenses and i guess i would have thought maybe more of it was going to come from g a and why are you at the gap you are to the industry on g a and why isn t there maybe more opportunity on that line david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure we will see significant leverage in g a as we go forward and that s a big part of our productivity so if i was not clear on that my apologies but that s a big part of our opportunities in g a especially as we manage the non facing ph cost so that s a big part of our program and in one that we will continue to work through that s number one and i m sorry the other part of your question gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst pricing pricing within the fourth quarter david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we disclosed the change that the overall change in check includes mix and pricing we do not get into the pricing detail but i can tell you as we go forward we will be having moderate pricing increases below inflation because we want to make sure that the customer experiences top notch gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst got it and maybe if i can do just one follow up on dine rewards where have you been seeing the benefits are those in customers coming to the brands they re are going to more frequently or are you seeing them sort of trial across brands more than you have in the past i guess as you have looked at the data and i guess bringing up ph more information on this in a couple of weeks but where are you seeing the benefits on that line elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president yeah both and i think that s what s really exciting we re seeing our existing customers experience our other brands and so increase their entire frequency it is at right across our ecosystem and we re also seeing kind of new users come in and experience the brands and so we ve introduced a lot of folks to fleming s for example and now they re choosing fleming s to go for their annual celebration of x or y and so it s this working across the portfolio that s made it kind of that one plus one equals three and that will be something that we ll talk in more detail about in march gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of sharon zackfia with william blair please proceed with your question sharon zackfia william blair analyst hi good morning can you hear me ok elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president hey sharon we sure can sharon zackfia william blair analyst great thank you for a number of different reasons revenue growth has lagged comp growth over the last three or four years i m just wondering is this the year where we see revenue growth kind of at least keep pace with comp growth that s not exceed the rate of comp growth and then how do you think about that revenue growth longer term is it more optimizing average unit productivity with dine rewards and delivery and off premises or do you think there will be more expansion opportunity with one of your other brands domestically going forward david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah we see expansion opportunities as liz has mentioned we see expansion opportunity for outback in the us where we think we have at least 50 more incremental sites we think we have we ve talked about brazil getting to 100 outbacks we now believe it s it s an opportunity for us to expand beyond that and we re doing that work right now in the last four out the five four five the last fleming s sites that we have opened have been really really strong and so we feel good about the fleming s opportunity going forward i think sharon to the other thing is when you look at revenue growth liz has mentioned that we are always looking at our portfolio from time to time we will refranchise restaurants and so that will in itself reduce revenue because we re not getting the company sales anymore but absent that the comp growth in the expansion opportunities that i just talked about i think our chance for us to to grow revenue but also take a look in your modelling if you do any refranchising so that will diminish revenue growth even though it might be a better way to go to market in that particular geography elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president yeah the only other thing i d add is that you know we have always been very disciplined about new unit growth and saying across all of our brands you have to earn the right to grow we re feeling increasingly enthusiastic about bonefish and carrabba s and we ll continue to fill that box and drive that productivity but they are were opened to their coming a point given how well we believe those brands are going to do to taking kind of these top rated brands and going prudently with into new units if it makes sense we ve proven ourselves to be disciplined stewards of capital but we do see that on the horizon because we are very confident in driving the average unit productivity sharon zackfia william blair analyst and i may have missed this but did you give any update on how the off premise s only locations are kind of fairing ph and whether that s an opportunity for growth david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yes that s an opportunity for growth it continues to be a test for us we have some of them are working quite well some of that aren t doing as well as we had hoped but it is an opportunity especially as the industry moves forward and we re looking to refine that with further menu reductions and also some more systems work but right now it s a test for us and we re continuing to learn as we go forward sharon zackfia william blair analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of andrew strelzik with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning a couple of questions on delivery when you talk about completing the roll out fully in 2019 across outback and carrabba s how many units are you thinking that ultimately gets to is it the full system across the two brands domestically and also as you are now ramping that back up and looking for significant margin expansion can you talk at all about the delivery economics and how that layers in to that margin expansion david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer okay on delivery because we re seeing an incrementality the margin the margin is very helpful to us we won t have as high a margin because we re not delivering alcohol and beverage as the in restaurant experience but the given the incrementality of the business that helps us but also we re growing the business that we already have the 480 we have are growing year on year we expect to have around 600 restaurants when we re done yeah we will see then it could be higher than that depending on where we end up but that would be our guess right now and we look to finish that in 2019 andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst great and if i could squeeze one more in just wondering about the check growth that you re thinking about in outback in 2019 i mean it s been running close to 4 you re not going to be taking much price and i recognize the delivery investments are kind of through at this point so are there going to be other efforts to improve the mix at outback or are you going to kind of pull back on that in an effort to continue to have the traffic pick up the this lag david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we ll continue to we don t want it for competitive reasons obviously to get into any kind of detail but we ll continue to manage the comp through traffic and mix as we always do but the one thing i want to assure you is on the pricing side we ll continue to watch that carefully like i had mentioned previously in the call andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst great thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to liz smith for closing remarks elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president we appreciate all of you joining us today and we re

combined numbers by combining our results with the results of frutarom prior to the acquisition on october 4 2018 and adjusting for divestitures of frutarom businesses since october 4 2018 with me on the call today is our chairman and ceo andreas fibig and our executive vice president and cfo rich o leary we will start prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have with that i would now like to introduce andreas andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer thank you mike on the call today i will give an executive overview of our operational performance for 2018 once finished i will ask rich to give a more in depth financial review of the business before leading into our integration priorities for 2019 of the frutarom acquisition we will then provide an update on our financial expectations for 2019 and then as usual take any questions that you may have i m very pleased to say that 2018 proved to be a historic year in a long and successful history of iff as we recently celebrated our 130th year birthday we delivered on all of our key financial metrics and completed the acquisition of frutarom the largest deal in our industry to date all while successfully navigating a challenging and dynamic market environment we achieved strong advancements in both top and bottom line results in 2018 but we re in line with our guidance range that we set forth highlights include our record setting sales of approximately 4 billion which was a 17 increase over last year this performance was driven by mid single digit growth in both taste and scent as well as additional sales related to frutarom we also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of 6 28 as adjusted operating profit growth and a lower year over year fx rate more than offset higher interest expense and shares outstanding most related to the frutarom acquisition throughout 2018 we had many strategic accomplishments that drove significant value creation to highlight just a few with the acquisition of frutarom we established ourselves as a global leader in taste scent and nutrition this combination helps us create a truly differentiated portfolio with an increased focus on naturals and health and wellness it also provides us opportunities to expand into attractive and faster growing categories and broadens our complementary and growing customer base we believe this plus strong sales and cost synergies will translate into accelerated financial performance as a combined company beyond the transaction we continue to strengthen our innovation platforms by successfully commercializing three new natural taste modulators two new fragrance molecules 41 new natural fragrance ingredients and fragrance body care capsules as critical to driving future growth through the execution of our vision 2020 strategy we re truly the partner of choice as we expanded our cordless ph with key global scent customers this expanded access will help fortify our market leading position and offer significant future growth opportunities as we now can compete on incremental business opportunities we also leveraged our exposure to faster growing small and mid sized customers to drive results as tastepoint in north america continued its strong performance by growing double digits productivity continues to be paramount to our way forward as cost and productivity initiative once again contributed approximately 5 percentage points of adjusted currency neutral adjusted operating profit and currency neutral adjusted eps growth in 2018 and in terms of sustainability iff continued its global sustainability leadership as we exceeded already three out of four of our 2020 eco efficiency targets we also established our 2025 goals which focuses on emission reductions zero waste to landfill and water stewardship i m pleased that we continue to be acknowledged externally for our sustainability efforts in 2018 we were named to barron s 100 most sustainable companies an honor we received again in 2019 and we were named to the euronext vigeo world 120 index most recognizing companies for exceptional environmental social and governance performance more recently in january 2019 we were once again included on cdp s a list for climate change our fourth consecutive year and we received an a for water security for the first time naming iff as a global leader on environmental responsibility we also made tremendous progress as it relates to our integration of frutarom first and foremost we instilled an integration management office to provide visibility for all critical initiations and enhance decision making this key group of individuals the best of iff and frutarom have been instrumental in developing go forward plans and supporting the day to day execution we also refined and confirmed our plan to achieve approximately usd145 million of cost synergies by 2021 synergies are expected to come from procurement footprint optimization and streamlining of overhead expenses in addition we identified initial cross selling opportunities to drive incremental growth going forward these opportunities are expected to provide revenue synergies which we believe will further value create to the shareholders over time as we mentioned last quarter we ve already capitalized on a few quick wins we integrated frutarom s north america taste business in our north america business and we ll leverage our tastepoint go to market strategy for small and mid sized customers at the same time we combine frutarom s cosmetic active ingredients business called ibr into our lucas meyer s cosmetics business concurrently we moved all savory solution capabilities and innovation on a single leader to form frutarom global savory solutions group this will enable the group to work together in a unified direction from a global footprint standpoint we have already begun to execute the optimization of our manufacturing sites in order to realize significant cost synergies this plan has already led to closings in the uk as we consolidated our inaudible while this is the first step in the process and we have much more work to be done we are moving forward as planned lastly we are finalizing plans for next stage of taste integration like we did in north america combining like taste businesses together to build a strong platform more to be shared in due course i would like now to turn it over to rich richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you andreas i d like to now give you more in depth review of taste scent and nutrition turning to this taste business in the fourth quarter 2018 currency neutral sales grew inaudible with 3 of the 4 regions expanding year over year this performance was led by mid single digit growth in north america and greater asia all categories contributed to growth led by dairy and beverage segment profit was challenged due to higher rsa expenses and several other ongoing costs which i don t expect to be continuing in a more of a one off nature in the quarter for the full year 2018 currency neutral sales increased 5 driven by growth in all regions and across all categories improvements were led by high single digit growth in north america with strong double digit growth at tastepoint mid single digit growth in eame led by double digit growth in africa and the middle east and in latin america led by strong double digit growth in argentina taste currency neutral segment profit on a full year basis grew approximately 6 led by volume growth and the benefits from our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives in terms of segment profit margin we continue to see margin expansion improving 60 basis points to an industry leading 22 7 in the scent business fourth quarter 2018 currency neutral sales grew 3 performance was driven by mid single digit improvements in fragrance ingredients and low single digit growth in consumer fragrances fine fragrances were down slightly year over year reflecting strong double digit growth in the year ago comparison for the year 2018 currency neutral sales grew 4 with the strongest improvement coming in fragrance ingredients which grew high single digits this was led by price increases and strong double digit growth in cosmetic active ingredients consumer fragrances grew mid single digits including price as performance was driven by double digit growth in hair care and mid single digit growth in fabric care home care and toiletries all led by innovation platforms scent currency neutral segment profit decreased approximately 2 as the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to input costs reflecting unprecedented raw material inflation including the previously announced citral supply issue as well as higher manufacturing costs due to these supply chain challenges it should be noted that over the course of 2018 due to external events we continued to be impacted by incremental pressures in raw material costs our pricing as expected accelerated throughout the year and was near 3 in the fourth quarter however it was not enough to cover the cost increases as always we ll continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate the cost increases in terms of segment profit margin year over year performance was pressured however profit margins remained strong at 17 5 turning to frutarom in the fourth quarter sales totaled approximately 360 million please note and as a reminder we closed the acquisition on october 4th and the financial results for frutarom reflect the closing date and as such does not include a full quarter s activity we re pleased to report that frutarom returned to growth in the fourth quarter as like for like sales increased 3 driven by strong improvements in natural product solutions and fnf ingredients the core business which excludes trade and marketing grew 4 versus the prior year on a like for like basis in terms of segment profit the frutarom division delivered 27 million and 66 million excluding amortization the margin profile for frutarom in the fourth quarter was strong at 18 5 excluding amortization this was a strong improvement when you compare to what they reported in q4 2017 as a stand alone company in terms of cash flow operating cash flow increased 46 million or 12 to 437 million compared to 391 million in 2017 the year over year increase was driven by increased earnings depreciation and amortization and lower pension contributions offset by increased inventories core working capital was impacted by higher inventory to ensure business continuity during the supply chain challenges as well as higher raw material prices from a capital allocation standpoint we spent approximately 170 million in capital expenditures or about 4 3 of sales driven by new plant and capacity investments mainly in greater asia as we discussed in the past some of these investments include a flavors manufacturing facility in the zhangjiagang free trade zone which opened on october 9th 2018 and a natural products research lab located in the nanjing life science park which opened on october 15th 2018 the flavors plant is our second in china and is designed to supplement our existing flavors and manufacturing operations in guangzhou the naturals lab is our first outside of the us china is a critical component of our long term research strategy the opening of these new facilities will support our efforts to be a partner of choice and grow in this exciting region regarding cash returned to shareholders we paid approximately 230 million or about 50 of adjusted net income in dividend payout and 15 million on share repurchases with that i d like to turn the call back over to andreas andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich i wanted to spend a few moments to highlight our integration priorities moving forward as we enter year one of this three year journey as we spoke about earlier integrating ibr into lmc is imperative to strengthen the product offering and drive accelerated growth in cosmetic active ingredients as a reminder cosmetic active ingredients is a very high growth and high profitable sector that we have prioritized moving forward we want to ensure a seamless combination of the global savory solutions group to address customer needs by leveraging the technologies and expertise in our various categories by establishing a globally coordinated team we will support strong local presence with global expertise as we offer a full range meat ingredient provider novel flavors functionality and technical expertise and texture color oxidation plant protein and are almost to our entire customer base we will continue to consolidate the frutarom taste business under the iff taste leader as we move to capitalize on efficiencies and drive accelerated growth the plan is to leverage our strong blueprint of our tastepoint north america go to market approach to strengthen our exposure with small and mid tier customers in every market around the world in terms of synergies which i will touch more in a moment we plan to capitalize on significant make versus buy initiatives across our spend to drive strong year one cost synergies and we will continue to execute our global site rationalization for improved efficiency lastly we will broaden our cross selling activities and begin the execution on opportunities a cross functional global team has been established and is working diligently to generate incremental opportunities to capture greater value as i ve said previously i continue to believe this will provide the largest value creation opportunity in the medium to long term slide 16 provides an overview on the anticipated cost synergies in year one of our three year integration plan our integration program is well under way developing and refining the work plans to unlock these value creation opportunities as you can see we anticipate approximately 30 million to 35 million of expected savings in year one the 30 million to 35 million will come from accelerating the rationalization and harmonization of our procurement spend we will leverage higher spend on overlapping direct raw materials and rationalize we will also leverage production capabilities where we are currently buying materials or intermediates at a higher price we will also continue to rationalize the global footprint to optimize our global sites note that over time the contribution of our manufacturing rationalize will increase as it takes time to work with site closures lastly we will be streamlining overhead expenses by reducing non strategic costs and eliminating redundant expenses this will ensure that we create an organization that focuses and direct spend to the most value enhancing opportunities i would now like to turn the call back over to rich who will give us an outlook for 2019 richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks andreas over the last few years we ve seen the global operating environment continued to be volatile there are several things that have direct implications on our industry and business in 2019 that i d like to highlight a clear headwind within our industry is the continued rise of raw material costs in 2019 we expect mid single digit inflation on our legacy iff business as synthetic materials continued to rise driven by several supply chain disruptions that we have faced over the last 12 to 15 months these market disruptions continue to disproportionately impact the scent business and is more as it is more broadly exposed to these raw materials it should be noted that when you combine 2018 and 2019 raw material cost inflation in the scent division is near 20 our strategic priority is to protect our customers business which we were successful in doing in 2018 however this comes at an incremental cost this will require us to continue to work with our customers taking additional price increases as we move through 2019 to ensure that we ultimately recover these cost increases over time it should be noted that natural ingredients costs like vanilla and citrus markets remain elevated near historical levels we expect to see more muted cost increases for taste in 2019 from an economic perspective gdp growth on a global basis remains positive however many estimates were recently revised downward there continues to be geopolitical tension and uncertainties around the world with examples like trade wars and brexit all in all we are optimistic about our top line but recognize that there is risk given the constantly changing operating environment the us dollar continues to fluctuate versus the world currency as we are in generally a strong usd environment year over year the euro to usd exchange rate is the most relevant to iff so you ll see the euro to usd exchange rates stabilizing it is positive from a profitability perspective the euro represents approximately 30 of our profits including the addition of frutarom our rolling hedging program helps limit any volatility as we are currently hedged approximately 45 at an average rate of 1 21 lastly we ve seen improved global consumer staples volumes in 2018 which we expect to continue in 2019 at the same time local and regional customers continue to grow rapidly a great opportunity as this is even more prevalent to our business when incorporating 30 000 small and mid sized customers that we acquired from frutarom before reviewing full year expectations for 2019 i want to highlight a few go forward modeling assumptions first of all we will be referencing a combined 2018 result as if all aspects of the frutarom transaction were retroactive to the start of 2018 first in 2019 we expect a modest benefit from m a and yes an additional week of sales or 53rd week currency is expected to be a headwind in 2019 we expect the headwind of approximately 3 percentage points on a combined sales growth and approximately 2 percentage point on adjusted eps ex amortization we expect approximately 30 million to 35 million in cost synergies in 2019 coming from procurement operations and overhead expenses as andreas explained following successful debt raise for the frutarom acquisition our debt outstanding is about 4 4 billion and combined interest expense associated with this debt is approximately 150 million currently we are assuming an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19 for 2019 but the dynamics around this remain fluid for the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted eps on a going forward basis we estimate that there will be approximately 113 million shares outstanding including 6 3 million shares related to the tangible equity units annual amortization of intangible assets is expected to be about 190 million to 195 million down from our previous estimate given the several moving parts we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers between combined 2018 and 2019 sales in terms of sales growth we are targeting to achieve 5 2 billion to 5 3 billion in sales during 2019 representing a combined growth of 5 to 7 in the chart as you can see from second bar approximately 9 months of frutarom adds 1 1 billion to our combined 2018 sales in the third bar we ve estimated approximately 45 million of divestitures related to non core frutarom businesses in central europe and the us that takes us to a combined full year 2018 sales of 5 1 billion in the fifth bar we estimate approximately 150 million of headwinds due to currency resulting in a currency neutral combined sales number of 4 95 billion if you then use our expected 2019 growth of 5 to 7 you get our guidance of 5 2 billion to 5 3 billion in sales during 2019 we expect broad based growth across all of our segments with pricing driving scent and volumes a key component of taste and food performance moving onto a reconciliation of our 2019 adjusted eps we expect adjusted eps of 4 90 to 5 10 and adjusted eps ex amortization of 6 30 to 6 50 on the left side of the slide you can see what we ve you can see that we expect 10 to 15 of growth in 2019 for adjusted eps to get us to a range of 4 90 to 5 10 for adjusted eps ex amortization i ll walk you through the key drivers starting with the second bar in that section 2 06 will be added to our full year 2018 number representing the first nine months of frutarom on the next bar you can see that the full effect of the 4 4 billion debt issuance has a negative 0 55 impact when you add that together with the share count dilution from the equity issuance going forward from approximately 80 million before issuance to approximately 113 million shares outstanding it has approximately 1 71 share dilution impact on full year combined results combine that with approximately 0 13 related to other impacts including tax rate frutarom minority interest and lower other income and expense in 2019 it gets you to 5 95 for the combined 2018 year we expect approximately 0 12 related to currency in 2019 to bridge it to a currency neutral combined adjusted eps of 5 83 when you apply the 2019 expected growth rates of 8 to 11 our guidance for 2019 comes out to be 6 30 to 6 50 while we expect to see solid top line growth across the entire business scent profitability is being adversely impacted by the additional raw material cost inflation where pricing actions take time to achieve given the nature of our business as we move beyond 2019 we would expect to see the results to accelerate as raw materials tend to begin to trends begins to normalize and we generate the majority of integrations related in 2020 debt repayment continues to be a critical focus of ours we are committed to reaching a 3 times leverage ratio by 2020 down from our current 3 6 times our intent is to retain an investment grade rating and our management teams and centers are now aligned with the repayment repayment debt metrics with that let me turn it back over to andreas andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich that was a very complicated slide but i hope it helps as we look to the future we are reconfirming our long term targets we expect to deliver between 5 to 7 currency neutral combined sales growth cagr between 2019 and 2021 we also expect to deliver 10 plus adjusted eps ex amortization combined gross for the same period so 2019 is a first very important step in the journey and the foundation to achieve our long term targets in summary we are pleased with our financial performance for 2018 as we delivered on all of our key metrics we made strong advancement in both top and bottom line results as we recorded record setting sales and adjusted eps ex amortization we also built an organization for accelerated profitable growth combining two strong organizations to create a truly global leader in taste scent and nutrition as we look forward full year 2019 we expect sales to be between 5 2 billion to 5 3 billion adjusted eps to be between 4 90 and 5 10 and adjusted eps ex amortization in between 6 30 and 6 50 as rich said the coming together of iff and frutarom was a momentous achievement in 2018 and we are excited to be moving forward as one company and pursuing new opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders around the world and with that i would now like to open up the call to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mark astrachan from stifel your line is open mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst wanted to ask about frutarom so sales growth improved sequentially but was still below longer term expectations i guess given tough comparisons in the business prior to the deal i assume it doesn t meaningfully accelerate until 2q so maybe just verify if that s kind of what you believe and then what gives confidence that 6 remains achievable the only thing that you ve seen so far that would increase confidence in that and i guess sort of related to that any idea what shipments looked like in that business relative to demand in quarters prior to the deal close meaning like could they have over shipped demand andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer okay mark so first of all good morning let me answer the question first of all from a technical point of view we certainly have much easier comparables in the second half of the year so that s something which makes us very optimistic we are also happy that after a softer third quarter last year the fourth quarter was turning around people are again focusing on the business after we have done the close on the 4th of october we have started the integration very very well and as we said before we were happy that we could close a deal a couple of weeks ahead of our original timing and that pays off because everything is going according to plan so people can go back and focus on the customers i believe that s super important leadership is clear and we really can make sure that we see the customers and sell what makes me optimistic is that first of all we are in some of the faster growing segments which is super helpful particularly in the adjacent business you know that we are with some of the faster growing customers as well and particularly in europe and in the us and we haven t even tapped into the cross selling opportunity but we see already that our teams are generating really good ideas and having implemented a couple of pilots and that makes us pretty optimistic on the frutarom piece so all in all a very very positive picture from our point of view richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think mark from as you said i think q1 will be the most challenging from a comp standpoint a little bit better in q2 obviously q3 and the second half is andreas talked about will be we ll see the fastest acceleration i think the other thing to me is clearly north america was one of the challenged markets i think we ve done we ve put the leadership in place now there was vacancy particularly prior to the closing and i think now we are getting much much more alignment and integration between frutarom s business taste business in north america and our tastepoint business so that i think that will enable us to accelerate growth i think we ve already seen very very quickly some real opportunities in terms of where we combine our two capabilities to drive growth on projects that these two companies individually weren t able to tackle mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst got it ok so just to be clear then 6 remains the target and then i just want to switch to a separate question on free cash flow rich richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst it s diverged from net income in recent years does this normalize in your view in 2019 i think you d mentioned inventories be inflated given the supply chain challenges so does the inventory piece specifically improve and are there any other anticipated items that will impact cash generation in 19 as far as you can tell richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think to your first comment our expectations in terms of the 6 certainly are that s still our expectations for the frutarom business going forward in terms of cash flow yeah i think that in the last two years if i look at cash flow from operations compared to adjusted net income it was in the 80 to 90 range 19 was or 18 was clearly challenged by the inventories which were up 130 million something in 19 i would expect the inventory number to stabilize i don t think it s going to get better yet we re going to be challenged with the mid single digit cost increases that i alluded to on our legacy business but i think that s where we see going forward stabilization in 19 and then improvements beginning in 20 going forward overall i would expect that cash from working capital impacts in 2019 to actually be favorable versus a big outflow in 2018 and overall i would say when you take that into consideration plus the increased d a i would expect our conversion of cash from operations versus adjusted net income to be above 100 so much better than what we have been for the last two years mark astrachan stifel nicolaus analyst great thank you richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of faiza alwy from deutsche bank your line is open faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst to talk about the flavors business i think the organic growth of 2 in the quarter was a bit disappointing relative to what it had done in the rest of 2018 so just as you talked about your expectation for the frutarom business i d love to hear how you re thinking about your base business so flavors and fragrances it seems like you re embedding a bit of an acceleration in 2019 so if you could just break those two components out that would be helpful richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah faiza it s rich i mean i think that clearly there has been q4 was a disappointment but i think you also got to keep in mind the prior year comparable is in a very strong q3 i think that with 2020 hindsight it looks like a portion of the strong growth that we saw in q3 is some element of inventory because we see we saw a positive impact from volume erosion which was actually favorable in q3 in the taste business and it turned unfavorable in q4 so i think there s clearly an element associated with inventory adjustments and movements on the part of our customers on a two year basis growth for flavors is probably around 4 and on a full year basis growth rates for on a two year basis are probably in the 5 range so i think partly the fundamentals of our taste business haven t changed our expectations haven t changed we are clearly seeing particularly in the fourth quarter some volume erosion and lower volumes with global customers large cpgs it s hard to say right now whether that s again a continuation of inventory correction but i think overall our expectations are going forward have not changed significantly i think it s still going to be a challenging year but the potential of the business hasn t changed andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer and on the fragrance side we can say we are winning good businesses we had for the fine fragrance business a very tough comparison for the fourth quarter but looking forward in particular if you look at the win rates we have in house already we re very optimistic on the fine fragrance business i think for for the fragrance and scent business it is not too much about the let s say the growth rate in terms of sales and the win rate i think we re doing extremely well here it s more about managing the raw material crisis making sure that we can realize our price and what makes us super optimistic on it is that that we have won three more global inaudible we never had we didn t have before and that gives us just a more expanded reach of our business opportunities whether we can big times already capitalize in 19 i m not sure because it takes a little bit of time but on the mid term i m very optimistic on this one because these were significant wins the team brought in end of last year faiza alwy deutsche bank analyst okay so andreas you mentioned managing the pricing amid this raw material inflation like what is sort of what is embedded in your outlook for 19 for pricing and how much of that pricing have you already taken and how much do you have to go back to your global customers and try to get that pricing richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean faiza that process is already under way i think when you look at the guidance and our expectations excuse me for 2019 it s about a point and a half of pricing and all in the scent business and that process is already under way i think it s it s the same thing if i rewind button it s a tough discussion but nicolas teams have done an they understand the importance our customers understand that we work through the normal mechanisms of price and other activities to do that i think we did an excellent job in 2018 and our price realization was in line with our expectations what was the surprise was the cost impact as we progressed through the year continued to increase and accelerate so i m confident in the medium and long term that we re going to recover the price increases but 19 is going to be another challenging year andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer and actually if you compare ourselves to one of our bigger competitors then you see that the erosion of the ebitda margin was actually less so that basically is a testament for me that the teams are doing a good job here operator our next question comes from the line of kate grafstein from barclays your line is open kate grafstein barclays analyst thanks if we could just talk a little bit about gross margins for 2019 if you could walk through some of the moving pieces and how should we think about incremental pricing needing to cover inflation in fragrances and we assume gross margins could actually be up as that pricing comes through in the back half of the year richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean actually no i think as i said we ve got about a point and a half built in to the target for our objectives for 2019 in terms of pricing again all of that substantially all of that in the scent business i think on the t side it s more flat from a pricing standpoint from a margin standpoint it s going to be dilutive because we re going to have the sales and we re recovering we re looking to cover the cost increases and we re playing catch up again versus what we the way we exited 2018 and then on top of that we ve got additional increases expected in 2019 so there s going to be a time lag as it has been and in time there is a level of this magnitude of 20 over a 2 year basis from an overall margin standpoint i think the other thing to keep in mind is a mix impact between the three businesses and so you ve got frutarom that s going to represent about a third about 30 of the overall total from a sales standpoint their margins inaudible when you look at how we report from a us standpoint us gaap standpoint they are in the high 30s about call it 38 in that range in that high 30s so that has a dilutive impact so our margin year to year is going to be it s going to be diluted and kind of go up in 2019 i think it will help some of the synergies will help but that synergies are going to get split between overhead expenses as well as cost of goods sold i think we ll get some but it s not going to be a significant step up from 18 to 19 andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer you will see it probably in 2020 because the synergies on the manufacturing sides are kicking in and taking into let s say taking the assumption which i think is fair that the raw material inflation hopefully will stop this year then you will see a significant improvement in 2020 operator our next question comes from the line of mike sison from keybanc your line is open mike sison keybanc analyst hey guys in terms of frutarom could you walk us through what the expectation should be for sales in 19 i guess from the 1 1 billion that you noted in the presentation and then i guess when you report operating income for 19 what should that look like if you ll be reporting it with amortization right richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer correct yeah so if you take the 1 1 billion we ve got we ve adjusted for the you basically take out about as i said about 45 million of business that we the biggest piece that we sold in the fourth quarter there is a small piece that will be discontinued and we expect to be discontinued in early 2019 so then the basis net of that to those two elements and then from there i would say the 6 that we ve talked about is our expectation for 2019 from a profitability standpoint the amortization will be included in the division results as it is for all three divisions we do that to maintain that s how we measure the business performance it s how we look at it from an incentive comp standpoint and it s how we keep things tied back to our economic profit principles and that s why we look at it both at a division level on a segment profit basis including amortization and on a corporate level we ve added the element of ex amortization from an overall cash flow standpoint operator our next question comes from the line of gunther zechmann from bernstein your line is open gunther zechmann bernstein analyst he andreas hey mike and rich two questions just can you talk a bit about the sales leverages that we are expecting from the frutarom business i think i remember you saying 50 bps when do you see that really kick in and also if you can discuss what the incremental margins are that you expect from that that s the first one the second one is pretty quick i have in the 5 to 7 sales growth guidance for 2019 that you put is it fair to assume that s organic sales growth or is it just local currency with some bolt ons as well thanks andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer maybe you take the last one and then i ll take the other one richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah do you want me go to first andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer yeah richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer okay so out of the in the 5 to 7 there is as i said about point and a half related to price there is about little bit between 50 basis points and 100 basis points of call it a middle 75 of impact related to the 53rd week and a small amount of m a and the balance is organic volume andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer yeah and on the cross selling we will be first of all we will be more let s say concrete on it when we do our investor day in the middle of the year but what we see and the teams are working on it that we have the first let s say pilots running we had the first couple of wins small ones but we see that they are really good and significant sizable opportunities so i believe it will actually start probably at the end of the year and then going into 2020 that we see an impact on the cross selling which is really really good and we will make sure on the margin side to answer that question that we go into these more higher margin business that we certainly put our resources behind the areas and categories where we can earn better margin than we have and we probably let that some of the lower margin business go so that s as an answer and by the way on the growth rate as rich said in one of his bridges we have lost a couple of sales as well because we have sold or we are selling some of the smaller business from frutarom just as an fyi operator our next question comes from the line of john roberts from ubs your line is open john roberts ubs analyst thank you in the frutarom shareholder filings they had a 2018 projected revenue number of 1 75 billion and so on slide 20 if i take your 1 1 billion and add your fourth quarter of 360 million i m coming up about 300 million short did they finish the year like the was the fourth quarter 300 million below what they were thinking earlier in the year that seems like way too big a gap like the math is wrong here somehow michael deveau head of investor relations yeah hi john it s mike just remember from a frutarom guidance standpoint pre the acquisition that was a 2020 guidance right so that 300 million was a number they had that was going to go out another couple of years but look clearly john i mean third quarter built in at that point in the numbers they were not expecting to have a negative growth in q3 and they were not expecting i don t think those numbers were based on having 3 4 growth in q4 so the second half of the year was clearly weaker than what that was projected there is a currency element between that and what we ve built into our assumptions for 2019 and clearly there s i think there was m a that they had expected to occur during 2018 that has not occurred so i think it s a combination of all of that that much but it s not 300 million in the fourth quarter that s causing the difference operator our next question comes from the line of daniel jester from citi your line is open daniel jester citi analyst yeah hi good morning everyone just on the cost synergy side now that you ve had the asset for a couple of months can you talk about your confidence level in getting that 145 million target and if we do see a slowdown from a macro perspective is there anything you can do to accelerate those cost savings andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me take it first of all our confidence level on the synergies is very very high because we see it already on the run rates we have for some of these elements like procurement and even the footprint rationalization i m saying run rate because of p l impact we have to go circa to inventory in 2019 to make it happen but confidence levels is very very very high if the economy is going down or is not growing as fast as we saw it in 2019 we have other levers to play here as well to make sure that we will reach our numbers richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think built into the guidance that we have for 2019 is investments that we want to make to drive future growth i mean nicolas andres talked about nicolas business and the new core list that we ve gained access to in order to realize that potential we ve got to invest in resources whether it s commercial people boots on the ground c a resources consumer insights and research that s embedded in our guidance for 2019 it s probably 300 to 400 basis points of investment if the year unfolds differently we can certainly slow that down and make choices as we ve done over the last two to three years as particularly in 16 and 17 we slowed back investment and we cut it back to try to mitigate the impacts of weaker top line that will always be part of our management process and the trade offs that we have to evaluate part of that 300 to 400 that i talked about is really playing catch up and we will as we progress through 2019 that s the first thing we will do is say are we on track from an external in looking viewpoint and what do we do as a result of that operator our next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas from jpmorgan your line is open jeff zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much just a couple of questions on frutarom in your descriptions of the taste and scent business you talk about local currency growth or currency neutral growth but in the frutarom business you talk about 3 growth on a like for like basis can you remind me what like for like means and how that factors in acquisitions currencies or whether it does or doesn t and then secondly frutarom s sales were much higher in the first and second quarter they were 385 and 401 why were the sales for frutarom so much higher in the first and second quarters than they were in the third and the fourth andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer you do the first piece richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me take i ll take the first one jeff yeah you re right it is it s a different methodology i mean they ve always used like for like and we ll evaluate as we go forward if there s a way to combine the two methodologies like for like represents that if what they do is they then back in and say if there is an acquisition that was done in the middle of any year they take the prior year growth and put it back prior year sales and compare prior sales for the acquisition to current year sales for the acquisition so again it s almost on it s measuring on a pro forma basis as if the acquisition any current year acquisition was affected as of the first of the prior year so they re looking at the organic growth of that business plus the organic growth of the existing businesses so it s a slightly different methodology it s almost like same store sales it is a bit different than what we re doing but it was the most practical way for the time being for us to look at it on a combined basis andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer okay and i think that s important that we have to let s say bring it all at the same level that we can compare apples to apples let me take the second piece of your question jeff is on frutarom first half to second half certainly seasonality plays a role second we are had an unfavorable currency situation at the second half of the year as well because it s a lot of euro denomination in the sales for the consolidation to our numbers the three days we re missing because we close on october 4th and then what we should not underestimate particularly in the third quarter that there was certainly a distraction of the organization to get the closing of the deal done we are happy that we closed actually ahead of time as we said but that we re certainly a couple of weeks or months even though the organization whether we re more focused getting the closing done than selling to those customers and we are very happy and actually optimistic because it turned around already in the fourth quarter and that s a very good sign so that s the explanation for the sales first compared to second half of 2018 operator our next question comes from the line of jonathan feeney from consumer edge research your line is open jonathan feeney consumer edge research analyst good morning thanks very much just a quick one andreas you were on the board and i know rich you were there i think you were controller for a lot of the cultural changes under doug and kevin that took place i think just focusing on more profitable brief like that sort of business process stuff could you compare the culture at frutarom and the integration challenges or integration opportunities you see just as far as the cultural organizing from most profitable least profitable basically risk adjusting all of that to what you went through back then and if there is that kind of opportunity how that plays into your synergy plan thank you andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer i would say jon a very interesting and good question because here are certainly opportunities for us to look at the profitability of the different businesses and we are doing it even much broader that we look into all categories and all customers right now and we will present to the board in may by the way to look where we put all the dollars behind and where we might walk away or make sure that we don t invest too much money to make sure that we re really going after the opportunities which are giving us the best yield for our dollar so that s good in terms of the culture what is good is that with the acquisition we got a lot of energy from a company which is very commercially focused and that will help us as well to focus on our customers and make sure that we get the best out of the customers and that we have a good service in place here as well so that would be my answer but rich you please supplement richard o leary executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think jon it s in some ways the fundamentals of the cultural change are similar in the sense that the biggest thing back under doug kevin was a shift in focus in understanding from just topline growth to profitability and margins and accretive business the whole ep focus and i think i can clearly tell you that the frutarom mentality frutarom dna is all about profitable growth and they focus on margins day in day out you ve heard me talk about their executive information system and they lived through that day in day out they re focused on what s the margin expansion what s the mix improvement so i think from that standpoint it s very similar in terms of we both companies recognize the importance of profitable growth i think the challenge that we were going to have to manage through as an executive team is now we have a much bigger business and the choices that we have are much bigger and so we re going to have to manage through that because we don t have analyst resources so it s both a benefit and a challenge that now we have to allocate those resources and prioritize across a much wider spectrum of businesses andreas fibig chairman and chief executive officer and that was actually one of the reasons for the acquisition that we said we wanted to increase the option space for us because now as rich said we can we have natural colors we have health ingredients we have food protection we have flavors we have fragrances we ve active cosmetics and that gives us good choices and actually it helps us as well to balancing very good global environment as well so we believe it s good to have options and we have now more options than we had ever before probably more options than many of our competitors and we believe that has positioned us actually in a very very very good good spot with that i think mike we will close the call for today but i would like to remind you that we are at cagny next week and we have a cagny dinner where we will display all of these new franchises and categories we have now in store and we ll give you an explanation what we can do with it and you can experience it you can taste it you can smell it and we believe it will be great so i hope to see a lot of you next week in boca actually it was much warmer and better weather and you will see it will be spectacular thank you very much take care operator

cnn it s a big fat scary round number the national debt reached 22 trillion on monday that s bigger than the entire economic output of the united states in a year is it time to panic no but it may be time to worry a bit about the direction the debt is heading what is debt the first thing to know is that 22 trillion is a misleading number because it includes two types of debt the money the federal government owes to itself and the money the federal government owes to everybody else the former known as intragovernmental debt is mostly what the treasury owes to trust funds like social security that s important but not as important as debt held by the public which is what can impact the economy by fueling inflation or crowding out private investment right now debt held by the public stands at 16 2 trillion even if you measure it as a share of the economy that s a lot of money it s about 76 of gross domestic product which is very high by historical standards it ballooned in the wake of the great recession when the federal government spent liberally to save the economy from total collapse and hasn t been paid down much since another important note the debt is different from the deficit or the difference between what the federal government spends and what it collects in revenue each year the debt represents the accumulation of deficits over time deficits have been rising over the past several years and jumped to 3 9 of gdp in 2019 the highest share since 2013 when the country was still emerging from a deep recession in part because of tax cuts that sharply reduced government income is debt bad not necessarily it depends on what you re using it for the problem with debt is that servicing it costs money the us paid 325 billion in net interest in 2018 according to the congressional budget office which forecasts that number to jump to 383 billion in 2019 and 928 billion in 2029 under current law as a percentage of gross domestic product that will approach levels not seen since the 1980s when interest rates the cost per unit of debt were spiraling out of control interest rates are rising slowly now as the federal reserve tapers off a period of near zero rates but they remain low it s also unusual at a time when the economy is in very good shape raising the question of what happens when the government has to spend its way out of the next recession if we go through a business cycle and we re starting at this level then the business cycle would lead to very large deficits said cbo director keith hall at a briefing with reporters last month i think that s a concern as a risk going forward however it still could be worth it to rack up debt and pay a lot in interest if what the government is spending money on generates a larger economic return than the cost of credit a shift in the economic winds in recent months economists have been taking another look at their longstanding consensus that high debt levels are unequivocally bad for economic growth a view that led to austerity budgets in both the united states and europe following the great recession which may have slowed the recovery voices on the left have been arguing that governments can spend as much as they want in their own currency and control inflation through taxation that philosophy is known as modern monetary theory and it has been used to explain how large spending programs such as student debt relief or the green new deal might be funded most economists don t go that far but they have been cautioning over high debt levels that get out of hand a few weeks ago former obama administration economic policy officials larry summers and jason furman made the case in foreign policy that high deficits should not be used as an excuse to cut social programs like medicare and social security and that the federal government should instead find ways to recover revenues lost to generations of tax cuts and at the american economics association s conference in january former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard delivered a keynote speech theorizing that debt might not be a problem as long as interest rates are reasonably low as they have been for decades now and government is using the money on projects that boost productivity such as education and infrastructure both the fiscal and welfare costs of debt may then be small smaller than is generally taken as given in current policy discussions blanchard wrote in a paper describing the argument
expand ap photo julio cortez last month our president told 800 000 federal employees to make do without paychecks for 35 days full time workers lined up at soup kitchens families frantically begged for loan deferments credit extensions and acts of mercy from their banks air traffic controllers put in ten hour shifts then worked as uber drivers to make ends meet the contract workers who clean government offices guard government doors and serve government meals are still not guaranteed one cent of the pay they missed the january shutdown bore all the ugly hallmarks of the trump presidency from overt racism to tone deaf privilege and beneath it all an administration that sees the livelihood of ordinary americans as a bargaining chip they are willing to trade away for our president it was the latest notch in the belt of a man who has broken every populist promise he made elections and history will put him in his rightful place for our country however the past month was one chapter in a saga that began long before donald trump and that demands an equally profound reckoning the mounting injustice of our modern economy it s a story about gdp or stock prices or innovation it s also the story of a global superpower where 18 5 million people live in deep poverty where we reward vast wealth with tax cuts loopholes and endless ways to ensure dollars earn more dollars but value actual labor at only 7 25 an hour a place whose laws steadfastly protect multinational corporations like philips lighting and general motors when they harvest millions from government tax cuts while laying off workers from fall river to detroit but where laws stand idle when a farmworker in the yakima valley or a waitress in boston are forced to work overtime without pay when a housekeeper in phoenix faces sexual violence on the job when fedex and uber misclassify drivers to evade giving them basic benefits when jiffy lube destroys their workers leverage to negotiate better wages and walmart refuses accommodations for pregnant workers and fast food franchises deny their employees predictable hours here our medical innovations subsidize global health but our citizens die rationing insulin they can t afford here we dehumanize immigrants with one hand while exploiting their cheap labor with the other here we let redlines course through housing markets and neighborhoods segregating schools 50 years after jim crow we subject the poor to endless tests of character for our taxes to cover their next hot meal but the rich face no such scrutiny when our taxes float their stock prices we let the wealthy divert and dilute resources from public schools public transit and public housing meant to level the inevitable tip of capitalist scales and then criminalize the marginalized when they can t hang on this is the story of our modern economy and of a government that aided abetted and encouraged its rise it is the challenge of our time american capitalism has undeniably done more good for more people than any other economic system but capitalism as we know it today is badly broken and rightfully under attack the sooner we confront that the sooner we can strip it to the studs and build something better a moral capitalism judged not by how much it produces but how broadly it empowers backed by a government unafraid to set the conditions for fair and just markets today the united states government is called to be an economic activist to remedy the injustice it has let fester on its watch to jump off the sidelines of an economy with the highest disparities of almost any advanced nation on earth and demand with the full force of its mighty laws that we do better first our government must aggressively address and redress economic abuse decades of trickle down dogma created a tsunami of deregulation union busting and rampant consolidation that destroyed any semblance of balance between corporate power and worker clout reform efforts should end predatory corporate practices from non competes and no poach agreements to outdated antitrust laws that have failed to check the consequences of monopoly power for both consumers and employees congress must flex its muscles and actively disincentivize the shareholder first mentality that gave corporate america over 1 trillion in stock buybacks last year while working america got pink slips instead we must defend a system of fair taxation that demands significantly more from those at the top particular industries require extra vigilance from the technology companies that commoditize our data invade our privacy and endanger our democracy to the pharmaceutical companies that price patients out of life saving treatment strong and smart regulation is not a weight on growth but a necessary condition for a capitalist system capable and worthy of survival unfortunately economic abuse has not just been perpetrated by private hands our public sector shares blame creating and condoning discriminatory systems that keep people of color women the lgbtq community the disabled and others under a heavy economic thumb racist housing policies segregation of neighborhoods and schools a broken criminal justice system and inequitable delivery of federal dollars make it nearly impossible for black america and other historically oppressed communities to survive compete and build wealth just 15 percent of the nearly 550 billion our government issued in contracts last year went to minority and women owned businesses that s not opportunity building it s opportunity hoarding for those already in the driver s seat of our economy second government must be a fierce guarantor of economic protection from independent contracting to low wage job growth and gig employment our federal labor protections have failed to keep pace with the economic reality for most american workers we need to catch up that means a livable minimum wage health insurance detached from employment status paid family and sick leave and a massive expansion of the number of americans assured these benefits in a modern economy it means anti discrimination laws that apply to all a full throated defense of a worker s right to organize unionize and strike and a justice system that protects class action ends forced arbitration and promises recourse to any who are wronged or abused third government must be a reliable supplier of public goods from primary and secondary education to infrastructure and national defense we operate robust public systems for that which we deem essential to our national interest which makes their equitable and universal delivery worthy of public investment however we fail to extend this mentality to two systems american families most depend on health care and child care existing federal structures barely touch the level of need at a time when the vast majority of parents work outside the home our current child tax credit gives eligible families already a tiny sliver of the country 2 000 a year at most to defray costs meanwhile the annual price tag of full time infant care in massachusetts is over 17 000 higher than in state tuition at our public university and the devastating inequities of american health care grow more painful by the day with gofundme pages becoming as common as insurance coverage it is time to create universal public systems for both health care and child care where access isn t restricted by employment income or geography and where affordability comes with a government guarantee finally government must mobilize our economy around our national interest in recent decades washington has taken a stubbornly passive approach to economic mobilization time and again deferring to market forces corporate profit and private instincts not since the great society have we proactively channeled our economic might toward higher nobler needs health safety security and livelihood but today a threat at our doorstep gives us the opportunity to change that climate change an arrow aimed at all of us but striking hardest where government insufficiency always does those we have historically repressed or systemically left behind black and brown indigenous and appalachian cancer alley eastern kentucky puerto rico where people are more likely to live near toxic facilities or environmental waste and less likely to have access to the health care and legal advocacy necessary to survive more likely to be paralyzed by disruptions to public services when violent storms and floods and fires sweep through and less likely to have the resources to recover more likely to see their jobs decimated by our changing energy landscape and less likely to reap the benefits of new technology innovation and industry from environmental crisis to economic exclusion climate change exemplifies the far reaching failures of a government that has refused to marshal its resources toward the common good leaving its citizens vulnerable and inequities deeply rooted but this is also an opportunity to put moral capitalism into action we should heed the call for a green new deal and other aggressive climate strategies championed by lifelong advocates activists and elected leaders these solutions move beyond singular policy reforms and mobilize a nationwide response to a worldwide crisis they demand we do more than just react to economic winds but sound a public call to arms across our entire economy new jobs new technology new education new industry all powerfully backed by the united states government and aimed at a threat none of us will escape done right done well and done boldly our climate efforts could reorient our economy around common good shared survival and a future with space for all this is the level of public activism our broken economy demands and our people deserve and at this particular moment in history we are reminded of exactly what happens if we take another path if we choose not to act someone else will three years ago a man named donald trump usurped america s economic story he offered a simple explanation for the hurt so many carry it s the other guy s fault the brown guy the immigrant the gay one the woman that one over there who looks different and sounds funny he like many an aristocrat and supremacist before him deftly turned us on each other defusing the force that abusers of privilege fear most solidarity among the people they oppress so americans today fight each other over the scraps of our system instead of uniting to fight a system that finds them worthy of only scraps to begin with a system that fails the coal miner in harlan forced to defend his hard earned pensionandthe nanny in the bronx battling for basic benefits that siphons the livelihood of the fifth generation dairy farm in oshkosh and the first generation immigrant business in el paso that ignores the profound human cost of poverty on the reservation in south dakota and the depleted communities of appalachia their stories are different their experiences distinct but they share the burden of a system that leaves most americans behind they hail from places where polling locations suddenly disappear where payday lenders prey on local economies where lead poisons children s water where neighborhoods spend years fighting injustice on their own before anyone in power shows up they disproportionately shoulder the hard words that make life hurt eviction pollution addiction bankruptcy violence they bear the swollen stubborn scars of a government that has for much of a half century abdicated its role as guarantor of economic equity and a country that has made it difficult to be middle class excruciating to be poor and downright impossible to be poor and poor and black poor and brown poor and female poor and gay poor and sick or old or addicted president trump has spent two years amassing these economic casualties he has built bunkers of privilege throughout government mighty fortresses from which he takes aim at those with no shield but we don t stand a chance against him until we come together to neutralize the weapon he depends on most an economy that keeps most american families hanging on by the skin of their teeth

arabia president and chief executive officer bryan giglia chief financial officer and marc hoffman chief operating officer after our remarks we will be available to answer your questions with that i would like to turn the call over to john please go ahead john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you aaron good morning everybody and thank you for joining us this morning i d like to start off our call today with a recap of a successful 2018 which included a continued transformation of our portfolio as well as better than expected fourth quarter and full year operating results and earnings i ll then provide our thoughts on the 2019 operating environment an update on the transaction market and our thoughts on deploying the significant capacity we have built afterwards bryan will recap our balance sheet strength and provide the specifics of our initial 2019 guidance let s begin with a recap of a successful 2019 2018 excuse me in 2018 we continue to concentrate our portfolio into the ownership of long term relevant real estate while we were disappointed that we did not complete a hotel acquisition in 2018 we materially improved our portfolio through the sale of six primarily suburban non core assets as well as the acquisition of a ground lease and other lease spaces at two of our existing hotels we sold these six hotels including the sale of the marriott tysons corner in december for a combined 353 million at a blended trailing cap rate of 8 4 this blended cap rate on the asset sold is not too dissimilar to the approximately 8 implied cap rate of our portfolio when we finished the year that said we view these six hotels which included one short term ground lease to be some of the lowest quality assets within our portfolio and our strategy in terms of their long term relevance and economic earnings growth potential while revpar comparisons don t always tell the full picture it is worthwhile to note that the combined prior year revpar and ebitda per key at these six hotels were approximately 44 lower and 50 lower respectively than the remaining in place portfolio these transactions bring our total dispositions to approximately 1 1 billion since we began our strategic disposition program and those sales were completed at a strong trailing ebitda multiple of approximately 15 times these sales not only leave us with a higher quality portfolio with stronger long term earnings prospects but they have also provided us with significant financial flexibility and optionality which we will discuss in greater detail in a moment in addition to these asset dispositions we completed two relatively small but important real estate investments during 2018 the first was the acquisition of the lease fee interest in the land underlying the j underlying our jw marriott new orleans with ownership of both the fee and the leasehold we now own 100 of the asset and its economics into perpetuity the second transaction was the acquisition of the exclusive perpetual rights to a small portion of the renaissance washington dc meeting space and fitness center that were previously leased both of these acquisitions reduced our annualized ground lease payments by approximately 1 9 million but more importantly improved the lasting value of both of these hotels i m very pleased to report that the percentage of hotel ebitda from hotels subject to a ground or air rights lease is now approximately 18 compared to roughly 50 several years ago similarly we continue to make proactive investments within our portfolio that are expected to generate earnings growth in 2019 and beyond in 2018 we completed over 150 million of capital improvements throughout our portfolio with the details of many of these projects highlighted in previous quarters the most meaningful improvements occurred at the marriott boston long wharf as renovation included a full redesign of the guest rooms the creation of a larger bi level m club a lobby refresh and the addition of three new keys as well as the jw new orleans this renovation also included full redesign of the guest rooms as well as enlarging many of the bathrooms and converting a majority of the bathtub to showers other rooms renovations on smaller and more routine scale included the renaissance lax and the concierge s level and suites at the hyatt regency san francisco both completed in the first half of 2018 another early 2018 project was the conversion of 8 000 square feet of vacant retail space and the meeting space at boston park plaza which has ramped up nicely and has been a key selling point since opening in orlando our new 46 000 square foot state of the art meeting space opened in january of 2019 and absolutely looks fantastic the new space has already hosted several groups and the feedback so far has been incredible resulting in immediate rebooking of the same business in future years furthermore we invested over 4 million in a variety of environmental and sustainability projects during 2018 including led lighting retrofits installing variable frequency mechanical equipment and smart sensors to reduce overall energy consumption and our largest project converting steam boilers in baltimore to natural gas these projects not only produce attractive returns but also reduce the environmental impact of our properties we will continue these important investments into 2019 and beyond with several solar projects on the horizon we are also pleased with our solar projects on the horizon we re also pleased with our operating results and earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year 2018 despite heavier than normal renovation disruption earlier in the year revpar and comparable property level revenues for our 21 hotels both increased 5 6 in the fourth quarter bringing our full year revpar and comparable property level revenue growth to 2 8 and 3 7 respectively both the fourth quarter and full year revenue results exceeded our expectations and were driven by respectable room rate growth in both group and transient segments of demand as well as very strong growth including beverage revenue and other property level income comparable hotel ebitda growth increased by 7 in the fourth quarter and by 2 for the full year hotel profits were negatively impacted by cost pressures in wages benefits and property taxes nevertheless comparable hotel level ebitda exceeded our expectations for both the fourth quarter and full year resulting in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo per diluted share that exceeded the high end of our most recent guidance as is normally the case there was a mix of both positive and negative operating trends in 2018 in general operating results proved to be weaker than expected at our hotels in washington dc boston and los angeles and the magnitude of wage growth in most hotels was higher than anticipated as we made proactive and meaningful wage adjustments at most of our hotels in 2018 that said our hotels in chicago new york san francisco and wailea surprises to the upside as did food and beverage income which increased nearly 5 over 2017 and other property level revenues which increased nearly 8 while not everything went our way we are very pleased with the overall accomplishments and operating performance in 2018 so let s talk a bit about our expectations for 2019 while there is likely a wide range of potential outcomes it appears that the most likely outcome for the operating environment is more or less the same as we have recently witnessed that is our baseline assumption is modest growth in portfolio revpar and total hotel revenues with continued cost pressures primarily in wages and benefits that will make it difficult to maintain hotel ebitda margins without creating problems with guests associates with a physical plant down the road as we ve discussed on recent earnings calls we expect boston chicago washington dc and portland to face notable headwinds specifically difficult citywide calendars and or the addition of new supply while we expect our hotels in san francisco wailea key west and orlando to post respectable growth it should also be noted that our recently completed renovations and additions at the marriott boston long wharf the jw new orleans and the renaissance orlando to result in revpar growth levels meaningfully in excess of market growth rates at the end of december our 2019 group pace for the entire portfolio was up nearly 1 and we have roughly 76 of our group rooms already on the books the midpoint of our guidance calls for revpar growth of 1 5 ebitda margin contraction of roughly 50 basis points and comparable hotel ebitda to remain generally flat to last year if operation surprises to the upside like they did last year we could very well exceed both the top line and margin expectations bryan will provide more details on our 2019 guidance in just a moment so let s talk a bit about the current investment environment during 2018 we actively underwrote several billion dollars of single asset and portfolio investments we bid on several of these potential investments but in the end we are not willing to pay the prices needed to win several transactions pricing expectations for high quality assets that fit our strategy have increased in the past year and translate into cap rates after property tax resets below 5 in most cases and in many cases cap rates in the mid 3 to mid 4 range pricing expectations by sellers have recently corresponded to values per key that in some instances are approaching or exceeding replacement cost while acquiring hotels at such pricing with cash on hand would obviously be accretive to near term ffo per share and likely applauded by some in the investment community we have found pricing to be difficult to justify that is we do not believe that paying such a low cap rate on many of these opportunities particularly on stabilized assets would result in any level of growth in our nav per share over time in fact the opposite may eventually be true as a result we have not bought a hotel recently despite a significant level of underwriting activity and a fortress balance sheet in which to fund such investments looking forward we continue to expect to underwrite new investments and remain hopeful that we will find the right investments that will add to our shareholder value over time while at the same time we expect methodically dispose of a handful of remaining hotels that do not fit our strategy if we can get reasonable prices in the end we believe our patience will be rewarded with that i ll turn the call over to bryan bryan please go ahead bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thank you john and good morning everyone we ended 2018 with significant financial liquidity including more than 680 million of total adjusted unrestricted cash and a recently amended an undrawn 500 million revolving credit facility as of the end of the fourth quarter we had approximately 1 2 billion of consolidated debt and preferred securities outstanding and our current in place debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 5 1 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4 2 our variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt stands at 22 and 43 of our debt is unsecured we have 16 unencumbered hotels that collectively generated 225 million of ebitda during 2018 and nearly 67 of our ebitda is unencumbered now turning to first quarter and full year 2018 guidance 2019 guidance a full reconciliation can be found in our supplemental and in our earnings release to the first quarter driven by 2018 displacement comp and a very strong san francisco market we expect total portfolio revpar to grow between 2 5 and 4 5 we expect first quarter adjusted ebitda to be between 59 million and 62 million and adjusted ffo per diluted share to be between 0 18 and 0 20 for the full year we expect our total portfolio revpar growth to range from flat to positive 3 our full year 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance ranges from 300 million to 324 million and our full year adjusted ffo per diluted share ranges from 1 01 to 1 11 our outlook for 2019 includes approximately 4 million to 5 million of total revenue displacement and approximately 3 million to 4 million of ebitda displacement related to our planned 2019 capital investment projects on a year over year basis we expect 2019 ebitda displacement to be approximately 3 million to 4 million less than what we realized in 2018 finally this guidance reflects our existing 21 hotel portfolio and does not assume any additional hotel dispositions nor does it reflect the incremental future earnings potential that would result from the deployment of our meaningful cash balance now turning to our dividends our board of directors has declared a 0 05 per common share dividend for the first quarter consistent with our practice in prior years we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0 05 per share of common stock throughout 2019 and to the extent that the regular quarterly common dividend do not satisfy our annual distribution requirements for 2019 we would expect to pay a catch up dividend that would generally be equal to our remaining taxable income our total cash dividend for 2018 including our fourth quarter catch up dividend equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 4 in addition to common dividends our board has also approved the routine quarterly distributions for both outstanding series of our preferred securities with that i d like to now open the call to questions ryan please go ahead questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions okay we will take our first question from jeff donnelly with wells fargo please go ahead jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst good morning out there guys maybe a first question for you bryan can you give us maybe some more specificity around some of the underlying assumptions that you made in your 2019 budget like specifically maybe what you guys are assuming for growth in your payroll costs or maybe some assumptions that you re making in some of the i guess i ll say the hotter markets like hawaii and san francisco for revpar growth bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer sure good morning jeff starting on the top line and looking throughout the year q1 will be is expected to be the strongest that is driven off of the comp from the 2018 displacement which was heavy in long wharf and then also san francisco will have its strongest quarter in q1 i think that s really driving the stronger growth for that quarter when we look at expenses across the board looking at the departmental expenses salary and wages we expect to be up in the 3 to 5 range benefits a little north of that we do think that group commissions will start to flatten or even come down a little bit this year and transient commission should be kind of flat to up a few percent in line with revenue growth when we look at some of the other fixed costs typically what you see around this time are the real estate taxes tend to flatten a little bit as you get later in the cycle as we saw last year and our expectations for this year we re taking a pretty conservative approach to that expecting to have more pressure on real estate taxes as municipalities look for additional revenues on the ground rents with the acquisition of the space in dc last year and jw we don t expect to see growth there we actually see it s actually declined a little bit and then on the insurance front when there were even though there were no or we didn t have any cat claims last year just looking at the impact over the last couple of years our expense our expectation is that that expense will grow more than inflationary amount i think the prior year we were up around kind of around 10 we ll probably see that same growth in 2019 jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst yeah that s really really helpful thank you and i guess on san francisco can you guys talk about how that market has been performing versus your expectation in the first month or two of the year or throughout the year i should say john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah jeff as bryan said the first quarter of the year is particularly strong with a couple of groups in house we didn t anticipate that the overall year for 2017 is actually going to be very strong so probably one of our stronger markets this year jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst and just last question for you john i guess as you sit here today i mean how do you rank your major demand segments for 2019 group leisure corporate transient it sounds like from your remarks that your group segment might actually be a i guess a laggard relative to your revpar guidance if i heard that right but i d like your thoughts john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah they are all about the same i mean group so far in is the overall portfolio is up about 1 in pace keep in mind jeff there s a couple of markets out there that we ve actually taken down our group business for example one of our very key resorts we just we re taking on what we think is the right strategy from a pricing standpoint and because a couple of our competitors will be under renovation and we are taking on a greater transient strategy this year which we think is very important so there s always a little bit of noise there but overall it s just kind of some of the same trends that we ve seen that overall pricing in group transient and leisure are all pretty good jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst okay great thanks guys bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thanks jeff operator thank you we will take our next question from shaun kelly with bank of america please go ahead shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone john in the prepared remarks you mentioned a sense about proactive and meaningful wage adjustments you made in 2018 and i think we re all aware of some of the just broader headline cost pressures but i was wondering if you could just elaborate on that a little bit specifically kind of what did you see was it market specific was it minimum wage driven i mean we know you re not usually an employer there but was it pressure from lower end employers pushing up through the kind of the food chain or what exactly did you see throughout the year john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah i would say it s fairly broad based and i would think it s very typical of where we generally sit in the cycle with unemployment at the levels that it is particularly shaun we saw in certain markets where there was incremental hotel supply or just cost of living was increasing in order to retain motivate quality people and deliver the service levels we re looking for the right thing to do was to make in some cases a couple of proactive wage adjustments last year i think we re ahead of the curve on that a little bit we ll see i would anticipate those some of the same trends going into 2019 with the labor market the way it is it s the right thing to do but we saw it was fairly broad based and throughout the team members meaning from entry level all the way up through management i would say it was pretty broad based shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just any quantification you provide is just directionally on i guess purely your wage related or wage and benefits line how much that was up in 2018 over 2017 was that materially higher than what you saw in let s call it in 2017 over 2016 bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer hey shaun it s byran in 2018 we saw john v arabia president chief executive officer shaun i think it was up about 4 to 5 in 2018 bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer yeah which was considerably more than it was in 2017 and part of that were some of the wage adjustments that john talked about additionally the benefits have continued to increase pretty materially in the probably kind of 4 to 6 range over the last several years john v arabia president chief executive officer and shaun i think it s important to note that look we work with our operators in a very specific way in trying to do the right things trying to retain the best employees there s other folks that we ve seen out there that i think will take a more draconian view and try and squeeze every last penny out of their hotels we don t think that that s a right long term winning strategy and so our asset management team working with our operators made several of those adjustments over the past year we will anticipate more we think it s a right thing to do the fair thing to do but we also think it s the right business decision long term for our assets shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst great last question for me just and maybe just switch gears a little bit would be on obviously you saw some marriott exposure marriott had a few different kind of headline issues between the third and fourth quarters in particular around the data breach and what s going on with sort of the expedia negotiation and then of course some of the transition and integration around the starwood merger just curious on your own experience there anything that was a notable drag or call out how you ve been working with them sort of et cetera how did that side of the or that how did they perform for you in the fourth quarter john v arabia president chief executive officer overall taking out some of the market specific factors which are always going to be the case and should be excluded our relationship with marriott is strong we didn t have any of the material integration issues that i think some have talked about as we did not have starwood assets coming on legacy starwood assets coming over into the marriott systems our relationship is one where we work with them on things that we need to work on but other than that nothing for sunstone to call out that i would mark as negative in terms of recent results shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst helpful thank you very much john v arabia president chief executive officer thanks shaun operator thank you we will take our next question from anthony powell with barclays please go ahead anthony f powell barclays analyst hi good morning guys you mentioned that pricing had gone up throughout the year in terms of transactions that you were looking at did that change at all over the past couple of months say starting in december when you started to see the overall market volatility john v arabia president chief executive officer no it really hasn t the private markets the transaction markets don t move as quickly as the public markets as you would expect and so what we ve seen and it s not like we have a robust number of data points anthony on that that they re coming in every month or every week but in general i d say it s pricing expectations and i want to clarify pricing expectations versus pricing on closed transactions but pricing those pricing expectations for several assets have been in our view pretty robust anthony f powell barclays analyst got it thanks and i think several of your peers have gone into the buyback market in recent months i know you have something in place but haven t used it yet what s your kind of view on buybacks for this part of the cycle john v arabia president chief executive officer buybacks will be we think will be an important capital allocation tool over time we have a sizable authorization in place we clearly have a significant amount of capacity it s something that we as a management team and a board speak about robustly and regularly i do think it s a capital allocation tool i don t view it as a signaling tool so at the right time i think you ll see that as one of the strategies we employ from a capital allocation perspective anthony f powell barclays analyst thanks and one more on the non core asset sales you said there are a handful left could you maybe drill the number down into just an exact maybe not an exact number but is it one two three four and would those be sold this year or is that something that you want to look to do over the next couple of years john v arabia president chief executive officer no that s something still under evaluation i think it s just it s a small number of hotels that we will continue to evaluate but we have not made any strategic decisions on any one of those again we don t need the capital but eventually we d like to continue to advance our overall stated objectives so but just like we said in this past year in selling some of those assets they are relatively small in terms of total dollars particularly when you compare some of the assets to those the larger long term relevant assets within our portfolio that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars each so i d say it s relatively small anthony f powell barclays analyst right thank you good quarter bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator thank you we will take our next question from chris woronka with deutsche bank please go ahead chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys i guess you came in about 0 5 point in terms of full year 2018 you came in about 0 5 point above the high end of your full year guidance initially what do you think kind of drove that was it conservatism or wailea or group strength or something else bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer well chris first of all with guidance i think what we always do is we want to provide guidance that we believe based on the information we have at that time is achievable and we want to balance the degree of conservatism and providing reasonable achievable guidance when you look at the initial guidance for 2018 there were some negative revpar hotels that were sold throughout the year so that moved the number up and i think if you look at where we we ve said are adjusted for those sales as of last quarter where we were going to end we came just inside of that high end on the revpar guidance and so part of that beating the initial guidance was is just a function of the asset sales and those being lower revpar and lower revpar growth or negative growth assets chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay fair enough and then want to ask about the kind of the non room revenues that s been a big source of strength for you guys and some of your peers and can that same pace continue this year and what can you give us a little bit more granularity on is it f b is it fees is it something else marc a hoffman executive vice president chief operating officer hey chris it s marc yeah we had a good strong quarter in the year in food and beverage contribution again as we get later in the cycle the food and beverage contribution will stabilize and then we ve had good success with capturing our fees as we ve continued our growth and ramp up with fees in our group hotels with marriott and in wailea chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay great and then just going back to the transaction market i totally understand the commentary about the pricing is there do you think there there are any opportunities where you guys can take a different view on a market or a specific asset where you can underwrite much stronger growth or some kind of repositioning or have those kind of also dried up recently john v arabia president chief executive officer no we would take on chris it s john we would take on some type of repositioning even if it s viewed as late in the cycle particularly by the time that one would think by the time we actually get around to doing all the planning and executing on it it could be actually a great time to do a deeper renovation that doesn t scare us away if we believe that the long term value creation elements are in place those have so far those have been a little bit difficult to secure and we have bid on a couple of those but it s not the only thing we ve bid on as well chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay very good thanks guys john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you we will take our next question from bill crow with raymond james please go ahead william a crow raymond james analyst hey good morning john and bryan appreciate the time a couple of questions john how are you thinking about g a as you continue to shrink the company john v arabia president chief executive officer something to be mindful of but honestly in where i think the company is going over the long term maintaining not only the right financial capital but the right human capital is very important and if the markets worked out the way i think they might over the next several years i want to clearly keep a robust team with our capabilities in place that have the capabilities to enact our strategy with numerous different tactics so i think it s fine william a crow raymond james analyst okay and then i think about your dispositions to date it really started i think in earnest with the terrific sale up in new york and i m just curious it seems like and that was a while go now it seems like it would have been easier to put the money out than certainly it is today given your comments on where cap rates have gone is that fair and so that was it kind of a window there that that maybe some should have gotten done but didn t get done john v arabia president chief executive officer looking back i am sure there are always assets that we pushed hard for that didn t swing our way or that others ended up in others hands for various set of reasons sometimes not always financial i think that might be fair bill if i look back there might be an asset or two that i kind of wish that we now owned but that is it is what it is you have to make those decisions along the way but i would agree with you that pricing expectations in our view have only become more robust despite the fact that at least we believe we re later in the cycle and factually several of those same assets have only produced more and more noi on the bottom line so that s the part that in our view is the real dilemma william a crow raymond james analyst yeah okay that s it from me appreciate it john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you sir operator thank you we will take our next question from michael bellisario with baird please go ahead michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst good morning guys john v arabia president chief executive officer hi mike michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst i wanted to dig a little bit deeper just on that buyback topic maybe drill down can you help us reconcile i know you mentioned an 8 implied cap rate on your stock at the end of the year kind of help us bridge that number to the 3 5 4 5 5 cap rate deals that you were evaluating and kind of really help us think about the delta there and maybe where we might be missing the value within your portfolio versus the 8 cap you quoted and not pulling the trigger on the buyback side john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah great question michael a couple of thoughts first those are pricing with the cap rates that i had mentioned are pricing expectations on assets that have come out over the last several months kind of in the mid 4 ish after property tax resets some lower than that some a little bit higher than that those have not several of those have not closed so we will see where the actual pricing comes in two i would say that not every single property within our portfolio we would have such levels of expectations or whether or not those levels are justified but i think where you re going and the reason i put that in the prepared remarks was there was a time when right when we sold the marriott tysons corner a fine hotel we sold that at an 8 2 cap on trailing in december i think right around that same week when our shares were weaker than they are today we were trading at roughly an 8 2 cap which is at least if nothing else intellectually interesting considering we view that hotel as and the other five that we sold last year to be in the bottom seven or eight of our total portfolio when we take a look at the assets that are completely on strategy those are several several hundred basis points lower if we were to transact on them so what does that all mean i think that there is a disconnect between public and private market pricing i think it s also at least intellectually stimulating to say how will that eventually break such a wide discrepancy between public and private market pricing doesn t last forever and both markets cannot be right so what i like about where we currently sit is we have a lot of optionality we don t need to access the equity markets we have a considerable amount of financial strength and human strength human capital and we are actively underwriting but at the same time we are going to be patience to make sure that we re not just moving for the sake of motion sake but we eventually create value with that optionality that we have built up and i think where you re going with your question or to build on the question before share repurchase is very much on the table michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst that s helpful and then just on the deals that you did underwrite call it 4 5 cap kind of deals what do you think those unlevered yields are pricing to and have you missed deals by a wider margin more recently than you were in the middle of the year has that changed at all john v arabia president chief executive officer not too many data points to be so specific about it i don t know what the under i can tell you what we think at that pricing the unlevered returns are but you have to keep in mind that we anticipate or we at least underwrite downturns in our underwriting now maybe that s going to be the biggest hurdle for us putting money to work in the short term but i think it s a fair discipline unless you believe that we are that this is going to be some 20 year cycle so my guess is if you re starting out at that point it s difficult to underwrite cap rate compression at the end of your whole period but even if you assume some level of growth long term growth even at inflation which i think for some assets is difficult you re probably talking about unlevered return expectations and maybe 6 5 5 6 which would probably be the lowest i have ever seen in my career michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then relative to that you guys would go down or reflect as far as 7 5 8 what s kind of your threshold there john v arabia president chief executive officer it s hard to tell but i think that somewhere in the 8 s range is probably if we triangulate at what irrs or unlevered irrs were for real estate and add a premium to that for hospitality probably somewhere in there although that s arguable michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst that s helpful thank you john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you operator okay we ll take our next question from smedes rose with citi please go ahead smedes rose citi analyst hi thanks john i just wanted to ask you a little bit on the language around your guidance where you mentioned the residual impact from the government shutdown does that mean you are have seen impact and it s already factored into your first quarter outlook or you just you haven t seen anything and you re not expecting to see anything i mean and if john v arabia president chief executive officer no we saw is that during and in some residual impact of government shutdown we saw several hundred thousand dollars of total revenue it wasn t only in dc we saw it in san diego we saw it in san francisco with a couple of small group cancellations or wider attrition but it was several hundred thousand dollars of revenue which we have in our first quarter guidance already so we i think we had said something the effect of residual or new impact our only fear was if there is a material government shutdown for a long period of time then obviously that would provide an extra weight on our operations that weren t considered within our guidance smedes rose citi analyst okay thank you for the clarification i also wanted to ask you on the san diego hilton numbers there at least relative to our expectations were significantly better on the revpar side is that more just related to the timing of maybe group business for the year or is there something going on at that property that s just putting it on a sustainably higher growth trajectory john v arabia president chief executive officer no it was all related to a very strong group base for q4 smedes rose citi analyst great okay thank you bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thanks smedes operator thank you we will take our next question from stephen grambling with goldman sachs please go ahead stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst hey thanks i guess just a follow up on some of the earlier questions on the transaction environment i guess when you see the 3 to 4 cap rates are those generally being completed by a very consistent type of buyer or has that evolved and are the assets typically at for whatever reason you think abnormally low margins or have some sort of hiccup are these actually relatively healthy growing assets john v arabia president chief executive officer very high quality by the way not assets that are have closed yet but assets that are in the market with pricing expectations and so we will see where those assets or others that could potentially be coming to market see where those pricing expectations are and then see who the buyers are if they transact at those levels but generally very high quality completely on strategy assets for us stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst great and then would you say anything in the environment has changed your thinking around the decision to flag as a brand versus independent as you think over a longer timeframe thanks john v arabia president chief executive officer any specific asset or in general stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst yeah more i realize that there can be differences on a market by market basis but if we think more broadly are there trends that you re seeing where you d say in general it s becoming more attractive to be independent versus brand john v arabia president chief executive officer not necessarily i think it really depends on the asset in the market and then will also depend on the operating partner which will be a important element of that the good news is is i think we have the optionality to do both well we have a couple of independent hotels i wouldn t be surprised over time if we add more but there are certain hotels in certain markets that really benefit from a flag and quite honestly sometimes benefit from a being managed by marriott hilton or hyatt so it really just depends in some respects we re a little agnostic but it depends stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst fair enough i guess maybe trying to dig in a little bit more on the distribution side have you seen distribution costs when you re looking at your branded versus independent hotels narrow john v arabia president chief executive officer well yeah distribution costs so far we have seen and i ll turn it over to marc in a second but overall distribution costs in some of our branded hotels have clearly benefited and i have said this on other calls but i want to thank in particular marriott and hilton for leading that charge and showing great leadership in our industry in fixing what i ve referred to in the past as one of our greatest self inflicted wounds marc a hoffman executive vice president chief operating officer yeah i mean obviously the biggest move is the group distribution flattening the three major brands to 7 and while there was a little bit of noise throughout 2018 as they went at different times we feel that as we move into 2019 and beyond we will continue to see meaningful declines in those costs we continue to see transient commissions rise but again the marriott and hilton work and particularly as we ve seen with negotiations with expedia coming more down the pipe we think that hopefully those will slow in their growth more than anything else stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst great thanks so much operator thank you we will take our next question from david katz with jefferies please go ahead david katz jefferies llc analyst hi afternoon everyone or good morning thanks for all the detail and the information what i wanted to ask about is looking at the valuation range of the publicly traded population periodically the discussion of m a comes up how would you feel about the arguments that given valuation given balance sheet and given core strengths you might be well positioned as an acquirer under the current circumstances john v arabia president chief executive officer i do think we have certain advantages i think we have been involved in discussions over the past many years in terms of m a i think given the quality of our portfolio people see the benefits they like the strategy our balance sheet obviously provides some benefit the way we look at this is first and foremost it has to fit our strategic objectives then it has to meet our financial objectives getting bigger just to get big in my opinion and i think there s a lot of research on this does nothing for you or very little for you so i would anticipate that over time there could be those conversations but we are looking for something very specific in our strategy and we will stay disciplined to that david katz jefferies llc analyst got it okay thanks for taking my question i appreciate it john v arabia president chief executive officer thanks david operator thank you we will take our next question from patrick scholes with suntrust please go ahead c patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi good morning good afternoon with you folks looking at 3 to i believe you said 3 to 5 labor cost this year and 5 benefit growth where does that put your revpar break even as far as as it relate to margins this year and how does that compare to what you were at last year thank you bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer hi patrick it s obviously going to depend on the composition of the revpar where we are cyclically it s mainly coming from primarily coming from rates and then you re going to have a different answer market by market depending on the labor cost structure of whatever the specific market taking all that and making a coming up with a guideline for our portfolio it s going to be somewhere looking at this year where we are later in the cycle where there are these cost pressures on various fronts you re looking at 3 to 4 revpar growth to maintain those margins 4 in the more expensive markets and 3 in the easier labor markets c patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay that s it thank you john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you patrick bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator thank you we will take our final question from rich hightower with evercore isi please go ahead rich hightower evercore isi analyst hey morning guys john v arabia president chief executive officer hey rich rich hightower evercore isi analyst thanks for taking my question here so i guess really quickly on the guidance given the strength that you are forecasting for the first quarter relative to the full year can you help us understand just the cadence across the remaining quarters bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer hi rich there s not a lot of variability over the remaining quarters q1 is definitely impacted benefiting from the displacement last year and then san francisco which as we get into more of our peers earning my guess is what you ll earnings you ll hear the same is that san francisco will be the strongest in q1 and so boston for us in q1 is also strong as you look past q1 then maybe q3 is probably slightly higher than the other quarters but it s pretty uniform across the board rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay that is helpful and then maybe i don t know if this is going to be possible or given that it s a small number of hotels to really get a meaningful answer here but when you when i think about revpar and margin guidance maybe independently of the renovation tailwinds that you re expecting this year which obviously you re going to be sort of chunky relative to the portfolio are you able to kind of strip those out and give us what a an adjusted same store number might be kind of all else equal if that s even possible john v arabia president chief executive officer i think we can get you close rich hold on one second rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay john v arabia president chief executive officer keep in mind rich is we re looking for some of that information keep in mind that the renovation disruption year over year is actually going to decline we were pretty heavy particularly in renovation disruption in the first half of 2018 which is also helping our year over year growth rates in 2019 in the first quarter first half so there is a little bit of a bump and we re just seeing if we got that rich hightower evercore isi analyst yeah that s exactly what i was getting at the tailwind not a headwind thanks for that john v arabia president chief executive officer it s going to help it s going to help to the tune of i think we are down in total revenues 4 million to 5 million total revenue displacement and then in the bottom line it s kind of i don t know i think we re to the benefit this year maybe 3 5 million less in ebitda disruption so that s a bit of help bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer when you look over that the year over year the 2018 displacements the 2019 displacements we re picking up about 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin benefit rich hightower evercore isi analyst got it all right thank you guys aaron reyes vice president of corporate finance thank you sir operator thank you we will take our next question from lukas hartwich with green street advisors please go ahead lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst thanks hey guys john v arabia president chief executive officer hi lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst in terms of your hey in terms of your larger renovations can you provide more color on how the returns are tracking versus your expectations john v arabia president chief executive officer so far they ve been anywhere from very good to outstanding wailea has just been a knockout particularly versus our underwriting expectations we spent we invested a little bit more than we originally thought because we saw the opportunity with the property and that asset particularly with comparable sales in the immediate market that asset i don t have a number for you lukas you could probably we give you all the information such as purchase price incremental investment earnings and then you can come up with a rough estimate of what you think the asset is worth i would say they ve been fantastic so not every single one of our renovations has been as good but i still believe that one of the hallmarks of this company is completing those things in a holistic with a holistic view at the right time and creating outsized shareholder returns lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst that s helpful i was actually just more curious about the big renovations last year in orlando and long wharf john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah i know that we have said and we still believe that orlando is orlando is easier to measure because we literally took an empty parking lot and we put in a new 46 000 square feet of space and that was easier we anticipated kind of a low teens unlevered irr on that it will take a couple of years to ramp but from what we ve seen thus far it s just we feel very good about it marc hoffman and team did just a really outstanding job on that some of the other ones i think it s more difficult to specify because for things like the jw new orleans and long wharf we were already going to renovate we needed to renovate it was really when we looked at it it was the incremental cost of instead of doing a kind of a standard marriott or jw renovation we went well above and beyond things like moving the m club to really just a spectacular space at long wharf or bumping up the bathroom walls and putting in a very luxurious bath amenity and showers those types of things the incremental return we felt comfortable with in terms of being able to achieve greater index or recapturing index over time and in those we thought that they were although it s a lot more art than science we thought that we re we were in the teens as well lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst that s helpful and then you kind of touched on this a little bit already but hopefully you can give a little more color how you approach planning for when you re planning for the intermediate term for your business i m just curious how you approach things like the length of the cycle the timing of a downturn the severity of a downturn do you run scenario analyses how do you think about those sorts of really important questions when you re planning for your business john v arabia president chief executive officer it s look first of all nobody knows right all the best modeling in the world and you are still probably going to be off or wrong in terms of the timing the magnitude the duration and exactly how it s going to impact your business however we this is something that we debate regularly in fact we re debating it now on a quarterly basis within our own team it s something that we discuss meaningfully with our board discuss openly with our shareholders we run various sensitivities and again lukas as i said before we understand we re going to be off but just the simple fact that we will be off doesn t mean that we can ignore a potential downturn at some point because ignoring that and assuming that just everything is going to grow from here at some long term rate we actually think that s the wrong answer so that s where we are i think in some of our conversations or on the past quarterly calls we said years and years ago we thought the downturn would be late 2018 early 2019 in fact i think our underwriting for wailea ebitda in 2018 or 2019 was something like 22 million i think we did 40 million something last year give or take so again we will be off but as long as we get the bigger picture right i think we ll be well served in our capital allocation strategies lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst great thank you john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you this now concludes the question and answer session i will turn the presentation over to john arabia john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you so much appreciate the time and the interest we are around if there is any follow up calls and wish you all a

morning i d like to start off our call today with a recap of a successful 2018 which included a continued transformation of our portfolio as well as better than expected fourth quarter and full year operating results and earnings i ll then provide our thoughts on the 2019 operating environment an update on the transaction market and our thoughts on deploying the significant capacity we have built afterwards bryan will recap our balance sheet strength and provide the specifics of our initial 2019 guidance let s begin with a recap of a successful 2019 2018 excuse me in 2018 we continue to concentrate our portfolio into the ownership of long term relevant real estate while we were disappointed that we did not complete a hotel acquisition in 2018 we materially improved our portfolio through the sale of six primarily suburban non core assets as well as the acquisition of a ground lease and other lease spaces at two of our existing hotels we sold these six hotels including the sale of the marriott tysons corner in december for a combined 353 million at a blended trailing cap rate of 8 4 this blended cap rate on the asset sold is not too dissimilar to the approximately 8 implied cap rate of our portfolio when we finished the year that said we view these six hotels which included one short term ground lease to be some of the lowest quality assets within our portfolio and our strategy in terms of their long term relevance and economic earnings growth potential while revpar comparisons don t always tell the full picture it is worthwhile to note that the combined prior year revpar and ebitda per key at these six hotels were approximately 44 lower and 50 lower respectively than the remaining in place portfolio these transactions bring our total dispositions to approximately 1 1 billion since we began our strategic disposition program and those sales were completed at a strong trailing ebitda multiple of approximately 15 times these sales not only leave us with a higher quality portfolio with stronger long term earnings prospects but they have also provided us with significant financial flexibility and optionality which we will discuss in greater detail in a moment in addition to these asset dispositions we completed two relatively small but important real estate investments during 2018 the first was the acquisition of the lease fee interest in the land underlying the j underlying our jw marriott new orleans with ownership of both the fee and the leasehold we now own 100 of the asset and its economics into perpetuity the second transaction was the acquisition of the exclusive perpetual rights to a small portion of the renaissance washington dc meeting space and fitness center that were previously leased both of these acquisitions reduced our annualized ground lease payments by approximately 1 9 million but more importantly improved the lasting value of both of these hotels i m very pleased to report that the percentage of hotel ebitda from hotels subject to a ground or air rights lease is now approximately 18 compared to roughly 50 several years ago similarly we continue to make proactive investments within our portfolio that are expected to generate earnings growth in 2019 and beyond in 2018 we completed over 150 million of capital improvements throughout our portfolio with the details of many of these projects highlighted in previous quarters the most meaningful improvements occurred at the marriott boston long wharf as renovation included a full redesign of the guest rooms the creation of a larger bi level m club a lobby refresh and the addition of three new keys as well as the jw new orleans this renovation also included full redesign of the guest rooms as well as enlarging many of the bathrooms and converting a majority of the bathtub to showers other rooms renovations on smaller and more routine scale included the renaissance lax and the concierge s level and suites at the hyatt regency san francisco both completed in the first half of 2018 another early 2018 project was the conversion of 8 000 square feet of vacant retail space and the meeting space at boston park plaza which has ramped up nicely and has been a key selling point since opening in orlando our new 46 000 square foot state of the art meeting space opened in january of 2019 and absolutely looks fantastic the new space has already hosted several groups and the feedback so far has been incredible resulting in immediate rebooking of the same business in future years furthermore we invested over 4 million in a variety of environmental and sustainability projects during 2018 including led lighting retrofits installing variable frequency mechanical equipment and smart sensors to reduce overall energy consumption and our largest project converting steam boilers in baltimore to natural gas these projects not only produce attractive returns but also reduce the environmental impact of our properties we will continue these important investments into 2019 and beyond with several solar projects on the horizon we are also pleased with our solar projects on the horizon we re also pleased with our operating results and earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year 2018 despite heavier than normal renovation disruption earlier in the year revpar and comparable property level revenues for our 21 hotels both increased 5 6 in the fourth quarter bringing our full year revpar and comparable property level revenue growth to 2 8 and 3 7 respectively both the fourth quarter and full year revenue results exceeded our expectations and were driven by respectable room rate growth in both group and transient segments of demand as well as very strong growth including beverage revenue and other property level income comparable hotel ebitda growth increased by 7 in the fourth quarter and by 2 for the full year hotel profits were negatively impacted by cost pressures in wages benefits and property taxes nevertheless comparable hotel level ebitda exceeded our expectations for both the fourth quarter and full year resulting in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ffo per diluted share that exceeded the high end of our most recent guidance as is normally the case there was a mix of both positive and negative operating trends in 2018 in general operating results proved to be weaker than expected at our hotels in washington dc boston and los angeles and the magnitude of wage growth in most hotels was higher than anticipated as we made proactive and meaningful wage adjustments at most of our hotels in 2018 that said our hotels in chicago new york san francisco and wailea surprises to the upside as did food and beverage income which increased nearly 5 over 2017 and other property level revenues which increased nearly 8 while not everything went our way we are very pleased with the overall accomplishments and operating performance in 2018 so let s talk a bit about our expectations for 2019 while there is likely a wide range of potential outcomes it appears that the most likely outcome for the operating environment is more or less the same as we have recently witnessed that is our baseline assumption is modest growth in portfolio revpar and total hotel revenues with continued cost pressures primarily in wages and benefits that will make it difficult to maintain hotel ebitda margins without creating problems with guests associates with a physical plant down the road as we ve discussed on recent earnings calls we expect boston chicago washington dc and portland to face notable headwinds specifically difficult citywide calendars and or the addition of new supply while we expect our hotels in san francisco wailea key west and orlando to post respectable growth it should also be noted that our recently completed renovations and additions at the marriott boston long wharf the jw new orleans and the renaissance orlando to result in revpar growth levels meaningfully in excess of market growth rates at the end of december our 2019 group pace for the entire portfolio was up nearly 1 and we have roughly 76 of our group rooms already on the books the midpoint of our guidance calls for revpar growth of 1 5 ebitda margin contraction of roughly 50 basis points and comparable hotel ebitda to remain generally flat to last year if operation surprises to the upside like they did last year we could very well exceed both the top line and margin expectations bryan will provide more details on our 2019 guidance in just a moment so let s talk a bit about the current investment environment during 2018 we actively underwrote several billion dollars of single asset and portfolio investments we bid on several of these potential investments but in the end we are not willing to pay the prices needed to win several transactions pricing expectations for high quality assets that fit our strategy have increased in the past year and translate into cap rates after property tax resets below 5 in most cases and in many cases cap rates in the mid 3 to mid 4 range pricing expectations by sellers have recently corresponded to values per key that in some instances are approaching or exceeding replacement cost while acquiring hotels at such pricing with cash on hand would obviously be accretive to near term ffo per share and likely applauded by some in the investment community we have found pricing to be difficult to justify that is we do not believe that paying such a low cap rate on many of these opportunities particularly on stabilized assets would result in any level of growth in our nav per share over time in fact the opposite may eventually be true as a result we have not bought a hotel recently despite a significant level of underwriting activity and a fortress balance sheet in which to fund such investments looking forward we continue to expect to underwrite new investments and remain hopeful that we will find the right investments that will add to our shareholder value over time while at the same time we expect methodically dispose of a handful of remaining hotels that do not fit our strategy if we can get reasonable prices in the end we believe our patience will be rewarded with that i ll turn the call over to bryan bryan please go ahead bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thank you john and good morning everyone we ended 2018 with significant financial liquidity including more than 680 million of total adjusted unrestricted cash and a recently amended an undrawn 500 million revolving credit facility as of the end of the fourth quarter we had approximately 1 2 billion of consolidated debt and preferred securities outstanding and our current in place debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 5 1 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4 2 our variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt stands at 22 and 43 of our debt is unsecured we have 16 unencumbered hotels that collectively generated 225 million of ebitda during 2018 and nearly 67 of our ebitda is unencumbered now turning to first quarter and full year 2018 guidance 2019 guidance a full reconciliation can be found in our supplemental and in our earnings release to the first quarter driven by 2018 displacement comp and a very strong san francisco market we expect total portfolio revpar to grow between 2 5 and 4 5 we expect first quarter adjusted ebitda to be between 59 million and 62 million and adjusted ffo per diluted share to be between 0 18 and 0 20 for the full year we expect our total portfolio revpar growth to range from flat to positive 3 our full year 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance ranges from 300 million to 324 million and our full year adjusted ffo per diluted share ranges from 1 01 to 1 11 our outlook for 2019 includes approximately 4 million to 5 million of total revenue displacement and approximately 3 million to 4 million of ebitda displacement related to our planned 2019 capital investment projects on a year over year basis we expect 2019 ebitda displacement to be approximately 3 million to 4 million less than what we realized in 2018 finally this guidance reflects our existing 21 hotel portfolio and does not assume any additional hotel dispositions nor does it reflect the incremental future earnings potential that would result from the deployment of our meaningful cash balance now turning to our dividends our board of directors has declared a 0 05 per common share dividend for the first quarter consistent with our practice in prior years we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0 05 per share of common stock throughout 2019 and to the extent that the regular quarterly common dividend do not satisfy our annual distribution requirements for 2019 we would expect to pay a catch up dividend that would generally be equal to our remaining taxable income our total cash dividend for 2018 including our fourth quarter catch up dividend equates to an annual dividend yield of approximately 4 in addition to common dividends our board has also approved the routine quarterly distributions for both outstanding series of our preferred securities with that i d like to now open the call to questions ryan please go ahead questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions okay we will take our first question from jeff donnelly with wells fargo please go ahead jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst good morning out there guys maybe a first question for you bryan can you give us maybe some more specificity around some of the underlying assumptions that you made in your 2019 budget like specifically maybe what you guys are assuming for growth in your payroll costs or maybe some assumptions that you re making in some of the i guess i ll say the hotter markets like hawaii and san francisco for revpar growth bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer sure good morning jeff starting on the top line and looking throughout the year q1 will be is expected to be the strongest that is driven off of the comp from the 2018 displacement which was heavy in long wharf and then also san francisco will have its strongest quarter in q1 i think that s really driving the stronger growth for that quarter when we look at expenses across the board looking at the departmental expenses salary and wages we expect to be up in the 3 to 5 range benefits a little north of that we do think that group commissions will start to flatten or even come down a little bit this year and transient commission should be kind of flat to up a few percent in line with revenue growth when we look at some of the other fixed costs typically what you see around this time are the real estate taxes tend to flatten a little bit as you get later in the cycle as we saw last year and our expectations for this year we re taking a pretty conservative approach to that expecting to have more pressure on real estate taxes as municipalities look for additional revenues on the ground rents with the acquisition of the space in dc last year and jw we don t expect to see growth there we actually see it s actually declined a little bit and then on the insurance front when there were even though there were no or we didn t have any cat claims last year just looking at the impact over the last couple of years our expense our expectation is that that expense will grow more than inflationary amount i think the prior year we were up around kind of around 10 we ll probably see that same growth in 2019 jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst yeah that s really really helpful thank you and i guess on san francisco can you guys talk about how that market has been performing versus your expectation in the first month or two of the year or throughout the year i should say john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah jeff as bryan said the first quarter of the year is particularly strong with a couple of groups in house we didn t anticipate that the overall year for 2017 is actually going to be very strong so probably one of our stronger markets this year jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst and just last question for you john i guess as you sit here today i mean how do you rank your major demand segments for 2019 group leisure corporate transient it sounds like from your remarks that your group segment might actually be a i guess a laggard relative to your revpar guidance if i heard that right but i d like your thoughts john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah they are all about the same i mean group so far in is the overall portfolio is up about 1 in pace keep in mind jeff there s a couple of markets out there that we ve actually taken down our group business for example one of our very key resorts we just we re taking on what we think is the right strategy from a pricing standpoint and because a couple of our competitors will be under renovation and we are taking on a greater transient strategy this year which we think is very important so there s always a little bit of noise there but overall it s just kind of some of the same trends that we ve seen that overall pricing in group transient and leisure are all pretty good jeffrey j donnelly wells fargo securities llc analyst okay great thanks guys bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thanks jeff operator thank you we will take our next question from shaun kelly with bank of america please go ahead shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone john in the prepared remarks you mentioned a sense about proactive and meaningful wage adjustments you made in 2018 and i think we re all aware of some of the just broader headline cost pressures but i was wondering if you could just elaborate on that a little bit specifically kind of what did you see was it market specific was it minimum wage driven i mean we know you re not usually an employer there but was it pressure from lower end employers pushing up through the kind of the food chain or what exactly did you see throughout the year john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah i would say it s fairly broad based and i would think it s very typical of where we generally sit in the cycle with unemployment at the levels that it is particularly shaun we saw in certain markets where there was incremental hotel supply or just cost of living was increasing in order to retain motivate quality people and deliver the service levels we re looking for the right thing to do was to make in some cases a couple of proactive wage adjustments last year i think we re ahead of the curve on that a little bit we ll see i would anticipate those some of the same trends going into 2019 with the labor market the way it is it s the right thing to do but we saw it was fairly broad based and throughout the team members meaning from entry level all the way up through management i would say it was pretty broad based shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just any quantification you provide is just directionally on i guess purely your wage related or wage and benefits line how much that was up in 2018 over 2017 was that materially higher than what you saw in let s call it in 2017 over 2016 bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer hey shaun it s byran in 2018 we saw john v arabia president chief executive officer shaun i think it was up about 4 to 5 in 2018 bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer yeah which was considerably more than it was in 2017 and part of that were some of the wage adjustments that john talked about additionally the benefits have continued to increase pretty materially in the probably kind of 4 to 6 range over the last several years john v arabia president chief executive officer and shaun i think it s important to note that look we work with our operators in a very specific way in trying to do the right things trying to retain the best employees there s other folks that we ve seen out there that i think will take a more draconian view and try and squeeze every last penny out of their hotels we don t think that that s a right long term winning strategy and so our asset management team working with our operators made several of those adjustments over the past year we will anticipate more we think it s a right thing to do the fair thing to do but we also think it s the right business decision long term for our assets shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst great last question for me just and maybe just switch gears a little bit would be on obviously you saw some marriott exposure marriott had a few different kind of headline issues between the third and fourth quarters in particular around the data breach and what s going on with sort of the expedia negotiation and then of course some of the transition and integration around the starwood merger just curious on your own experience there anything that was a notable drag or call out how you ve been working with them sort of et cetera how did that side of the or that how did they perform for you in the fourth quarter john v arabia president chief executive officer overall taking out some of the market specific factors which are always going to be the case and should be excluded our relationship with marriott is strong we didn t have any of the material integration issues that i think some have talked about as we did not have starwood assets coming on legacy starwood assets coming over into the marriott systems our relationship is one where we work with them on things that we need to work on but other than that nothing for sunstone to call out that i would mark as negative in terms of recent results shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst helpful thank you very much john v arabia president chief executive officer thanks shaun operator thank you we will take our next question from anthony powell with barclays please go ahead anthony f powell barclays analyst hi good morning guys you mentioned that pricing had gone up throughout the year in terms of transactions that you were looking at did that change at all over the past couple of months say starting in december when you started to see the overall market volatility john v arabia president chief executive officer no it really hasn t the private markets the transaction markets don t move as quickly as the public markets as you would expect and so what we ve seen and it s not like we have a robust number of data points anthony on that that they re coming in every month or every week but in general i d say it s pricing expectations and i want to clarify pricing expectations versus pricing on closed transactions but pricing those pricing expectations for several assets have been in our view pretty robust anthony f powell barclays analyst got it thanks and i think several of your peers have gone into the buyback market in recent months i know you have something in place but haven t used it yet what s your kind of view on buybacks for this part of the cycle john v arabia president chief executive officer buybacks will be we think will be an important capital allocation tool over time we have a sizable authorization in place we clearly have a significant amount of capacity it s something that we as a management team and a board speak about robustly and regularly i do think it s a capital allocation tool i don t view it as a signaling tool so at the right time i think you ll see that as one of the strategies we employ from a capital allocation perspective anthony f powell barclays analyst thanks and one more on the non core asset sales you said there are a handful left could you maybe drill the number down into just an exact maybe not an exact number but is it one two three four and would those be sold this year or is that something that you want to look to do over the next couple of years john v arabia president chief executive officer no that s something still under evaluation i think it s just it s a small number of hotels that we will continue to evaluate but we have not made any strategic decisions on any one of those again we don t need the capital but eventually we d like to continue to advance our overall stated objectives so but just like we said in this past year in selling some of those assets they are relatively small in terms of total dollars particularly when you compare some of the assets to those the larger long term relevant assets within our portfolio that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars each so i d say it s relatively small anthony f powell barclays analyst right thank you good quarter bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator thank you we will take our next question from chris woronka with deutsche bank please go ahead chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys i guess you came in about 0 5 point in terms of full year 2018 you came in about 0 5 point above the high end of your full year guidance initially what do you think kind of drove that was it conservatism or wailea or group strength or something else bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer well chris first of all with guidance i think what we always do is we want to provide guidance that we believe based on the information we have at that time is achievable and we want to balance the degree of conservatism and providing reasonable achievable guidance when you look at the initial guidance for 2018 there were some negative revpar hotels that were sold throughout the year so that moved the number up and i think if you look at where we we ve said are adjusted for those sales as of last quarter where we were going to end we came just inside of that high end on the revpar guidance and so part of that beating the initial guidance was is just a function of the asset sales and those being lower revpar and lower revpar growth or negative growth assets chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay fair enough and then want to ask about the kind of the non room revenues that s been a big source of strength for you guys and some of your peers and can that same pace continue this year and what can you give us a little bit more granularity on is it f b is it fees is it something else marc a hoffman executive vice president chief operating officer hey chris it s marc yeah we had a good strong quarter in the year in food and beverage contribution again as we get later in the cycle the food and beverage contribution will stabilize and then we ve had good success with capturing our fees as we ve continued our growth and ramp up with fees in our group hotels with marriott and in wailea chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay great and then just going back to the transaction market i totally understand the commentary about the pricing is there do you think there there are any opportunities where you guys can take a different view on a market or a specific asset where you can underwrite much stronger growth or some kind of repositioning or have those kind of also dried up recently john v arabia president chief executive officer no we would take on chris it s john we would take on some type of repositioning even if it s viewed as late in the cycle particularly by the time that one would think by the time we actually get around to doing all the planning and executing on it it could be actually a great time to do a deeper renovation that doesn t scare us away if we believe that the long term value creation elements are in place those have so far those have been a little bit difficult to secure and we have bid on a couple of those but it s not the only thing we ve bid on as well chris woronka deutsche bank analyst okay very good thanks guys john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you we will take our next question from bill crow with raymond james please go ahead william a crow raymond james analyst hey good morning john and bryan appreciate the time a couple of questions john how are you thinking about g a as you continue to shrink the company john v arabia president chief executive officer something to be mindful of but honestly in where i think the company is going over the long term maintaining not only the right financial capital but the right human capital is very important and if the markets worked out the way i think they might over the next several years i want to clearly keep a robust team with our capabilities in place that have the capabilities to enact our strategy with numerous different tactics so i think it s fine william a crow raymond james analyst okay and then i think about your dispositions to date it really started i think in earnest with the terrific sale up in new york and i m just curious it seems like and that was a while go now it seems like it would have been easier to put the money out than certainly it is today given your comments on where cap rates have gone is that fair and so that was it kind of a window there that that maybe some should have gotten done but didn t get done john v arabia president chief executive officer looking back i am sure there are always assets that we pushed hard for that didn t swing our way or that others ended up in others hands for various set of reasons sometimes not always financial i think that might be fair bill if i look back there might be an asset or two that i kind of wish that we now owned but that is it is what it is you have to make those decisions along the way but i would agree with you that pricing expectations in our view have only become more robust despite the fact that at least we believe we re later in the cycle and factually several of those same assets have only produced more and more noi on the bottom line so that s the part that in our view is the real dilemma william a crow raymond james analyst yeah okay that s it from me appreciate it john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you sir operator thank you we will take our next question from michael bellisario with baird please go ahead michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst good morning guys john v arabia president chief executive officer hi mike michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst i wanted to dig a little bit deeper just on that buyback topic maybe drill down can you help us reconcile i know you mentioned an 8 implied cap rate on your stock at the end of the year kind of help us bridge that number to the 3 5 4 5 5 cap rate deals that you were evaluating and kind of really help us think about the delta there and maybe where we might be missing the value within your portfolio versus the 8 cap you quoted and not pulling the trigger on the buyback side john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah great question michael a couple of thoughts first those are pricing with the cap rates that i had mentioned are pricing expectations on assets that have come out over the last several months kind of in the mid 4 ish after property tax resets some lower than that some a little bit higher than that those have not several of those have not closed so we will see where the actual pricing comes in two i would say that not every single property within our portfolio we would have such levels of expectations or whether or not those levels are justified but i think where you re going and the reason i put that in the prepared remarks was there was a time when right when we sold the marriott tysons corner a fine hotel we sold that at an 8 2 cap on trailing in december i think right around that same week when our shares were weaker than they are today we were trading at roughly an 8 2 cap which is at least if nothing else intellectually interesting considering we view that hotel as and the other five that we sold last year to be in the bottom seven or eight of our total portfolio when we take a look at the assets that are completely on strategy those are several several hundred basis points lower if we were to transact on them so what does that all mean i think that there is a disconnect between public and private market pricing i think it s also at least intellectually stimulating to say how will that eventually break such a wide discrepancy between public and private market pricing doesn t last forever and both markets cannot be right so what i like about where we currently sit is we have a lot of optionality we don t need to access the equity markets we have a considerable amount of financial strength and human strength human capital and we are actively underwriting but at the same time we are going to be patience to make sure that we re not just moving for the sake of motion sake but we eventually create value with that optionality that we have built up and i think where you re going with your question or to build on the question before share repurchase is very much on the table michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst that s helpful and then just on the deals that you did underwrite call it 4 5 cap kind of deals what do you think those unlevered yields are pricing to and have you missed deals by a wider margin more recently than you were in the middle of the year has that changed at all john v arabia president chief executive officer not too many data points to be so specific about it i don t know what the under i can tell you what we think at that pricing the unlevered returns are but you have to keep in mind that we anticipate or we at least underwrite downturns in our underwriting now maybe that s going to be the biggest hurdle for us putting money to work in the short term but i think it s a fair discipline unless you believe that we are that this is going to be some 20 year cycle so my guess is if you re starting out at that point it s difficult to underwrite cap rate compression at the end of your whole period but even if you assume some level of growth long term growth even at inflation which i think for some assets is difficult you re probably talking about unlevered return expectations and maybe 6 5 5 6 which would probably be the lowest i have ever seen in my career michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst and then relative to that you guys would go down or reflect as far as 7 5 8 what s kind of your threshold there john v arabia president chief executive officer it s hard to tell but i think that somewhere in the 8 s range is probably if we triangulate at what irrs or unlevered irrs were for real estate and add a premium to that for hospitality probably somewhere in there although that s arguable michael j bellisario robert w baird co incorporated analyst that s helpful thank you john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you operator okay we ll take our next question from smedes rose with citi please go ahead smedes rose citi analyst hi thanks john i just wanted to ask you a little bit on the language around your guidance where you mentioned the residual impact from the government shutdown does that mean you are have seen impact and it s already factored into your first quarter outlook or you just you haven t seen anything and you re not expecting to see anything i mean and if john v arabia president chief executive officer no we saw is that during and in some residual impact of government shutdown we saw several hundred thousand dollars of total revenue it wasn t only in dc we saw it in san diego we saw it in san francisco with a couple of small group cancellations or wider attrition but it was several hundred thousand dollars of revenue which we have in our first quarter guidance already so we i think we had said something the effect of residual or new impact our only fear was if there is a material government shutdown for a long period of time then obviously that would provide an extra weight on our operations that weren t considered within our guidance smedes rose citi analyst okay thank you for the clarification i also wanted to ask you on the san diego hilton numbers there at least relative to our expectations were significantly better on the revpar side is that more just related to the timing of maybe group business for the year or is there something going on at that property that s just putting it on a sustainably higher growth trajectory john v arabia president chief executive officer no it was all related to a very strong group base for q4 smedes rose citi analyst great okay thank you bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thanks smedes operator thank you we will take our next question from stephen grambling with goldman sachs please go ahead stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst hey thanks i guess just a follow up on some of the earlier questions on the transaction environment i guess when you see the 3 to 4 cap rates are those generally being completed by a very consistent type of buyer or has that evolved and are the assets typically at for whatever reason you think abnormally low margins or have some sort of hiccup are these actually relatively healthy growing assets john v arabia president chief executive officer very high quality by the way not assets that are have closed yet but assets that are in the market with pricing expectations and so we will see where those assets or others that could potentially be coming to market see where those pricing expectations are and then see who the buyers are if they transact at those levels but generally very high quality completely on strategy assets for us stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst great and then would you say anything in the environment has changed your thinking around the decision to flag as a brand versus independent as you think over a longer timeframe thanks john v arabia president chief executive officer any specific asset or in general stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst yeah more i realize that there can be differences on a market by market basis but if we think more broadly are there trends that you re seeing where you d say in general it s becoming more attractive to be independent versus brand john v arabia president chief executive officer not necessarily i think it really depends on the asset in the market and then will also depend on the operating partner which will be a important element of that the good news is is i think we have the optionality to do both well we have a couple of independent hotels i wouldn t be surprised over time if we add more but there are certain hotels in certain markets that really benefit from a flag and quite honestly sometimes benefit from a being managed by marriott hilton or hyatt so it really just depends in some respects we re a little agnostic but it depends stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst fair enough i guess maybe trying to dig in a little bit more on the distribution side have you seen distribution costs when you re looking at your branded versus independent hotels narrow john v arabia president chief executive officer well yeah distribution costs so far we have seen and i ll turn it over to marc in a second but overall distribution costs in some of our branded hotels have clearly benefited and i have said this on other calls but i want to thank in particular marriott and hilton for leading that charge and showing great leadership in our industry in fixing what i ve referred to in the past as one of our greatest self inflicted wounds marc a hoffman executive vice president chief operating officer yeah i mean obviously the biggest move is the group distribution flattening the three major brands to 7 and while there was a little bit of noise throughout 2018 as they went at different times we feel that as we move into 2019 and beyond we will continue to see meaningful declines in those costs we continue to see transient commissions rise but again the marriott and hilton work and particularly as we ve seen with negotiations with expedia coming more down the pipe we think that hopefully those will slow in their growth more than anything else stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst great thanks so much operator thank you we will take our next question from david katz with jefferies please go ahead david katz jefferies llc analyst hi afternoon everyone or good morning thanks for all the detail and the information what i wanted to ask about is looking at the valuation range of the publicly traded population periodically the discussion of m a comes up how would you feel about the arguments that given valuation given balance sheet and given core strengths you might be well positioned as an acquirer under the current circumstances john v arabia president chief executive officer i do think we have certain advantages i think we have been involved in discussions over the past many years in terms of m a i think given the quality of our portfolio people see the benefits they like the strategy our balance sheet obviously provides some benefit the way we look at this is first and foremost it has to fit our strategic objectives then it has to meet our financial objectives getting bigger just to get big in my opinion and i think there s a lot of research on this does nothing for you or very little for you so i would anticipate that over time there could be those conversations but we are looking for something very specific in our strategy and we will stay disciplined to that david katz jefferies llc analyst got it okay thanks for taking my question i appreciate it john v arabia president chief executive officer thanks david operator thank you we will take our next question from patrick scholes with suntrust please go ahead c patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi good morning good afternoon with you folks looking at 3 to i believe you said 3 to 5 labor cost this year and 5 benefit growth where does that put your revpar break even as far as as it relate to margins this year and how does that compare to what you were at last year thank you bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer hi patrick it s obviously going to depend on the composition of the revpar where we are cyclically it s mainly coming from primarily coming from rates and then you re going to have a different answer market by market depending on the labor cost structure of whatever the specific market taking all that and making a coming up with a guideline for our portfolio it s going to be somewhere looking at this year where we are later in the cycle where there are these cost pressures on various fronts you re looking at 3 to 4 revpar growth to maintain those margins 4 in the more expensive markets and 3 in the easier labor markets c patrick scholes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay that s it thank you john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you patrick bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator thank you we will take our final question from rich hightower with evercore isi please go ahead rich hightower evercore isi analyst hey morning guys john v arabia president chief executive officer hey rich rich hightower evercore isi analyst thanks for taking my question here so i guess really quickly on the guidance given the strength that you are forecasting for the first quarter relative to the full year can you help us understand just the cadence across the remaining quarters bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer hi rich there s not a lot of variability over the remaining quarters q1 is definitely impacted benefiting from the displacement last year and then san francisco which as we get into more of our peers earning my guess is what you ll earnings you ll hear the same is that san francisco will be the strongest in q1 and so boston for us in q1 is also strong as you look past q1 then maybe q3 is probably slightly higher than the other quarters but it s pretty uniform across the board rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay that is helpful and then maybe i don t know if this is going to be possible or given that it s a small number of hotels to really get a meaningful answer here but when you when i think about revpar and margin guidance maybe independently of the renovation tailwinds that you re expecting this year which obviously you re going to be sort of chunky relative to the portfolio are you able to kind of strip those out and give us what a an adjusted same store number might be kind of all else equal if that s even possible john v arabia president chief executive officer i think we can get you close rich hold on one second rich hightower evercore isi analyst okay john v arabia president chief executive officer keep in mind rich is we re looking for some of that information keep in mind that the renovation disruption year over year is actually going to decline we were pretty heavy particularly in renovation disruption in the first half of 2018 which is also helping our year over year growth rates in 2019 in the first quarter first half so there is a little bit of a bump and we re just seeing if we got that rich hightower evercore isi analyst yeah that s exactly what i was getting at the tailwind not a headwind thanks for that john v arabia president chief executive officer it s going to help it s going to help to the tune of i think we are down in total revenues 4 million to 5 million total revenue displacement and then in the bottom line it s kind of i don t know i think we re to the benefit this year maybe 3 5 million less in ebitda disruption so that s a bit of help bryan a giglia executive vice president chief financial officer when you look over that the year over year the 2018 displacements the 2019 displacements we re picking up about 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin benefit rich hightower evercore isi analyst got it all right thank you guys aaron reyes vice president of corporate finance thank you sir operator thank you we will take our next question from lukas hartwich with green street advisors please go ahead lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst thanks hey guys john v arabia president chief executive officer hi lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst in terms of your hey in terms of your larger renovations can you provide more color on how the returns are tracking versus your expectations john v arabia president chief executive officer so far they ve been anywhere from very good to outstanding wailea has just been a knockout particularly versus our underwriting expectations we spent we invested a little bit more than we originally thought because we saw the opportunity with the property and that asset particularly with comparable sales in the immediate market that asset i don t have a number for you lukas you could probably we give you all the information such as purchase price incremental investment earnings and then you can come up with a rough estimate of what you think the asset is worth i would say they ve been fantastic so not every single one of our renovations has been as good but i still believe that one of the hallmarks of this company is completing those things in a holistic with a holistic view at the right time and creating outsized shareholder returns lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst that s helpful i was actually just more curious about the big renovations last year in orlando and long wharf john v arabia president chief executive officer yeah i know that we have said and we still believe that orlando is orlando is easier to measure because we literally took an empty parking lot and we put in a new 46 000 square feet of space and that was easier we anticipated kind of a low teens unlevered irr on that it will take a couple of years to ramp but from what we ve seen thus far it s just we feel very good about it marc hoffman and team did just a really outstanding job on that some of the other ones i think it s more difficult to specify because for things like the jw new orleans and long wharf we were already going to renovate we needed to renovate it was really when we looked at it it was the incremental cost of instead of doing a kind of a standard marriott or jw renovation we went well above and beyond things like moving the m club to really just a spectacular space at long wharf or bumping up the bathroom walls and putting in a very luxurious bath amenity and showers those types of things the incremental return we felt comfortable with in terms of being able to achieve greater index or recapturing index over time and in those we thought that they were although it s a lot more art than science we thought that we re we were in the teens as well lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst that s helpful and then you kind of touched on this a little bit already but hopefully you can give a little more color how you approach planning for when you re planning for the intermediate term for your business i m just curious how you approach things like the length of the cycle the timing of a downturn the severity of a downturn do you run scenario analyses how do you think about those sorts of really important questions when you re planning for your business john v arabia president chief executive officer it s look first of all nobody knows right all the best modeling in the world and you are still probably going to be off or wrong in terms of the timing the magnitude the duration and exactly how it s going to impact your business however we this is something that we debate regularly in fact we re debating it now on a quarterly basis within our own team it s something that we discuss meaningfully with our board discuss openly with our shareholders we run various sensitivities and again lukas as i said before we understand we re going to be off but just the simple fact that we will be off doesn t mean that we can ignore a potential downturn at some point because ignoring that and assuming that just everything is going to grow from here at some long term rate we actually think that s the wrong answer so that s where we are i think in some of our conversations or on the past quarterly calls we said years and years ago we thought the downturn would be late 2018 early 2019 in fact i think our underwriting for wailea ebitda in 2018 or 2019 was something like 22 million i think we did 40 million something last year give or take so again we will be off but as long as we get the bigger picture right i think we ll be well served in our capital allocation strategies lukas hartwich green street advisors analyst great thank you john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you operator thank you this now concludes the question and answer session i will turn the presentation over to john arabia john v arabia president chief executive officer thank you so much appreciate the time and the interest we are around if there is any follow up calls and wish you all a great day and earning season take care operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference the call has now concluded please disconnect your lines and have a great day duration

briefing highlights wither canadian housing stocks loonie oil at a glance telus warns on huawei ban bombardier rebounds to profit canadian tire profit slips telus meets expectations transcanada boosts dividend manufacturing sales tumble what to watch for today airbus to scrap a380 from today s globe and mail wither the housing markets oh the things they re saying about canada s housing markets most of the chatter among economists and housing officials relates to vancouver s slump but other cities are flashing warning signs too for a variety of reasons we ll get a broader picture friday when the canadian real estate association releases its report on how sales and prices fared in january that report promises to be interesting because the numbers compare to january 2018 when new mortgage qualification stress tests known as b 20 rules came into effect dampening the markets january home sales are going to look less weak on an easy comparison as the first month of 2018 was ugly with the b 20 mortgage rules coming into effect said benjamin reitzes bmo s canadian rates and macro strategist several local real estate boards have already released january numbers including vancouver and toronto the former slumping and the latter rebounding mr reitzes expects this national report to show sales fell 8 per cent from a year earlier with average prices slipping 1 per cent that would be a far better showing than in december when sales tumbled 19 per cent and prices 4 9 per cent bmo also expects to see that the mls home price index which is considered a better measure rose 1 3 per cent a slower pace than december s 1 6 per cent vancouver continues to struggle and appears to be in full correction mode mr reitzes said the prairies remain under pressure as oil prices had a tough run late last year and broader activity in the region is relatively soft he added ottawa and montreal are expected to be the bright spots amid decent affordability and firm economic activity toronto rebounded nicely in january with sales showing their best monthly increase since july that s just one of several reports or comments about the housing markets over the past several days for example the latest reading of the teranet national bank home price index released wednesday showed the downward trend in home prices intensified in western canada s three largest metropolitan areas those being vancouver calgary and edmonton home prices have been trending down in three of the past four years in calgary and edmonton while vancouver shows no growth for the first time in six years national bank senior economist marc pinsonneault said in releasing the numbers january marked the seventh consecutive month without a price gain in calgary the sixth such month in a row in vancouver and the fifth in edmonton in calgary mr pinsonneault noted the ratio of listings to sales was the highest for a january since the oil price rout of 2014 both calgary and edmonton are facing an outsized number of vacant new dwellings and continued price weakness he said though pointed toward some stability in vancouver after seasonal adjustment vancouver home sales indeed stabilized when compared to december mr pinsonneault said solid labour markets in greater vancouver where a near record 72 000 jobs were added in the last six months argue for a more stable listings to sales ratio and limited price deflation of course limited price deflation still means lower prices but vancouver could benefit from anything that would ease its affordability crisis some key findings notably in price changes since their respective peaks teranet national bank composite house price index by metropolitan area as of january 2019 metropolitan area index level month over month change year over year change change from peak peak date victoria 208 77 0 0 4 9 0 5 sept 2018 vancouver 284 58 0 3 0 0 3 2 july 2018 calgary 177 43 0 5 2 8 5 8 oct 2014 edmonton 176 0 8 2 4 6 3 sept 2007 winnipeg 208

0 jan 2019 halifax 148 66 0 7 1 7 0 9 july 2018 source national bank of canada certainly january was better than december said stephen brown senior canada economist at capital economics referring to the teranet national bank measure nevertheless the local sales to new listing ratios paint a picture of divergence between canada s main cities he added the ratio in montreal points to annual house price inflation rising from january s 4 5 per cent to the high single digits by contrast the ratio for vancouver points to annual falls in prices of 5 per cent look too at the latest findings from canada mortgage and housing corp which studies levels of vulnerability in various cities in terms of price inflation and other measures keep in mind of course that the b 20 stress rules were aimed at cooling markets and preventing a credit bubble the latest cmhc report found a better picture but trouble spots remain to be sure the agency still cited a high degree of vulnerability in vancouver victoria toronto and hamilton though the situation is improving over the past year evidence of overvaluation continues to be detected in these four centres since house prices are higher than the price levels supported by fundamentals cmhc said however with price growth moderating and the young adult population growing the conditions of overvaluation are easing in all four centres most notably the evidence of overvaluation has changed from high to moderate in toronto and victoria the agency cited edmonton calgary saskatoon regina and winnipeg for a moderate overall assessment of vulnerability with evidence of overbuilding fading somewhat in the first three of those centres ottawa quebec city moncton halifax and st john s are all on the straight and narrow with low vulnerability and where house prices remain consistent with fundamentals but watch montreal which mr brown also flagged a low degree of overall vulnerability is also maintained for montreal but its resale market is very close to overheating as a result of a tightening between supply and demand creating significant upward pressure on house prices cmhc said read more markets at a glance read more telus warns on huawei

guidance once we ve completed these remarks we ll open the call up for questions with that i d now like to turn the call over to liz smith elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president thanks mark and welcome to everyone listening today as noted in this morning s earnings release adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was 0 30 and combined us comp sales were up 1 6 this was a terrific quarter and represented the fifth consecutive quarter of positive us comp sales for the total year all us concepts finished with positive comps including an impressive 4 at outback this represented outback s highest annual comp sales result in six years in addition adjusted eps grew 25 on a comparable 52 week basis in 2018 which was well above our initial guidance expectations for the year this overall performance was the successful combination of a multi year effort aimed at strengthening our differentiation improving brand health and setting the brands up for success over the next three to five years these results were also a testament to our extraordinary team who demonstrate our principles and beliefs and show the enthusiasm and dedication in always putting the customer first i want to thank everyone for making a difference each and every day our number one priority remains driving healthy profitable sales growth across the portfolio beginning in 2016 we took the necessary steps to reduce discounting while also investing in incremental levers to accelerate growth this includes 50 million of food and service enhancements shifting media spend from mass marketing to digital personalization the dine rewards loyalty program and the rapidly growing off premise business these investments have helped to fortify the core business and expand our reach to new and existing customers we will continue to leverage our scale portfolio of brands and data analytics to enhance engagement with higher returns importantly the significant upfront investments that we have made in the 360 degree customer experience are largely behind us we are now beginning to fully monetize the benefits of these efforts our patients has paid off and as we enter 2019 we are confident this momentum will lead to sales growth and meaningful margin expansion now turning to the brands outback comp sales were up 2 9 in the fourth quarter on top of an already strong 4 7 increase in q4 2017 this is outback s eighth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales the investments we have made to elevate the customer experience are driving healthy sales growth as a reminder we have made customer facing improvements across food quality and portion enhancement service upgrades and improved ambience last year we also made significant investments back into our people as the war for talent remains high these actions have resulted in increased partner engagement higher satisfaction and helped contribute to the lowest turnover levels of the brand in the past ten years ensuring our assets are current remain a top priority we completed the multi year rollout of the outback exterior remodel program and have now shifted to interior remodels outback is testing multiple design prototypes that incorporate new design elements to modernize our look while expanding the off premise room to handle the higher expected order volume we are also relocating outback s restaurants as quickly as quality sites become available we completed 14 relocations in 2018 looking ahead to 2019 we expect to relocate another 11 restaurants given the strength of the pipeline this relocation program continues to deliver impressive results and recent relocations are generating sales lift well in excess of 30 we are very bullish about outback and the brand is well positioned to further take market share at bonefish q4 comp sales were down 1 1 largely driven by a 10 reduction in discounting we have now largely cycled through our deliberate plan to reduce discounting going forward bonefish will focus on driving healthy traffic by leveraging its strength with fresh fish innovative cocktails and superior service we continue to see success with the specials board which offers local fresh fish and seafood entrees that are selected by our partners in addition we have migrated our marketing resources away from national toward more impactful local programs this local philosophy helped define bonefish as the unchanged chain and it s paying off as the brand achieved record profitability in 2018 at carrabba s comp sales were up 80 basis points in the quarter carrabba s remains focused on driving healthy sales and providing a great authentic italian meal at affordable prices we continue to simplify the core execution while investing back into experience with larger portions and service enhancements we are also targeting more proprietary programs such as our successful wine dinners and amore mondays in addition our growing off premise business via family bundles catering and delivery platforms represents a significant incremental opportunity in 2019 in q4 fleming s comp sales were down 0 4 driven by a planned 20 reduction in discounting we made the conscious decision at fleming s to move away from legacy value offerings such as our 567 bar menu and non holiday gift card distributions while these actions have a short term negative impact on traffic they have had a positive impact on profitability moving forward fleming s will work on differentiating the brand from the traditional high end steakhouses through localized menu selection and customer segmentation the successful dine rewards loyalty program now has 8 million members this program is performing very well and driving strong engagement across the portfolio we will evolve the program to further leverage the customer segmentation opportunities provided by the rich data we have collected over the years our investments in crm strengthen engagement through more customer centric communication while providing a higher return from marketing spending for perspective these investments have enabled us to reduce advertising spend by 25 million over the past two years while improving return on investment turning to off premise in q4 we completed the roll out of an additional 200 delivery locations across outback and carrabba s delivery is now available in over 450 locations as of the end of the year we are very pleased with the progress and these locations continue to perform well against several key metrics including delivery times and deliveries per location this continues to give us confidence in the potential and expect to complete the roll out to the remaining delivery locations by the end of 2019 we are very excited about the incremental opportunity it represents as we capitalize the growing consumer demand for enjoying restaurant meals at home moving to international brazil comp sales were up 2 4 in the quarter we are very pleased about these results as the country experienced a difficult environment last year this reaffirms our belief that the advance of q2 and q3 were temporary and not indicative of long term fundamentals the economy in brazil is beginning to see signs of stabilization since the presidential election and underlying health indicators are improving gdp is set to have its strongest performance in four years and reduced inflation and interest rates are having a positive impact on consumer demand and disposable income we remain optimistic about the long term potential of the market the demand and love for our restaurants remain high and we are well positioned to continue to grow and take share in an under penetrated casual dining market in summary 2018 was an excellent year as our multi year effort of investing behind the consumer is paying off in the form of healthy underlying traffic and margin expansion the incremental sales layers we have qualified across loyalty digital and off premise will position us to capitalize on the continued sales momentum and monetize the benefits of these investments as we enter 2019 and beyond our long term strategies remain intact and you can expect the following priorities in 2019 the first priority is to grow quality sales and profitability in the us the benefits of our strategic investments have gained momentum over time data personalization will help us engage more efficiently and effectively with consumers across each sales layer including the dine rewards loyalty program in addition to remodels and relocations we also believe we have a very attractive opportunity for domestic new unit growth at outback and fleming s and are building the pipeline that will be pursued in a disciplined manner our second priority is executing against the growing off premise opportunity we believe off premise represents a structural tailwind for the category and has the potential to reach 25 of total sales in our restaurants over time given this potential we have built the infrastructure technology and capabilities to support these elevated sales volumes we are offering delivery in over 450 restaurants today and expect to fully complete the roll out in 2019 third we will continue to allocate capital to maximize the international growth opportunity this includes leveraging the success in brazil with outback and abbraccio in addition we will pursue the growing franchise opportunities in latin america and in asia with our portfolio of brands and our final priority is to maximize total shareholder return we remain committed to reviewing all potential opportunities and we ll evaluate them through the lens of maximizing shareholder value since the beginning of 2015 we have returned nearly 1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases given our cash flow we expect 2019 to represent another strong year of returning cash to shareholders we are excited about the prospects ahead as we have transitioned to a strong differentiated growth model and look forward to providing more details at our march 11 investor day and with that i ll turn the call over to dave deno to provide more detail on q4 and 2019 dave david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer well thank you liz and good morning everyone i ll kick off with a discussion around our sales and profit performance for the quarter i d like to remind everyone that when i speak to results i ll be referring to adjusted numbers that exclude certain costs and benefits please see the earnings release for reconciliations between non gaap metrics and their most directly comparable us gaap measures we also provide a discussion of the nature of each adjustment before i begin it is important to note that our q4 2017 results included 14 weeks versus q4 2018 which had 13 weeks the additional week in 2017 fell between christmas and new years and includes many of the business days of the year this week had the following impacts to our fourth quarter 2017 reported results total revenues improved by 80 million fourth quarter gaap and adjusted eps improved by 0 12 and gaap and adjusted operating margins benefited by 190 basis points and 170 basis points respectively for purposes of today s call when i refer to fourth quarter of 2017 results i ll be referring to comparable 13 week results that remove the impact of the additional week from my discussion for additional reference both the reported and the comparable financial metrics for revenues eps and operating margin technical difficulty in the q4 earnings release issued this morning with that in mind our fourth quarter financial results versus the prior year were as follows gaap diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 12 versus 0 01 in 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 30 versus 0 18 last year this represents an impressive 67 year over year increase the primary difference between our gaap and adjusted eps is related to certain impairment restaurant closing costs and severance excluded from the 2018 and 2017 fourth quarter results total revenues increased 1 7 to 1 billion in the fourth quarter and us comp sales were up 1 6 this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales for our company adjusted operating income margin was 4 3 in q4 versus 2 2 in the comparable period a year ago this was primarily driven by increases in us comp sales the investments in customer experience are driving higher quality sales which is improving margins in addition our margins continued to benefit from the ongoing productivity efforts to help offset inflation in 2018 we made great progress in reducing food waste and optimizing the labor model ongoing productivity efforts will play a role in 2019 margin expansion efforts also we had a 5 million favorable change in year over year q4 incentive compensation this change had a 50 basis point positive impact on our q4 2018 margins as compared to last year in our international segment adjusted operating margins improved from 10 in q4 of 2017 to 12 2 in q4 of 2018 this was driven by a strong margin quarter in brazil as they rebounded from the truckers strike and political uncertainty that negatively impacted their second and third quarter results q4 adjusted tax rate was 7 8 this was lower than expected due primarily to the benefit of certain tax items this has a 0 02 favorable eps impact versus our expectations on the development front we opened five systemwide locations in the fourth quarter including four international locations and one domestic outback franchise location before i discuss 2019 it s important to reflect on some of the key accomplishments in 2018 first as liz mentioned the us business finished the comp sales up 2 5 for the year with positive comps at all us brands outback posted a 4 comp for the year significantly outpacing the casual dining industry our eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps underscores our confidence in the sustainability of their growth trajectory second we finished 2018 up 25 in adjusted eps well above our original guidance of 11 to 16 on a comparable calendar basis third we finished the year with positive year over year operating margins on a comparable calendar basis our efforts to drive healthier traffic through higher roi marketing activities such as digital are working and have set us up to make significant improvements in operating margins going forward fourth our business in brazil has proved to be extremely resilient the fourth quarter comp sales result of positive 2 4 came after two quarters of uncertainty leading up to the october presidential election there is renewed optimism in the country and the brazilian consumers love of outback remains strong finally in 2018 we repurchased 5 1 million shares of common stock for a total of 114 million since 2015 we returned nearly 1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases at our most recent meeting the board of directors approved another share repurchase authorization of 150 million the share repurchase program has been a big win for our shareholders our strong performance has given us the financial flexibility to balance returning cash to shareholders with prudently managing our capital structure and credit metrics 2018 was a strong year for our company and has set us up for continued success in 2019 before we discuss 2019 guidance i want to briefly review the impact that the adoption of the new lease accounting standard will have in our business beginning in q1 2019 this standard will be reflected in our results among its impacts we will no longer recognize gains on sale leaseback transactions in our financial statements as you may recall in 2017 we largely completed a very successful sale leaseback initiative that generated nearly 700 million in gross proceeds we used the net proceeds to pay down 300 million of debt and repurchased over 300 million of stock these transactions did have a negative impact on operating income as we had recorded the rent expense from these new leases we were able to offset a portion of this additional rent expense with deferred gains realized on the sale of these properties both the rent expense and the amortization of the deferred gain were included in the other operating expense line in our income statement under the new lease accounting standard we will no longer be able to recognize the deferred gain in our financial statements this accounting change will have the following impacts in our 2019 results first there will be a non cash 12 3 million increase in other restaurant operating expenses in 2019 second this represents a 0 10 reduction in eps for the fiscal year third it represents a 30 basis point reduction in operating income margin for the year with that context i will now discuss our 2019 guidance keep in mind we have provided a table in the earnings release to help with the discussion as it relates to eps we expect gaap eps to be between 1 44 and 1 52 we expect adjusted eps to be between 1 53 and 1 61 if you exclude the 0 10 impact of the new lease accounting standard on 2018 results our adjusted eps would have been approximately 1 40 on that basis our 2019 adjusted eps guidance range represents 10 to 15 growth we expect the 2019 gaap effective income tax rate to be between 6 and 7 and the adjusted income effective income tax rate to be between 7 and 8 as it relate to other aspects of our guidance we expect us comp sales to be up 2 to 2 5 we will leverage our numerous sales layers such as off premise remodels relocations loyalty and digital marketing to continue our momentum from 2018 on the cost of sales line we are seeing some inflation across several key commodity categories including beef and seafood we also have increased transportation costs driven by a tight labor market and high demand commodities are expected to be up approximately 2 in 2019 as compared to approximately 3 in 2018 labor will continue to be a headwind in 2019 persistent labor pressures have been a reality in the industry for several years approximately 4 labor inflation is expected in 2019 given these ongoing inflation pressures food and labor cost productivity will be an important part of our 2019 financial model with our sales growth in these productivity efforts we do anticipate meaningful margin expansion in 2019 we expect adjusted operating income margin to be between 4 8 to 5 which is an increase of 20 to 40 basis points from 2018 if you exclude the 30 basis points impact of the new lease accounting standard from our 2018 results our adjusted operating income margin would have been 4 3 on that basis this is a 50 to 70 basis point improvement in adjusted operating income margins from 2018 in 2019 we are confident the margin benefits associated with our prior investments will accelerate capital spending is expected to be between 175 million and 200 million we will continue to make high return investments in areas such as new units in brazil and renovating the outback fleet through our exterior and interior remodel and relocation programs we ll open approximately 20 restaurants with the majority being international in summary q4 was a fantastic finish to a very strong year for bloomin brands clearly our investments in the core customer experience are paying off and we are have entered a new growth cycle we remain disciplined stewards of capital and our improving capital structure provides increased flexibility to return cash to shareholders and with that we will now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator operators instructions our first question comes from the line of michael gallo with cl king please proceed with your question michael gallo c l king associates analyst hi good morning elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president good morning michael michael gallo c l king associates analyst yeah i just wanted to delve in a little bit on margin guidance obviously you re guiding to a significant improvement again in margins despite a meaningful labor and other headwind so i was wondering if you can give us some more color on what some of the bigger buckets of productivity initiatives are and as you look beyond 2019 how we should think about further productivity opportunities all things being equal to move that operating margin up thanks david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure good morning michael first of all we were very pleased with the operating margin expansion in q4 of 210 basis points it s something we pointed to during the year and they came through in a big way so we see that momentum continuing on into 2019 first and foremost we re as liz has mentioned in our remarks that we re going to be driving traffic at a nice margin so that s going to be number one because we ve invested in the core experience and a lot of those investments are behind us and it s important now to monetize those investments we see off premise growth at outback and carrabba s our loyalty program and some of our crm engagement to help us build sales so as i mentioned earlier we re now past a lot of our large cycle investments and we see margin expansion coming forward but beside sales the productivity piece is a big part of it and we expect at least 50 million of productivity this year and we ll see that in the years ahead how are we doing that by simplifying continue to simplify our operations we are making the investments in technology we re doing a really great job in improving our management of our actual versus theoretical food cost management program we have an opportunity to work we re continuing to work with our suppliers and that s been coming through for us we ve opportunity in managing our beer wine and liquor business labor costs have been good for us in a tough labor market because our turnover especially at outback is among the lowest it s ever been and it s just a hats off to the outback team in accomplishing that so and then we also have opportunity on the facility side in our restaurants which was a big opportunity for us in q4 liz has mentioned the advertising piece which we ve gotten higher rois with lower spending especially on digital and finally we continue to be dedicated to holding flat on our overhead structure as we go forward and then lastly as you saw that s with the us and lastly as you saw 220 basis point expansion i believe in our operating margin in brazil and that s a higher margin business for us and they had a really great fourth quarter and we expect that to continue on this year so those are the components of our margin piece for 2019 and beyond michael gallo c l king associates analyst thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays please proceed with your question jeffrey bernstein barclays capital analyst great thank you very much looking more at the the top line looking at 2019 your guide 2 to 2 5 i m wondering if you can maybe prioritize what you think of the biggest sustainable drivers just wondering where you think the industry compares to that 2 to 2 5 and then if you can maybe just give an update i know you mentioned qualitatively the off premise and the dine rewards and remodels but can you just quantify where we stand in terms of mix of off premise and contribution from dine rewards and delivery thank you elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so just kind of unpack that on the industry front we see the industry environment as being a comfortable environment for the consumer you see all the metrics that we see so low unemployment there s high disposable incomes so we think there will be a positive macro environment however we do expect to see negative traffic in the industry again and we expect to have positive traffic across of our portfolio so we and what gives us that confidence well that s exactly what you said we ve spent the last 2 5 years removing discounting and qualifying significant incremental sales layers and that large investment is behind us and we re seeing the momentum and we re able to monetize that number one you always have to go with how are we executing and the core experience in the box and all the 50 million that we ve spent you re going to see more we re taking more at during the analyst day about other food and investment qualities but you re going to see the elevated customer experience is driving really healthy traffic in the box and we certainly have seen the in dining experience traffic strengthen significantly and that s going to continue the second is that we have qualified incremental layers that differentiate us we re really pleased with how our off premise business is doing we are on track for that 25 to 35 of sales in q4 the off premise business grew about 18 for us okay and a total of 11 2 we see that continuing all the investments we ve made to build our database infrastructure and shift from what i call mass marketing which is less efficient to more mass personalization is really driving high return on investments on our advertising and we ve built a pretty formidable database and infrastructure now to be able to monetize and speak directly and continue to raise that roi you see that reflected in the ongoing gains that we record quarter after quarter in the dine rewards program which has really succeeded at the top end of our expectations we re in the first quarter there now that we have those data in those profiles we can monetize and speak directly to them so kind of more on that to come so i think it s this confidence in the core business confidence in the incremental sales layers that we ve done and confidence in the overall platform that we ve built to support it jeffrey bernstein barclays capital analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jeff farmer with gordon haskett please proceed with your question jeff farmer gordon haskett research advisors analyst great thanks just have a follow up and then a question on the follow up you touched on this but advertising as a percent of sales in 2018 and where do you think that number can go in 2019 david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah we don t disclose in great detail as far as what advertising as a percent of sales will be but we expect as a percent of sales to continue to move downward a bit much like it has in the last few years we re really pleased with return on investments jeff that we re getting on the digital piece and also helping us manage our advertising costs jeff farmer gordon haskett research advisors analyst and then similar vein but again you hit on this with bonefish with some color but where do you stand at outback in terms of reduced marketing levels that the reduced discounting and couponing and again what sort expectation as you move into 2019 from those things elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so across the portfolio and outback was on that journey as well we have reduced discounting over the last two years by 25 which is a huge amount over the past two years we believe that journey is completed in 2018 and now we have the ability to lap and monetize that plus the investments as we go forward so we don t see that reduction continuing we took the difficult but right decision over the last two years it s behind us and now we can enjoy the healthy traffic benefits in high margin benefits that come to healthy traffic growth jeff farmer gordon haskett research advisors analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley please proceed with your question john glass morgan stanley co analyst hi thanks good morning liz can you talk a little bit about specifically the benefits you re seeing right now from dine rewards in the quarter if you re willing to quantify kind of what benefit you think to the portfolio or outback that s contributing to comps and secondly you mentioned off premise but can you maybe provide some detail on specific to delivery those units that have delivery what kind of sales lift you re getting from those at this point i ve got one follow up elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so the benefits of dine rewards and again john what i m really excited about is the ability to go in even more detail when we have time on march 11 to really unpack kind of what it means that be on this data journey that we ve been on and the benefits that accrue to that so i ll answer that and then i ll turn it over to dave to talk about the delivery question we currently have 8 million customers we are reaching new and existing users with that we are introducing and cross fertilizing customers across our brands so the portfolio is working beautifully and we re introducing people to our other brands we re increasing existing customers frequencies we re seeing our lifts off the program as we said at the high end of any of our expectations don t want to break that out we also see ourselves very much in the first inning of this and what do i mean by that well we now have 21 million customer profiles and we know what they like when they like and how they like it that gives us the ability now to market directly to them on one on one in a personalized manner and we ll start doing that this year and that we ll be able to drive enhancements to the loyalty program which make it continue to keep building so it s been a terrific program for us over the last 2 5 years we ve got a lot of growth ahead of it same thing on off premise which i ll turn to dave an incremental high growth business and he can talk the particulars david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure good morning john we had 18 growth in off premise in q4 we have delivery in 488 restaurants it s now 14 of our business we saw a good growth in the restaurants in restaurants that have delivery just like in restaurants that don t have delivery so we feel very good about the incrementality we ve been talking about the 80 to 85 range now for quite some time so like i said we have a very good feel for what s going on with delivery and expect to grow that business as we go forward john glass morgan stanley co analyst and then just unpacking the margin comments about 19 you mentioned anniversarying number of your investments you made in 18 you re getting to healthy traffic that helps margins are there any offsetting investments that you re making i mean in other words do you is there is the 50 million is that a net number and you ve got some investments to make particularly in delivery or do you think a lot of those investments are now behind you and in the base of the margins david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah the real big investments that we made in the restaurants over the last few years are behind us but we will always to help grow traffic we will always use some of the productivity and some of the traffic to continue to grow our business but our margin expansion guide includes that but the big investments are behind us john so we will continue to do that and also embedded in our guidance is very prudent pricing we want to make sure that we give the customer great value and so that will be a part of our that s part of our guide as well so the big investments are behind us we will always look to improve the customer experience and productivity is a big part of that along with traffic and prudent pricing john glass morgan stanley co analyst go it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan please proceed with your question john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst hi thank you two different ones if i may first dave you mentioned in an answer to a previous question about margins beyond fiscal 19 and i m maybe a little bit of a preview on the march 11 analyst day because i think it s the question a lot of us want answered what do you think i mean at this point i mean as you see the current cycle and your overall best outlook what an annual margin gain expectation for bloomin should be longer term and i ll ask that question should we get it from the store level should we get it through g a leverage should we really expect it to be top line driven so i mean are you beginning to think about you kind of and maybe an annual basis point increase is there a longer term margin increase or margin turn a longer term level excuse me that you re targeting when might that level be achieved whether in three or five years so really just asking at this point to help us think a little bit longer term because that s obviously be a very key part of your story at this point jeffrey bernstein barclays capital analyst absolutely and as we ve mentioned we felt that we ve had a 200 basis point opportunity in margins and we ll lay out all that in great detail on march 11th but let me just talk a little bit about how we re looking at today and that is first of all healthy traffic at the restaurants as we made our investments and continue to improve service as a big part of it but as this also john it s productivity so your question about it if it s coming out of the restaurant p l absolutely it will come out of the restaurant p l as well especially if we look at facility management energy management food cost management all things i talked about earlier is an important part of it and then we also are working very hard and have worked very hard to doing to manage our overhead costs so we will see leverage on our maintaining our overhead flat going forward and the teams here in the non customer facing business are really really really it s really important so that will be part of the overall overhead management as well and then i oftentimes we don t get questions about this let me just add brazil is a big part of our company and they ve got high margins and growth and that mix will continue to help us so it s restaurant margins overhead brazil as we move forward over the next few years and i think you saw a major down payment on that in q4 and as we go forward into 2019 john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst that s great and do you think to just holding on to that 200 basis point number i mean are you willing to say at this point i mean is that a five year type of expectation 10 year expectation medium or long term i mean is there i mean at this point in time frame that you re willing to give us a heads up on david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer i d say medium term john i don t think it will take five years john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst okay right well that s helpful color in and of itself and in terms of your business composition or portfolio management obviously brazil kind of being in the place that it is and hopefully benefit from some stability in that economy i m going to ask the question about bonefish i mean at least it wasn t from our perspective it wasn t necessarily clear that that was going to remain a long term part of your portfolio but there are some earlier comments that were made fiscal 18 i think was a record profit year for the brands and you ve obviously just made a very high profile of hiring jeff carcara so can you talk about what you think what the opportunity is for that brand and maybe what jeff can bring with his exposure to not that level of dining and even higher level than bonefish dining might mean for that brand over the next couple of years elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president sure so bonefish had a terrific year we knew the traffic was going to be down we planned for that it was anticipated all you re wrong on our guidance because we were really pulling that discounting out and getting back to our roots of being the unchanged chain shifting to all fresh fish returning rights to the local markets getting out of national giving the menu and fish buying rights back to the managing partner and returning to its roots of fresh fish served at really really attractive prices what s the heart and soul of bonefish has always been the ambience and the vibe and we are really excited to have jeff to join us we think he will be a wonderful addition to the team we ve made great strides in the experience and simplification but jeff will continue to elevate that in restaurants periods as he has proven to his career his most recently as you know was head of barteca and so i think you know the vibe the energy it s all coming back he certainly is tremendously excited about the opportunity and the potential on we are looking for positive traffic and positive growth from bonefish this year and excited about that we re blessed to have versatile leaders across the organization and so after having a record year at bonefish driven by our dave schmidt our president of bonefish we ve been able now to ask dave to go over and be cfo of outback and apply his deep operational and financial expertise on that on our largest brand and so all around we re feeling really good about the portfolio of having the right people in the right seats at the right time so we re very bullish john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst thank you go ahead david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we also had a the cfo at outback we had a retirement in supply chain and we have a really talented executive going down there to lead that function so it really is a combination of talented people coming together john ivankoe jpmorgan chase co analyst excellent thanks operator our next question comes from the line of brian vaccaro with raymond james please proceed with your question brian vaccaro raymond james analyst thanks and good morning i just wanted to circle back to the margins and maybe we can level set a bit starting with 18 and could you quantify or be a little more specific on the savings that you realized in 18 and sort of across the p l and on labors could you give a few examples of where you found some efficiencies in that line david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah on labor i mentioned earlier it s been a big robust labor market but one of the things that our teams have done especially at outback is our old our turnover is really really down they re doing a great job managing the teams and everything and moving forward and that saves on training costs and other things like in a big way and so not only we re able to pay our people incent our people but we ve experienced some talented people remaining with our company and that s a big impact brian on the p l brian vaccaro raymond james analyst yeah understood would you be able if you would want to quantify where hourly turnover is these days at outback david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer it s below the industry elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president well below david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer well below and prefer not to get into that given it s a competitive advantage but well below the industry brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right fair enough and as i think about the opportunities in 19 speaking with the productivity inaudible has been a source of savings for a couple of years how much is left there and i guess as we re thinking about simplifying ops further you mentioned as an initiative in 19 maybe just a couple of examples there david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah i think for us we re looking at putting a new pos device for instance and that will help simplify operations in our restaurants carrabba s just did a fantastic job putting in a new kitchen line that really simplified operations and helped on productivity i think on the food cost management not only with our suppliers brian but also managing our actual versus theoretical food waste management but also beer wine and liquor we have you know frankly over tens of millions of dollars left to go i mean that s a big part of our 50 million a year in productivity is managing suppliers work from our suppliers managing beer wine and liquor and continuing to manage our food cost i m not going to get into details by year and those kind of things because again it s proprietary but it s a big part of our 50 million of productivity we re committing to brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right that s helpful and then last one dave you said on the g a front the goal to keep overhead flat just wanted to confirm that means dollars you re talking about sort of dollars similar in 19 to 18 and a lot of moving pieces and g a what s the adjusted base we should be thinking about in 18 that you re comparing that to thank you david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we will be in dollars flat not percent of revenue flat dollars flat and we re looking at 276 million ph brian vaccaro raymond james analyst perfect thank you david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer uh huh operator our next question comes from the line of alex slagle with jefferies please proceed with your question alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst thanks you talked about some of the drivers behind the same store sales outlook for 19 but in terms of the brand performance do you still expect outback to dominate or should we expect this to balance out more in 19 perhaps if there is one of the brands you see having the best opportunity for a near term inflection elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president yeah great question so we see continued strength on outback but the other brands we are we see comp store growth and traffic gains across the portfolio as we have now finished the journey of removing discounting which has tough traffic results over 17 and 18 and are able to monetize those investments so we re looking for growth across all the brands and traffic growth across the portfolio and again we ve talked about this thing the elevated experience the healthier traffic dine rewards the data personalization the strong local marketing feeling really good about the portfolio as we enter 19 in the prospects for each brand do i have one course that i think we ll have a breakout will they get mad at me if i picked one because i think they re all enthusiastic about the year and i think you re going to see strength across the portfolio alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst great and one question on delivery if you could sort of talk about your confidence in the ability to operationally manage all this incremental traffic i guess some of it at peak and maybe a little bit more about elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president we re doing it alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst the changes you plan to make with the interior remodels david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure the good news is we re doing it and it s interesting some of our highest volume restaurants also have the highest volume delivery there were some concern with the high volume restaurants to be able to take it and it s just so great to see and when we look at our interior and exterior remodel programs we will make sure we have the room available for our partners to be able to in their pump out rooms for off premise to be able to execute the concept that s a big part of our remodel program so it s across the portfolio and we already are doing it and we track speed of service we track all those kind of things customer satisfaction and we re pleased to say that we re continuing to make progress each and every quarter on all those key measures elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president i think if you ve ordered just if you ve ordered our delivery i think you can see that leaps and bounds improvements in technology and efficiency and kind of where we re going and that s driving momentum across all of the stores so i m really proud of the team alex slagle jefferies company inc analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gregory francfort with bank of america please proceed with your question gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst hey guys i have two questions the first is just where have you been running on blended pricing either in the fourth quarter or the full year of 18 and then my other question is it seems like a lot of the messaging is it the margin expansion is going to come from the store level expenses and i guess i would have thought maybe more of it was going to come from g a and why are you at the gap you are to the industry on g a and why isn t there maybe more opportunity on that line david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer sure we will see significant leverage in g a as we go forward and that s a big part of our productivity so if i was not clear on that my apologies but that s a big part of our opportunities in g a especially as we manage the non facing ph cost so that s a big part of our program and in one that we will continue to work through that s number one and i m sorry the other part of your question gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst pricing pricing within the fourth quarter david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we disclosed the change that the overall change in check includes mix and pricing we do not get into the pricing detail but i can tell you as we go forward we will be having moderate pricing increases below inflation because we want to make sure that the customer experiences top notch gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst got it and maybe if i can do just one follow up on dine rewards where have you been seeing the benefits are those in customers coming to the brands they re are going to more frequently or are you seeing them sort of trial across brands more than you have in the past i guess as you have looked at the data and i guess bringing up ph more information on this in a couple of weeks but where are you seeing the benefits on that line elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president yeah both and i think that s what s really exciting we re seeing our existing customers experience our other brands and so increase their entire frequency it is at right across our ecosystem and we re also seeing kind of new users come in and experience the brands and so we ve introduced a lot of folks to fleming s for example and now they re choosing fleming s to go for their annual celebration of x or y and so it s this working across the portfolio that s made it kind of that one plus one equals three and that will be something that we ll talk in more detail about in march gregory francfort bofa merrill lynch analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of sharon zackfia with william blair please proceed with your question sharon zackfia william blair analyst hi good morning can you hear me ok elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president hey sharon we sure can sharon zackfia william blair analyst great thank you for a number of different reasons revenue growth has lagged comp growth over the last three or four years i m just wondering is this the year where we see revenue growth kind of at least keep pace with comp growth that s not exceed the rate of comp growth and then how do you think about that revenue growth longer term is it more optimizing average unit productivity with dine rewards and delivery and off premises or do you think there will be more expansion opportunity with one of your other brands domestically going forward david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yeah we see expansion opportunities as liz has mentioned we see expansion opportunity for outback in the us where we think we have at least 50 more incremental sites we think we have we ve talked about brazil getting to 100 outbacks we now believe it s it s an opportunity for us to expand beyond that and we re doing that work right now in the last four out the five four five the last fleming s sites that we have opened have been really really strong and so we feel good about the fleming s opportunity going forward i think sharon to the other thing is when you look at revenue growth liz has mentioned that we are always looking at our portfolio from time to time we will refranchise restaurants and so that will in itself reduce revenue because we re not getting the company sales anymore but absent that the comp growth in the expansion opportunities that i just talked about i think our chance for us to to grow revenue but also take a look in your modelling if you do any refranchising so that will diminish revenue growth even though it might be a better way to go to market in that particular geography elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president yeah the only other thing i d add is that you know we have always been very disciplined about new unit growth and saying across all of our brands you have to earn the right to grow we re feeling increasingly enthusiastic about bonefish and carrabba s and we ll continue to fill that box and drive that productivity but they are were opened to their coming a point given how well we believe those brands are going to do to taking kind of these top rated brands and going prudently with into new units if it makes sense we ve proven ourselves to be disciplined stewards of capital but we do see that on the horizon because we are very confident in driving the average unit productivity sharon zackfia william blair analyst and i may have missed this but did you give any update on how the off premise s only locations are kind of fairing ph and whether that s an opportunity for growth david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer yes that s an opportunity for growth it continues to be a test for us we have some of them are working quite well some of that aren t doing as well as we had hoped but it is an opportunity especially as the industry moves forward and we re looking to refine that with further menu reductions and also some more systems work but right now it s a test for us and we re continuing to learn as we go forward sharon zackfia william blair analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of andrew strelzik with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning a couple of questions on delivery when you talk about completing the roll out fully in 2019 across outback and carrabba s how many units are you thinking that ultimately gets to is it the full system across the two brands domestically and also as you are now ramping that back up and looking for significant margin expansion can you talk at all about the delivery economics and how that layers in to that margin expansion david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer okay on delivery because we re seeing an incrementality the margin the margin is very helpful to us we won t have as high a margin because we re not delivering alcohol and beverage as the in restaurant experience but the given the incrementality of the business that helps us but also we re growing the business that we already have the 480 we have are growing year on year we expect to have around 600 restaurants when we re done yeah we will see then it could be higher than that depending on where we end up but that would be our guess right now and we look to finish that in 2019 andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst great and if i could squeeze one more in just wondering about the check growth that you re thinking about in outback in 2019 i mean it s been running close to 4 you re not going to be taking much price and i recognize the delivery investments are kind of through at this point so are there going to be other efforts to improve the mix at outback or are you going to kind of pull back on that in an effort to continue to have the traffic pick up the this lag david deno executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer we ll continue to we don t want it for competitive reasons obviously to get into any kind of detail but we ll continue to manage the comp through traffic and mix as we always do but the one thing i want to assure you is on the pricing side we ll continue to watch that carefully like i had mentioned previously in the call andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst great thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to liz smith for closing remarks elizabeth smith chairman chief executive officer president we appreciate all of you joining us today and we re

dollar traders is that while the fed has clearly signaled rates are going nowhere anytime soon softer economic data normally supports the argument that the fed should consider a more accommodative stance which is normally dollar bearish but since the us appears to be the best of the worst dollar weakness has been limited the difficult part for traders is that normally you would want to pair the

mercer international inc computation of operating ebitda unaudited in thousands operating ebitda is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges management uses operating ebitda as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results and as a benchmark relative to its competitors management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities in addition we believe operating ebitda is commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations as a measure of performance nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity the following tables set forth the net income to

will 2019 be the year of the big breakout for gold in each of the last three years gold has gotten off to a strong start only to fizzle as the year moved along will 2019 be the year gold finally breaks the pattern a good many investors fund managers and analysts think that 2019 might very well be the year when gold breaks the restraints and pushes to higher ground one of those is carter worth of cornerstone macro in new york who cnbc s melissa lee refers to as the chart master in a recent interview with lee worth referred to the long term chart below saying that there is a well defined set up and a lot of tension which he says is going to resolve to the upside a breakout to all time highs with respect to gold s relationship to the dollar worth says gold s got its own momentum now it is all setting up for higher gold prices and trouble for equities trouble for the economy the far left s next great monetary experiment mmt this mmt sounds like a recipe for immense inflation even hyperinflation says daily reckoning s bill maher you are spending all this money directly into the economy it will drive consumer prices through the attic roof you say this is crackpot a witch s sabbath of inflation would surely result yes but here the mmt crowd meets you head on they agree with you they agree mmt could cause a general inflation possibly even a hyperinflation modern monetary theory mmt is neither modern nor a theory john law the scottish financier tried a version of it exactly 300 years ago 1717 18 in france he did so with the blessing of the french monarchy and with a rationale very similar to mmt s proponents today in the end law s theories to his surprise if we are to believe the historical account bankrupted the french people and the government reduced the economy to ashes and created such a distaste for paper scrip among the citizenry that it took 80 years for france to reintroduce paper money as a circulating medium the shrewder speculators became alarmed they began to sell their shares of stock and hoard in gold the enormous wealth they had acquired this resulted in a demand on the government for metal in exchange for its paper and soon the government had no metal to give then the crash came those who had the government paper could buy nothing with it those who held the mississippi stock could scarce give it away it was worthless the government itself refused to accept its own paper for taxes a few lucky speculators had made vast fortunes but thousands of families especially among the wealthier classes were ruined edward s ellis and charles f home the story of the greatest nations 1900 please see this link for a summary of law s mississippi company land scheme funds institutions push gold etf stockpiles to the highest level in five years when this year s davos conference attendees boarded their private jets for the long ride home they left the swiss mountain resort with a sense that all is not well in the global economy and that financial markets might be in for some unpleasant times that sense of foreboding has big money led by some of the top names in the money management business paring its exposure to stock and bond markets and deploying that capital in the gold market gold etfs the favorite haunt for funds and institutions taking a stake in the gold market have started the year by adding 72 tonnes of gold to their stockpiles the influx has pushed the combined etf total to 2 513 tonnes the highest level since 2013 china builds up gold reserves in shift away from dollar as reported in the south china morning post yi gang the current central bank governor said in 2013 when he headed the state administration of foreign exchange safe that beijing was unable to diversify significantly into gold because the gold market is too small for china s us 3 trillion foreign reserves but things may start to change though it remained to be seen whether the modest gold purchases in the last two months represented a fundamental shift in china s attitude towards the precious metal analysts said i mentioned this south china morning post article in a recent daily market report but i did not pass along or comment on the portion highlighted above which may be the most interesting aspect of xin and yeung s report to give you an idea of china s dilemma with respect to gold and perhaps an inkling of just how undervalued gold is at current prices consider that all the gold ever mined according to world gold council data is worth about 7 5 trillion at a 1250 gold price china in other words could buy 40 of all the world s gold with its 3 trillion in reserves the market value of the 8 133 5 tonne u s gold reserve at 1250 per ounce is 335 billion thus china could buy america s gold reserve almost ten times over or put another way could swap its entire dollar reserves for the stockpile at 12 500 per ounce if by this time you have come to the conclusion that something is critically out of joint in this mathematical construct you are correct it is the price of gold silver forecast shortage to send silver prices soaring above 20 in 2019 surprisingly since gold and silver started their uptrend late last summer both are up the same number roughly 13 in other words silver has not outperformed gold as many thought it would at least so far that doesn t mean it won t in the future the gold silver ratio is still nearly 83 to one and still bumping along near its highs since 1970 that could all be changing now writes jason hamlin in a silver phoenix article as silver has become increasingly attractive to investors looking for undervalued asset classes or safe haven investments silver is benefiting from the persistent trade war government shutdown weakening dollar and a more dovish federal reserve venezuela s hyperinflation by the charts and numbers when a combination of currency debasement and inflation strikes an economy the effects can be sudden and severe as indicated in the two charts shown below i had to smile when i read this matter of fact summation of the situation from trading economics not that i fail to empathize with how these numbers translate to everyday life for venezuela s average citizen consumer prices in venezuela jumped 1 300 000 percent year on year in november of 2018 up from a 833 997 climb in october according to estimates from venezuela s opposition led congress inflation rate in venezuela averaged 3 268 55 percent from 1973 until 2018 reaching an all time high of 833 997 percent in october of 2018 and a record low of 3 22 percent in february of 1973 the usdveb traded at 248 520 9000 on wednesday january 23 historically the venezuelan bolivar reached an all time high of 248 520 90 in august of 2018 and a record low of 0 05 in january of 1989 it does not take a great deal of imagination to contemplate what the effects might have been on the price of gold in bolivars the charts below tell the tale of hyperinflation in venezuela charts and above commentary courtesy of tradingeconomics com gold sentiment reading on the mend climbing pretty steadily recently we touched base with sentiment trader s jason goepfert to ask about his latest reading on gold market sentiment we thought it might be a good time to check to see if there were any changes now that the price is approaching the 1300 level he graciously sent over the chart posted below along with the following comment our measure reached a point of maximum pessimism in august and has been climbing pretty steadily ever since it reached the upper end of neutral recently before falling off a bit bull markets tend to see optimism stay above 40 during the pullbacks so the next one will be interesting to watch we got the surge off of the extreme pessimism and now if it can hold above 40ish and starting bouncing again it would argue strongly that the longer term trend has changed for the better chart courtesy of sentimentrader com jason goepfert u s mint posts strongest american eagle bullion gold coin sales in two years gold and silver bullion coin sales rebounded in january with the strongest monthly sales in two years the u s mint

typically slow down in december as the mint and market wholesalers gear up for the new year the solid gains over january of last year indicate growing interest among investors as we head into the new year january is typically a strong month for sales in both the gold and silver categories as collectors and investors step up purchases of coins bearing the new year s date central bank gold demand highest in 50 years many analysts credit the washington gold agreement of 1999 as the seminal document at the heart of gold s secular bull market in it the top central banks agreed to gradually curtail the sale and lease of gold reserves two activities that kept the price rangebound for much of the 1990s at the time gold was stuck in the 270 to 300 price range from there it never looked back fast forward to 2011 and we begin to see central banks moving from the net seller side of the gold fundamentals ledger to become net buyers some analysts applauded the simple retreat from sales and leases as a major victory for gold bulls the move to becoming net buyers was icing on the cake in 2018 central bank gold purchases reached their highest level in fifty years according to world gold council data a profound development the machinations of which have yet to be fully digested in the marketplace notablequotable this is a rally inside a bear market we could have something between a 10 percent and a 30 percent decline the market on a risk reward basis is dangerous we do feel as if individuals ought to cut back their equity exposure i m a believer that gold represents true money we

europe could have benefited from a nascent recovery of world trade investment and finance but now even these hopes are diminishing dan steinbrock counting pips editor s note it seems with all the problems steinbrock mentions coming to a head simultaneously that europe is one trigger event from a major unraveling gold demand is running at high levels on both sides of the english channel courtesy of world gold council i grew up in a purely urban family we had no relatives in the country i m born in 1944 when i was a baby my mother could only buy food because she still had some gold coins without gold i would have starved she always told me that therefore this generation already has a certain gold affinity in extreme times of crisis this is one of the few things left to be accepted gold was the only thing left to the people of the city at that time before the silver cutlery was also traded at the farmer ewald nowotny european central bank governor we can t assume it will be a smooth sail for the rest of 2019 so what does that mean for you as an investor if you need insurance for your portfolio the best way to protect yourself from economic chaos is by owning some gold now i have been saying this for years jim cramer cnbc the market reaction has been positive for risk assets but not as drastic as might have been expected yes the fed was expected to move in a dovish direction so some of this was in the price before wednesday but nobody expected fed chairman jerome powell to embrace the dovish narrative so fully john authers bloomberg gold and silver like other commodities have an intrinsic value which is not arbitrary but is dependent on their scarcity the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them and the value of the capital employed in the mines

beijing before his first year as leader of china was out and three years before donald trump was elected president of the united states xi jinping laid out a historic vision for market forces to rule the 13 trillion chinese economy now trump is demanding that xi finish the job making a sweeping overhaul of china s economy a key condition for ending the u s china trade war as trump s negotiators led by trade representative robert e lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin sit down with their chinese counterparts for a second day of trade talks friday u s demands for such structural changes will be at center stage during a chinese communist party conclave in november 2013 xi declared that he would restructure the economic system to let the market play the decisive role in the allocation of resources advertisement although he reiterated the party s commitment to socialism xi s pronouncement was viewed as an epochal moment for the world s second largest economy after the third plenum there were a lot of great expectations albeit unrealistic that the state was finally going to retreat and the market would thrive said jane golley head of the australian center on china in the world at australian national university referring to the meeting by its official name but today just a year before the event s 330 plus major policy changes are scheduled to be completed the third plenum symbolizes the gap between chinese promises and performance it also shows how trump s hopes of winning genuine structural changes in china s economic model are colliding with the entire thrust of xi s rule which has been all about bolstering beijing s role in the economy while preserving communist party control advertisement securing xi s assent to abandon the economic model that lifted china from maoist impoverishment to become the world s fastest growing major economy would crown trump s confrontational diplomacy with success but few analysts anticipate such an outcome china has made genuine progress in only two of the 10 areas where it has promised changes innovation and environment on labor land fiscal affairs competition and state owned enterprises it has regressed according to an analysis by rhodium group for the asia society policy institute policies of the kind that xi envisaged in 2013 and that trump wants now are hard for the party to push through as the economy slows growth decelerated to 6 4 percent last year and a state run paper this week warned it could sink to 6 percent in 2019 xi wants to steer the economy toward a high tech and dominant position said barry naughton an expert on china s economy at the university of california at san diego but when it comes to paying any kind of cost in terms of reduced growth rates or even worse any kind of economic turbulence he seems quite ready to step back advertisement in 2016 china halted a key financial liberalization and restricted outflows from its capital account apparently spooked by an outflow of nearly 1 trillion the erosion of its foreign exchange reserves and a weakening currency negotiators are racing the march 1 deadline trump set for a comprehensive deal that includes more than just amped up chinese orders for u s farm energy and industrial goods but some of the administration s china hawks fear the president worried about the impact of a prolonged trade dispute on u s financial markets and the economy will settle for something less than fundamental changes in china s economic model chinese negotiators appear to be hoping trump will do just that and settle for large purchases of u s soybeans and liquefied natural gas to narrow the u s trade deficit with china which is expected to hit a record 400 billion plus when final 2018 figures are tallied advertisement one of the main points of contention in the protracted trade discussion has been the role of china s state owned enterprises rather than empower the market as he promised in 2013 xi has lavished aid on state companies that s been especially true in strategic sectors such as aerospace energy heavy industry and telecommunications xi is a modernizer more than a reformer said michael hirson eurasia group s director for china he wants to modernize the tools the party uses to stay in power and keep china on its trajectory of being a stable rising power share this article share as a result state backed companies continue to enjoy preferential access to astonishing amounts of credit less than a month after xi toured northern regions last year chinese banks extended a 144 billion credit line to faw group the state owned maker of the iconic red flag cars favored by communist party leaders since mao zedong a fundamental issue remains the xi administration s belief that the political value of maintaining soe dominance still outweighs the economic costs said wendy leutert of harvard s fairbank center for chinese studies referring to state owned enterprises advertisement state companies are now growing faster than private companies for the first time since deng xiaoping launched china s economic overhaul four decades ago said nicholas r lardy an economist with the peterson institute for international economics decided party control was more important than economic growth said lardy the results have contributed to china s economic slowdown resources poured into state companies have rewarded inefficiency acting as a drag on china s performance even as state companies bulked up via mergers their return on assets fell from 6 percent in 2005 to less than half that figure by 2017 according to lardy within key industries the iron nexus linking communist party officials at the helm of major state owned enterprises state banks regulatory agencies and provincial and municipal governments has kept private sector companies chinese and foreign at a disadvantage according to craig allen president of the u s china business council advertisement after years of promises china this year began loosening limits on foreign participation in its financial services industry regulators lifted the cap on foreign stakes in securities firms mutual fund companies and insurers answering repeated u s demands but allen said more is needed it s really late and it s much less than we bargained for when china joined the world trade organization in 2001 he said u s officials complain that chinese authorities funnel generous subsidies via state banks to government owned companies while bureaucrats craft regulations that discriminate against their foreign competitors under china s state led system foreign companies are often required to surrender proprietary technology before being allowed into the market and hackers working for the state pilfer trade secrets from their corporate computers advertisement getting china to agree to stop doing this will be close to impossible analysts say because beijing flatly denies that it happens when it comes to intellectual property rights protection another key issue for the united states china is likely to make promises analysts say but how to make sure these agreements stick is tricky but the biggest factor holding reforms back might be beijing s belief that its industrial policy is indeed giving it an advantage said naughton of the university of california they think that one of the motivations for the u s to be so aggressive in recent months is that the u s also thinks china s industrial policy plans are working

directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with ifrs please refer to exhibit ii at the end of this press release ceo statement paul wogan chief executive officer stated gaslog delivered another set of record results in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven in large part by very strong earnings from our spot vessels against a backdrop of extreme tightness in the lng shipping market these spot earnings combined with our fleet growth during the year our strong operational performance and strict cost control delivered record annual results for revenues ebitda and profit and allowed us both to increase our common dividend by 7 1 and to declare our first special dividend in november during 2018 we continued to execute our growth strategy we announced seven newbuild orders six of which are committed to long term charters four with cheniere and two with a wholly owned subsidiary of centrica plc centrica we are very pleased to continue to develop and strengthen our relationship with these two important customers gaslog partners issued over 320 0 million of new equity in 2018 of which over 200 0 million was recycled to gaslog as consideration for the two dropdowns and the modification of the idrs which will permanently reduce the partnership s expected cost of capital the equity recycled to gaslog and our declining leverage mean that we are well placed to fund our newbuild vessels under construction the continued growth of our fleet the improvement in spot earnings and our cost control measures mean we have made significant progress towards meeting our target of more than doubling consolidated annualized ebitda over the 2017 2022 period while spot rates have recently moderated from fourth quarter peaks in line with historical seasonal trends we expect tightness in lng shipping markets to return given forecast lng supply growth through 2020 and relatively few uncommitted newbuild vessels delivering in that period as we look beyond 2020 additional shipping capacity will be required if consensus lng demand and supply forecasts are realized however whilst we now believe that the lng shipping market is heading towards a balanced state early next decade the long term secular growth of lng supply and demand mean that over the medium and long term gaslog will continue to serve a dynamic and growing industry lng market update and outlook lng demand as estimated by wood mackenzie is expected to have increased by 9 from 288 million tonnes per annum mtpa in 2017 to 313 mtpa in 2018 according to china s general administration of customs china s lng imports increased by approximately 16 mtpa or 41 to 54 mtpa in 2018 driven mainly by continued coal to gas switching in the industrial commercial and residential sectors south korea pakistan thailand and mexico also experienced strong growth in lng imports during 2018 the outlook remains robust with wood mackenzie forecasting compound annual growth in global lng demand of 6 between 2018 and 2025 this growth is expected to be broad based with wood mackenzie forecasting that south east asia and europe will account for approximately 70 of the 148 mtpa net increase in demand between 2018 and 2025 according to wood mackenzie global lng supply in 2018 totaled 326 million tonnes mt or a 9 increase on 2017 several new lng supply projects and the ramp up of existing facilities contributed to the increase in lng production in 2018 during the year new production started in the united states cove point corpus christi train 1 and sabine pass train 5 australia wheatstone train 2 ichthys russia yamal trains 2 3 and cameroon floating lng supply from existing liquefaction facilities in egypt trinidad and tobago and oman also increased following successful efforts to raise domestic gas production downtime at existing facilities in malaysia and russia partially offset these gains based on wood mackenzie s current forecasts 2019 is anticipated to be the strongest year ever for supply growth in the lng market with supply expected to increase by 40 mtpa to 366 mtpa a 12 increase on 2018 this includes new lng production from elba island cameron freeport and corpus christi train 2 in the united states the prelude floating lng project offshore australia further increases in russia s output and the continued ramp up of projects which were brought onstream in 2018 during 2018 three new lng liquefaction projects reached final investment decision fid underpinning further lng supply growth during the next decade lng canada 14 mtpa in western canada corpus christi train 3 4 5 mtpa in the united states and the greater tortue ahmeyim project offshore mauritania and senegal 2 5 mtpa were all approved during the year in february 2019 the golden pass 16 mtpa project in the united states also reached fid according to wood mackenzie proposed projects including golden pass in the united states with a combined capacity of approximately 35 mtpa are expected to gain investment approval in 2019 outside the united states qatar is aiming to take fid on an expansion of existing facilities from 77 to 110 mtpa new projects offshore mozambique 28 mtpa and the arctic lng 2 project 20 mtpa in russia are also expected by wood mackenzie to be approved in 2019 in parallel with the progress on new supply fids in 2018 there was a significant increase in the number of announced long term lng off take contracts according to wood mackenzie and company disclosures 95 mtpa of long term defined as greater than 5 years duration off take commitments have been agreed since the beginning of 2018 compared to 25 mtpa in 2017 the nature of the lng marketplace also continued to evolve according to the financial times the top three independent commodity traders increased their delivered lng volumes by almost 40 to 31 mt in 2018 taking market share from traditional participants such as national oil companies and major integrated oil and gas companies in the lng shipping spot market tri fuel diesel electric tfde headline rates as reported by clarksons averaged 89 000 per day in 2018 a 93 increase on 2017 levels headline tfde rates rose significantly in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reached all time highs of 190 000 per day in november 2018 following a marked decrease in spot ship availability average headline tfde rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 150 000 per day headline rates for steam propulsion steam vessels also reached multi year highs of 98 000 per day in late 2018 in recent weeks however relatively mild winter weather and ample inventory levels in key asian markets have resulted in falling asian lng prices reducing the incentive to move lng cargoes from the atlantic to the pacific basin and resulting in a seasonal rise in prompt vessel availability and falling spot rates headline tfde spot rates are currently assessed at 60 000 per day notwithstanding this recent fall and the likelihood of continued seasonality in the spring shoulder months we continue to believe that the medium term outlook for spot rates through 2019 and 2020 is positive given supportive lng commodity fundamentals and lng shipping supply and demand however spot rates may be prone to further periods of seasonality and volatility similar to that seen in 2018 during 2018 there was a significant increase in term chartering activity based on poten data charters between 181 days to seven years duration increased to 19 of total fixtures in 2018 from 5 in 2017 our expectation of structural tightness in the lng carrier market combined with increasing spot vessel availability could result in this trend continuing in 2019 and beyond according to poten there were 61 orders for dedicated lng carrier newbuilds in 2018 an all time high the orderbook now totals 105 dedicated lng carriers 100 000 cbm of which 63 are backed by long term contracts the positive outlook for lng commodity and lng shipping markets as well as historically low newbuild prices resulted in both existing lng carrier owners and new entrants ordering new vessels based on 2018 newbuilding orders and current forecasts of lng supply growth we now believe that the lng shipping market is heading towards a balanced state early next decade as such the requirement for additional shipping capacity in this period has now been largely addressed this implies that newbuilding order activity in 2019 needs to slow relative to 2018 levels in order to reduce the risk of vessel oversupply completion of the sale of the methane becki anne on november 14 2018 gaslog completed the sale of 100 of the ownership interest in gas twenty seven ltd the entity which owns the methane becki anne to gaslog partners for an aggregate purchase price of 207 4

to 2 050 and 8 317 operating days for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the increase in operating days resulted mainly from the deliveries of the gaslog houston the gaslog hong kong and the gaslog genoa on january 8 2018 march 20 2018 and march 29 2018 respectively partially offset by certain non operating days for the vessels not operating under a long term time charter and the off hire days for four dry dockings in 2018 the gaslog santiago the gaslog sydney the gaslog skagen and the gaslog seattle as opposed to only one dry docking in 2017 the gaslog

2017 respectively the increase was mainly driven by the new deliveries in our fleet the gaslog houston the gaslog hong kong and the gaslog genoa and the increased revenues from vessels operating in the spot market due to the significant increase in lng shipping spot rates during the year as a whole and the fourth quarter in particular partially offset by a decrease due to the expiration of the initial time charters of the gaslog shanghai the gaslog santiago and the gaslog sydney and the increase in off hire days due to dry dockings in 2018 gaslog recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of 57 9 million and 2 4 million respectively from the operation of its vessels in the cool pool during the quarter ended december 31 2018 14 5 million and 3 6 million for the

generated by the gaslog vessels in accordance with the pool distribution formula for the total fleet of the pool the increase in gaslog s total net pool performance during the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 compared to the quarter and year ended december 31 2017 was driven by higher spot rates and higher utilization achieved by all vessels trading in the cool pool gaslog s total net pool

december 31 2018 as compared to the quarter ended december 31 2017 was mainly attributable to a decrease in bunkers consumed due to the increased utilization of our vessels in the spot market the year on year increase resulted mainly from the increased bunkers consumed during certain off charter and off hire days vessel operating and supervision costs were 29 1 million and 128 1 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively 35 6 million and 122 5 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the decrease for the quarter ended december 31 2018 as compared to the quarter ended december 31 2017 was mainly attributable to a decrease in technical and maintenance expenses as well as a decrease in tonnage tax and insurance costs the year on year increase was mainly attributable to the deliveries of the gaslog houston the gaslog hong kong and the gaslog genoa earlier in 2018 resulting in increased crew costs partially offset by a decrease in tonnage tax general and administrative expenses were 9 7 million and 42 0 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively 9 6 million and 39 9 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the year on year increase was mainly attributable to an increase in employee costs due to the unfavorable movement of the usd against the eur and the

revenues for the vessels operating in the spot short term market under the cool pool agreement the two newbuild vessels without charters and the methane nile eagle in which we hold a 25 0 minority interest contracted revenue calculations assume a 365 revenue days per annum with 30 off hire days when the vessel undergoes scheduled dry docking every five years b all lng carriers on order are delivered on schedule and c no exercise of any option to extend the terms of charters revenue calculations for such charters include an estimate of the amount of the operating cost component and the

the spot short term market are included 3 represents available days for ships after the expiration of existing charters assuming charterers do not exercise any option to extend the terms of the charters and the available days for the vessels operating in the spot short term market and the two uncommitted newbuild vessels other than the assumptions reflected in the footnotes to the table including our assumption that our newbuildings are delivered on schedule the table does not reflect events occurring after december 31 2018 the table reflects only our contracted charter revenues for the ships in our owned fleet and bareboat fleet for which we have secured time charters and it does not reflect the costs or expenses we will incur in fulfilling our obligations under the charters nor does it include other revenues we may earn such as revenues for technical management of customer owned ships in particular the table does not reflect any revenues from the six vessels that are operating in the cool pool any additional ships we may acquire in the future nor does it reflect the options under our time charters that permit our charterers to extend the time charter terms for successive multi year periods the entry into time charter contracts for the six vessels that are operating in the cool pool and any additional ships we may acquire or the exercise of options extending the terms of our existing charters would result in an increase in the number of contracted days and the contracted revenue for our fleet in the future although the contracted charter revenues are based on contracted charter hire rate provisions they reflect certain assumptions including assumptions relating to the service elements of revenues we consider the assumptions to be reasonable as of the date of this report but if these assumptions prove to be incorrect our actual time charter revenues could differ from those reflected in the table furthermore any contract is subject to various risks including performance by the counterparties or an early termination of the contract pursuant to its terms if the charterers are unable or unwilling to make charter payments to us or if we agree to renegotiate charter terms at the request of a charterer or if contracts are prematurely terminated for any reason we would be exposed to prevailing market conditions at the time and our results of

expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s business operations during 2019 raw material prices are expected to remain at their current level or decrease the national economy and industrial production are growing moderately in russia an important market area for aspo while international sanctions and their possible increase have maintained uncertainties regarding the development of the russian economy general political risks continue to increase and this may have rapid effects on the operating environment or decrease free trade also affecting the operating conditions of customers of aspo s businesses economic conditions will remain favorable in aspo s businesses even though there is always the risk of rapid changes aki ojanen ceo of aspo group comments on the fourth quarter and financial year aspo s net sales continued to increase significantly and the operating profit adjusted by the impairment loss recognized on kauko s goodwill improved clearly even though aspo s profitability has developed positively and all main businesses increased their operating profit during the fourth quarter we have not been able to use the full potential of all businesses esl shipping accounted for a significant part of the increase in aspo s net sales esl shipping s new environmentally friendly vessels and the acquisition of swedish shipping company atob c had a positive effect on its net sales in the fourth quarter eastern markets an area important to aspo developed well with net sales during the fourth quarter growing by 12 during the fourth quarter the impairment loss of eur 4 8 million recognized on kauko s goodwill strained aspo s operating profit serious technical problems with cranes slowed down the deployment of esl shipping s new vessels this also reduced profit for the fourth quarter cargotec macgregor the crane supplier is committed to completing its warranty repairs during the first quarter of 2019 we can be satisfied with the operation of the energy and environmental efficiency systems of the new vessels when we can raise the reliability and efficiency of the loading and unloading operations of the new vessels to the planned level the vessels will meet our high profitability requirements and they can be placed to intended customers cargo deliveries during the 2018 financial year net sales reached a new record level of eur 541 million the operating profit for the financial year adjusted by the impairment loss recognized on goodwill stood at eur 25 4 million increasing for the second year in succession the operating profit for the period was eur 20 6 23 1 million during the 2018 financial year aspo made significant investments to ensure its future growth and the development of its profitability esl shipping s new vessels and the acquisition completed in sweden combined with investments to expand operations for example in central asia enable aspo s strong financial performance to continue we expect aspo s strong financial performance to continue and indebtedness to decrease aspo is committed to reaching its financial goals the year 2018 was significant in terms of investments and operations on our way towards our goals during the financial year net sales increased in all of aspo s market areas the most significant growth took place in scandinavia as a result of esl shipping s acquisition which also increased net sales in finland during the fourth quarter net sales in the baltic countries increased slightly at an annual level but decreased notably during the fourth quarter net sales in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased substantially during the fourth quarter and the market area was the second largest for aspo following finland financial targets aspo s objective is to reach an average return on equity of over 20 gearing of up to 100 and an operating profit of 7 with the current structure by 2020 the operating profit rate for the financial year was 3 8 4 6 return on equity was 12 4 17 1 and gearing was 154 4 103 9 the operating profit rate adjusted by the impairment loss recognized on goodwill was 4 7 outlook for 2019 global economic growth is expected to slow down economies in russia and eastern markets will continue their moderate increase while political risks and international sanctions imposed on russia have maintained a high level of risks in the market area meaning that future development is difficult to predict the risk of increasing obstacles to international free trade has remained and negative development may also be rapid which may affect the operating prerequisites of aspo s principals customer companies or aspo s businesses exchange rates are expected to continue to fluctuate heavily economic growth in the eu and particularly in finland remains at good level while the growth in finnish export volumes has decelerated the increase in industrial production is expected to slow down in the main market areas of aspo s businesses in northern europe the boom will continue in aspo s businesses even though there is always the risk of rapid changes the prices of industrial raw materials and oil that are important to aspo are expected to remain at their current low level dry bulk freight rates in sea transportation that are important to esl shipping are expected to remain at their current level aspo s business operations esl shipping esl shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the baltic sea region at the end of the financial year the shipping company s fleet consisted of 49 vessels with a total capacity of 464 000 dwt of the vessels 22 are wholly owned two are minority owned one is leased and the remaining 24 are time chartered esl shipping s competitive edge is based on its ability to secure product and raw material transportation for the industries and energy production round the year even in difficult weather conditions the shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at

being at the same level as in the year before at the end of the quarter duties and sanctions that potentially restrict international free trade have increased uncertainties over continued international growth during the fourth quarter the shipping company s vessels mainly operated in contract traffic in the baltic sea and in northern europe and also performed loading and unloading operations at sea transportation operations in the baltic sea and the north sea are mainly based on long term customer agreements and established customer relationships operations from the canadian arctic to europe continued as in previous years until the end of the season in november the numerous storms in late autumn caused lay days in vessel operations and additional costs also as a result of higher fuel consumption esl shipping s net sales in the fourth quarter increased significantly as a result of higher transportation volumes the completion of the new vessels and the increase in the vessel capacity through the acquisition of atob c as part of its growth strategy esl shipping completed the acquisition of swedish shipping company atob c on august 31 2018 its figures are included in the shipping company s financial reporting starting from the beginning of september net sales for the fourth quarter grew by 105 from the comparative period to eur 46 4 22 6 million the impact of the acquisition on the increase in net sales was eur 20 0 million in the fourth quarter operating profit for the fourth quarter was eur 4 2 4 1 million the operating profit rate for the period of 9 1 18 1 was not satisfactory considering long term target fluctuations in the prices of ship fuel were unusually high during the fourth quarter the highest prices of the year were recorded in the middle of october after which prices fell rapidly by more than 30 to the lowest level of the year fuel prices mainly have an impact on net sales through fuel clauses included in agreements however extreme short term fluctuations have also some impact on results transportation volumes in the steel industry increased from the comparative period but were lower than expected due to production problems at certain plants and congestion at ports in the energy industry the transportation volumes of coal decreased slightly as expected from the comparative period the transportation volumes of biofuels increased as expected transportation volumes in other customer sectors increased significantly in particular as a result of new product groups and customers brought by the business acquisition the cargo volume carried by esl shipping during the final quarter amounted to 4 5 3 3 million tons demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea was at the usual level in the fourth quarter being however lower compared with the very high demand in the previous year through the acquisition of atob c esl shipping also strengthened its position in the smaller vessel category the shipping company s operations diversified significantly as it expanded its service range and customer base from the transportation of raw materials to industrial products esl shipping will continue its development to offer more environmentally friendly and efficient transportation solutions to meet its customers future needs in the fourth quarter two smaller wholly owned vessels and both party owned vessels were docked as planned in november atob c acquired a 4 100 dwt dry cargo vessel of ice class 1a built in 2000 the shipping company had already operated the vessel through long term time chartering and it also owns the vessel s sister ship in the fourth quarter esl shipping started activities to reach synergy benefits and profitability target level in addition it strengthened its operating and sales resources through recruitment processes in order to ensure the high and efficient use of its vessel capacity all important and expiring customer agreements were renewed as targeted during the fourth quarter in addition the shipping company signed new agreements and expanded existing agreements at a highly satisfactory cargo level ms viikki and ms haaga the world s first ice strengthened dry bulk cargo vessels fueled by liquefied natural gas have started their operations the vessels fulfil the high goals set for them for example in terms of load bearing capacity fuel economy and eco friendliness in the fourth quarter both vessels arrived safely and fully laden to the baltic sea via the northern sea route which is shorter than the route via the panama canal by three weeks significantly reducing the environmental impact of the voyage however extensive and serious problems in the conventional mechanics of high power cranes which are subject to warranty have significantly interfered with the efficient operations of both vessels these have resulted in significant loss of income and additional costs for the shipping company this problem concerns all the cranes on both vessels due to the delivery times of spare parts repairs are expected to be completed only at the end of the first quarter of 2019 during this time the vessels cannot be operated fully efficiently as planned in 2018 esl shipping improved its profitability and its operating profit stood at eur 15 1 13 5 million the operating profit includes eur 0 9 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition the shipping company s net sales grew by 51 in january december to eur 120 1 79 3 million in 2018 the cargo volume carried by esl shipping amounted to 13 4 11 4 million tons outlook for esl shipping for 2019 the shipping company s vessel capacity increased significantly as a result of the atob c acquisition and the completion of its two new vessels due to serious warranty repairs involving the cranes of the new vessels the financial performance of the vessels can only reach the targeted level starting from the second quarter the increase in capacity enables the company to improve its operational efficiency and profitability especially during the second half of the year when there is typically a shortage of vessel capacity economic growth is expected to slow down in the shipping company s main market areas in finland any disputes resulting from collective bargaining in the transportation sector may have an impact on the operations of customer companies and transportation chains during spring actions directed at international free trade an increase in political risks and decelerating economic growth in china may have an impact on global flows of goods the vessel capacity in the vessel categories operated by the shipping company will increase slowly and the availability of leased high quality vessels may be limited particularly in the smaller vessel category the development of the cargo markets in 2019 will be most directly reflected in the financial performance of the largest supramax vessels of the shipping company most of the shipping company s transportation capacity has been secured in the baltic sea and northern europe through long term agreements the current forecasts of general transportation volumes of contractual partners are highly satisfactory in all key customer segments even though there are uncertainties in demand due to political situation and increased economic uncertainty general demand in the steel industry is high and transportation volumes are expected to develop very positively and improve significantly starting from the second quarter demand for loading and unloading operations for large ocean liners at sea a segment important to the shipping company is expected to remain high furthermore demand for raw material and product transportation in the forest industry an important sector for the shipping company s smaller vessel category is expected to continue strong total transportation volumes in the energy industry are expected to increase from the previous year as a result of higher demand for the transportation of bioenergy the biofuel transportation markets in the baltic sea are expected to grow significantly in the near future the transportation volumes of coal will decrease as expected during 2019 three vessels of the larger category and one smaller vessel will be docked as planned in addition the docking of time chartered vessels will affect the available vessel capacity the content of the time chartering portfolio will be reviewed if necessary in accordance with any changes in demand ice conditions in the baltic sea area are expected to be normal during winter and spring wind conditions will have an impact on the development of pack ice which may be reflected in the efficiency of operations esl shipping aims at net sales of more than eur 200 million and an operating profit rate of 12 15 by 2020 leipurin leipurin is a unique provider of solutions for bakery and confectionery products and the out of home foodservice market the solutions offered by leipurin range

meat industry raw material business as well as compensation in the fourth quarter related to leipurin s project delivery completed in 2014 including processing fees totaling eur 0 5 million during the fourth quarter confidence among consumers decreased in leipurin s main market areas the consumer price of food increased in finland and the rate of inflation accelerated slightly in russia remaining however at a low level the prices of raw materials important to leipurin showed variation from one raw material group to the next and the market prices of seasonal products continued to increase during the fourth quarter the market for industrially packed bread continues to decrease in the west whereas the market of in store bakeries and baking units has continued to increase this change presents challenges in the operations of industrial bakeries in 2017 a change took place in russia as a result of which bakeries are no longer responsible for retail bread wastage instead any unsold bread is covered by the retail industry the change has significantly reduced the production of packed bread and reduced net sales compared with the comparative period however this change has increased the markets for in shop bakeries in russia where leipurin has gained a strong market position the trends that are important to leipurin and affect the consumer market i e increasing popularity of out of home eating eating snacks and the consumption of pastries continued the net sales of leipurin in the fourth quarter decreased from the comparative period to eur 31 6 32 9 million this decrease was mainly attributable to the timing of project deliveries in machinery operations net sales in ukraine and russia and in certain baltic countries increased the operating profit of eur 0 8 0 7 million was not at the targeted level the operating profit includes costs from the discontinuation of loss producing operations such as raw material operations in poland operations in eastern markets in particular improved profitability the operating profit rate during the quarter was 2 5 2 1 net sales of bakery raw materials in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased in the fourth quarter by 2 to eur 9 1 8 9 million the operating profit rate was approximately 9 10 net sales in the eastern markets including machinery sales increased by approximately 14 to eur 11 8 10 3 million and the operating profit rate was approximately 10 10 in western markets the total net sales of raw material and foodservice operations were at the comparative period s level the decreasing profitability of the loss producing test cafeteria operations and costs from discontinuation of raw material operations in poland and a test cafeteria had a negative impact on the operating profit in finland the total net sales of raw material and foodservice operations were at the comparative period s level even though the volume of industrial sales fell the net sales of foodservice operations increased in finland from the comparative period as a result of the procurement and logistics services of a new significant chain customer currently foodservice operations do not account for any significant part of net sales the net sales of machinery operations fell by roughly 20 due to the timing of project deliveries in leipurin s own machine production and deliveries of principals equipment cyclicality is typical of leipurin s machinery operations due to the timing of revenue recognition related to bakery lines and projects leipurin s net sales in january december fell to eur 121 0 million 122 3 the net sales of raw material operations decreased by 3 due to the divestment completed at the end of august 2017 where leipurin sold its meat industry raw material business to mp maustepalvelut oy leipurin s operating profit improved to eur 3 3 3 1 million the operating profit during the comparative period included sales gains of eur 0 4 million from the sale of meat industry raw material business and compensation of eur 0 5 million for a project delivery completed by leipurin in 2014 including processing fees the operating profit during january december was strained by the further decrease in loss producing operations such as raw material operations in poland and by costs from the discontinuation of loss producing operations in addition exchange rate losses and increased resources in foodservice operations reduced the operating profit net sales in russia other cis countries and ukraine increased by 3 6 to eur 36 3 35 0 million profitability in this market area remained at the comparative period s level approximately at 8 8 outlook for leipurin for 2019 the market situation is expected to remain challenging in leipurin s key markets the development of leipurin s main customer categories i e bakeries and foodservice chains continues to vary from one customer to the next for example many bakeries in finland announced in 2018 that their operations will discontinue this reduces the net sales of leipurin s operations in finland the market position of leipurin is expected to remain strong in the industrial baking sector in finland russia and the baltic region the operating profit of leipurin is expected to increase in 2019 in russia the national economy and the purchasing power of consumers are in moderate growth while international sanctions and their possible increase have added to the uncertainties regarding the development of the russian economy exchange rate changes have reduced leipurin s price competitiveness in eastern markets however leipurin will continue to develop the procurement of bakery raw materials in the area in order to better respond to any changes in demand leipurin will maintain its high profitability in the region strengthen its market position and look for growth in the bread and pastry sectors as well as in store bakeries the foodservice market is a significant area of growth for leipurin leipurin will continue to invest in the foodservice market particularly in finland and the western markets where leipurin is responding for example to the growing demand of chain customers such as cafés and fast food restaurants the company has further developed its operations targeted at foodservice chains offering both procurement and logistics services to chain customers the large logistics volumes of leipurin as well as its efficiency and expertise allow the development and expansion of its operations in terms of machinery operations bakeries are expected to maintain their current equipment investment level in finland and the baltic countries a moderate increase in investments is expected in russia the expansion of the procurement network for leipurin s own machine production and the development of manufacturing and installation lead times will continue in machinery operations the order book shows variation between quarters currently orders focus on the latter half of 2019 due to customers project schedules the increase in the leipurin s own machine production will be driven by increased industrial investments in leipurin s home markets and elsewhere in europe financing the

developing operations procedures and products as part of the customer specific operations which means that the development inputs are included in normal operational costs and are not itemized the development and certification costs of medical computers developed by kauko have been capitalized as product development expenditure and they are amortized over their useful life the amount of this expenditure is low at aspo group level corporate responsibility the ceo and board of directors of aspo group are responsible for the management of corporate responsibility in accordance with the company s risk management policy ensuring corporate responsibility is vital in order to secure the company s long term development aspo acts like a good corporate citizen in all its operating countries for aspo being a good corporate citizen means bearing its social responsibilities as demonstrated by the way aspo always pays its taxes in the country where it has made its profit only a responsibly led growing company can create jobs tax revenue and wellbeing aspo treats all of its employees and stakeholders fairly and equally in all its operating countries aspo group s code of conduct and environmental policy form a common set of rules for all businesses aspo s key operations consist of the development of the trade and logistics businesses it owns above all aspo approaches corporate responsibility through responsible leadership and management key aspects of corporate responsibility in the fields in which the businesses aspo owns operate are reduction in energy consumption and the volume of waste the wellbeing of employees and safe working environment equality and good governance aspo takes climate change seriously and aims to reduce its impact through its actions aspo s businesses continued to develop their responsibility in 2018 all of aspo s businesses have shared and separate indicators that represent the responsibility of their operations aspo s responsibility report will be presented in the year 2018 publication to be released in conjunction with financial statements aspo s application to join the un s global compact initiative was approved in december 2018 and therefore aspo committed to adopting supporting and implementing the ten principles related to human rights working life principles the environment and the prevention of bribery within its scope of influence risks and risk management despite the lower financial indicators the economic outlook is positive in all aspo s market areas economic growth and increased industrial production have decreased financial risks associated with aspo s market areas but general risks can increase when the economic trend reaches its peak increases in political risks are not expected to have any impact on aspo s business operations in the short term import duties imposed by the usa and china which limit international free trade have not affected aspo s operations aspo does not have any business operations that are or would be affected directly by the brexit or its implementation but there may be an indirect impact through the principals or customers of aspo s businesses following the financial crisis the global economy is growing simultaneously in all of aspo s market areas decelerating towards the end of the year in the eurozone development has slowed down partly due to growing political tension related to trade in russia the increase in the gdp and the inflation rate are at the expected levels exports have increased and private consumption and investments have increased slowly general cargo prices in sea transport fluctuated throughout the period under review at the end of the review period the prices started to increase financial risks in all of aspo s businesses have decreased as a result of more stable markets however any unexpected changes in international politics and trade policies combined with rapid changes in exchange rates or commodities markets may have an impact on the demand and competitiveness of the products of aspo s companies the subdued demand for investment commodities which earlier limited growth in both the eastern and western markets has turned into a moderate increase investments have increased in russia even though most of them are still targeted at the energy sector private consumption and export volumes have increased slowly as there have been no structural economic changes economic growth is expected to remain at the previous year s level strategic risks political risks have increased globally which may have a rapid impact on aspo s operating environment and reduce free trade in the short and long term the economic and political situation in aspo s market areas may have made it more difficult to make structural changes as part of aspo s strategy even though some have been implemented recently the situation may continue unchanged but as the economic and political pressure alleviates or increases it may change rapidly the russian economy has stabilized inflation has accelerated slightly and growth is slow deteriorated consumption demand in the long term has affected trade in general but the increase in nominal wages has increased consumption even though inflation has reduced the purchasing power in ukraine the economic situation has stabilized consumer and producer prices are at a moderate level and did not change significantly after the fluctuations early in the year during the review period production volumes were up from the previous year and imports and exports increased albeit at a more moderate rate than in the previous year no signs of weakening have been seen in the financial and payment markets of russia and ukraine but they involve risks that are reflected for example in the russian banking sector companies are now more willing to make investments the promotion of local production has increased the volume of raw materials and items produced in russia in industrial production despite the decrease in quality this may further reduce the position of imported raw materials in the value chain and the margin level but correspondingly an increase in import volumes may increase demand for foreign raw materials and reduce related risks for aspo economic sanctions their increase or other obstacles arising from the economic or political situation in russia may in part reduce transportation volumes originating from russia and the demand for unloading services for large ocean liners at sea protectionist actions may decrease sea transportation in the russian arctic if russia set stricter regulations on internal transportation for example regarding the transport of energy products in finland and the rest of europe social pressures to reduce the use of fossil energy sources in energy production have increased which will reduce coal transportation volumes in the future correspondingly the transportation volumes of replacement energy products will increase due to this change it is difficult to estimate future transportation volumes fluctuations in international freight indices their extended low level and the global increase in the number of vessels particularly in large size categories have increased uncertainty over the long term profitability of shipping companies nevertheless there are signs of an increase in freight indices and of a decrease in the number of vessels in operations in the long term strategic risks may be caused by the deterioration of the global economic situation the political atmosphere protectionism and the outlook and production choices of industrial customers decisions regarding energy production structures affected by environmental policy and other political choices cause changes in industry and energy production that may decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of alternative forms of energy the flow of goods in the baltic sea may change as a result of steel production cost structures changes in the customer structure such as centralization or other reasons these changes may have negative consequences on operations as the need for transportation decreases but they can also be seen as significant opportunities as a result of low cargo prices in international shipping competition over cargoes may also become fiercer in the baltic sea mild ice free winters may also increase competition during the review period esl shipping received two new low emission vessels with better fuel economy for this region and customer base these will also be able to operate in ice conditions the shipping company also completed an acquisition that will significantly improve its competitiveness strategic risks are influenced by long term changes in cargo prices the building of new vessels and the removal of others from the markets investment trends and changes in trade structures especially in western markets in eastern markets risks are increased by such factors as political instability social structures or the lack of reaction to the difficulties encountered by business operations the accumulation and discharge of investments may cause long term changes in the competitive situation and customer behavior trade between eastern and western markets may suffer from restrictions on free trade as a result of which there may be a decrease in the sales of goods and services rapid changes in economic structures may cause risks due to changes in the customer or principal structure or technologies and due to unused opportunities that require a quick response changes in demand as a result of various megatrends may cause changes in the product and service ranges of aspo s subsidiaries due to which it may be difficult to replace their current products disruptive changes may be very rapid aspo s strategic risks are evened out by the distribution of business operations over four segments its engagement in business operations in a broad geographical area and its ability to react quickly to changing situations in addition to western markets aspo operates in areas where economic trends or the political atmosphere may turn rapidly positive or negative which could significantly change the prevailing operating conditions operational risks economic uncertainty in aspo s operating environment was lower during the review period than in the previous year however operational risks remained unchanged these include risks related to supply chains goods and services and persons the threat of different kinds of misuse from outside the company has also increased as a result of the development of electronic media for a long time the focus of aspo s growth has been on emerging market areas where risks decelerating growth are affected by factors such as exchange rate fluctuations and interest rates the level of and changes in the global market prices of raw materials industrial and commercial investments customer liquidity changes in legislation and import regulations and inactivity bias or corruption among public authorities economic growth and alternatively any decrease in production may have an impact on demand for raw materials political instability makes commercial activities more difficult and if the situation prolongs it may also decelerate the growth of aspo s businesses consumer behavior and confidence are also reflected in risks associated with b to b customers and their risk levels the growth opportunities presented by emerging markets are encouraging interest among competitors in starting or expanding business operations in these areas the challenging emerging markets and their escalated situations have also caused competitors to withdraw from these markets which has created new potential for aspo s businesses and has increased their market shares hedging against exchange rate changes is not possible in all conditions or in particular at all times changes in exchange rates may reduce profit and equity on the balance sheet as a result of translation differences then again changes in exchange rates may also strengthen results and the balance sheet as changes in credit loss risks are diversified across businesses and customers aspo s businesses have not been subjected to any significant credit losses related to their customers even though credit loss risks have increased and provisions are made for them in accordance with principles of ifrs 9 standard the technical products or applications deployed by aspo s businesses may break or malfunction due to which the increase in profit based on these products or applications may slow down or be delayed sales margins may be reduced and financial claims related to deliveries may emerge if aspo s products are not suited for the customers production processes or do not have the correct technical properties operational risks have also increased as a result of computer related crime malware and the increased number of fraud attempts if realized these risks may mean financial losses for aspo aspo has appropriate information security and internal training arrangements but individual cases may occur due to the decentralized structure of operations any deviations in internal processes may result in losses for example in the form of taxes or official fees the quantity and probability of the group s loss risks are regularly assessed bidding processes are arranged for general insurance policies and the amounts insured are regularly updated the amounts insured are sufficient in view of the scope of aspo s operations but insurance companies may restrict the validity of insurance policies as a result of risks increasing for various reasons such as in war areas internal control and risk management one of the responsibilities of aspo s audit committee is to monitor the efficiency of the group s internal control internal audits and risk management systems the audit committee monitors the risk management process and instructs necessary measures to prevent strategic risks in particular in accordance with the internal control principles approved by the board of directors risk management is part of aspo

directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with ifrs please refer to exhibit ii at the end of this press release ceo statement paul wogan chief executive officer stated gaslog delivered another set of record results in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven in large part by very strong earnings from our spot vessels against a backdrop of extreme tightness in the lng shipping market these spot earnings combined with our fleet growth during the year our strong operational performance and strict cost control delivered record annual results for revenues ebitda and profit and allowed us both to increase our common dividend by 7 1 and to declare our first special dividend in november during 2018 we continued to execute our growth strategy we announced seven newbuild orders six of which are committed to long term charters four with cheniere and two with a wholly owned subsidiary of centrica plc centrica we are very pleased to continue to develop and strengthen our relationship with these two important customers gaslog partners issued over 320 0 million of new equity in 2018 of which over 200 0 million was recycled to gaslog as consideration for the two dropdowns and the modification of the idrs which will permanently reduce the partnership s expected cost of capital the equity recycled to gaslog and our declining leverage mean that we are well placed to fund our newbuild vessels under construction the continued growth of our fleet the improvement in spot earnings and our cost control measures mean we have made significant progress towards meeting our target of more than doubling consolidated annualized ebitda over the 2017 2022 period while spot rates have recently moderated from fourth quarter peaks in line with historical seasonal trends we expect tightness in lng shipping markets to return given forecast lng supply growth through 2020 and relatively few uncommitted newbuild vessels delivering in that period as we look beyond 2020 additional shipping capacity will be required if consensus lng demand and supply forecasts are realized however whilst we now believe that the lng shipping market is heading towards a balanced state early next decade the long term secular growth of lng supply and demand mean that over the medium and long term gaslog will continue to serve a dynamic and growing industry lng market update and outlook lng demand as estimated by wood mackenzie is expected to have increased by 9 from 288 million tonnes per annum mtpa in 2017 to 313 mtpa in 2018 according to china s general administration of customs china s lng imports increased by approximately 16 mtpa or 41 to 54 mtpa in 2018 driven mainly by continued coal to gas switching in the industrial commercial and residential sectors south korea pakistan thailand and mexico also experienced strong growth in lng imports during 2018 the outlook remains robust with wood mackenzie forecasting compound annual growth in global lng demand of 6 between 2018 and 2025 this growth is expected to be broad based with wood mackenzie forecasting that south east asia and europe will account for approximately 70 of the 148 mtpa net increase in demand between 2018 and 2025 according to wood mackenzie global lng supply in 2018 totaled 326 million tonnes mt or a 9 increase on 2017 several new lng supply projects and the ramp up of existing facilities contributed to the increase in lng production in 2018 during the year new production started in the united states cove point corpus christi train 1 and sabine pass train 5 australia wheatstone train 2 ichthys russia yamal trains 2 3 and cameroon floating lng supply from existing liquefaction facilities in egypt trinidad and tobago and oman also increased following successful efforts to raise domestic gas production downtime at existing facilities in malaysia and russia partially offset these gains based on wood mackenzie s current forecasts 2019 is anticipated to be the strongest year ever for supply growth in the lng market with supply expected to increase by 40 mtpa to 366 mtpa a 12 increase on 2018 this includes new lng production from elba island cameron freeport and corpus christi train 2 in the united states the prelude floating lng project offshore australia further increases in russia s output and the continued ramp up of projects which were brought onstream in 2018 during 2018 three new lng liquefaction projects reached final investment decision fid underpinning further lng supply growth during the next decade lng canada 14 mtpa in western canada corpus christi train 3 4 5 mtpa in the united states and the greater tortue ahmeyim project offshore mauritania and senegal 2 5 mtpa were all approved during the year in february 2019 the golden pass 16 mtpa project in the united states also reached fid according to wood mackenzie proposed projects including golden pass in the united states with a combined capacity of approximately 35 mtpa are expected to gain investment approval in 2019 outside the united states qatar is aiming to take fid on an expansion of existing facilities from 77 to 110 mtpa new projects offshore mozambique 28 mtpa and the arctic lng 2 project 20 mtpa in russia are also expected by wood mackenzie to be approved in 2019 in parallel with the progress on new supply fids in 2018 there was a significant increase in the number of announced long term lng off take contracts according to wood mackenzie and company disclosures 95 mtpa of long term defined as greater than 5 years duration off take commitments have been agreed since the beginning of 2018 compared to 25 mtpa in 2017 the nature of the lng marketplace also continued to evolve according to the financial times the top three independent commodity traders increased their delivered lng volumes by almost 40 to 31 mt in 2018 taking market share from traditional participants such as national oil companies and major integrated oil and gas companies in the lng shipping spot market tri fuel diesel electric tfde headline rates as reported by clarksons averaged 89 000 per day in 2018 a 93 increase on 2017 levels headline tfde rates rose significantly in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reached all time highs of 190 000 per day in november 2018 following a marked decrease in spot ship availability average headline tfde rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 150 000 per day headline rates for steam propulsion steam vessels also reached multi year highs of 98 000 per day in late 2018 in recent weeks however relatively mild winter weather and ample inventory levels in key asian markets have resulted in falling asian lng prices reducing the incentive to move lng cargoes from the atlantic to the pacific basin and resulting in a seasonal rise in prompt vessel availability and falling spot rates headline tfde spot rates are currently assessed at 60 000 per day notwithstanding this recent fall and the likelihood of continued seasonality in the spring shoulder months we continue to believe that the medium term outlook for spot rates through 2019 and 2020 is positive given supportive lng commodity fundamentals and lng shipping supply and demand however spot rates may be prone to further periods of seasonality and volatility similar to that seen in 2018 during 2018 there was a significant increase in term chartering activity based on poten data charters between 181 days to seven years duration increased to 19 of total fixtures in 2018 from 5 in 2017 our expectation of structural tightness in the lng carrier market combined with increasing spot vessel availability could result in this trend continuing in 2019 and beyond according to poten there were 61 orders for dedicated lng carrier newbuilds in 2018 an all time high the orderbook now totals 105 dedicated lng carriers 100 000 cbm of which 63 are backed by long term contracts the positive outlook for lng commodity and lng shipping markets as well as historically low newbuild prices resulted in both existing lng carrier owners and new entrants ordering new vessels based on 2018 newbuilding orders and current forecasts of lng supply growth we now believe that the lng shipping market is heading towards a balanced state early next decade as such the requirement for additional shipping capacity in this period has now been largely addressed this implies that newbuilding order activity in 2019 needs to slow relative to 2018 levels in order to reduce the risk of vessel oversupply completion of the sale of the methane becki anne on november 14 2018 gaslog completed the sale of 100 of the ownership interest in gas twenty seven ltd the entity which owns the methane becki anne to gaslog partners for an aggregate purchase price of 207 4

to 2 050 and 8 317 operating days for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the increase in operating days resulted mainly from the deliveries of the gaslog houston the gaslog hong kong and the gaslog genoa on january 8 2018 march 20 2018 and march 29 2018 respectively partially offset by certain non operating days for the vessels not operating under a long term time charter and the off hire days for four dry dockings in 2018 the gaslog santiago the gaslog sydney the gaslog skagen and the gaslog seattle as opposed to only one dry docking in 2017 the gaslog

2017 respectively the increase was mainly driven by the new deliveries in our fleet the gaslog houston the gaslog hong kong and the gaslog genoa and the increased revenues from vessels operating in the spot market due to the significant increase in lng shipping spot rates during the year as a whole and the fourth quarter in particular partially offset by a decrease due to the expiration of the initial time charters of the gaslog shanghai the gaslog santiago and the gaslog sydney and the increase in off hire days due to dry dockings in 2018 gaslog recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of 57 9 million and 2 4 million respectively from the operation of its vessels in the cool pool during the quarter ended december 31 2018 14 5 million and 3 6 million for the

positive 3 9 million and 7 3 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the variances were attributable to the movement in the adjustment of the net pool results generated by the gaslog vessels in accordance with the pool distribution formula for the total fleet of the pool the increase in gaslog s total net pool performance during the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 compared to the quarter and year ended december 31 2017 was driven by higher spot rates and higher utilization achieved by all vessels trading in the cool pool gaslog s total net pool

december 31 2018 as compared to the quarter ended december 31 2017 was mainly attributable to a decrease in bunkers consumed due to the increased utilization of our vessels in the spot market the year on year increase resulted mainly from the increased bunkers consumed during certain off charter and off hire days vessel operating and supervision costs were 29 1 million and 128 1 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively 35 6 million and 122 5 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the decrease for the quarter ended december 31 2018 as compared to the quarter ended december 31 2017 was mainly attributable to a decrease in technical and maintenance expenses as well as a decrease in tonnage tax and insurance costs the year on year increase was mainly attributable to the deliveries of the gaslog houston the gaslog hong kong and the gaslog genoa earlier in 2018 resulting in increased crew costs partially offset by a decrease in tonnage tax general and administrative expenses were 9 7 million and 42 0 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively 9 6 million and 39 9 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the year on year increase was mainly attributable to an increase in employee costs due to the unfavorable movement of the usd against the eur and the british pound we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge economically part of this exposure and the associated realized losses gains are recorded in gain loss on the derivatives line which is discussed below depreciation was 39 5 million and 153 2 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively 34 6 million and 137 2 million for the quarter and the

respectively financial costs were 44 1 million and 166 6 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively 34 9 million and 139 2 million for the quarter and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively the increase was attributable to the increased weighted average debt outstanding as a result of the debt drawdowns for the vessels delivered in 2018 and the increased weighted average interest rate deriving from the upward movement of the usd london interbank offered rate libor rates an analysis of the financial costs is set out below all amounts expressed in

on derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 is mainly attributable to a decrease of 40 7 million in gain from mark to market valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss derived mainly from changes in the libor curve as well as modifications of the group s interest rate swap portfolio that includes interest rate swap agreements with maturities out to 2028 and a net decrease of 0 4 million in realized gain on derivatives the year on year decrease in gain on derivatives is mainly attributable to a

same quarter of 2017 was driven by the increase in revenues and improved net pool performance reflecting the significant increase in lng shipping spot rates as well as the decrease in vessels

wholly owned vessels the 13 of the 14 vessels owned by the partnership the bareboat vessel and seven of our nine newbuildings on order for which we have secured time charters does not include charter revenues for the vessels operating in the spot short term market under the cool pool agreement the two newbuild vessels without charters and the methane nile eagle in which we hold a 25 0 minority interest contracted revenue calculations assume a 365 revenue days per annum with 30 off hire days when the vessel undergoes scheduled dry docking every five years b all lng carriers on order are delivered on schedule and c no exercise of any option to extend the terms of charters revenue calculations for such charters include an estimate of the amount of the operating cost component and the management fee component 2 available days represent total calendar days after deducting 30 off hire days when the vessel undergoes scheduled dry docking the available days for the vessels operating in the spot short term market are included 3 represents available days for ships after the expiration of existing charters assuming charterers do not exercise any option to extend the terms of the charters and the available days for the vessels operating in the spot short term market and the two uncommitted newbuild vessels other than the assumptions reflected in the footnotes to the table including our assumption that our newbuildings are delivered on schedule the table does not reflect events occurring after december 31 2018 the table reflects only our contracted charter revenues for the ships in our owned fleet and bareboat fleet for which we have secured time charters and it does not reflect the costs or expenses we will incur in fulfilling our obligations under the charters nor does it include other revenues we may earn such as revenues for technical management of customer owned ships in particular the table does not reflect any revenues from the six vessels that are operating in the cool pool any additional ships we may acquire in the future nor does it reflect the options under our time charters that permit our charterers to extend the time charter terms for successive multi year periods the entry into time charter contracts for the six vessels that are operating in the cool pool and any additional ships we may acquire or the exercise of options extending the terms of our existing charters would result in an increase in the number of contracted days and the contracted revenue for our fleet in the future although the contracted charter revenues are based on contracted charter hire rate provisions they reflect certain assumptions including assumptions relating to the service elements of revenues we consider the assumptions to be reasonable as of the date of this report but if these assumptions prove to be incorrect our actual time charter revenues could differ from those reflected in the table furthermore any contract is subject to various risks including performance by the counterparties or an early termination of the contract pursuant to its terms if the charterers are unable or unwilling to make charter payments to us or if we agree to renegotiate charter terms at the request of a charterer or if contracts are prematurely terminated for any reason we would be exposed to prevailing market conditions at the time and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected please see the disclosure under the heading risk factors in our annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on february 28

rbc capital markets us chief economist tom porcelli echoed what many people had to say about the retail data no doubt about it the december retail sales report was one of the ugliest of all time beneath the surface the key control measure tanked 1 7 on the month after a strong 1 0 in november this was the worst sequential read for this metric since the early 2000s to be sure the report suffered from a significant delay on the back of the government shutdown and it is possible that sampling was an issue though the census noted that responses were in line or above the norm the equity market collapse during the tail end of the month don t forget the s p went from about 2800 early in the month to a low near 2350 at the end and the uncertainty around the economic backdrop certainly could have also played a role alas we have to take the number at face value when baking it into our gdp tracking and the damage here is palpable indeed on a q q annualized basis control retail sales went from a tracking near 4 to just 1 8 all in our gdp tracking for 4q drops to 2 0 from 2 8 prior mr porcelli also said though that he is looking at the december data as bump in the road with incomes

percentage of 11 2 adjusted ebitda of 250 1 million overall 2018 was a successful and record setting year for the company as we delivered 4 186 homes up 29 and achieved homebuilding revenues of 2 1 billion up 16 both the highest in the company s history said matthew r zaist president and chief executive officer earlier in the year we completed our strategic acquisition of rsi giving us additional exposure to the first time home buyer segment and expanding our footprint into one of the best new home markets in the country in central texas we along with the rest of the homebuilding industry experienced a challenging environment in the fourth quarter of 2018 in october and november 2018 we experienced homebuyer demand levels that were less than what we had anticipated as mortgage interest rates increased and consumer confidence waned along with increased stock market volatility as a result we sold and closed fewer spec homes in the fourth quarter than we had expected and we also experienced a higher cancellation rate in certain of our markets which led us to fall short of our deliveries and revenue expectations for the quarter on the positive side homebuilding gross margins were at the high end of our expectations sales and marketing percentage was in line with expectations as were g a dollars on an absolute basis though the percentage was higher than our forecast due to decreased leverage on lower revenue mr zaist continued while the disruption we experienced in october and november caused us to fall short of our internal forecasts we are incrementally encouraged by december s rebound in sales activity which demonstrated significant sequential improvement with an absorption pace up 21 over november this sequential improvement continued into january where we saw a more historically representative level of traffic and sales if traditional trends hold true in terms of spring selling season evolution we would expect to see some acceleration moving into the next couple of months although we are taking a more cautious view this year until the selling season plays out operating results home sales revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 657 4 million as compared to 623 3 million in the year ago period an increase of 5 the increase was driven by a 24 increase in deliveries to 1 311 homes compared to 1 058 in the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by a 15 year over year decline in the average sales price of homes closed homebuilding gross margin percentage for homes closed during the fourth quarter of 2018 was 18 8 up 60 basis points from 18 2 in the third quarter of 2018 net new home orders for the quarter were 756 up 13 from 672 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the overall increase in net new home orders was driven by an increase in community count to 117 average sales locations from 80 in the year ago period the dollar value of homes in backlog was 479 0 million as of december 31 2018 an increase of 11 compared to 433 0 million as of december 31 2017 the increase was driven by a 27 increase in units in backlog to 1 041 from 822 in the year ago period the average sales price of homes in backlog decreased to 460 100 from 526 800 in the prior year due to the number of homes in backlog at our central texas division of 234 homes at an average sales price of 261 700 sales and marketing expense during the fourth quarter of 2018 was 5 2 of homebuilding revenue compared to 4 5 in the year ago quarter which was driven by an increase in advertising and outside broker commissions of 30 basis points combined as well as the impact of the adoption of asc 606 of 30 basis points general and administrative expenses increased to 5 5 of homebuilding revenue compared to 4 7 in the year ago quarter

the much anticipated release of rep alexandria ocasio cortez s d n y green new deal already has forced one of the most consequential debates in american history but its substance leaves the field open to a more effective alternative first it s important to understand what s proposed far from socialism the green new deal gnd embraces fundamentally keynesian approaches to mobilize the nation to address massive environmental social and labor problems that already are harming the prosperity and security of the republic itself that is the gnd sees climate change as a way to direct federal dollars to stimulate economic social and political opportunity for those excluded from the 2019 economy but as a non binding resolution it neither authorizes spending nor appropriates tax dollars meaning there is no price tag and that the primary purpose of the document is to launch the most significant debate washington has seen since abolition the preamble sets the stage with a precise summary of aoc s worldview climate change is a massive threat to americans and people around the world the transition to clean energy manufacturing and agriculture represents an enormous opportunity for sustainable economic growth that will benefit all americans and vulnerable communities need prioritization and participation to ensure the transition serves to improve their disadvantaged economic social and political reality the resolution offers a program called the green new deal mobilization to initiate a crash 10 year u s transition to net zero emissions as a means to right some of the injustice aoc sees on our nation s streets in this section the policy meat of the agenda the text is very broad and thin with agriculture for example receiving less than 75 words the text is also very stakeholder focused with objectives optimized for community participation and the strengthening of organized labor here is a quick summary of the 14 objectives that make up the mobilization build national resilience to the unavoidable effects of climate change invest in a new generation of clean and safe urban infrastructure 100 percent of u s power from clean renewable and zero emission energy sources rebuild the national energy transmission network using smart grids upgrade all buildings to reduce emissions ensure clean manufacturing and expand the u s clean tech sector remove emissions from agriculture rethink the transportation system to achieve zero emissions and universal access mitigate the health effects of unavoidable climate change remove carbon from the atmosphere through low tech natural systems restore damaged ecosystems clean up legacy hazardous waste sites solve any other emissions problems and help other countries create their own green new deal after the what of the mobilization is laid out the resolution turns to the how at the top is funding thoughtfully presented as needing many types although direct government spending and grants are paramount but also financing and equity investment that generates a return for the public s money transparency inclusive participation and prioritization of the most vulnerable are key characteristics as well as numerous paragraphs to strengthen the role of unions and address the ongoing concentration of economic power the non binding green new deal resolution is a political prop not a policy framework a big win the resolution closes on a populist note specifically stating that the green new deal will provide all people of the united states with high quality health care affordable safe and adequate housing economic security and access to clean water clean air healthy and affordable food and nature here s where rep ocasio cortez is speaking to her base those hardworking americans who just want the basics to be better ideological critics certainly will attack the proposal first to deny its basic premise then for its more liberal although still far from socialist details moderates are already questioning how realistic the gnd is at the end of the day that is its purpose the non binding green new deal resolution is a political prop not a policy framework it is a prop designed to raise awareness of the urgent risks and the enormous scale of the challenges before us and to inspire or cajole action yes there is too little policy detail to judge whether it would work and how much it would cost but the last proposal to seriously address climate change in congress the waxman markey cap and trade bill a decade ago was much less forthright about the scope of the problem or the required scale of the response at the end of the day a national mobilization is necessary to address the multiple converging perils facing the united states and here the real service provided by the release of the green new deal is the space it creates to have this debate and to develop desperately needed plans to address the single greatest threat to the u s and the world as george marshall famously observed it s not the plan but the planning that matters indeed speaker of the house nancy pelosi already said as much in response saying that the gnd will be one of many suggestions she expects to receive that s already a big win another service the gnd provides is the staking out of the leftmost parameter of the debate and taking fire from critics and climate deniers given aoc s own brand and the support the resolution has received from progressives such as sen bernie sanders i vt sen elizabeth warren d mass and rep jim mcgovern d mass it s hard to imagine anything arriving that is more politically liberal and while adhering to an established ideology comes with some real advantages it also carries real consequences in this case that means surrendering the high ground in the coming policy debate a friendly amendment while the science is clear on the need for massive national transition and the politics of any transition require it to improve the lives of americans and the nation s strategic position the analogy to the new deal and its keynesian approach is difficult to square the original new deal reduced the suffering of a population that was one quarter unemployed and lacking any meaningful retirement security yet the alphabet soup of stimulus programs and reforms simply were unable to restore secular demand and our economy crashed again in the second dip of the great depression in 1937 the thinking behind both the mobilization for world war ii and for the post war boom that followed was not keynesian where keynes was focused on how government could stabilize the boom bust cycle through well managed markets the economic engineering done for and after world war ii were of a completely different and higher order these economic strategies aligned three macro factors in a relationship designed to allow our economy and nation to succeed they identified large pools of demand for goods and services contracted directly or subsidized capital to serve that demand and they designed the economic engine to in part minimize stranded assets caused by the transition between economic engines in other words demand capital stranded assets economic engine for world war ii the formula is familiar weapons cost plus contracts unemployed workers after 1945 the formula was profoundly different suburbs subsidies unemployed veterans the key was to ensure that the demand and capital being harnessed were deep durable and capable of recycling potentially stranded assets labor capital equipment real estate natural resources the demand is there the capital is there and the primary potential stranded asset has plenty of valuable alternative uses even better we don t need to wait on washington to act used as the economic foundation of two of america s grand strategies the nation was thus able to turn on a dime win a world war break the grip of the great depression and set the united states up to defeat the soviet union in a contest of economic and political systems but nearly 75 years later we have yet to revisit that aging economic engine despite homebuyers and investors abandoning the suburban hypothesis and while climate change and the re emergence of asia are forcing a global economic re think in this light the gnd s prescription is akin to bolting on green energy and new infrastructure spending to an economic engine that rusted out decades ago further because the gnd does not lash itself to a pool of secular demand demand for things americans will work hard to earn for years if not decades it likely will face a similar fate to the original new deal perhaps crashing sooner due to historically high level of debt in global markets present today fortunately as we laid out in our 2016 book the new grand strategy there is a formula for a sustainable american economic engine the demand is there the capital is there and the primary potential stranded asset has plenty of valuable alternative uses even better we don t need to wait on washington to act let s break it down demand sixty percent of americans want a walkable lifestyle according to the national association of realtors that s three times the demand for housing after world war ii walkable communities are more energy efficient healthy and inclusive by design and by unleashing a walkable housing boom we can provide the efficiency gains state and local revenues and private demand signal that can deliver a 100 percent renewable transition such as the one laid out in the solutions project without raising federal taxes to do it it s actually suburban sprawl that requires burdensome taxpayer subsidies not walkable places beyond walkable places there is massive global demand for food requiring an increase global agricultural production by 60 percent by 2050 one hundred percent of that new production needs to be regenerative sequestering carbon healing our soils and cleaning up our water that s great news for our agricultural heartland finally the world is desperate for new building materials with asia growing its cities and middle class and the united states poised to add 100 million new citizens before 2050 in the same way we cannot power the future with fossil fuels we cannot build a sustainable future out of the materials of the past concrete steel aluminum lumber and gypsum we need a lower carbon palette of building materials and all the new products and manufacturing that entails all three sources of demand are more than enough opportunity for widespread prosperity capital america is poised for a post keynesian economic engine in which substantial amounts of financing come not from public treasuries but from institutional investors such as pensions and reinsurance who now understand that their fiduciary obligations require them to invest long term in the health and sustainability of the system itself by allocating just 10 percent of their portfolios to strategic impact investing the infrastructure and assets of a sustainable economy they can replace much of the missing capital from washington while boosting their overall rate of return this pool of long term capital had not yet formed in the middle of the last century so keynes and fdr could not have considered tapping it but today the money is there the top 400 institutional investors control more than 65 trillion in assets while the total cost of sustainable infrastructure in the united states is roughly 4 5 trillion over 10 years when that money finally adopts a hard nosed set of requirements for walkable investments regenerative agriculture and energy and material efficiency the market will respond faster than anything washington could do and led by groups such as ceres investor network on climate risk and sustainability and focusing capital on the long term it is only a matter of time stranded assets the assets most at risk of being stranded in the transition to a zero emission world are hydrocarbons oil and natural gas while society can do little else with coal besides keep it in the ground it s become clear that the world cannot transition in the time remaining without finding alternatives to the extremely carbon intense palette of building materials we currently use we simply cannot build the future out of the materials of the past concrete alone accounts for more than 5 percent of global emissions the most available alternative is hydrocarbons which are already replacing metals in the production of vehicles are essential to every wind turbine and solar panel and are rapidly replacing building and infrastructure components with lightweighting mechanical and composite advantages that enable much higher degrees of efficiency as well as recycling and with unsubsidized renewable energy already outcompeting fossil fuels a material transition will help move oil and gas from being part of the problem to being part of the solution so the formula for the new grand strategy is walkable communities institutional investment hydrocarbons new economic engine the exciting thing about this new economic engine is that it does not need washington to act which won t happen until at least 2021 anyway because the demand is already there homebuyers want walkability and investors want green investments a cluster of institutional investors blue chip companies and consumer finance firms working with willing mayors and governors need only take the next logical step and adopt the integrated straightforward business models that turn historic levels of consumer demand for walkable lifestyles into an economic force that essentially hacks our broken economy we cannot afford to wait walkable places can come in any size from agricultural villages to suburban towns to vibrant cities and are growing in red and blue states alike walkable places powered with renewable energy served by efficient and accessible mobility fed by regenerative agriculture and built with sustainable materials can reduce more than 90 percent of america s emissions and put our people and our capital back to work it s a new american dream and that s a vision most americans can get behind patrick doherty is a founder of long haul capital group and co author with col mark puck mykleby usmc ret and greenbiz executive editor joel makower of the new grand strategy restoring america s prosperity security and sustainability in the 21st century

welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call i d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning with me today is aaron jagdfeld our president and chief executive officer we will begin our call today by commenting on forward looking statements certain statements made during this presentation as well as other information provided from time to time by generac or its employees may contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward looking statements please see our earnings release or sec filings for a list of words or expressions that identify such statements and the associated risk factors in addition we ll make reference to certain non gaap measures during today s call additional information regarding these measures including reconciliation to comparable u s gaap measures is available in our earnings release and sec filings i will now turn the call over to aaron aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks york good morning everyone happy valentine s day thank you for joining us today our fourth quarter results capped off a fantastic year for generac in 2018 as we again experienced record quarterly sales through strong core organic growth of approximately 12 overall net sales increased 14 compared to the prior year when including the contribution from the selmec acquisition which was slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts during the quarter for the full year net sales grew more than 20 to over 2 billion with ebitda margins expanding 210 basis points over the prior year to 21 or approximately 425 million continued strength in all of our end markets underpin the increases in 2018 with demand for home standby generators in particular remaining very robust throughout the year as increased power outage activity over the last two years alongside the impact of our initiatives to grow the market resulted in continued penetration gains shipments of c i products were also significantly higher year over year driven by continued recovery in domestic mobile products and growth in demand for backup power in the telecom and healthcare sectors in addition strong organic sales growth was again experienced within the international segment which was leverage into further improvement in adjusted ebitda margins for the year awareness for the home standby generators has benefited from elevated baseline power outage activity during the past two years with end user activations remaining very strong in the fourth quarter and the full year particularly in the northeast and southeast regions our residential dealer base continued to expand during the year to an all time high of more than 6 000 production levels of home standby generators were at all time highs for the company during the quarter and demand for these products remain strong heading into 2019 shipments of portable generators were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year which included the impacts of major hurricane activity but were up significantly for the full year driven by the elevated outage activity replenishment of channel inventories and additional retail placement experience demand for domestic mobile products remained strong during the quarter and for the full year as the equipment rental markets further recovered in 2018 with the rebound in the oil and gas markets and increased construction activity both contributing to the continuing fleet refresh cycle demand for stationary domestic c i generators also increased in the fourth quarter as the elevated power outage environment drove broad based growth across a number of end markets in particular certain of our telecom account customers are investing heavily in hardening their networks in response to their customers needs for consistent uptime demand for natural gas fueled generators was particularly strong during the quarter and for the full year while diesel gensets remain the dominant choice for c i backup power globally natural gas generators continues to gain acceptance as a substitute due to their economic and operational advantages in addition to the growth experienced domestically in the fourth quarter and for the full year our international business also saw a strong growth in mainland europe latin america australia brazil and china adjusted ebitda margins for the full year for our international segment continued to expand with improved operating leverage on the higher sales volumes being the biggest contributor to the improvement we re also seeing success with the introduction of our gaseous fuel products into markets outside the u s and canada with both residential and c i products experiencing impressive growth rates during the year albeit off a small base we achieved a number of significant milestones in 2018 that we believe are important to the execution of our strategy in may we launched the latest version of our flagship home standby generator product line with wi fi connectivity as a standard feature as an industry first we believe that the ability for a consumer or a dealer to remotely monitor a generator is a great first step toward enhancing the customer experience as well as enabling a deeper relationship with both end users and distribution partners with this new functionality we have also introduced a new software platform known as fleet specifically for our dealers that allows them to track the status of every single one of their customers generators by providing real time information about the status of each machine as well as dramatically enhancing the level of diagnostic information available we believe the dealers will be able to better track and schedule needed repairs or maintenance and we ll be able to do so with greater precision and speed with the outcome being to maximize the uptime of generators under their care we also believe that the connectivity layers we are building and now deploying could have an important impact on other future opportunities by creating a gateway to the electrical system of a home or business the market for certain services related to energy monitoring and management is rapidly developing and we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in electronics and electrical systems our broad distribution our global footprint and our brand to participate in this exciting new space in 2018 we also expanded our position as the largest global manufacturer of gaseous fuel backup generators with the introduction of a 750 kilowatt machine the largest output unit in our lineup we are very pleased with the initial acceptance of the product as interest has been strong since its release mid year the substitution of natural gas power gensets for traditional diesel fuel products has accelerated in recent years as the performance of newer gas machines equals or exceeds that of diesel generators while providing some tangible benefits for the end user by mitigating the need for fuel delivery lower overall operating costs and cleaner emissions a core component of generac strategy is to build on its leadership position in the market for natural gas gensets and throughout 2018 we introduced a number of new products new programs and innovative technologies related to gaseous generators during the year 2018 was also a record year for sales volumes outside the u s and canada for generac with 22 of our overall revenues being generated primarily through our pramac ottomotores tower light and motortech entities building on our success in globalizing the company we closed on the acquisition of a mexican genset company selmec in june of last year recall that selmec is located in mexico city and is a designer and manufacturer of commercial and industrial generators serving latin america with a particular focus on the telecommunications market and strong service capabilities the integration of selmec with our existing ottomotores operations is well under way with the latest milestone achieved earlier this month as we opened a new headquarters facility in mexico city to consolidate our commercial and administrative teams into a single location further integration activities are planned for 2019 as we look to realize the synergies of combining the systems and production activities of the two businesses in addition in early 2019 pramac acquired a majority share of captiva energy solutions captiva founded in 2010 and headquartered in kolkata india specializes in customized industrial generators while relatively small in size this acquisition gives us a physical presence in the important indian backup power generation market and provides a platform to execute on the potential revenue and sourcing synergies that exist by integrating the captiva operation into the broader pramac business finally i d like to spend a minute this morning to tell you about some exciting enhancements we re making to our long term strategy that we call powering ahead over the last 10 years we have used powering ahead as our blueprint for making investments and prioritizing our resources in that time we ve effectively more than tripled the revenues of generac while simultaneously quadrupling our served markets as our business evolves from being a smaller more narrowly focused company to that of a larger globally focused leader in the power products industry we believe that our strategy must also evolve last year you may recall that we added the strategic pillar of lead gas to powering ahead as we believe that our continued leadership in gaseous fuel generator technology has a critical element of our future growth and focus as we continue to think about other areas of our business and the markets that we serve that present significant opportunities for us we can see the connectivity in the technologies and markets associated with the internet of things will play a vital role in the way we interact with customers and distribution partners well into the future the ability to connect will have a profound impact on the way we develop new products the way we think about our customer service models the opportunities to better monetize our products over their entire lifecycle and the exciting prospects around potentially creating entirely new business models around energy monitoring and energy management as a result we re adding a new pillar to our strategic plan simply called connect and we are updating the name of our enterprisewide strategy to be called powering our future as we have done for the last 10 years we intend to continue to prioritize our resources and our efforts around our strategic plan with powering our future the four strategic objectives we have established of growing the residential generator market globally gaining share in our existing markets leading in gaseous generator technologies and using connectivity to develop new opportunities with our customers and distribution partners will guide our focus and investments for the future i d now like to turn the call over to york to provide further details on the fourth quarter results york york ragen chief financial officer thanks aaron before discussing fourth quarter results in more detail recall that effective january 1 2018 generac adopted the new gaap revenue recognition accounting standard for comparability purposes the full retrospective method was elected under the standard which requires application to all periods presented although the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements so the prior year 2017 figures that we are discussing this morning have been adjusted accordingly in addition upon finalizing our revenue recognition accounting under the new standard we made certain immaterial prior quarter reclassifications to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to extended warranties there was no impact on income from operations or net income as a result of these prior quarter reclassifications see our press release for more information related to these prior quarter reclassifications now looking at our fourth quarter 2018 results in more detail net sales for the quarter increased 14 3 to 563 4 million as compared to 493 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluding the 13 3 million of contribution from the june 1 2018 selmec acquisition and the slightly negative impact from foreign currency core growth rate during the quarter was approximately 12 looking at consolidated net sales by product class residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 10 3 to 293 9 million as compared to 266 6 million in the prior year quarter despite the fact that the prior quarter included the immediate after effects of hurricanes harvey irma and maria the current year quarter still experienced very strong growth in shipments of home standby generators as end market demand for these products continues to be robust the elevated frequency and duration of power outages in recent years coupled with our initiatives to drive adoption of automatic home standby generators on an everyday basis has helped to make the category more mainstream in the marketplace resulting in record shipments of home standby generators during the current year fourth quarter switching to portable generators the prior year fourth quarter included the impact of hurricane maria and significant replenishment of portable generators with our retail partners on the back of the active hurricane season last year as a result shipments of portable generators while still strong were down in the current year fourth quarter versus prior year looking at our commercial and industrial products net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 17 5 to 223 2 million as compared to 189 9 million in the prior year quarter with core growth being approximately 15 when excluding the m a contribution from selmec and unfavorable foreign currency impacts domestically as aaron mentioned we are seeing very strong growth in the telecom market a certain of our national telecom customers are in the middle of a large investment cycle for backup power equipment to harden their cell tower networks in addition demand for our mobile c i products continues to be strong as our rental account customers both nationals and independents continue to replace their support equipment fleets for general rental and oil and gas purposes finally shipments and order rates from our industrial distributors continue to be very strong during the current year quarter in particular for natural gas fuel generators as the strong economic environment and the low natural gas prices are driving significant investment in non residential construction and the adoption of natural gas as a cost effective fuel source for backup power internationally our pramac tower light and motortech businesses grew modestly during the quarter despite headwinds from the weakening euro as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe particularly in mainland europe australia brazil and china in latin america we also saw modest shipment growth for the quarter even with the certain geopolitical headwinds that are impacting that region as we continue to make progress on the ottomotores and selmec integration and execute on synergies between the two companies net sales for the other products category primarily made up of service parts and extended warranty deferred revenue amortization increased 26 5 to 46 3 million as compared to 36 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 with core growth of approximately 13 this strong core growth rate tracks with the rest of our business as the installed base of our products has expanded around the globe and replacement part demand increased due to the elevated power outage activity in recent quarters higher amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue also drove this increase gross profit margin was 36 3 compared to 37 1 in the prior year fourth quarter a modestly favorable sales mix shift toward higher margin on standby generator sales and price increases implemented since prior year were more than offset by higher logistics and labor costs as well as the realization of unfavorable commodity and currency fluctuations relative to prior year levels operating expenses increased 7 9 million or 9 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as a percentage of net sales operating expenses excluding intangible amortization declined 30 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to improved operating leverage on the higher organic sales volumes the increase in operating expense dollars over the prior year was primarily driven by incremental variable opex on the strong sales volumes an increase in employee costs including long term incentive compensation recorded during the current year quarter and additional recurring operating expenses from the selmec acquisition these increases were partially offset by lower warranty and intangible amortization expenses adjusted ebitda attributable to the company as defined in our earnings release was 123 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 109 9 million in the same period last year adjusted ebitda margin before deducting for non controlling interests was 22 4 in the quarter as compared to 22 8 in the prior year this 40 basis point decline compared to prior year was mostly due to the previously mentioned higher input cost that impacted gross margins offset by improved operating leverage on the organic increase in sales for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda before deducting for non controlling interests came in at 424 6 million resulting in a 21 margin and an impressive 34 increase over prior year i will now briefly discuss financial results for our two reporting segments domestic segment sales increased 14 3 to 437 8 million as compared to 382 9 million in the prior year quarter as i previously discussed strong broad based end market demand driven by higher power outages severity and favorable economic conditions drove increased shipments across our residential and c i products in the current year fourth quarter adjusted ebitda for the segment during the quarter was 115 5 million or 26 4 of net sales as compared to 101 9 million in the prior year or 26 6 of net sales for the full year 2018 domestic segment sales increased 21 over the prior year while adjusted ebitda margins increased 230 basis points international segment sales increased 14 to 125 6 million as compared to 110 2 million in the prior year quarter including 13 3 million of contribution from the selmec acquisition and a foreign currency headwind of approximately 4 core sales growth was approximately 6 when you exclude both selmec and currency impacts as i previously discussed this overall core growth compared to the prior year was due to broad based growth across our international subsidiaries as we continue to drive market penetration across the globe note that we were still able to execute relatively strong year over year core growth in the international segment despite the prior year benefiting from larger project activity across certain of pramac s global sales branches adjusted ebitda for the segment during the quarter before deducting for non controlling interest was 10 6 million or 8 4 of net sales as compared to 10 5 million or 9 6 of net sales in the prior year higher margin larger project activity in the prior year quarter and higher input costs drove the year over year decline for the full year 2018 international segment sales increased 17 9 over the prior year with core sales growth of approximately 13 adjusted ebitda margins for the segment before deducting for non controlling interests increased to 8 1 of net sales during 2018 compared to 7 2 of net sales in the prior year we believe we are on track with our strategic plans to reach double digit adjusted ebitda margins for the international segment in the coming years now switching back to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2018 on a consolidated basis gaap net income for the company for the quarter was 75 6 billion as compared to 80 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the prior year net income includes the impact of 28 4 million of non cash gains largely from the revaluation of the company s net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the tax reform act as a result gaap income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2017 were only 2 million when excluding the aforementioned gain gaap income taxes in q4 2017 would have been 30 4 million or an effective tax rate of 36 1 on an adjusted basis this compares to gaap income taxes during the fourth quarter of 2018 of 20 million or an effective tax rate of 20 7 the large year over year decline in the gaap tax rate on an adjusted basis is primarily due to the enactment of the tax reform act which resulted in lower federal tax rates in the united states in addition a favorable provision to return adjustment was recorded in the current year fourth quarter related to the finalization of our 2017 federal and state income tax returns diluted net income per share for the company on a gaap basis was 1 20 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 1 29 in the prior year with the prior year earnings impacted by the aforementioned 28 4 million non cash gain related to the tax reform act or 0 45 per share the specific calculations for these earnings per share amounts are included in the reconciliation schedules of our earnings release adjusted net income for the company as defined in our earnings release was 88 1 million in the current year quarter or 1 42 per share versus 87 1 million in the prior year or 1 39 per share the strong sales growth and related improvement in operating earnings just discussed were mostly offset by higher cash income taxes during the quarter with regards to cash income taxes the fourth quarter of 2018 includes the impact of a cash income tax expense of 15 4 million as compared to 6 million in the prior year quarter the current year reflects the cash income tax rate of 15 for the full year 2018 with the prior year fourth quarter was based on a cash tax rate of 12 5 for the full year 2017 higher pre tax earnings in 2018 in excess of our tax yield coupled with the fact that 2017 benefited from certain incremental tax deductions that were accelerated into the 2017 tax return resulted in a higher cash tax rate in 2018 cash flow from operations was 108 2 million as compared to 136 7 million in the prior year fourth quarter and free cash flow as defined in our earnings release was 87 3 million as compared to 121 8 million in the same quarter last year higher operating earnings were more than offset by increased working capital investment due to the strong organic growth incremental inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes and higher capital expenditure levels free cash flow for the full year 2018 was 204 million as compared to 228 million for 2017 during the current year quarter we also made a voluntary 50 million payment on our abl revolving credit facility paying off the entire outstanding balance as of december 31 2018 with cash on hand as of december 31 2018 we had a total of 924 million of outstanding debt net of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs our gross debt leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2 2 times on an as reported basis a healthy decline for the 3 0 times at the end of 2017 given our strong earnings and cash flow generation we ve demonstrated the rapid deleveraging capabilities of the company additionally at the end of the year we had 224 million of cash on hand and there was approximately 277 million available on our abl revolving credit facility both our term loan and abl now mature in the year 2023 uses of cash during 2018 included 48 million for capital expenditures 65 million for m a 24 million for the repayment of debt and approximately 26 million for stock repurchases with that i d now like to turn the call back over to aaron to provide comments on our outlook for 2019 aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks york as we have previously discussed this morning end market demand for our products has continued to be strong as we enter 2019 as such we expect net sales in the first half of the year to grow approximately 10 to 12 on an as reported basis and 8 to 10 on a core basis with higher growth rates in the first quarter compared to the second quarter this assumes an average baseline level of power outages during the period looking at the second half of 2019 net sales could range from low single digit declines to low single digit increases depending on the severity of power outages during the year the low end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment while the high end of the range would assume more elevated outage activity which could include a major power outage event during the year overall for the year given these assumptions net sales are expected to increase between 3 to 7 compared to the prior year on an as reported basis and 2 to 6 on a core growth basis net income margins before deducting for non controlling interests are expected to be between 11 to 12 for the full year 2019 with adjusted ebitda margins also before deducting for non controlling interest expected to be between 20 to 21 for the year the low end of the range would assume no major power outages and an average baseline outage environment and the high end of the range would assume more elevated power outage conditions furthermore mix operating leverage and our level of promotion and marketing spend will all vary depending on the severity of power outages during the year 2019 margins are also expected to be impacted by a number of other factors realization of higher input costs coming into the year along with the impact of regulatory tariffs are expected to be largely offset by price increases favorable trends with respect to commodities currencies and logistics costs and benefits from our profitability enhancement program throughout the year consistent with historical seasonality we expect adjusted ebitda margins in the second half of the year to be higher relative to the first half with the sequential improvement being approximately 350 basis points to 500 basis points depending on the power outage environment experienced during the year this 2019 outlook does not reflect potential business acquisitions or stock buybacks given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation we have significant resources to drive further shareholder value as we execute on our long term strategic priorities and now i d like to turn the call back over to york to walk through some additional guidance details for 2019 york york ragen chief financial officer thanks aaron for 2019 our gaap effective tax rate is expected to increase to between 25 to 27 as compared to the 22 5 full year rate for 2018 based on our guidance provided for 2019 our cash income tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately 52 million to 60 million depending on the outage environment which translates into an an anticipated full year 2019 cash income tax rate of approximately 17 to 18 that compares to the 15 cash income tax rate for full year 2018 the expected increase in our gaap and cash tax rates compared to 2018 relates to certain favorable deductions that were accelerated and reflected in the 2018 rates in response to the tax reform act that aren t expected to repeat in 2019 as a reminder we still have a favorable tax shield as a result of a significant intangible amortization deduction in our corporate tax return that results in our cash income tax rate being notably lower than our gaap income tax rate with the passage of the tax reform act the tax affected annual value of this tax shield is expected to be approximately 30 million per year and expires fully in 2021 in 2019 we expect interest expense to be approximately 41 million to 42 million assuming no additional principal payments during the year and one expected rate increase in 2019 our capital expenditures for 2019 reflect continued investments in expanding capacity and our forecast to be approximately 2 5 of our forecasted net sales for the year depreciation expense is forecast to be approximately 30 million in 2019 given our assumed capex guidance gaap intangible amortization expenses in 2019 is expected to be similar to 2018 levels at approximately 21 million to 22 million during the year stock compensation expense is also expected to be similar to 2018 at 14 million to 15 million per year for full year 2019 operating and free cash flow generation is once again expected to be strong and follow historical seasonality benefiting from the solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow expected to be over 90 in 2019 this concludes our prepared remarks at this time we d like to open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from ross gilardi of merrill lynch you may proceed with your question ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst yeah thanks good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning ross york ragen chief financial officer good morning ross ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst hey aaron i was wondering if you could kick it off just talking a little bit more about your balance sheet i mean at the midpoint of your guidance for ebitda and free cash flow and i think your net debt to ebitda is going to be like 1 1 times by the end of 19 if you hit the numbers i mean usually the i think the lowest since the ipo so what s the plan i mean obviously you had a lot of options like how are you thinking about dividends buybacks versus m a aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah i think ross it s a great question and one that obviously internally as a company we given the position we re in and given that the prospects for the company going forward there s we look at that and we say ok how can we best create an environment for our not only our future growth here at the company but obviously for our shareholders and all stakeholders and that s a there s a number of things you can do and we step through priority uses of cash every time and we ve been very consistent even since the ipo on that and the first thing we want to do is grow continue to grow organically and now thankfully it doesn t take a tremendous amount of capital to do that so we re pretty efficient that way but that being said we do have there is a number of capex things that we continue to look at in terms of scaling the company right through some capacity expansion things that we re focused on this year you ll notice the capex guide that we gave here this morning is a little bit higher than maybe historically we ve been around the 2 of net sales this morning closer to 2 5 and there is some capacity type of expansion things in there you can imagine growing we grew 15 year before 20 last year and when you do that there s a lot of things that you need to do to get your capacity up so that s one thing beyond that we ve said that there are some very interesting things to accelerate our strategy through acquisitions through m a activity and we ve done 12 acquisitions over the last six or seven years and we have a pipeline that would indicate that additional acquisition activity in the future is something that could happen if we find the right asset at the right price that fits our strategy and we think it can accelerate things and help us grow that s certainly something where we re looking to and there s the universe of potential acquisition targets for us is it s pretty big there s a lot of things i think we could do there not only from an international standpoint where some of things have been focused like the selmec acquisition last year and the captiva acquisition announced earlier this year but also i think around some of these other potential business models and other opportunities we ve been talking about that i mentioned in my prepared remarks after you step through those things then you start talking about return of capital to shareholders and you can do that in a number of different ways we ve done some special dividends in the past i think we ve done some buybacks in the past both of those are vehicles to do that paying down debt i think we look at that and we ve got a really cost effective liability structure it doesn t mature until 2023 we really think we ve got it we wouldn t get a great return honestly from taking out a lot of debt so we think putting the capital to work or returning it to shareholders is a better is a better way to go but we ll evaluate those priorities as we kind of have in the past and we ll have to we ll have to figure out where we go from here but we i really like the set up we ve got a lot of we ve got a lot of dry powder here and we ve got a lot of cool things that we re looking at that i m pretty excited about ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst okay so you mentioned regular quarterly dividend i mean does that still feel like something and you re not that interested in doing and then obviously you have inaudible specials in the past aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah i would say that s about a quarterly dividend i mean it s something we ve talked about we ve discussed dividends and that s certainly one possibility but i think at this stage the way i think about the company as a growth company the kind of growth we ve experienced here i think of regular dividend i don t know that we re in the right part of the cycle yet to be thinking about that and there are far too many opportunities for us to i think get a to continue to grow the company and get an overall longer term better return with investing in whether again whether it s organic or whether it s through m a activity i just see too many potential areas where we can invest and use that capital for the benefit of all of our stakeholders and so i m just i m not ready to say that we don t have enough opportunities there and i think that we ve been we ve been pretty clear on this point since our ipo and maybe there is a point in the cycle where that s going to make sense and we ll talk about that as a board but today i m just too excited about the future to say we should be thinking about deploying our capital that way versus through growth ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst okay and then just last inaudible topic and then i ll hand it over this captiva transaction with pramac i mean can you talk a little bit more about the mechanics of that and aaron you seem sort of interested in the indian market for a long time and this gives you a foot in the door i mean do you potentially use this to create a much bigger platform in a market like india or is this at this point we think of it as kind of exploratory learn about the market and just sort of see what happens for the next three to five years aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question ross and we kind of look at it as a giving us a toehold in a part of the world in india that we haven t really had any operations we ve done some sourcing there but really no commercial activity and it s a huge generator market there s a couple of markets like that around the world where we think we need to participate and there we could have went in could have kind of pushed all the chips into the middle and gone all in with a much larger acquisition if we wanted to go that route but i think given our limited knowledge of the market we felt it better to try this first and if it works i think it could be a springboard for something bigger i think we re looking at it from this standpoint there is as we ve been talking in our prepared remarks this morning the substitution of natural gas generators for diesel gensets is something that s been going on for the last 20 or 30 years here in the united states we re starting to see that pattern repeat in other parts of the world india eventually we ll do that as well the economics of natural gas infrastructure and the usage of natural gas for heating and cooking and other baseload power needs and things of that nature the economic arguments are far too compelling in favor of natural gas got a lower emissions profiles and many of the fuels that are burned in many other parts of the world and we re going to need natural gas for a long time for baseload power production everywhere in the world india is starting to realize this and they ve got a lot of projects on the drawing board for natural gas pipeline infrastructure as that infrastructure gets deployed the opportunity to connect a backup power system like a generator to that pipeline becomes a reality and we think that being there and having a footprint in india to begin to push on that is an important part of our overall lead gas strategic pillar and so that s really where we re we want to start out in india it could be bigger for us long term but i think it s a way for us to cut our teeth there ross gilardi merrill lynch analyst got it thanks very much aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer you bet operator thank you and our next question comes from charley brady of suntrust robinson you may proceed with your question charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey guys thanks good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning charley york ragen chief financial officer good morning charley charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i was wondering obviously on the m a this new powering our future and inaudible you re kind of adding in there i m wondering does that add sort of an additional pipeline to m a and can you maybe talk about what would be potential ideas of you branching out beyond we were at into that area aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s it s a great question charley anytime we only made a few adjustments to strategy over the last 10 years and any time you do that you have to evaluate again we use m a to help us accelerate our strategy so and i think we ve been very consistent on that point and as we add this new pillar of connect to our strategy and kind of rebranding the strategy powering our future absolutely the m a funnel now is starting to fill up with different ideas some of them technology oriented some of them when you talk about other kind of monitoring type of opportunities it s actually for our business development teams here and our corporate development teams it s been interesting because we ve we find that we ve had to kind of interface with different parties and different people than we ve been traditionally doing in the kind of i ll call it traditional equipment spaces right so many of these business models are more around services the business models can be very as i ve mentioned before technology oriented we re not ready to discuss details about the pipeline itself but i think what you re going to see from us over the next several years is interesting and again this is what i ve been at i ve been here a long time 25 years and i can t remember a time i ve been more excited about the future of the company and what s going on in the industry i think the utilities the energy markets there is going to be a tremendous amount of change coming in the next decade the next 10 years is going to present just some amazing changes to all of that and we think we should have an opportunity to participate in how that market develops i don t know that anybody knows exactly how it s going to develop or what s going to what s going to happen but people have ideas i think that the traditional model of delivering power by utility to your home or your business so i think that s going to change radically here in the next few years and whether that s because of the addition of renewables or storage or decentralization of the grid and on site power generation distributed generation there s a lot of different formats that this is going to take but i think that the focus that we have on natural gas gensets and the focus that we re now putting on connectivity i think a really important parts of putting ourselves in the middle of many of those conversations down the line charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst great that s good color and just i don t know if i missed it but do you talking about the florida nursing home assisted living facility situation swing on there with providing the generators is that bleeding into 2019 as you kind of alluded to in prior calls aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah there was about a third of the facilities in florida that were granted waivers for the end of the year deadline to get a backup power system in place and so that will undoubtedly lead to some spillover here into 2019 the first half most likely in each of those waivers a little different depending on the situation in the size of the facility but it s been nice florida has been a great market as you can imagine not only for the residential markets that we serve but also in the c i space and not just for healthcare i mean we ve seen a marked increase in a number of other kind of commercial and industrial type applications for backup power there as you know it was a state that went up what 10 11 years without any kind of this major disruptions in the grid there and then we ve had a number of different things happen in the last few years so it s back on the radar screen florida is doing well and there will be some spillover i don t think it s going to be it s not to be major but our guidance does contemplate some amount of spillover charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right thanks and just one more for me on the price cost you talked about i guess neutralizing that but i m just trying to get a little more color on or can you put through price increases obviously and particularly on the home standby market development but pricing is a sensitive issue to that whole dynamic of the growth there are you going to be fully neutral for the year and is a ramp or are you fully neutral now today thanks york ragen chief financial officer charley this is york so yeah i think there are input cost headwinds and it s and it s not just tariffs that we re talking we re inaudible the realization of just higher steel costs and aluminum and copper and logistics costs have really spiked up in q4 labor cost the realization of all higher costs are going to spill into the front half of 2019 so you re probably going to have some headwinds on the price cost side in the front half of 2019 but what we see though is today as those input costs are starting to moderate if you look at steel copper aluminum and if you look at our currencies with the euro and rmb and then logistics cost we see moderating and then you layer on the price increases relative to the tariff situation and then also combined that with all of these profitability enhancement initiatives that we have collectively we think that s going to flip around in the back half of the 19 to neutralize that fully for the full year so we are cognizant on the price increase side of relative to home standby and price elasticity but i think with relative to tariffs that s just something that the market will bear should show the tariffs come to fruition are at least at the 25 level on march 1 charley brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from jerry revich from goldman sachs you may proceed with your question jerry revich goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everyone york ragen chief financial officer jerry good morning jerry revich goldman sachs analyst you folks have really focused on the analytics and one interesting element that i m wondering if you could talk about is if you re starting to see in your residential standby business any replacement demand of units that were installed 15 to 20 years ago just to give us a sense for what the replacement market could look like once we get to the sweet spot of the units that were installed in the call it mid 2000s plus when the business really start to ramp for you any analytics that you could share with us in terms of the contribution from replacement or the ramp in replacements at all for that part of business would be helpful york ragen chief financial officer yeah jerry it s we haven t talked about it much because the market is only 20 25 years old it is interesting i mean we do track all that information and it s a very reliable steady march up in terms of the percentage of products that we sell today that go into a replacement as a replacement and so today we re sitting at about 5 6 of our volume there on the residential side is for replacement but i think you may have hit an interesting nail on the head there which is there are because of the nature of the way that market has grown there s faster points in the penetration curve that have happened over the last 10 to 20 years and when you hit one of those patches and you hit that kind of replacement cycle you should see this similar kind of offset in increase in the replacement cycle in terms of that growth and we re seeing that so as an example with florida again it was 10 11 years ago but there was prior to that there were some pretty interesting up cycles around katrina back in 2005 you had the big power outages in northeast in 2003 we re starting to get into those kind of time frames a generator should last you between 15 to 20 years if well cared for so like it s typical like a typical piece of your homes infrastructure like an hvac system something like that very similar but we do see that it s starting to show up and we re kind of excited about that long term because as we build this market out now we ve got our installed base is well over a 1 5 million machines actually getting closer to 2 million here there s a nice opportunity there longer term for replacement jerry revich goldman sachs analyst i appreciate the disclosures and you mentioned really the 6 000 dealer network now can you just talk about your efforts to continue to drive high engagement in some of the newer dealers where after the post storm enthusiasm might potentially fade as you laid out call it into the back half of 19 what are you folks doing to drive continued engagement to make sure those 6 000 dot some of the newer ones stay green for you aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s a challenge every time right because you add dealers they generally come on board as the market is market demand cycle is higher and then when demand relaxes you ve got it effectively train the dealers on how to market and many of these dealers are in the electrical trades or hvac trades and marketing maybe for an electrician doesn t come as kind of a standard part of your business practices right so it s a new skill set that has to be learned and we have a progression for dealer there is there we do a lot of training i think one of the things that is just an amazing part of this business and i don t know that whether it s investors or others that maybe don t get it is that distribution that we ve built that 6 000 dealers we ve built that over 20 years and we have poured countless dollars time blood sweat and tears into building that out and to making these dealers our representatives out in the market for a new product category like home standby generators and that just takes we burn a lot of calories it s an ongoing effort you can t relax at all you have to constantly be coming up with new programs i would say that one element of that we talked about this in our prepared remarks but with our connectivity initiatives now this new platform that we re introducing called fleet the software platform that our team has been working on here we just rolled that out we had our annual dealer conference a couple weeks ago in las vegas 2 500 people there it was a massive event and we talk about new programs fleet being one of them but fleet is you can kind of think of that as a obviously it by its name you can see all of the generators under a dealer s care right there they re customers products but and then can get a lot of diagnostic information things like that but the way we think about fleet longer term is a really important way to engage with dealers it could potentially be a totally different platform any of these dealers there their erp system is a spiral notebook on the dashboard of their van or truck and you could think of fleet as being a potential platform for dispatch for billing for other things that we could inventory control things of that nature we see it as a really interesting way to interact with our dealers on a go forward basis so it s things like that help us keep the engagement up even after the initial surge of excitement and demand passes after an event jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay yeah thank you i appreciate the discussion aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks jerry operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff hammond from keybanc capital please proceed with your question jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst hey good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning jeff york ragen chief financial officer good morning jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst so just on the 2 to 6 core is there anyway to parse it out between commercial and residential york ragen chief financial officer yeah so if you the 2 to 6 core is collective so on the c i business i think our prepared remarks talked about the strong end market demand we re seeing both domestically and internationally there is a number of verticals that are turned on and we see those continuing that strong demand into 2019 and pretty consistent throughout the year so for c i purposes we re seeing that high single digit low double digit growth really consistently throughout the year at least that s our what our guide shows and it s really consistent across domestic and international so i think the theme there is broad based strong demand for c i on the resi side what that would mean is probably flat to down slightly the down slightly is mainly due to headwinds with regards to portables so still seeing resi flat to slightly down with portables being the headwind there for the full year jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst okay and then does that inform some of the margin dynamic where commercial would be lower mix york ragen chief financial officer yeah yeah so on if you look at i talked a little bit about price cost on the mix side that probably be there would be a slight negative mix hit on the margin side relative to from 19 from 18 to 19 jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst okay and then last question inventories moved up quite a bit and was a big drag on working capital can you just speak to how much of that is some of this pre buy ahead of tariffs what does your finished good inventory look like and then just separately how you re feeling about channel inventories thanks york ragen chief financial officer yeah so i mean the way i think about inventory levels because they did increase during the year so when you think about portable generators so last year at this time we had just lived through hurricanes harvey irma and maria our inventory portable inventory level was wiped out there so throughout 2018 here we ve actually been investing in replenishment in our warehouses of our portable inventory level so just sort of every day portable replenishment thing with that way on the tariff side so we saw as we were entering the year there was the threat of tariffs going to 25 from 10 to 25 relative to chinese imported goods on january 1 so as a management team we said look we to be smart to bring in some extra components on the across the board across our product lines those impacted by that could be impacted by those tariffs and we decided to invest in pre buy of that inventory prior to that potential tariff change and then the third piece of the puzzle is really just our strong 20 growth we re going to be just investing in more inventory to facilitate our growth so i think that maybe one third one third one third when you think of those categories that are driving that inventory increase on the field inventory side on the portable side i think we re field inventory stocked ready to go ready for a storm on the home stand by side i think it s actually seasonally appropriate seasonally consistent with where we should be very manageable where we re at this point of the curve coming into 2019 so we re feeling ok on where our field inventories are for home stand by jeff hammond keybanc capital analyst okay thanks guys york ragen chief financial officer thanks aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks jeff operator thank you and our next question comes from mike halloran from baird you may proceed with your question michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst good morning guys aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer good morning mike york ragen chief financial officer good morning mike michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst so first just clarify on the guidance to make sure i m thinking about it right in terms of assumptions on outage activity but thinking about the first half it feels like you re essentially saying momentum for the back half of 18 plus an average underlying outage environment and then when you think about the back half of the year it s in the average underlying environment and then the range of outcomes is based on nominal larger opportunities versus the high end being more significant opportunities is that how you guys are breaking that out front half to back aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah that s exactly it mike michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst okay perfect and then regional variances obviously you said southeast northeast are doing very well on the areas that aren t seeing as much impact from the larger scale things over the last couple of years maybe track how awareness is in those areas and what growth looks like dealer distribution penetration and things like that aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yes so i mean it s a it is interesting because you see this oscillation that ll happen where you get events like we had down in the southeast and we had the the nor easters that were in the beginning of 2018 or in march 2018 the consecutive nor easters that have been i think kind of turning the northeast to up has been if you think the u s is a heat map it s actually very interesting we watch just even all the way down to the individual states but even even actually more granular than that of course but it is interesting that midwest was a really good market for us a year ago and this year there were quite a few storms and events in michigan in ohio illinois and that didn t repeat this year to the same level and so that cooled off as an example but it is interesting because what s going like if you look at it right now today there s actually quite a bit more activity out west so the west and the north west the recency of a lot of the storms that are going on out there i was just i was looking at outages this morning we track them everywhere and there was a 130 000 people in california without power this morning from the latest event that was rolling through and so that s just one state one area and yeah very predictably and we now have as you can imagine from a data perspective we have a fair amount of data and there is a fair level of predictability around some of this that we could say reliably at this point over the next 12 months in california we re going to have it s going to be it s going to be the growth rate will be better than its been same will happen in northwest as well so but it s it does move puerto rico was really hot couple years ago now now it s not i mean there s it s it really does cycle and oscillate but it s interesting that that being said they grow these this is a step function growth that we ve talked about you get to this baseline level of growth that you kind of grow rapidly and then it tops out at a kind of a baseline level or bottoms out if you want to call it that and then it stays there but it s materially higher than where it was prior to the event and then you get another event successively after that and it grows again and so it s really quite amazing for mathematically speaking how you can start to model that out michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst now makes sense and then i know it s early days just customer and dealer receptivity to the connectivity solution as you re putting it out there and then thoughts on that resi versus the c i side and now implementation could phase variably between the two areas aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah no it s a good question right now a good chunk of our focus has been on the residential side so i ll start there receptivity has been good we you don t have a the challenge in that if there is a challenge is like anything we roll out to our distribution partners is there is an adoption rate right they have to adopt that there s a learning curve i mean it s like it s not like anything else in life unlike anything else in life it s the same and again we re talking about mainly electrical contractors here they re not used to working with customers with their wi fi networks and passwords and so there is there has been a bit of learning that s going on there s a lot of learning cycles going on in the market but we have tens of thousands of units connected already in a very short period of time and the data that it s giving us is amazing it s great and the interaction level the way we re able to increase the interaction with our customers we can look at customers products we can understand what s going on we can now this is a really cool thing we can deliver over the air firmware updates to our machines so as new features get developed in the products we can deliver those features to customers so there is additional future benefit potential coming from that it also then leads right into that fleet comment i made previously it allows for our dealers to have a much better view of all of the products under their care to affect repairs a lot quicker and more accurately and that s been a really good upside the c i piece is the next piece for us and we ve got our control platforms there we ve introduced a brand new control platform on our industrial products that are that s going to roll into products here over the next 12 to 24 months as we kind of cycle through it it s a lot of product to get the new platform in we call it our power zone control platform but it s state of the art and it is it s by far and away the coolest generator control platform in the industry and it was all developed internally and again we this is i think one of the great benefits of the focus we bring to the market is we do a lot of this stuff internally and it s the same with the remote monitoring we re doing it all internally we re not leaving that to some other third party we feel that at the oem we want to have that direct conversation with our customers and our distribution partners michael patrick halloran robert w baird co incorporated analyst thanks for the time i appreciate it aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks mike york ragen chief financial officer thanks mike operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from chip moore of canaccord you may proceed with your question chip moore canaccord genuity analyst thanks hey guys york ragen chief financial officer hey chip chip moore canaccord genuity analyst on the 8 to 10 core in the first half can you talk a bit more on visibility i think you said it was more q1 weighted so some of the puts and takes there and then maybe just remind us on baseline outage activity expectations does the events of the past couple of years that push that up or are you thinking how do we think about that thanks york ragen chief financial officer yeah i think our prepared remarks the assumption there at least for the first half is that we re assuming just sort of long term average levels which if you actually if you do the math that would actually be lower than what we experienced in 2018 so that 8 to 10 core growth that we were talking about in the first half it actually it spreads across resi and c i relatively consistently so we re seeing strength both in resi and c i as i mentioned and then as we said in the prepared remarks q1 year given the strength that we re seeing coming into the year we expect those q1 growth rates to be higher than the second quarter so i think that was the level of commentary we were providing on that chip moore canaccord genuity analyst got it that s helpful thanks and good to hear you talking more on this new connect strategy obviously it s a robust ecosystem a lot of things you could go after can you talk about your appetite for partnerships and organic development versus the m a which you can clearly use to accelerate it thanks aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah chip it s great question the i think that again i think about my time here at the company and just all the things that we ve done over the years and i don t think i ve been more excited about the potential area of growth in a way for us to really explore some of the great things that we ve done here in terms of distribution i talked about that before the build out of distribution our brand and the position we ve gotten in the marketplace and take that in concert with our technical expertise around electrical systems and this unique opportunity that we have every one of our machines these backup generators is connected to a home or businesses electrical panel and their electrical system there are very few companies that can probably claim that space other than the panel manufacturers themselves and certainly the claim that space but i think that the opportunity there to do something with that and our distribution and our brand and this connectivity layer is really exciting so to your question about organic versus m a m a certainly can help us do some of those things faster and there may be some technical skill sets and the people in particular that we might need to be successful in that could come to us through m a but make no mistake we re putting a lot of effort organically the current system that we rolled out the fleet system the wi fi connectivity systems that act as this gateway that was all built internally we didn t partner we have a team of people here in waukesha wisconsin we re doubling the size of that team this year and it s not a small team it s a big team and we re going to double that because we believe in the future of this being a really critical part of the future and moving generac into more of a i ll call it more of a solutions based provider as opposed to just the products based company more around services these subscription models like we re already selling through our through our mobile linked subscription which is a monitoring subscription for generators the amount of potential business models and things that we could do with this are just there almost where we ve got too many things we have to prioritize what exactly we want to go after and how we want to do it but we re going to be in the middle of that conversation and i think it s going to have a profound impact on this company over the next decade chip moore canaccord genuity analyst that s great thanks a lot aaron aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer thanks chip operator thank you and our next question comes from brian drab of william blair you may proceed with your question york ragen chief financial officer anybody home aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer we might have lost him york ragen chief financial officer he might be on mute brian drab william blair analyst that s my bad good morning york ragen chief financial officer very good hey brian how you re doing brian drab william blair analyst i was wondering why you didn t say good morning back usually they say good morning back sorry so can we just zoom back out and can you talk about did something change in terms of how you were viewing the first half of 19 where we stand today versus where we were at the on the third quarter call do you feel a little if they ve seen more demand then you would have expected in the first half slightly and what are the can you kind of rank order the factors that drove that storm activity recently et cetera aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah brian i think for sure that as we get or another 90 days plus away from that third quarter call and that has galvanized our view on the first half because we re closer to it and in fact we re almost two months into it here and we came into the year feeling good about 2019 it s playing out at this point as you indicate maybe even a little bit stronger and i think our guidance reflects that and over what we were kind of maybe talking about on the third quarter even though we weren t really giving full year guidance i think we said the next we felt pretty good about the next three to six months for sure and that definitely is how we feel about this and i think maybe more importantly what we really like is what we re seeing in the c i space c i markets for us have been have remained strong both stationary and mobile some of our large accounts in the rental markets some of our large accounts in the telecom markets we ve got some customer concentration the buying signals there and the there are kind of plans as they roll them out for the full year and there are some of these companies are public companies really kind of fit well with how we were thinking about the year playing out and so we re pleased to see that capex spending for these customers is going to continue the hardening of their networks if it s a telecom customer is going to continue and the overall c i business has just been it s felt very strong and i think that our guidance reflects how we re feeling about that and then resi of course as we said activations were just at amazing levels in q4 and what we look at in that particular business we look at the leading indicators we call them ihcs in home consultations and in home consultations have been up dramatically over the prior year prior year s run rate in the first 45 days of the year here so we re very excited about that because we think that that portends to a stronger again it s all reflected in the guidance but it portends to a pretty good first half brian drab william blair analyst got it you mentioned telecom in there too have you seen any signs of a pause there s some companies that supply into that market have said they ve seen a pause someone obviously at t is having some issues and some other issues going on in the industry aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer yeah it s certainly customer specific i think the ones that where you re hearing positives and seeing positives and i think in that it is interesting how that tends to rotate from one customer to another for us one year it might be one customer is doing a lot of build out in a network and maybe another customer that was doing a lot of build out the year before has as pulled back for whatever reasons sometimes it s m a on their part sometimes there are other business factors or economic factors that drive that but we have i think we feel pretty good about remaining at some of the same levels that we saw in 2018 as it relates to telecom and it was strong in 2018 nothing at this point gives us pause now that can change as we said before but i think that the realization from all of these providers that the uptime of their networks is just absolutely critical right i mean most people are paying now by the bit and the byte that goes across those networks and so if the network is down it s not just an inconvenience for customers there s an economic impact to the to carrier as well and then you couple that with just the critical nature of the communications and things that are going on across these networks it has become a vital part of our infrastructure as a country and we re also seeing that around the world i mean we ve got some great things from a telecom perspective going on in brazil and we ve got some great things going on in mexico we ve got some really interesting possibilities going on in mainland europe around telecom and we see the opportunity to take our expertise here in the u s and telecom and extend that based on our expanded geographical footprint through all these acquisitions that was always part of the original strategy and we re starting to see some of that come to fruition brian drab william blair analyst and then thanks and the last one from me is just how far away are we from seeing maybe starting to see a material impact from the implementation of your strategy with motortech and getting more into continuous power and some of these things that you ve laid out at the analyst day and are you seeing that now or is that still coming aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer we re actually starting to see some of that brian we have in fact we have a dedicated commercial resources here now at the company that are focused on building that market out alongside motortech and alongside some of our partners in the rest of the world markets where you will see more of those applications frankly but it is really interesting because we re seeing some really neat opportunities even in places like canada time of use programs from utility providers are taking natural gas generators customers are taking natural gas generators and using them where they would have normally had a backup system anyway they re using that generator to reduce their utility bills and this is some of the things that we talked about at our investor day a year and half ago and we see that market developing but as we said at that investor day that s a long play right we know that it s going to take time to build out an important part of our future success there is continuing to roll our products and programs and the support structures needed to be successful in that market we also have to grow our brand in other parts of the world where we re quite well known here in the u s market and maybe in latin america as well but maybe not so much in other places in china or india or the african continent or even the european continent so we ve got some brand building to do some awareness to do but we like the prospects for that long term and it will be long term but we re seeing some really interesting things starting out some really good interest around that brian drab william blair analyst so is that more an international opportunity than it is a u s opportunity aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer i think initially that s probably right i think it s the u s power markets as they evolve those opportunities will become more evident here as well but i think they will become more evident in other parts of the world quicker there is a lot of factors that drive that some of it is stability of grid where you have again like in india where you have a lot of outage events and a natural gas generator because when you have a lot of outage events and a generator is going to run a lot or if you re talking 8 to 10 hours a day the input costs meaning the fuel matters and natural gas costs are roughly half the cost of diesel fuel and so that really adds into the total return of the machine and the way that a customer would view that and that has a stronger payback or roi outside the u s today than it does inside the u s that may change as the energy markets develop here but again over the longhaul but as we go out the gas market even further but that s kind of how we think it s going to play out brian drab william blair analyst okay perfect thanks a lot aaron jagdfeld president and chief executive officer you bet thanks brian operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would not like to turn the call back over to aaron jagdfeld for any further remarks aaron jagdfeld president and chief

and for your continued interest in ingevity if you ll turn with me to slide number 4 i d like to start this morning s call by reviewing how we ve delivered versus the commitments we made at the beginning of 2018 and from the time of our spin off in 2016 in 2018 we exceeded our original guidance in terms of revenues and adjusted ebitda by 3 and 9 from the midpoint respectively we executed our capital program as planned though we accelerated spending slightly when we released the strength of our performance in the year still our free cash flow was 67 higher than originally projected and as a result our net debt to ebitda ratio came in under our forecasted range lastly our segments are ahead of the schedule toward meeting the revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin goals we set for them back in 2016 at the time of the spin our market valuation has continue to reflect the growing understanding and appreciation of our performance and our potential as a result our shareholders were rewarded with a total return of 19 for the year we re very proud of our team s performance last year but all of that is now in the rearview mirror as you know we aspire to sell much more and we are looking ahead to achieving our next set of milestones our objective is to continue to be a leading specialty chemicals and materials company with an atypical growth trajectory premium margins a strong balance sheet and excellent returns in our short three year tenure as a public company we ve provided strong evidence of our ability to be just that our performance of the fourth quarter was no exception if you ll turn to slide number 5 you ll note some highlights for the quarter as you can see we delivered another outstanding quarter one that frankly exceeded our expectation and capped off a very strong year for ingevity and what is essentially a slower quarter we realized higher volumes and improved price and mix revenues in the fourth quarter were about 279 million which is up more than 21 when compared to the previous year s quarter adjusted ebitda was 73 million up more than 39 versus the prior year s quarter predominantly due to the revenue impacts with some benefit from lower raw material costs these positives were partially offset by higher freight and distribution costs increased spending related to a plant planned outage and higher legal expenses our fourth year adjusted ebitda margin of 26 3 was up 340 basis points from the prior year also on slide number 5 you ll find the results for the full year on revenues that increased about 17 including the acquisition of georgia pacific s pine chemicals business we drove an adjusted ebitda increase of more than 32 this resulted in an adjusted ebitda margin of 28 3 of sales representing an increase of 330 basis points versus the prior year moving to the segments you can see on slide number 6 performance chemicals posted another strong quarter segment sales in the fourth quarter were 166 million up about 20 versus the prior year period due largely to the g p acquisition which contributed significantly to our oilfield technologies and industrial specialty sales but did not affect our pavement technologies business sales of performance chemicals products to oilfield customers were up approximately 53 more importantly on a pro forma basis which assumes we had owned the g p business for the entire year of 2017 sales were still up 17 this occurred on the strength of u s drilling despite some softening later in the quarter as customers reacted to oil price uncertainty in the market according to baker hughes u s rig count at the end of the fourth quarter was up 2 7 versus the third quarter however it seems rig count is vacillating as it s already down 3 6 at the end of january from the beginning of the year sales to pavement applications increased by about 2 in the seasonally much slower fourth quarter for the u s market sales were augmented by continued penetration in international markets such as peru and china as we continue to globalize this business sales into industrial specialties applications and these include printing inks adhesives agricultural chemicals lubricants and others were up about 18 versus the prior year period again the increase was largely driven by our g p acquisition however we achieved strong growth in adhesives as we gained share versus hydrocarbon resins and road safety striping and we continue to drive sales in niche applications such as agricultural and lubricants in addition sales in industrial specialties benefited from higher selling prices for tall oil fatty acids or tofa which rose in the low double digit percentages these successes enabled us to partially replace the lower margin printing inks business the net impact of the shifts across oil field pavement and industrial specialties was a substantial improvement in segment profitability and margins performance chemicals segment ebitda of over 30 million was up 100 in addition to the revenue impacts the increase was a result of lower costs per crude tall oil or cto and synergies gained through our g p acquisition these were partially offset by higher freight and sg a costs overall we drove an improvement in ebitda margins of 730 basis points to 18 3 on a pro forma basis while revenues were essentially flat segment ebitda was up 32 for the full year in performance chemicals sales were 733 million up almost 18 versus 2017 segment ebitda of 151 million was up almost 50 versus the prior year our ebitda results benefited from our ability to increase and accelerate synergy capture from the g p acquisition these synergies contributed 3 million to 4 million in each of the last three quarters surpassing the year three 11 million annual target we communicated when the deal was announced performance chemicals adjusted ebitda margin for the year was 20 6 that s up 440 basis points from a year ago for the full year revenues on a pro forma basis increased 4 yet because of the success the team has had in recovering price capturing cost reductions and moving to higher margin applications segment ebitda was up 22 turning to slide number 7 we were pleased to announce yesterday that we have completed the acquisition of the capa caprolactone business from perstorp holding ab i d like to take this opportunity to remind you why we re so excited about this acquisition first and foremost capa is a complementary market leading business focused on high growth end uses it is the clear global leader in caprolactone and caprolactone derivatives with unique technology and a state of the art facility capa s capacity is three times that of its closest competitor of which there are only two others globally in addition capa aligns with our business model and capabilities mirroring the way we go to market and how we add value for our customers both capa and ingevity focus on leveraging close customer relationships and strong end use technical expertise to create businesses where our customers recognize us as technological innovators thought leaders and partners in their businesses both capa and ingevity operate similar manufacturing processes as we both prefer to derivatized our basic products into higher value downstream products that bring unique performance and functionality characteristics to our customers products capa will also provide new avenues for strategic growth and value creation both organically and inorganically and we intend you to continue to invest behind this business and finally capa has a top tier financial profile the business has delivered strong historical revenue growth posting an average 10 cagr over the past five years more importantly capa has consistently achieved adjusted ebitda margins in the mid 30 range its maintenance capital requirements are generally modest and its cash conversion rate is historically high in 2018 sales for capa were approximately 175 million and adjusted ebitda was about 60 million we attribute about 1 5 million of adjusted ebitda to increase volume resulting from a competitor s unanticipated outage in 2017 that carried over marginally into 2018 while capa will be accretive to margins and earnings this year we are most excited about what this business will do for ingevity over the long term the capa financials will be reflected in our 2019 guidance which we ll discuss later in the call going forward this business will be part of our performance chemicals segment and will be titled as our engineered polymers application moving now to performance materials as you can see on slide number 8 the segment once again delivered outstanding performance in fact this was a record quarter for both revenues and adjusted ebitda for the business segment sales in the fourth quarter were 113 million up about 24 versus the prior year s quarter volumes continue to be driven by strong sales of our honeycomb scrubber product used to meet u s environmental protection agency tier 3 and california lev iii standards in addition we experienced robust pellet sales in the quarter which is a clear indicator that we re beginning to see the benefits of early regulatory adoption in china and to a certain degree in europe according to wards light vehicle production was up about 2 2 in north america however quarterly light vehicle production in china was down nearly 16 the fact that our performance materials segment was up so significantly despite the weak auto demand in china speaks to the regulatory driven nature of this business performance materials adjusted ebitda of 43 million was up almost 15 versus the prior year s quarter this translated to a 38 1 adjusted ebitda margin which is down 300 basis points from a year ago profitability was driven by the favorable revenue impacts but was partially offset by a major plant outage the placement of an activation kiln at our covington facility and higher freight costs in addition legal expenses necessary to defend our intellectual property were meaningfully higher for the full year of 2018 performance materials segment sales were almost 18 higher versus the prior year segment ebitda was about 20 higher resulting in an increase in the segment ebitda margins of 170 basis points to 42 3 for the year as i mentioned our performance materials business is benefiting significantly from advancements in regulations related to gasoline vapor emission control around the world on slide number 9 we have summarized the regulatory changes that are under way globally we are seeing continued strong demand for our technologies designed to meet u s epa and california tier 3 lev iii regulations the regulatory implementation schedule for the u s and canada steps up in the second half of this year to 80 compliance for 2020 model year vehicles we estimate the current compliance to be near 70 in brazil a resolution announced in december by that country s national environmental council mandates that in 2022 automakers must implement a two day parking standard in addition implementation of u s tier 2 type systems will begin in 2023 and are to be completed by 2025 for your reference brazil auto production in 2018 was approximately 3 million vehicles in europe the eu is continuing to implement its euro 6d two day parking standard on all new gasoline vehicles by september of this year what s more there s a continued shift in the eu away from diesel according to the most recent data in 2018 diesel powered vehicles lost an additional 8 market share to 36 the majority of which moved to gasoline and hybrid vehicles which require evaporative emission canisters and china as previously discussed is implementing its national china 6 regulation which will require u s tier 2 type systems on all new gasoline light vehicles in the country by mid 2020 each quarter we have provided updates to our understanding of the latest information regarding early adopting regions and cities in china if you ll turn to slide number 10 you ll note our updated map since our last call we have learned that the hainan and henan provinces and shenzhen city have announced that they would push out their implementation time lines by six months shifting from january 1 2019 to july 1 also guangzhou city moved its implementation by two months from january 1 to march 1 so while our estimate of early adoption six month ago for the first half of 2019 was about 19 that s now moved to about 3 yet the percentage of announced early adoption by july 1 2019 is still expected to be more than 60 these shifts and announced adoption aside we take our recent increase in pellet sales as an indicator that early adoption is beginning and that automakers are implementing ahead of the regulatory compliance dates we are well prepared to meet the needs of our customers in china moreover we re confident our technological leadership and the investments we ve made in manufacturing capacity globally will serve us well as various regions and countries continue to shift to more stringent regulatory standards before i turn the call over to john i d like now to take a minute to provide some color around progress toward our strategic initiatives if you move to slide number 11 you ll note on the left the six elements of our strategy that we rolled out at our investor day just a year ago to start we said consistently that we gain value for our sales only when we create value for our customers and we continue to do just that in fact if you go to our website under news and the ingevity effect blog you ll find a series of customer success stories in both print and video outlining various ways in which we ve helped our customers at anchor usa halifax paving protomatic and the orange water and sewer authority to name just a few as the need for our products is either mandated or preferred in emerging markets we are expanding geographically in both sales and manufacturing for example in 2018 we continue to drive adoption of our innovative evotherm warm mix asphalt product and our pavement technologies business is now doing business in eight new countries versus the prior year and over 13 in the past two years in performance materials we constructed and launched a new start of the art activated carbon extrusion plant in changshu china long an ingevity hallmark innovation continues to be a critical pathway for growth last year we built on our broad technology platform launched 20 new products and filed five new patent applications in performance chemicals we filed additional new low purge patent applications in performance materials and we made progress in developing and promoting our adsorbed natural gas ang technology for bi fuel vehicles at ingevity we aim to operate our businesses superbly and always with an eye to continuous improvement capital plan execution was on point in 2018 and included several significant projects such as the continued ramp up of our zhuhai china facility construction of the changshu plant kiln replacement and capacity expansion at the covington virginia side continued expansion at the waynesboro georgia honeycombs scrubber facility and integration of the crossett arkansas product slate into our performance chemicals offering our growth is being accelerated through strategic value creating acquisitions in 2018 we completed the g p pine chemicals acquisition acquired the remaining interest in purification cellutions and announced our intent to acquire the capa caprolactone division of perstorp in addition to the significant capital we ve invested into our existing businesses we ve invested approximately 1 billion of capital into new businesses in order to continue providing superior returns to our shareholders and finally as a result of our efforts for the full year adjusted ebitda of 321 million were up 32 versus 2017 ingevity s 2018 adjusted ebitda margin of 28 3 was up 330 basis points free cash flow was 158 million up 36 million or 30 and return on invested capital was over 23 which is in the top quartile of our peer group of specialty chemicals producers all in all we are well on our way to realizing the target 2022 objectives we set at our investor day early last year at this point i ll turn the call over to john fortson our executive vice president cfo and treasurer for a more detailed review of our financial status and our guidance for 2019 john john fortson executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael good morning everyone there are three areas i will speak to first i will provide some additional details on our financial performance in the quarter and over the year then i will review our cash generation and capital structure and lastly i ll review our outlook and 2019 guidance on slide 12 you ll find some key income statement metrics the fourth quarter and the year were very strong for ingevity as michael has covered revenue and ebitda i will start with some additional color on sg a fourth quarter 2018 sg a of 36 million was up 8 million from the prior year quarter as a percentage of sales fourth quarter 2018 sg a was 12 9 compared to 12 2 from the prior year quarter impact in the quarter over quarter comparison was 2018 amortization of 3 2 million associated with the amortizable intangibles acquired as part of the g p acquisition adjusting for this sg a as a percentage of sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 11 7 for the full year the g p amortization was 10 6 million and adjusting for this amount full year sg a as a percent of sales in 2018 was 10 7 compared to 10 9 in 2017 for the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded net interest expense of 8 million for the full year we incurred 30 million these numbers are up from 2017 and reflect the issuance of our 300 million 4 5 high yield bond as well as increases in the libor rate over the course of the year our provision for income taxes on adjusted earnings this quarter was 5 million and 45 million for the year this resulted in an adjusted non gaap tax rate of 10 for the quarter and 19 for the year the tax rate during the quarter was favorably impacted by u s tax reform due to further guidance on the application of the new tax law we reported gaap net income attributable in the quarter of 42 million and non gaap adjusted earnings of 45 million diluted adjusted earnings per share were 1 07 for the full year gaap net income attributable was 169 million representing an increase of 34 and non gaap adjusted earnings were 176 million representing an increase of 60 diluted adjusted earnings per share were 4 13 representing an increase of over 60 from 2017 we had 41 9 million basic and 42 5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as of year end during the fourth quarter we repurchased 350 000 shares of our stock at a weighted average cost per share of 83 81 of these 284 000 shares were bought in december in total we spent 29 3 million on share repurchases during the fourth quarter and we have 396 million remaining on our share repurchase authorizations we remain committed to offsetting dilution and supporting our share price when we deem it necessary however our priority in the near term remains deleveraging to our target leverage level to two time to 2 5 times net debt to ebitda on slide 13 you ll find some key balance sheet and cash flow information as of december 31 our cash and cash equivalents were 78 million total debt was 759 million including our capital lease obligation amount of 80 million related to our wickliffe idb we finished the quarter with an original 71 million of restricted cash for the idb net debt was 610 million which resulted in a net leverage ratio of 1 9 times as of december 31st 748 million of our 750 million revolving credit facility was available to us at year end we were borrowing at libor plus 125 basis points in our revolver and term loan trade working capital for the year increased versus 2017 to 217 million due to increased sales in the payables and receivables that go with them as well as the seasonality of our business underlying these numbers we continue to build inventory in zhuhai to address the growth demand from china these increases in the performance materials segment have been partially offset by strong inventory and capital management in the performance chemicals segment in fact performance chemicals after adjusting for the g p acquisition actually finished the year with working capital that was 10 million below last year cash from operations for the year was 252 million our capital expenditures were 94 million over the same period for the year as michael said we generated 158 million of free cash flow representing an increase of nearly 30 versus 2017 additional information will be available on our 10 k which we expect to file on february 20th on the next slide you ll find some guidance to help you think through the modeling the impacts of our engineered polymers application we expect to file audited prior three year and 2018 nine month historical and pro forma financials for capa sometime in early april much like we did for the g p acquisition we were cautioned reading too much into these historical numbers or any others that are in the public domain as the nature of the financial relationship and pricing agreements between capa and its parent perstorp are very different from what we plan them to be under ingevity s ownership in addition to changes in the depreciation and amortization the intercompany transactions presented in the stand alone capa financial statements for instance debt interest expense as well as the removal of licensing and managing expenses among other adjustments will be eliminated at the ingevity consolidated level further we are aware that the growth in capa s historical revenue and probability was positively impacted by a competitor s outage however as michael said in 2018 the benefit to capa from this outage was only 1 5 million as we discussed when we announced at the signing of capa the baseline 2018 full year numbers we are using for planning are 175 million of revenue and 60 million of ebitda while preliminary and subject to change for planning purposes we are estimating the goodwill will be around 310 million and the amortizable intangibles will be approximately 220 million the intangibles are expected to be amortized over a 12 to 14 year period the transaction should add an annual incremental 25 million to 30 million of depreciation and amortization to our current base d a of approximately 60 million for 2019 as these numbers are still being finalized i would encourage you to look at our pro forma filings that we expect to file with the sec in april we have initially funded the acquisition by drawing down our revolver capacity due to our increased leverage we will borrowing initially a libor plus 150 basis points as we discussed at the time of the transaction s announcement we may turn some of this debt out at a future date we are excited about the potential for growth in the coming years that capa brings as we pursue continued market penetration of its products and innovative technologies we welcome the capa team to ingevity turning to slide 15 you ll see our outlook and guidance for 2019 you should note that our guidance includes the capa business in our performance chemicals overall we are taking are very conservative view as we start the year across all the businesses in this segment we are focusing on growing higher margin applications increasing price to offset inflation costs and continuing on our path to drive margin accretion we are forecasting very modest top line growth for capa as we begin the process of integrating the business into ingevity we are entering into a transition services agreement with perstorp that will add some additional short term cost we will work to get off those arrangements as quickly as possible but some may last for much of the year in addition we will have three weeks of maintenance outages in the monomer plant at the warrington england facility over the course of the year these planned improvements will increase the reliability and efficiency of our operations however the one time cost should largely offset ebitda growth generated from higher sales while the outlook regarding brexit is uncertain the capital organization has made plans to increase raw material inventory in the u k as well as finished goods in continental europe to minimize potential disruptions to serving our customers at oilfield we expect volumes to be flat versus last year assuming crude oil prices remain at current levels we are in close communication with our customers regarding demand our customers are basing their projections on a wti price in north america averaging around 55 a barrel for the year in pavement technologies we expect to continue to deliver solid high single digit growth consistent with our growth over the last several years this will be driven by continued technology adoption in the globalization of our business for sales to industrial specialties applications we will continue to shift our business to higher margin uses this is expected to result in lower volumes specifically from exiting low margin ink business in europe and that result however will be higher margins and overall we have assumed modest increases in freight cost and raw materials including cto by the end of 2018 our cto cost reached what we feel is the market price we now anticipate modest inflation in cto cost given the balance in the supply and demand in performance materials we expect to see revenue and probability benefits from the increased regulatory requirements michael described in the u s china and europe as we ve indicated before this business is currently driven predominantly by the adoption of these regulations so any potential weakening in auto sales in the u s china and europe will be offset to a degree by the positive regulatory impacts in these regions from a cost perspective as we work through my pre adopted inventory in china we ll be cycling through higher cost product manufactured during the ramp up of the zhuhai plan finally we will continue to proactively defend our intellectual property therefore we anticipate higher legal expenses during 2019 on the right of the slide you ll see our guidance for the year of sales between 1 3 billion and 1 36 billion and adjusted ebitda between 390 million and 410 million at the midpoint we expect to increase revenues about 17 and earnings by almost 25 versus 2018 while we do not provide quarterly guidance i would like to describe how we see the cadence of the year playing out as most of you who follow us know the first and second half of the year tend to be fairly symmetrical however in 2019 due to the mid q1 closing of the capa acquisition and the regulatory growth in the performance materials segment in the second half of the year we expect the second half of the year s ebitda to be mid to high single digit millions of dollars higher than the first half our tax rate is forecasted to be between 21 and 23 capex is expected to be between 110 million and 120 million with approximately 15 million to 20 million of that number dedicated to the warrington site free cash flow should be between 180 million and 190 million with the capa acquisition our net debt to ebitda has risen to 3 5 times however we anticipate finishing 2019 with our net debt to ebitda ratio at less than 3 times as we look forward we are focused on execution across the company as we prepare to capture the opportunities of 2019 we are prepared for the increases in both carbon and honeycomb demand in the u s china and europe in the performance chemicals segment we are focused on growing our higher margin applications i will now turn the call back to michael michael wilson president and chief executive officer thanks john look in summary we had a great quarter and a great year and we re looking forward to 2019 i appreciate the work and efforts of our 1 700 employees worldwide they are a distinct competitive advantage for us we continue to believe very strongly in the long term potential for our company and we hope you share our enthusiasm for ingevity at this point operator we ll open up the call to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions all right first we ll go to the line of chris kapsch with loop capital markets please go ahead chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst yeah good morning so i had a question about your m a strategy in the context of your ambitions for the company overall and your formal remarks so it looks like on a pro forma basis roughly your net debt will be a little over 3 times but the free cash flow if that s devoted to debt reduction maybe you finish 2019 around 2 7 still above your targeted 2 to 2 5 so in that context in terms of additional m a opportunities where do you think you are in terms of timing on that you want to digest capa before you look to add additional opportunities or do you think you have the bandwidth that if something opportunistically crossed your plate you might be able to transact in the course of 2019 john fortson executive vice president and chief financial officer chris let me fix the you re thinking on the net debt to ebitda and then i ll let michael comment on the strategy we closed the year at 1 9 times right we just closed capa yesterday when you do the pro forma to include the debt from what we used for capa which is about 650 million of incremental debt you end up with 3 5 times so sitting here today we re at about 3 5 times net debt to ebitda given our cash generation profile for 2019 we should finish the year at just around 3 or slightly below 3 time all right so that s how the year will play out but i ll turn to michael on the m a michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes chris that s a great question i think as john just pointed out i mean given our outlook for 2019 and cash flow we will still be above our sort of targeted 2 to 2 5 times net debt to ebitda leverage ratio but i don t really think that hinders us strategically in any way if the right kind of opportunity comes along that we feel is value creating for shareholders our capital allocation priorities remain the same it s first and foremost to fully invest in our existing businesses that now includes capa we want to fund those growth opportunities we do see ourselves as a growth company long term we will continue to pursue value creating m a and then third and lastly assuming we can t find those opportunities or unsuccessful in doing so we ll return cash to shareholders all that said clearly right now in the short term we do have a focus on de levering in 2019 and we ll do that while we continue to screen the market for great opportunities chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst okay and i just had a follow up also on the pro forma modeling assumptions for capa the baseline assumptions that you had for 2018 given that that capa supplies the global engineered polymers industry while the palmer oriented companies obviously experienced a pretty dramatic downdraft in their demand associated with the somewhat vicious destocking cycle so i m wondering if capa experienced that in 2018 has that sort of influenced the pro forma number that you are using as a baseline for 2018 thanks michael wilson president and chief executive officer no i don t think so i don t think capa really saw that there s a lot of different polymer businesses out there some are very commodity oriented this is a very specialty business i mean it these are products that add very distinct functionality when added in small percentages to our customers end products and end uses and we just do not see that across the board our conservatism regarding capa in 2019 and we clearly covered this i think in our prepared remarks is that we are expecting a significant outage in the second half of the year in capa as we replace some glassware in one of the monomer lines we anticipate we will initially have some higher cost associated with the tsas that we will have with perstorp until we can work our way out of those however our priority there is to do that as quickly as possible we also recognize that there is uncertainty associated with brexit we are certain to have some higher costs associated with freight and distribution and warehousing as we pre stage raw materials in country and in products out of country to be prepared for any disruption that happens and so those are basically the reasons for conservatism the outlook for the business the business ability to continue to pursue derivative growth and penetrate new markets we think is unfettered chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst thank you operator our next question is from ian zaffino with oppenheimer please go ahead ian zaffino oppenheimer analyst hi great john i know when you were talking about the ramp seeing second half better than the first half you mentioned some of the compliance i was just more curious about have you been discussing with any of your customers the potential that they would actually go to 100 compliance on the auto side or is it really just going to be 80 and then we have to wait really until 2022 to see that 100 what are they saying what are the feedback what are you hearing there thanks michael wilson president and chief executive officer ian this is actually michael and there is a regulatory schedule out there for the the adoption for the u s and canada which does have step ups the next one being with 2020 model year vehicles which we ll see in the second half of 2019 to 80 and then of course 100 by 2022 model year vehicles but we sort of over the last quarter or two tried to convey that our view of what s happening has changed rather than automakers waiting for these implementations dates to make a step change in the compliance rate they seem to be on more of a gradual ramp simply moving to the new technology as they replace model years or as they update model year vehicles so as i said in my prepared remarks we think they re now at somewhere close to 70 sort of ahead of the 60 that was required for 2019 vehicles but we expect that just to continue to gradually ramp up i think i don t think it s really a question about moving to 100 in 2019 or 2020 but i do believe given the slope of that ramp we could see 100 adoption well before the 2022 deadline exactly when that would occur impossible to predict ian zaffino oppenheimer analyst okay and then also can you just talk about i know again you mentioned rig count can you maybe give us an idea what the correlation might be with rig count and the oilfield technologies business thanks michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes i think historically we like a lot of others who participated in oil field markets have used rig count as sort of a proxy for what s happening it s become less and less of a good correlating factor simply because rigs have become much more efficient instead of drilling one well from a rig maybe eight 10 years ago now they re drilling three four five so the better proxy is linear feet drill there is some information that s available in the marketplace on that that you can find but our best available information from talking with our customers is we anticipate linear feet drilled in 2019 versus 2018 is probably going to be flat to maybe down 5 now we ve guided our oilfield business as flat we think there s a bit of upside for us on the production side not the drilling side but also opportunity as we continue to globalize that business ian zaffino oppenheimer analyst okay great thank you very much very good quarter and good outlook michael wilson president and chief executive officer thanks we appreciate it operator next we ll go to james sheehan with suntrust please go ahead james sheehan suntrust analyst morning could you discuss the opportunity in brazil and how you see sales ramping in that market between 2022 and 2025 michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes i think we have some insight there i m going to let ed woodcock take that one though ed woodcock president performance materials yes thanks jim again as we announced it s starting in 2022 the brazilian automakers will have to meet a two day parking requirement then in 2023 2024 and 2025 there is an orvr requirement so a tier 2 styled canister where in 2023 it s a 20 compliance rate 2024 it s a 40 compliance rate and then by 2025 it s a 100 compliance james sheehan suntrust analyst do you guys need new capacity to serve the brazilian market or do you have enough in the u s ed woodcock president performance materials yes at this point i think we re fine things that could drive additional capacity needs or any regulations that occur outside of what s already been announced and any benefits that we get from our ang platform driving additional demand michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes and jim i would just add that if we were to add capacity it s probably more of the kind that we recently did in changshu where we put in sort of capital light capital efficient extrusion capacity converting more of our powdered carbons from purification solutions markets into automotive james sheehan suntrust analyst great and could you quantify the impact of higher cost inventory at zhuhai and the timing of that michael wilson president and chief executive officer well i think in terms of the timing and working through the inventory we would expect to do that over the course of 2019 i think in terms of getting granular on the cost that s probably somewhere i want to go john fortson executive vice president and chief financial officer you should see it reversing jim sort of in q4 michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes i would say if there s concern about the lower ebitda margins that we posted in the fourth quarter for performance materials i would attribute that more to the extended outage that we had at the covington facility to replace the kiln and somewhat to the higher legal cost more so than the work through of inventory in zhuhai with the increase we saw in pellet sales for china james sheehan suntrust analyst okay last question if i may what s the status of your patent infringement suits have you gotten any updates on those michael wilson president and chief executive officer well i get updates on those every week but unfortunately there is never any update it seems like the legal system continues to move at to glacial pace so that s frustrating for us we would like to give resolution but we ve done the hard work of providing the arguments and filings to the court and we just have to wait for it to play out there really is nothing significant to report but as soon as we have something we will pass it along james sheehan suntrust analyst all right thank you very much operator next question is from jon tanwanteng with cjs securities please go ahead jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst good morning gentlemen very nice quarter thanks for taking my questions michael wilson president and chief executive officer good morning john jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst expanding on one of the previous questions how should we think of the materials segment margin expansion in 2019 given higher legal cost higher freight the mix shift to china and then if there s any similar major plant downtimes on your schedule michael wilson president and chief executive officer yeah i do think we expect ongoing margin accretion i think maybe slow it a bit by some of the factors that you just referenced but again i mean some of the things that are headwinds to margins are being offset by just the ramp up of capacity utilization in zhuhai in changshu the fact that we re moving to more sophisticated products which bring higher margins as these more stringent regulatory requirements are put in place they require more difficult technology to produce and that favors our business so jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then are you basing your guidance on any particular start for china this year and i think i don t think you gave canada either although you ve provided the u s in your outlook michael wilson president and chief executive officer yeah for china our outlook has embedded and it s flat year over year sales for light duty vehicles so just to put that in context about 24 million vehicles i think jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then michael wilson president and chief executive officer gasoline vehicles obviously jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst got it and then just going to capa do you have a specific expectation for the contribution on ebitda in 2019 given you re 1 5 months in and also given its specific seasonality michael wilson president and chief executive officer we do but we re going to report capa underneath our performance chemicals segment so we re not going to give guidance below the segment level jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay fair enough thank you very much operator and next we ll go to daniel rizzo with jefferies please go ahead daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hi guys in terms of europe you said you saw some maybe potentially some pull forward there in performance materials i was wondering if that s been affected at all by the change in or the increased testing and the slowdown in production there i mean it doesn t seem to have an effect at all michael wilson president and chief executive officer i m going to pass that one to ed we re certainly aware of the increased testing requirements but i think the answer is favorable ed woodcock president performance materials dan it s not across all of europe meeting the wltp requirements somewhat oems did a terrific job of planning ahead and getting all their models certified under the new test procedures volkswagen as an example struggling to complete the large number of models that they have and get them all certified but in general we ve seen a good pellet increase in europe reflecting part of the regulatory impacts at the euro 6d and i think the automotive oems will work through the wltp issues relatively soon and get back to a normal production schedule daniel rizzo jefferies analyst if we think about brazil and the ramp it s going to occur there is it more like the u s pattern where there is like a model year or is it more like china where after this date is when you re compliant how does it work ed woodcock president performance materials yes it s more like china this time so it s not a model year based phase and it s an entirety of percentage across the vehicles that are produced daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay and then finally you mentioned freight cost being potentially a headwind i was under the impression that freight only spot freight costs are kind of declining right now i was wondering if that could be a potential tailwind later in the year as i guess contracts become renewed ed woodcock president performance materials it s possible michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes but i think we re taking a conservative view daniel rizzo jefferies analyst okay okay thanks operator next we ll go to curt siegmeyer with keybanc please go ahead curt siegmeyer keybanc analyst hey good morning guys michael wilson president and chief executive officer good morning john fortson executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning curt siegmeyer keybanc analyst given the growth that you cited in 4q in oilfield and industrial specialties can you talk a little more specifically how exactly you re able to leverage the georgia pacific assets just given they ve been in the portfolio for a while now to kind of drive that growth and your expectations going forward i know that you talked a little bit about the rig count but maybe a little more color around that michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes great question curt i m going to have mike smith take this one mike smith president performance chemicals yes thanks curt first i think that the in terms of sales from georgia pacific they were very much in line with our expectation the georgia pacific related sales to oilfield grew in a very similar way as ours did overall i mean i d say the same for industrial specialties what we were very pleased with as the year progressed was our ability to accelerate the synergy capture and actually increase above our initial expectations and we did that in a couple of different ways we found that our logistics and transportation synergies were really accelerated because we were able to reduce lane miles reduce storage so that was very helpful we were also able through shifting where we made certain products throughout the course of the year significantly reduce cost that we may have needed to take on an external tolling especially during the peaks in pavement season where we certainly sometimes need to go outside and do that and that was especially important because throughout the course of last year the oilfield market was very strong so the teams really did a great job in looking across the asset base looking across the logistic base and taking every opportunity to bring forward those synergies to deliver high earnings in terms of your comment for oilfield i think that they are very similar to what michael described before we re in close coordination and communication with our customers and just are kind of looking for more of a flat outlook toward 2019 versus 2018 compared to the very strong growth we ve had the previous two years operator our next question is from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg analyst thank you so in the capa business the new engineered polymers business 60 of your capex is for growth is that for some specific end market or products michael wilson president and chief executive officer i think over the long term it s really to support the entire business the expenditures that we have in 2019 are predominantly related to glassware replacement project that s related to the monomer capacity this is going to provide some debottlenecking and efficiency i think as we look beyond that it s really around investing in additional derivatives capacity this is something we ve known the business for a day so we need to dig into a little bit deeper but and talking with existing management team which we ve already garnered great respect for they see opportunities so we just want to look to understand those and be sure that we re investing properly behind the business paretosh misra berenberg analyst got it and then just on your free cash flow guidance if you could give maybe other components of your ebitda to your free cash flow conversion in other words if the tax if the cash tax rate also is 21 to 23 and working capital and those kind of things john fortson executive vice president and chief financial officer yes let me look at our cash conversion numbers are pretty straightforward paretosh i mean our cash tax rate generally is kind of around 15 right so that might help explain some of your disconnect as you kind of work through this but you really take the cash from operations the levers are capex spend working capital and obviously taxes drive some of that right but for us it s working capital is the big lever that we look at very carefully paretosh misra berenberg analyst got it thanks and good luck for everything john fortson executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you very much operator and we ll go to james sheehan with suntrust please go ahead james sheehan suntrust analyst thanks question on performance chemicals and your long term margin target for 2022 could you discuss the bridge to that 25 margin target the impact of 55 oil and how you get there and also the change you re probably adding the capa acquisition to the business michael wilson president and chief executive officer yes i think john this is michael wilson i will have mike add some color but i mean putting aside capa for a moment we remain committed to what was the core performance chemicals business achieving that 25 ebitda margin range by 2022 i think we certainly stayed on the cadence of that we had sort of a forecast for throughout 2018 and we thought we would hit 20 we came in at 20 6 so i think that s right on track the drivers for what i would call pine chemicals are going to continue to be the mix upgrades continuing to work hard to recover prices to get full value for our prices both at our tofa based and tor base now in terms of what capa adds again you re adding a business that in 2018 had a 175 million of revenue with mid 30 ebitda margin so that s going to cause faster margin accretion in performance chemicals then was previously talked about before we contemplated capa so we ll come back and reevaluate that i think at some point and then maybe early next year we ll come back and do another investor day and perhaps reset some of those targets given the evolution of the business but mike did you have anything you wanted to add to that mike smith president performance chemicals i think the one other i would add is that the highest margin business excluding capa within performance chemicals is our pavement technology business and with pavement technology business growing at high single digits you have an ongoing improvement in margin throughout the overall segment much like we do in that focus on the higher margin segments within industrial specialty so that s a natural improvement toward our target of 25 margins james sheehan suntrust analyst thank you very much michael wilson president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question is from vincent anderson with stifel please go ahead vincent anderson stifel analyst yeah thank you so you discussed some mild inflation in your feedstock cost for pine chem this year i m just wondering if you re baking in any assumptions for potentially lower hfo prices related to the imo 2020 regulations and may be the better question for us is to just remind us how much of your cost there is implicitly or explicitly tied to heavy fuel oil michael wilson president and chief executive officer i think in terms of heavy fuel oil standard i mean we probably would face the same thing everybody does as the transportation fuels prices they can go up with the lower sulfur requirements so we re certainly cognizant of that and i think that s probably baked into our outlook in terms of our freight and distribution cost in terms of the impact of that legislation on our business as a whole i mean i think if anything there might be a tailwind on asphalt as asphalt could end up being less costly as that gets implemented but overall freight and distribution is less than 5 of our total cogs so it s not a big new move vincent anderson stifel analyst great thanks and then you discussed potential growth capex related to expanding derivative capacity at capa utilization rates are tough to pin down but how much of that portfolio do you think you could shift over the near term before you would need to make any significant derivative investments michael wilson president and chief executive officer my understanding is that it s not something that is going to inhibit our growth over the next couple of years we have ample capacity to do that but if we stay on the growth trajectory that we anticipate in that time period we re going to need to add some additional derivatives capacity where that would be what exactly that would be is undetermined it might necessarily not even be in the u k there s also some possibility that some of our existing reactors and we ve already talked about the fact that we have multipurpose reactors that we may maybe able to make some derivatives in reactors that we already have within our chemicals business so we haven t had that evaluated we re only a day in so vincent anderson stifel analyst fair enough thank you very helpful operator and we ll go to chris kapsch with loop capital markets please go ahead chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst yes just a couple of follow ups on the pine chemicals business you mentioned the strong pricing on the tofa product line you ve also had some pricing initiatives in the market with respect to tor just wondering if you could describe how those are going and then also maybe if you can provide a little more color on the share gains that you mentioned in the adhesives market just wondering especially against the backdrop of lower oil because the gains i think you said were vis a vis hydrocarbon based tackifier so is this a function of the g p colorless technology tackifier technology or something else going on there any color would be appreciated michael wilson president and chief executive officer sure let me take the first part of your question and i ll let mike answer the second part i think in terms of related to the tor and well the pricing overall as we talked about in the script we sort of saw low double digit to low to mid double digit price increases across tofa in 2018 the rosin pricing was more or less flat we had certain success in some applications but not across the board but we did improved profitability by upgrading the mix by shedding lower margin business for higher margin opportunities and that s something that we ll continue to do and we ll also continue as i said earlier fight for higher value prices across that entire product line in terms of the adhesives application we picked up maybe mike can add some color mike smith president performance chemicals yeah sure michael yeah so within the adhesive and that s specifically in this particular case for safety road striping we have a large position in that already and through close collaboration with a major customer we were able to take a shift of part of that business where we already had some share that was tor based and replaced hydrocarbon based resins based on performance and being cost competitive on a total system at that customer so we were able despite the fact that yes oil prices were down to pick up a large piece of share at profitability that we were satisfied with and certainly higher profitability than other business that we shed in the second half of last year that was low margin in nature specifically inks in europe chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst very helpful thank you operator that will conclude the q a session i ll turn it back to the company for any closing comments michael wilson president and chief executive officer thank you everyone for your time and interest this morning we remain very positive about the long term outlooks for our business and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today thank you

you all for joining us today continued revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter capped off a strong year despite many challenges our team delivered on the outlook we provided in early 2018 i want to thank the associates across all of our businesses for the leadership hard work and resilience they demonstrated to help the company achieve that accomplishment ryan and douglas will discuss the fourth quarter results for each of their businesses in more detail but before that i want to share with you how we re thinking about the direction of the company about where we ve been and where we are going over the last several years progressive has performed incredibly well progressive s revenue has doubled from 1 billion in 2015 to 2 billion in 2018 while maintaining consistently strong profitability along the way the team has broadened our retail partner network invested in infrastructure product and compliance and developed an exciting pipeline of potential new retail partners i m incredibly proud of ryan woodley and the progressive team not only for their results but also for how they deliver their results the most exciting part for me is that there is still tremendous unserved market opportunity and i believe progressive is well positioned to continue to profitably grow the aaron s business has also made significant progress over the past few years on transformational initiatives that we believe will help the business get back to sustainable growth we ve invested in initiatives to improve the customer experience streamline our operating model and improve compliance we now have an e commerce platform that has grown meaningfully over the last few years and it s attracting new and younger customers to aaron s we invested in analytics to better inform us on merchandising and marketing decisions which has resulted in higher average tickets and improved lease margins we ve been piloting new store concepts that thus far are generating substantial lift in store level traffic and revenue the results we have seen in our business transformation initiatives give us the confidence to continue making strategic investments in the aaron s business the investments we intend to make will be centered around improving our customer experience operating efficiencies compliance and employee engagement we expect these investments will put the aaron s business on a path to sustainable long term growth in revenue and earnings i would like to think that aaron s business team led by douglas lindsay the balancing act between maintaining near term profitability and transforming the business to a new more attractive omni channel operating model is complex and difficult it takes strong leadership and a committed team to execute on both i m very proud of the team and i m optimistic about the businesses prospects as we continue to innovate it our strong earnings and cash flow over the past few years have provided the resources and flexibility to make capital allocation decisions that benefit shareholders both in the short and long term in 2018 we were able to make significant investments in all of our businesses acquire franchised stores across a number of attractive markets return 175 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and maintain a leverage ratio of about one turn our strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage for us we expect it will provide progressive the financial capacity to scale with potential pipeline partners give us the flexibility to continue to innovate the aaron s business and explore strategic development opportunities overall i m very pleased with the company s performance in 2018 and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2019 and beyond i will now turn the call over to ryan to discuss progressive s q4 results and 2019 outlook ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing thanks john i m pleased with the results the progressive team delivered in the quarter and for all of 2018 we re driving rapid growth while making significant investments in technology and infrastructure to position ourselves to convert and scale our large pipeline of retail partners total revenues rose 22 4 in the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 to a record 524 million ebitda increased by 31 2 as compared to the same period last year driven primarily by gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage the strong revenue performance was driven by a 14 1 increase in invoice volume in the quarter resulting from an 11 6 increase in invoice for active door and a 2 2 increase in the number of active doors in terms of notable changes to the door count from prior period the number of active doors in our mattress vertical was down several hundred locations due in part to store consolidations occurring in the industry we expect some additional reductions to our matches door count the first quarter of 2019 due to the timing of closures during the fourth quarter in spite of these reductions in door count we experienced invoice growth and our matches vertical during the quarter and the year we are now comping strong new door additions from the second half of 2017 and are pleased with the increasing contribution from these new partner locations we ve worked diligently to continuously improve the playbook for optimizing performance across new and existing doors by among other strategies focusing on the alignment of partner teams with program goals and using advanced door level performance tools and analytics in addition to optimizing performance among productive doors we re continuously identifying and evaluating underperforming doors and we re moving locations from our platform more necessary we believe the net effect of these optimization efforts is evidenced by the strong increase in productivity among our active locations ebitda was 12 5 of revenues versus 11 7 in the year ago period an increase of 80 basis points we generated leverage in operating expenses despite making plan investments ahead of expected future revenue growth write offs were 5 1 of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from the 5 4 reported in the year ago period bad debt expense was 12 8 of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 12 1 in the fourth quarter of last year our full year bad debt expense for 2018 was 11 4 well within the 10 to 12 target range we ve previously communicated with the change in lease accounting progressive bad debt expense will no longer be reported in operating expenses but will instead be reported as a contra revenue account given that the net effect of this accounting change is a reduction in reported revenues we are revising slightly our write off target range to 6 to 8 of revenues from 5 to 7 of revenues on roughly the same expected lease group performance as we look to our growth plan for 2019 and beyond we expect to continue to benefit from a strong pipeline of potential new retail partners across a variety of industry verticals consistent with past practice our outlook for 2019 includes anticipated growth from our existing book of retail partners as well as the expected conversion of a portion of our retail partner pipeline where we have near term visibility in keeping with that approach this year our outlook includes the rollout of one of the national partners with whom we have been piloting our modelling of the impact from this opportunity considers the fact that rollouts require time to mature as new partners and their locations become increasingly familiar with the program and fully integrate it into their marketing and selling activities virtually all our large partners have exhibited this trend of increasing productivity over time as is evident in the strong rates of growth we continue to see across many of our largest accounts some of whom have been with us for several years again i m proud of the team s performance in the quarter and the highly productive relationships we forged with our retail partners the majority of the 20 billion plus virtual lease to own market remains unserved and we believe our investments in people and technology position as well to continue to grow existing partnerships as well as attract convert and profitably scale new retail partner opportunities i will now turn the call over to douglas to discuss the aaron s business segments q4 results and 2019 outlook douglas lindsay president of aaron s business thanks ryan i m proud of our teams and encouraged by the momentum we re seeing in the aaron s business we experienced the best holiday selling season in the last three years both online and in our stores and finished the fourth quarter with a fourth consecutive quarterly increase in recurring revenue written into the portfolio and the eighth consecutive quarter with an improvement in lease margin our investments in people and technology are paying off and we believe they re enabling us to move faster on margin enhancing opportunities and also improved the customer experience same store revenues in the quarter were negative 0 5 an improvement of 490 basis points from the prior year quarter but slightly below our previous guidance in the fourth quarter we employed more low first payment promotions which we believe will benefit same store revenue in future periods but resulted in lower than expected revenue in the fourth quarter total revenues in the aaron s business increased 2 9 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 lease revenues increased 8 6 as compared to the same quarter last year primarily driven by the franchise stores acquired throughout 2018 lease revenues also benefited from investments in our aarons com platform which grew 50 in revenue written into the portfolio in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year aarons com is a key pillar of our omnichannel retail strategy and is attracting a younger higher ticket customer who prefers a mobile shopping experience we expect that aarons com will continue to grow in our existing infrastructure of fulfillment centers stores and last mile delivery as a competitive advantage this should enable us to continue to scale our e commerce business profitably adjusted ebitda increased 15 1 and was 10 4 of revenues versus 9 3 the year ago quarter an increase of 110 basis points adjusted ebitda growth demonstrated from an increase in lease margin partially offset by higher write offs and investments related to our business transformation initiatives including investments in people and technology write offs were 5 1 of revenue versus 4 2 in the same period last year contributing to the increase in write offs was an increase in the number and type of promotional offerings higher ticket leases written into the portfolio and an increasing mix of e commerce as a percent of revenue while e commerce leases charge off at a higher rate we remain pleased with the profitability of the channel given the number of new customers generated in this channel we believe profits generated by e commerce are largely incremental i remain encouraged by the underlying trends in our business in 2018 as well as our performance in the fourth quarter and our momentum going into 2019 as we look to 2019 i also want to take a moment to provide you with visibility into the aaron s business transformation initiatives these initiatives continue to be served around improving the customer experience driving demand and lowering our cost to serve many of our test and learn pilots from 2018 have proven successful and are ready for further scaling and rollout in 2019 the first of these initiatives is a rapid customer onboarding and decisioning test which has been very successful this new process allows us to digitally onboard our customer through a totally paperless experience that results in better data capture and a significantly faster sales process the customers and associate feedback have been very positive and we expect to immediately begin the rollout which should be completed in all company owned stores by the end of 2019 next the centralization of certain collection activities is moving forward as well testing is being significantly expanded based on promising early results both in collections productivity and in in store sales lift pending the successful outcome of our expanded testing we expect to begin rolling out this initiative to additional stores in the second half of 2019 and end of 2020 in addition we ve tested a couple of different versions of our next generation store concept in the greater san antonio market in 2018 and we re experiencing meaningful delivery in revenue lift the new concept includes a more modern look and feel inside and out a static retail showroom of new product with a separate pre lease area expanded store hours digital customer onboarding and a new sales focus to operating model as you know we operate stores across a variety of markets from large metro areas to small rural markets we don t think there s a one size fits all solution but we believe components of our new store concept will be relevant in all of our markets in 2019 we plan to expand the next generation concept to 40 to 50 locations which will be a combination of renovating existing stores and repositioning to new more attractive store locations we expect these stores will create a drag on earnings growth in the short term due to the initial investment costs and ramp up periods but we believe they ll have an attractive return on invested capital for the long run we will continue to evaluate results from our business transformation initiatives and we re taking a measured approach to these investments we ve included incremental operating expenses of approximately 15 million in our 2019 outlook for these and other marketing and demand generating initiatives before i hand it over to steve you may have also seen that during our 2018 holiday season we expanded our store hours to include opening on sunday from noon to 5 p m early indications that greater numbers of new customers are transacting in our stores on sunday and the revenue lift from these store sets where we have adopted sunday hours have been meaningful we expect nearly all of our company owned stores to be open on sunday in 2019 and both the expected lift in sales and the related costs are included in our outlook i m excited about our progress in 2018 and the prospects for advancing our business transformation in 2019 i ll now turn the call over to steve steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations thanks douglas now i ll turn to some financial highlights for the quarter on a consolidated basis revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 993 2 million an increase of 12 3 over the same period a year ago adjusted ebitda for the company was 112 7 million for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 89 9 million for the same period last year an increase of 22 8 million or 25 3 diluted eps on a non gaap basis for the quarter increased 57 to 1 02 in 2018 versus 0 65 in 2017 as you have seen from the earnings release operating expenses increased approximately 13 or 49 million versus the year ago quarter about 40 of the increase is due to the addition of acquired franchise locations throughout the year another one third of the increase was driven by the year over year increase in bad debt expense and write offs at progressive in line with expectations and with their significant revenue growth the balance of the increase is spread across investments in both our businesses including marketing personnel and intangible amortization expenses as well as legal fees resulting from our responses to the previously disclosed ftc cids cash generated from operating activities was 356 million for the full year of 2018 compared with 159 million for the full year of 2017 the improvement was driven primarily by a 162 million change in cash taxes paid between the two periods on october 23 2018 the company amended its revolving credit facility and term loan agreement to increase its term loan by 137 5 million to 225 million the company also amended its franchise loan facility to reduce the total commitment amount from 85 million to 55 million and extend the maturity to october 22 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we acquired 49 franchise stores for approximately 48 8 million we used cash on hand and availability under our revolver to fund the acquisitions during the fourth quarter the company purchased approximately 1 45 million shares of common stock for 68 7 million for the full year the company purchased approximately 3 75 million shares of common stock for 168 7 million at an average price of approximately 45 per share as of the end of the fourth quarter the company has approximately 331 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization we remain conservatively capitalized following the acquisitions and share buybacks and ended the fourth quarter with available liquidity of 388 million and a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of just over one turn lastly you will see in the 10 k we expect to file later today that in january 2019 the company initiated a restructuring program to further align its company operated aaron s store based portfolio with marketplace demand because of management s strategic review of the existing store portfolio the company is closing approximately 85 under performing company operated aaron s stores during the first quarter the company currently expects to incur between 12 million and 15 million of restructuring charges which will all be incurred within the aaron s business segment the restructuring charges will primarily consist of impairment charges associated with the closed stores now let s turn to our outlook for 2019 on a consolidated basis we expect revenues for 2019 to be between 3 9 billion and 4 06 billion an increase of approximately 8 to 13 compared to 2018 for purposes of these growth rates we have assumed that progressive bad debt expense is reported as contra revenue rather than a component of operating expenses for all periods presented non gaap earnings per share is expected to grow between 9 and 15 to 3 65 to 3 85 this assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23 5 and a diluted share count of 68 7 million shares for 2019 on a consolidated basis we expect to invest approximately 100 million to 120 million in capex we expect that 50 million to 60 million will be for ongoing normal course capital expenditures for our business so let s discuss the incremental spending from that baseline the increase is primarily in three areas first due to the change in lease accounting we reevaluated our vehicle acquisition strategy and plan to purchase trucks in the aaron s business instead of leasing them going forward the incremental capital expenditures for trucks should be approximately 15 million for 2019 another 15 million relates to both hardware and software to complete the rollout of rapid customer onboarding centralized decisioning and other it required support for our aaron s business finally you heard douglas talk about the success of the new store concept that we have tested over the last year the improvements we have seen include an increase in deliveries in excess of 30 given these results we are quickly but in a disciplined way expanding our tests to some additional markets and increasing our sample set by 40 to 50 locations during 2019 we expect to spend approximately 30 million for these real estate related improvements we believe it is prudent to take this additional step to confirm our findings before we decide about a possible broader rollout as douglas mentioned we do not expect these new store concept and related capital expenditures to apply throughout our entire system offsetting these internally focused investments we expect to scale back the pace of our franchise acquisitions compared to the last couple of years we do not have any material franchise acquisitions planned at this time however we would certainly evaluate the right opportunity where it do present itself let s talk about seasonality we expect progressive ebitda to grow throughout the year while we anticipate that aaron s business ebitda will be front end loaded due primarily to the impact of significant investments in business transformation initiatives and real estate costs associated with the further rollout of our new store concepts both of which will ramp throughout the year and have the biggest impact in the second half of 2019 on a consolidated basis we expect revenues adjusted ebitda and non gaap eps to be slightly higher in the second half of 2019 versus the first half and expect the fourth quarter to be the peak revenue and earnings quarter of the year with that i will turn it over to john for his final comments john robinson president and chief executive officer thanks steve we are pleased with the ongoing improvements in our business and look forward to another strong year in 2019 progressive continues to generate outstanding results and the aaron s business is beginning to experience the fruit of its business transformation efforts i would like to thank our associates retail partners and franchisees for their dedication to our mission and providing high quality products to credit challenged and underserved customers our success is a direct result of your commitment to providing the best experience for our customers every day thank you very much that concludes our prepared remarks i ll now turn the call over to the operator for q a questions and answers operator the first question will come from brad thomas of keybanc capital markets brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst i wanted to ask a question on progressive and one on aaron s if i could first i guess lying on the progressive side could you give us a little more color on the pipeline the scheduled rollouts here for this year what s baked into your guidance from in terms of new accounts versus existing partners and at a high level how you re thinking about that affecting the profitability of progressive steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations sure happy to thanks brad as you might have taken from the comments we re excited about the pipeline it continues to be comprised of both regional and national accounts and i think the team is doing a great job of surfacing the opportunities and as well as working the existing opportunities through the pipe we did mention in the prepared remarks about one of the rollouts is occurring we re not commenting on the specifics of that program but as i mentioned in the remarks it s a partner who we ve been piloting with for some time and have also obviously enjoyed a successful pilot and excited about the prospect of the program progressing to a rollout there s obviously still a lot of work to do but we re excited about the potential of program for us and our partner generally we remain very bullish about where the pipeline is today john robinson president and chief executive officer brad this is john i would add to that i mean in terms of our outlook we re we do try to include pipeline in that and we ve done that historically and we re doing that again but we have to we kind of keep it to what we think there s a lot of near term visibility on it and there s a lot of conservatives that we have to take into account in any of that because the schedule of rollout with the national partnering with regional accounts is uncertain and so there s always a portion of that in there there s uncertainty in that as well so we ve been consistent in that approach from the prior years and in this year again brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst got you and then in terms of how you re thinking about margins for progressive as you scale up with some of these national accounts are you still having to heavily invest ahead of that or do you think the flow through can be pretty good this year steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations there is definitely investment ahead of that i think we ve been pretty vocal about our store investing ahead of expected future revenue growth pretty consistently now for several quarters and i think that remains how we think about the business certainly in the case with this opportunity and others that remain in the pipeline and you can think about that in a number of ways but at the end of the day there s a technology investment in preparing solutions that we think are best suited to that retailers selling environment as well as sales and support investment in building out the team to support that account and help ensure the success of the rollout and we ve done both of those we continue to do both of those and that kind of buttresses our belief and how we think these pilots and programs will rollout and expand over time brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst ok and douglas could you just talk a little bit about the same store sales performance in the quarter i mean i think the good news is that these last two quarters have been some of the best in years but obviously we did take a little bit of a step back in the trend here in 4q what is it that slowed down a little bit steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations sure i mean first of all we re happy with the 490 basis point increase year over year sequentially they did dip down a little bit and we re below where we re originally guiding biggest driver of that is we got into particularly late in the fourth quarter into our holiday season and decided to really double down on a lot of our promotional offerings as you ve probably seen many of our promotional offerings are low first dollar delivers and we did more of those and so by nature of doing that we got lower first payments which adversely impacts revenue in the quarter but helps us build our business long term so we had a really successful fourth quarter in terms of revenue written into the portfolio and we ll see the benefit of that in 2019 but it calls the quarter to be down below where we had initially estimated the other thing that happened during the quarter is we had higher charge offs as we talked about and those adversely impact the portfolio as well so the combination of both of those things but we re really happy about our outlook for 2019 and we think that the deals that we drove in the fourth quarter were all of our positive comp outlook in 19 and we think that s net net a real benefit to the business brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst and douglas as you think about sort of 1q 2q it s been unusual backdrop with having a government shutdown tax refunds potentially delayed a little bit out of the gate but then hopefully a good refund season how are you thinking about those puts and takes impacting trends steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations yes i mean generally we ve got a portfolio of business that s as i said healthy rolling in 2019 we ll continue to see the benefit of ticket higher ticket that we rolled into the portfolio last year and we re working on the demand environment side of things so and i m not going to prognosticate on what s going to happen during tax season or anything else but we continue sort of run with same pace we ve been running and enjoying sort of the benefits of building the portfolio into 19 operator the next question will come from anthony chukumba of loop capital markets i m sorry our next question will now come from john baugh of stifel john baugh stifel financial corp analyst i was curious on the core side that obviously the comps were a little disappointing and you had to promote i guess from a very high level and it sounds like these tests are working and you re going to expand these store concepts to see how that flows and obviously that has some kind of an earnings drag so my question is simply as we look at the core business and we look at 19 earnings if we were able to extract the incremental investments in real estate or other areas are we kind of budgeting flat performance there or how are you thinking about that john or douglas strategically going forward given the difficulty to get traction in that side of the business john robinson president and chief executive officer john it s john robinson thanks for the question it s a good question and i mentioned in my prepared remarks it s definitely a balancing act that douglas and the team are managing and that they ve done a great job for the last few years really doing and managing between profitability in the short term and innovating the business for the long term and that s just where we are with the business right now we are very optimistic about the results we ve seen from the tests that have been running and they ve been really been running over the last couple of years and it s kind of all culminated into some new store concepts that we re testing in texas and it had very good results what we re going to do is take and what we have been doing and we ll continue to do is take a measured approach to that investment and the drag that it creates on earnings as we move forward we re really optimistic about some of the results we re going to expand the test of the we have been running we ve got kind of a four five store tests that we ve been running we re going to expand that to more stores this year and our outlook takes into account that obviously without that we d had higher near term profitability and it probably be materially higher in 2019 but we have a long term perspective on the business we really like the prospects of it longer term and are really encouraged by our ability to innovate into a really attractive model but it s a process and we re in that process right now e commerce is another great example of where we ve had great results and we re going to continue expand it s up 50 on a revenue written basis during the year so a lot of optimism but we re trying to be very measured and balanced about it and have provided what we think is our best estimate of our combination of maintaining profitability and investment for 2019 in our current outlook john baugh stifel financial corp analyst and john obviously to follow up on that e commerce you clearly still growing is there a way to isolate what your charge offs are on that business versus say the promotions you just ran which if i m not mistaken in your press release you alluded that that was the driver of the increase are you able to limit broad basically on the e commerce and what has your charge off experience been on that side of the growth for the quarter douglas lindsay president of aaron s business yes john it s douglas so e commerce is now roughly 10 of the revenue we write in to the portfolio and a bigger and growing piece of our overall revenue so we incurred slightly higher losses on e commerce but we have great visibility into those pools and monitor those curves all the time so we re constantly taking action to try to reduce those but also take the appropriate amount of risk we incur a much larger percentage of new customers in e com than we do in the storefront business and so new customers typically charge off at a much higher rate and all of the product that s on e commerce is new products that has a higher book value but even accounting for all of that we re really happy with the margins we re seeing in e com they re higher dollar margins and they re higher ticket deals so and they re largely incremental there s really low overlap between our e com business and our store business we expect that may evolve over time as we take a more omnichannel approach to our customers but right now really happy with the result john robinson president and chief executive officer and one thing i want to add to that on the e commerce side you mentioned fraud john which is definitely a consideration that anyone in the e commerce business has we do benefit substantially from the knowledge we have from progressive so that s one of the synergies of the combination for sure is the knowledge we have been able to port over from progressive to aaron s from a decisioning standpoint which is a considerable advantage for us on the aaron s side john baugh stifel financial corp analyst great and i apologize i joined late so if you addressed this my apologies any update on sort of the virtual inventory available in four stores that didn t have the internet or computer or whatever with ashley for example is that still something that s driving your business douglas lindsay president of aaron s business john it s douglas so typically when we refer to an outcome that s expanded out generally part of the replatforming of our e com business was allowing us to upload and have direct technical and those sort of relationships or connectivity to our vendors and so every day we re adding more product on to e com i think what you re referring to in store is our digital showroom or product in our stores and we continue to put that in stores as we renovate them you will see in these 40 or 50 new stores we do this year will have expanded isle i believe over time that our e com side and that functionality in our stores will overlap and we ll just have a different user experience in our stores that will tie end with the same product that we offer online but we continue to broaden the selection and are happy with progress there particularly with this new e com platform we have put in place operator the next question will come from bill chappell of suntrust bill chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst a little bit douglas first on the stores what s the expectation i understand the fourth quarter impact on same store sales but do you expect them to bounce back with as the kind of the new promotion start to kick in where you could see positive same store sales in first quarter of this year douglas lindsay president of aaron s business yes bill so we re guiding to full year guidance on comps which is zero to 2 you can look at the trajectory where comps have been we re not providing quarterly guidance i will tell you that we ve got momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the new year i made comments about sunday hours as well in my prepared remarks and almost all of our stores were open on sunday the first week in january and will continue to be we re seeing good lift there even a really strong lift even after the investment in labor and so that will further help comps and it is baked into our guidance so we i also mentioned that we ticket has been increasing and we see that continuing into the first quarter first half of the year as well as sort of carrying the benefits of the portfolio from 2018 the work that we did on ticket there bill chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst so i d just not to put words in your mouth but sounds like you re comfortable that comps would still be up this year even without just opening on sunday is that fair douglas lindsay president of aaron s business let me put it this way sunday is helping comps we are looking at the business holistically for all seven days of the week so we haven t really taken out sunday to see what the cannibalization is across the business we believe that we re still going to ride the wave of ticket but the underlying demand issue with customer traffic is one that we re solving over the course of the year through all these business transformation initiatives so we re not going to parse out the sunday versus non sunday comp piece bill chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and then ryan i might have missed it but the bad debt improved a little bit sequentially or in the quarter anything to that as we look into 2019 or just kind of the way the mix worked ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing yes write offs were down in the quarter end of the year right in the middle of the range of 5 to 7 that we used under the old accounting yes i d say the lease pools are performing in line with expectations happy with what the portfolio looks like and how we head into 19 bill chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and just like a big new rollout of a national vendor does that help on the write offs or does that usually actually have a negative impact to start with ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing we all invoice volume outdoors don t look the same and part of the work that we ve put into decisioning is to make sure that we can manage the portfolio to achieve the target returns that we ve given specifically the ebitda range of 11 to 13 in spite of that variability and if that s the case with this opportunity to grow the pipeline and that s kind of what we re shooting for is to target those ranges douglas lindsay president of aaron s business and bill i ll add to that the rollouts that we expect in 2019 are in verticals that we have been in for a long time so these verticals do have predictability around them and so that gives us comfort in our forecasting and the national rollout that ryan mentioned as he said is the continuation of a pilot that we have been working on for a while so that gives you comfort as well not that it s necessarily completely predictable in terms of how the scaled version will look relative to a pilot but it does give you good insight into forecasting pool performance operator the next question will come from anthony chukumba of loop capital markets anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst so just two real two quick questions one just a clarification so you talked about for 2019 guidance just said ok so progressive ebitda you have year over year growth throughout the year but then you said aaron s business is front end loaded i wasn t really sure what you meant by that steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations yes i think we just since we give this is steve since we give annual guidance we were trying to get a little bit of kind of mapping for the year the initiatives that we spoke to about the aaron s business were kind of ramped throughout the year and have and the opex that douglas spoke about as well as the capital will have a more of an impact on the back half of the year so we just meant to say that from an ebitda standpoint the first half will be bigger than the second half and that s partially influenced by the tax season which is a normal occurrence in this business anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst ok so the aaron s business ebit you have higher aaron s business ebitda dollars in the first half than the second half steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations yes anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst are you saying that the growth ok but you re not saying dollars steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations no dollars anthony chukumba loop capital markets analyst ok dollars ok got it ok that s helpful and then just one question you talked about the part of the reason that the aaron s business comps were a little disappointing was the lower upfront payments if i recall in this industry generally lower upfront payments down the line meet larger write offs and i guess i was just wondering how you are sort of thinking about that steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations sure what we re seeing in write offs is these lower ticket offers do accelerate write offs so we see higher write offs in the near term and i d say the first 60 days we see a spike in write offs and those were typically higher net book value deals because depreciation hasn t occurred on them but over time we see those write offs normalize and look and we believe just the acceleration of those write offs plus the lifetime value of those deals are just as attractive as non promotional periods but we drive more volume during those promotional periods so we re happy with the results operator the next question will come from kyle joseph of jefferies kyle joseph jefferies analyst steve just a quick one for you i think i get back into it but it would be helpful if you could give us sort of a what the 2018 progressive revenues were pro forma asc 842 if you have it off the cuff steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations i actually let me look for it while you have another question if you have another one kyle joseph jefferies analyst yes sure and then ryan just on the write offs outlook you gave is that just because of the progressive accounting that you talked about the write offs being up 100 basis points ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing it is kyle yes we have mentioned that we expect roughly similar lease pool performance in 2019 so we re just adjusting the range to reflect the new accounting guidance that we re implementing this year kyle joseph jefferies analyst got it ok and then just on a modeling question related to that going forward under asc are we going to get both the gross and the net revenue numbers from progressive going forward or should we just model for it on a net basis steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations yes we expect this year there will be color because of the footnotes on the bad debt expense but moving forward we would expect just to have the net revenue would be what we would be working off on in reporting kyle joseph jefferies analyst sure and then one last one for me for ryan if you could talk about the rollout of overstock how that s going and kind of give us a sense for how that if there s any impact on the metrics that you guys provide there in terms of invoice volume per active door and what not ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing sure i recognize there was a press release there so we ll acknowledge that we have a program there we re excited about it we have run a successful pilot and we re pleased to see that expand more fully on the site and it s going well i think it s evolving in line with our expectations we re continuing to see increasing productivity i think they ve done an excellent job of developing a very simple intuitive flow for customers on the site part of the work that went into that by both ends both overstock team and product team and excited about how it s going as with other accounts it continues to be upside as we identified more ways to refine the process make it easier and better for customers and that s what we re doing with overstock steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations kyle this is steve to answer your first question for the year it was 1 77 billion under the asc 842 method for 18 kyle joseph jefferies analyst ok perfect and then one last one for me ryan if you you talked about your pipeline can you give us a sense is that primarily brick and mortar or is it e commerce what is their balance ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing so if i was going to attack on to the overstock question just to point that i expect that s a harbinger of things to come e com obviously is a very significant next way of growth for our business and effectively virtually standing in general as more purchases shift online and that s the fastest growing segment and i think that s true with us as well we ve obviously not obviously but we ve invested more in our business development resources to target that opportunity and i think it s beginning to bear fruit and we re excited about what it will contribute long term obviously a big portion of the pipeline remains brick and mortar opportunity we re a very effective tool in helping our retail partners generate positive comps year over year both new and existing and i think that will continue to attract folks from the brick and mortar channel but the same customer wants to purchase online new customers in our demographic want to purchase online and we re working hard to help online retailers capture that opportunity as well douglas lindsay president of aaron s business the only thing i would add to that which steve is exactly right is the fact that through our bricks and mortar relationships many of them are taking more omnichannel approach to their businesses and progressive has done an excellent job of making that step with those partners and developing processes to help them do that so it s not only e com only retailers but it s retailers out there who were bricks and mortar traditionally becoming more omnichannel progressive is migrating to that format with them operator the next question will come from budd bugatch of raymond james alessandra jimenez raymond james analyst this is alessandra jimenez on the line for budd bugatch my first question is in the aaron s business what was the year over year performance of the acquired stores that were not in the comp douglas lindsay president of aaron s business yes thanks for asking obviously last year was a big year for acquisitions we bought some of our biggest franchisees and we re really excited about those acquisitions we bought markets that we admire and want to be in long term with our omnichannel strategy with the process of integrating those transactions many of them happened in the second half of the year so it s really hard to opine on performance yet we re going through the integration process switching out our teams making sure we got the right level of staffing making sure we re setting up the stores under our operating model and we re really optimistic about the markets we re not going to speak to any one transaction all i could say is these each of these deals operate at different levels and we inherit them at different levels and we re in the process of integrating them into our system and will report out more on them in the future alessandra jimenez raymond james analyst ok that s helpful and then you had mentioned that you promoted heavily in 4q in core and that resulted in a lower first payment on a comparable store basis how much did the portfolio contracts and contract value change year over year ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing i m sorry i missed the last part of your question alessandra jimenez raymond james analyst how much did the portfolio of contract and contract value change year over year ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing are you talking about the value of the portfolio how much did they go down alessandra jimenez raymond james analyst yes douglas lindsay president of aaron s business so we reported year over year in the fourth quarter negative 0 25 for comps and that s a proxy for the size of the portfolio so you want to think about at 0 5 of the degradation in the fourth quarter alessandra jimenez raymond james analyst ok and then for progressive on best buy s website it says that leases with progressive leasing will not be eligible for my best buy or pay with points program how widely available is leasing for best buy ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing no comment on any specific retailer i appreciate the question alessandra we just we tend to refrain from commenting on specific retailers operator the next question will come from vincent caintic of stephens vincent caintic stephens inc analyst first on the aaron s business side of the aberrance just the slight decline in the same store revenue so i appreciate that you talked about it being the result of some of the promotional activity and the lower upfront payments is there a way to normalize for that so maybe another way to see how the business has performed in the sense of maybe if you could give us the number of contracts maybe that grew year over year in the fourth quarter of 18 versus 17 or if you were to say normalize away from the lower payments is there would there had been same store revenue growth steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations yes there is another way to think about sort of our projected balance of business year over year which i just said was down 0 5 in the quarter is to talk about it in its pieces so our leading indicators are revenue that we write into the portfolio and what we churned out of the portfolio i think i had mentioned in my initial comments on same store comps that we did churn out we had higher write offs so we churned more out of portfolio but we had a really strong selling season it was our best selling season in three quarters sorry three years and so you can take from that that as we move into 2019 we feel the portfolio is building and that revenue written in to the portfolio which was very strong in the quarter will carry into the first quarter of next year we re not disclosing any specific numbers on both the churn and the revenue written in vincent caintic stephens inc analyst got it ok on the customer counts on the same store sale basis just being down 5 any color on that if there was any one timers or if something s just driving those customer counts lower steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations yes as you know we ve talked about this in the past what s been driving our same store improvement over the last year and 490 basis points over last year is largely ticket our underlying customer traffic has been down and we ve seen quarters where it s like this fourth quarter we ve seen improvement on that we drove more customers into our store but longer term that is the issue that we re trying to solve for and is our biggest focus internally i mentioned that we re spending a lot of money this year on business transformation and on demand generation and we have multiple demand generation projects as well as and those include marketing but also we re investing in the store of the future e comm and merchandising piece of the business all of which are addressing this demand part of the business that we re focused on so demand will be the focus going into 2019 and we think we have a solid plan to address it vincent caintic stephens inc analyst ok got it switching over to progressive side so appreciate the active doors grew but was impacted by some store closures and i think that mattress bankruptcy was well publicized but is there a way to normalize against that so excluding that those mattress closings what the growth otherwise have been for the rest of your portfolio ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing i think we did provide the detail that it was several hundred locations in the prepared remarks on a base of about 20 000 locations as we said in the past unfortunately doors isn t the perfect indicator of how the portfolio is growing and the business is performing with and this quarter is a good example of that we had 14 growth in invoice 22 growth in revenue 18 5 growth in the customer base which are all metrics we re very excited about even on that lower average store growth but we re very happy with how those doors are continuing to be productive and increasingly productive and excited about where the pipeline sits in into 19 vincent caintic stephens inc analyst got it and then just last one from me so i know there s been a focus on the bad debt expense increasing understand the focus on ebitda margin and i think that s great but i think the concern on bad debt expense is really we re kind of where we are in the cycle and if you re seeing anything so there s a worry that if you re kind of opening up to a certain customer that maybe that exposes you a bit more if we enter the correction or a recession but if you could give us comfort around that what you re seeing that would be really helpful ryan woodley chief executive officer of progressive leasing sure happy to just to recap on bad debt expense so it was up in the quarter year over year 12 8 versus 12 1 in the prior year but it ended the year 11 4 which is right near the middle of the range that we provided in the past on the old accounting it s under 12 of revenues and i d say that s reflective of the fact that the lease pools are performing in line with our expectations kind of in line with the increases in line with what we had in mind and we talked about the general level increase when we provided the 2018 outlook initially and then how those pools perform over time i d just say a couple of things on that we ve obviously operated the business through previous recessions and have some history of seeing pools play out not only across economic cycles and seasons but also different verticals and also say that the unique aspect of the lease that tends to get overlooked in the context of consumer finance more broadly is just the short average lease life these leases play out and seven months we have a good bit of visibility into the performance of the leases relatively soon after origination so you combine the visibility with a short average lease life and it really puts the our ability to manage portfolio in a different place in typical consumer finance business operator the last question today will come from john rowan of janney john rowan janney montgomery scott llc analyst just quickly on the expense guidance i heard three different numbers just to make sure i understand it is it 15 million for transformation 15 million for restructuring and then 30 million for demand initiatives incremental into 2019 steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations john i think we re maybe complaining two different issues we unpacked in my comments the some of the capex guidance so there is 15 million for fleet acquisition 15 million for capitalized software and other and hardware related to some of the initiatives and then 30 million for the build out real estate related improvements for the 40 to 50 stores that we mentioned i guess some of that is included in the 15 million of opex that douglas mentioned in his section as well so there is certainly an investment burden on the outlook for the aaron s business for 2019 but part of it is in capital and part of it is in opex john rowan janney montgomery scott llc analyst ok and there was there s 15 million of restructuring expenses in 1q correct steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations 12 million to 15 million is yes john rowan janney montgomery scott llc analyst ok and just to be clear you guys aren t seeing any change in early payments activity given the delayed tax refund yet steve michaels chief financial officer and president of strategic operations we don t really have any indications of anything different at this point in either business operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to john robinson for any closing remarks john robinson president and chief executive officer thank you for participating in our q4 earnings call we appreciate your interest in
