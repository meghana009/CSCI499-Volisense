main talking points the mexican peso stood out as the best performing emerging market currency in 2019 fundamentals do not support this growth further into 2020 usd mxn reverses its downward trend and corrects some of its losses there is no doubt the mexican peso has been the outstanding emerging markets currency in the last few months appreciating 5 since the end of november against the us dollar alone if we look at its performance against the euro it s continued strength coupled with euro weakness has seen eur mxn hit lows last seen july 2017 what is behind this recent strength in the mexican currency well if you look at solid economic data the mexican economy hasn t been performing well data for the last two months has shown that inflation is stagnating retail sales are falling and economy activity is slowing but like most emerging market currencies the mexican peso enjoys a push when risk appetite is at a high the effect of this risk driven demand is evident if we look at the performance of usd mxn in recent days when an outbreak of coronavirus spooked investors and money fled from risky assets towards risk havens like gold and the us dollar as the risks of the virus spreading became an increasing worry across the world at the beginning of this week usd mxn halted its decline and has manage to recover 1 of its value after rallying as much as 1 72 when measured at the height of the risk aversion sentiment on monday but before the world was concerned about a world virus outbreak markets were enjoying some much needed calm after ongoing trade wars between china and the us brexit concerns and a spike in geopolitical tensions in the middle east kept markets highly volatile throughout most of 2019 this period of market stability allowed riskier assests like the mexican peso to gain some ground but it s recent strength has also been influenced by a series of fundamental factors 3 key factors that have boosted the mexican peso the end to us china trade wars as i mentioned above the signing of a phase one of the long awaited trade deal meant that market apetite for riskier assests increased which also improved investor sentiment regarding global growth and financial stability the approval of cusma this new trade deal which stands for canada usd mexico trade agreement replaces the old north american free trade agreement nafta which was blamed by donald trump for hindering the us manufactoring sector the ratification of the agreement means that mexico s economy will receive a much needed boost after a period of uncertainty about the future of its trade relationship with the northern american countries especially given a period of stagnant domestic growth carry trade value with an interest rate at 7 25 the mexican peso enjoys the benefit of the carry trade strategy where investors borrow money from lower yielding currencies to buy bonds and financial assets of higher yielding currencies these means that there is a flow of capital from the us or european currencies towards mexico especially given that most developed economies are going through a period of unprecedented low interest rates a carry trade from the euro to the mexican peso would now yield a diferential of 7 75 given that the euro lending rate is currently 0 5 mexican peso outlook despite its stellar performance since the end of 2019 the long term outlook for the mexican peso is neutral to dovish given its lack of long term sustainability in the shorter term demand is likely to be driven by risk events with focus on the development of the coronavirus and its effect on us dollar safehaven demand as mentioned before the economic data for mexico is not particularly great and given its softening inflation banxico mexico s central bank will likely need to cut rates further in 2020 which will diminish the currency s carry trade diferential one of its most sought after traits on top of that the central bank mentioned at its lastest policy meeting that economic activity is weakening and growth remains stagnant putting further pressure on the mexican peso special focus on cpi and gdp data to be released in the following weeks to gauge the central bank s future stance on monetary policy it is also important to remember that demand driven by risk appetite is volatile and not sustainable in the long term especially when it is not supported by fundametals and economic data therefore we may see mexican peso weakness continuing in the short term usd mxn daily chart 2017 2020 if we look at a usd mxn daily chart we can see that the symetrical triangle that had been in play since the beginning of 2017 was broken to the downside at the beginning of december 2019 which consolidated the downward trend the price then bounced off a key support zone located between 18 73 key support in april 2019 and 18 49 key support in september 2018 on the upside usd mxn could find key resistance at 19 10 where the 100 dma is located beyond that resistence is likely to appear at th 50 fibonacci retracement from 2018 highs at 19 21 which served as a key support are in june 2019 written by daniela sabin hathorn junior analyst follow daniela on

the infectious and mortality rates of the new coronavirus have become the main force driving the pendulum of investor sentiment toward fear the move is all the more dramatic as investors had been positioned for a continuation of the historic bull market in equities and eager to take on new risks the coronavirus has surpassed the earlier precedents of sars 2003 and the swine flu 2009 the world health organization declared an international health emergency which will free up resources and boost efforts to contain the pathogen it took roughly 20 months to devise a vaccine for sars and it is estimated that a vaccine is possible within a month or so now to begin the testing process although china is expected to return from the extended lunar new year on february 2 more than a dozen provinces and cities will be closed several days longer which ballpark estimates suggest are responsible for a little more than 2 3 of gdp and 3 4 of exports supply chain and business disruptions will likely last longer still investors fear that the health crisis will turn into an economic crisis although president xi is understood to be the strongest chinese leader in a generation the challenges that china faces are immense u s rivalry and trade conflict hong kong taiwan and a highly leveraged domestic economy underpinned by deteriorating demographics china recently reported its birthrate fell to a record last year still some argue that the situation is even more dire as the official figures exaggerate both the population and the birth rate more monetary and fiscal stimulus is expected to be delivered to cushion the impact some forecasts show the chinese economy slowing to around 4 5 in q1 20 from 6 0 in q4 19 since the cny stopped trading for the holiday the dollar appreciated by a net of a little less than 1 against the cnh a catch up move of roughly the same magnitude would bring the greenback toward cny7 0 while the last time the dollar rose through that threshold the u s accused china of currency manipulation this time is considerably different moreover of all times this is the time when china could likely get away with manipulation if it wanted it is not just because of the macro shock but also because the u s has played the card once and relatively quickly reversed itself the has fallen 3 7 since china s lunar new year holiday began hong kong s is off about 5 8 taiwan s dropped a little more than 5 since the mainland holiday the german bund yield has fallen by about 11 bp and the u s treasury yield has fallen by closer to 18 bp china s benchmark yield fell about 15 bp since the end of last year to dip below 3 for the first time since q4 16 before the holiday china s will have little new information it will likely be ignored because events are evolving faster than can be captured in a snapshot of sentiment on similar grounds the january pmi readings more in the g10 are probably not going to be clean enough to give investors and businesses a strong sense of the economic toll of coronavirus also the policy significance is likely to be minor even if there was no contagion first few major central banks meet in february which means that there will be another pmi report before most g10 central banks meet second the bar to a change in policy is such that the pmi report is unlikely to shift expectations that said the is an exception it meets on february 3 the other two major exceptions are the on february 11 and sweden s the following day the market has grown more confident that the central bank will hold the cash rate at 0 75 before the december employment report january 22 the market favored a cut the fires and drought are pushing up domestic prices and the weakness in the 4 2 in january against the u s dollar may boost imported prices with a lag the fell for the second consecutive month in december and expectations for a rate cut fell from about 55 to less than 18 this does not end the story investors have pushed out the rate cut expectations and by midyear a 25 bp cut appears to be entirely discounted next week is important for the u s two major political events take place the first is the formal start of the u s presidential caucuses and primaries iowa is the standard bearer president trump is running unchallenged on the republican side leaving the democrat contest the focus two points are worth noting first in recent weeks sanders appears to have moved into the lead predictit org has been favoring sanders since early december second it does no matter so much because iowa has had a mixed track record in anticipating the national candidate third economic models many emphasize the low have consistently predicted a second term for trump for some time the positioning at predictit org has consistently favored this outcome as well the second major event is the following day the state of the union speech this is usually not a big deal for investors but what makes this year different is the president is likely to feel emboldened by the acquittal to be delivered by the senate the following day and his chances of being re elected specifically this may be the venue to formally announce the middle class tax cut that has been suggested by treasury secretary mnuchin and economic adviser kudlow looser fiscal policy by itself does determine a currency s direction which is why the may not rise if germany was to use its fiscal space which nearly everyone and their sister outside of germany have advocated monetary policy is the key loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy is the best mix for a currency it is what reagan volcker had that drove the dollar higher from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s it was what germany pursued when the berlin wall fell it is the recent u s policy

inflation target the risks also continued to be to the downside the december fed funds futures contract implies an average effective rate of 1 16 the current effective rate has been around 1 55 until month end pressures lifted it this means a full 25 bp rate cut and a little more than half of a second cut is priced it the market in a like vein if germany cut taxes as the cdu is advocating and increased social spending and infrastructure investment as the spd is advocating on top of the 62 bln euro program to facilitate a transition away from coal would the ecb respond by hiking interest

largest economy nearly stagnated in the last three months of 2019 the eurozone s fell to 1 1 in january from 1 3 according to the preliminary official estimate it has not been above 1 5 since 2012 headline inflation has been all over the board it finished 2018 with a 1 6 increase year over year it was halved to 0 7 in october 2019 and has doubled from there to 1 4 in january the ecb is not in a

china trade rebound the asian financial crisis and sars impact post coronavirus implications op ed by chris devonshire ellis with the world currently preoccupied with the coronavirus outbreak there has understandably been a lot of negative viewpoints concerning prospects for china during 2020 while the coronavirus situation is still unfolding mathematical modelling suggests infection figures will peak in the latter part of this month february and then decline during march during the latter half of this month we expect china factories to be back into production and remain so given isolated incidents pockets of infections can be expected to persist until the end of q2 as occurred with sars although the coronavirus is undoubtedly unpleasant and one in four cases of infection classed as severe there are some brighter spots the virus tends to be fatal among the old and the sick and the mortality rate appears relatively low at 2 percent which is about the same as global annual influenza outbreaks the difference this time is that the pathogen is new fairly contagious about 10 percent and appears to have arisen through species jumping it is unpleasant but it is not the global killer or doom for china many have been panicking about things will get back to normal and two similar if rather different events together with china s recent overseas belt and road spending tell us why the asian financial crisis of 1997 the first was the asian financial crisis in 1997 which occurred the same year as the handover of hong kong to china although this was not caused by any virus the resulting panic in financial markets had a similar effect to that being caused by today s coronavirus investors and buyers held off on purchasing from china this was a knee jerk effect caused by numerous asian governments in the wake of many asian currencies finding themselves unable to maintain their positions to a us dollar pegged system and higher than advisable foreign debt to gdp ratios the scenario began predominantly by us short sellers targeting then vulnerable asian currencies and making massive speculative bets forcing their currency values lower thailand devalued its currency and it halved in value in 6 months this created knock on effects in indonesia malaysia the philippines south korea and hong kong all of whose currencies came under severe pressure and in many cases declining significantly in value but the real target apart from profiting by short selling asian currencies was reducing china production costs because of this the unofficial rate between the us dollar and the chinese yuan also came under extreme pressure with many analysts and economists predicting that china would also devalue its currency china was under pressure for months until these attacks receded however during this time under the expectation the chinese currency would lose value against the dollar foreign investment effectively dried up orders were cancelled and chinese export growth took a large hit a situation not unlike the recent impact of both the us china trade war and today s coronavirus at dezan shira associates which was just five years old at the time the asian financial crisis wiped out 9 months of projected income and put the company into effective insolvency for a short period we were able to trade out of it as the situation improved and also learned some serious business operational changing lessons so as not to leave us so exposed in the future again many of those basic protections such as concentrating on developing cash flow generating business services and maintaining significant cash reserves are still in place today but it is what happened in china next that is more significant the speculators had under estimated in fact china had huge capital reserves a currency that was not freely convertible and capital inflows that consisted overwhelmingly of long term rather than short term investment existing foreign capital was then as to some extent it is now locked into china although it took several months eventually the global pro china trade lobby prevailed over the currency short sellers because of this and despite the problems china s gdp actually grew by 8 9 percent that year the chinese government also made various structural changes to prevent any repetition and to repel future currency raiders and as a consequence was able to maintain annual growth rates of 8 10 percent per annum for most of the next 20 years and the asian tigers chastened became less fiscally reckless and reduced their exposures meanwhile chinese gdp per capita income tripled from just above us 2 300 ppp in 1997 to us 6 900 ppp in ten years and is averaging about us 10 300 today with this being up to five to even ten times higher in principal cities like shanghai china has now become a valuable consumer market for foreign investors it didn t have that status in 1997 the contemporary equivalent to the short selling behavior of that time is today s trade sanctions regulatory and insider trading issues have moved the onus on trade manipulation from the us markets to the us government sars in 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars began affecting guangdong province in november 2002 however it wasn t until february 2003 that it had been identified and china had admitted there was a national problem many expatriates in china today will recall that period which was as concerning then as the coronavirus is now although without the restrictions and sophistication of social media we currently have in place the chinese economy had grown to us 1 2 trillion recording an 8 percent rise in 2002 the average per capita income in china at that time was about us 4 000 ppp although in primary cities such as beijing shanghai and shenzhen it was far higher there were similar instances of facemasks border controls passenger screening and various chinese villages attempting to isolate themselves by digging up access roads in fact although china had been woefully unprepared for sars a lot was learned back in those days that are extremely useful in handling today s coronavirus outbreak not least prompt liaison with the world health organization which was lacking in 2002 03 sars didn t completely clear up until july 2003 eight months after it had originally surfaced however china s growth continued it actually hit 9 1 percent in terms of gdp growth that year sparking economic concerns of an overheating rather than damaged economy li deshui then director of china s national bureau of statistics calculated that china had in 2003 become a significant global consumer of raw materials taking in 30 percent of the world s coal production 36 percent of the world s steel and 55 percent of the world s cement and acknowledged that prices for steel and cement were on the rise and that inflation could be a concern meanwhile 12 months after sars china s gdp grew by 9 4 percent coronavirus in 2020 it is hard to make predictions for the chinese economy in 2020 the coronavirus has still to run its course and problems could develop elsewhere in asia extending concerns our asean and asia coronavirus updates are here china s economy has also changed considerably since 1997 and 2003 however in 2019 the chinese economy reached us 14 3 trillion and achieved a growth rate of 6 5 percent china has become an exporter of finance providing us 500 billion for its belt and road initiative infrastructure projects alone china has also just concluded the us china trade war and tariffs on products have in many cases been relaxed from the position they were in a year ago however overall the situation remains the same as last year an economy in some uncertainty a virus has replaced the us china trade war as the new economic challenger reasons to be cheerful but there are bright spots according to mckinsey china s consumer confidence figures at the end of 2019 were at a ten year high the coronavirus outbreak will put an initial dent in that but there is no reason to suggest the fundamentals will change very much in fact there is likely to be some pent up demand once the situation is over and a release of positive emotions china has also been putting in place infrastructure to allow the digital processing of goods purchased and delivery both to consumers in china and those overseas many of these infrastructure developments along with free trade investments will kick in during 2020 many of the belt and road infrastructure projects china spent us 500 billion on either are or shortly will be completed providing the infrastructure required to keep china s imports and exports on track and in multiple cases enhancing these then there is china s internal infrastructure spend as concerns trade this includes the six free trade zones china is in the process of establishing on its borders the 24 e commerce zones it is also setting up and the enhanced freight traffic facilities it has established in numerous hubs both on a global basis as well as within the eu russia latin america and africa on top of those there is an improved china asean free trade agreement and the upcoming tariff conclusions to the china eaeu fta which when it happens will spur a us 100 billion in additional bilateral trade between china and russia it is also possible that the phase two us china trade deal could include a us china bilateral investment treaty should washington be in the mood to throw beijing a bone all things considered at dezan shira associates we expect china to recover from the coronavirus sooner rather than later there is a long way to go and as i pointed out uncertainty remains but that was also the case albeit under different circumstances last year and growth still reached 6 5 percent history shows us china s economy has rebounded or emerged relatively unscathed from previous serious stressors with 2018 and 2019 also being years china invested a great deal in securing supplies and developing and improving infrastructure i expect any shortfalls caused by the coronavirus outbreak to be made up by the trade enhancements both in infrastructure and in terms of improved and new fta it can expect to take advantage of in 2020 related reading

interview with philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by martin arnold on 27 january and published on 2 february 2020 the key motivation for this interview was to look at inflation and monetary policy and to ask you to try and explain why inflationary pressures seem so low and why even though in the past five years the ecb has thrown pretty much the full monetary policy toolkit at trying to raise inflation it still hasn t hit its target it s still struggling to push inflation up what s driving that when you listen to economists and you read what people are saying about it you get multiple explanations why do you think that is and what can you do about it first and foremost there has been a big macro shock that has seen the economy operating below potential in respect to europe the lowest end of the crisis was in summer 2012 it has been seven eight years since then so those effects have not disappeared europe had two crises one after another thinking about the cycle in europe compared with the united states that double crisis is relevant for why it s more delayed here the reason why the answer now is a little different to two years ago is that there is some evidence of a recovery in inflation two or three years ago there was a lot of debate about missing wage inflation but after a long period of time we have had wage inflation now for a couple of years but we don t have the transmission into the phillips curve much phillips curve work basically looks at wages and unemployment when you look at price inflation you see a variation services inflation is in the high ones now so it s not the case that services inflation is dead by high ones you mean close to 2 so in line with your inflation objective it s closer to the objective the fraction of the price level which is most likely to be influenced by wage pressures is moving closer towards the target the big gap is in goods inflation the price level of goods which is just over half the price index is still closer to zero than to the target it is a dichotomy and this applies globally between goods prices and services prices there s a dichotomy in the real economy as well between manufacturing and services yes it is an overlay that we have this big manufacturing slowdown at the moment the difference has been a long running phenomenon because the scope of productivity increases is much less in services than in manufacturing manufacturing is highly tradeable whereas services by and large are not the global influences on inflation that come through commodities and goods prices are much less evident in services the global question is why inflation in the goods category is so much weaker while firms in the goods sector are facing more labour cost pressure wages are going up in the goods sector in manufacturing as well as in services yes absolutely even more so looking at the markets many services sectors are made up of smaller firms which are more competitive whereas with many goods markets there is a degree of pricing power firms have to look at their market share for example so a firm may wish to raise prices but they feel that the current market conditions are not favourable this relates to globalisation think of sectors like electronics cars and so on where there is a fairly small number of global firms yes but if there s a small number of global firms they have more pricing power they also are elastic if one firm charges too much it will lose market share in the manufacturing sector you have to think about those global forces to a degree you can segment pricing you can differentiate pricing strategies across the different continental markets goods are generally more global in terms of competition whereas services are more domestic and local exactly yes it s also the case in terms of scale of global value chains and so on the cost structures in many goods industries have perhaps become a lot more common because firms are globally sourcing inputs they might have designers in europe ip originators in the united states and assembling of goods in asia or central and eastern europe in other words in addition to the fact that they are competing with each other they might have more similar cost structures because they are all searching for the optimum way to run a global value chain that s why there is more similarity in pricing developments in the goods sector now it s suppressing price increases but that is not necessarily forever you can also imagine scenarios where if it turns out that the market conditions favour the ability to raise prices that could also happen globally finally what is unique to the last couple of years is uncertainty firms think about whether they really want to risk losing market share by trying to obtain a price increase in a situation where there is a lot of uncertainty one point is trade tensions but also the other types of uncertainty for example in the car industry with changing consumer preferences the genuine uncertainty about the future of diesel versus petrol versus electric in those conditions of uncertainty there may be less appetite than normal for taking risks by raising prices or squeezing demand it s not necessarily forever do you see signs of it changing at the moment firstly there cannot be a permanent disconnect between labour costs and prices the second is cost pressures upstream for example the dynamics of commodity prices such as energy prices or other commodities these have been extremely volatile but if you get an episode where commodity prices have a sustained upward pressure that s going to play an important role in goods prices thirdly we are in a phase of low investment globally when you have less investment less capacity then that downward pressure from excess capacity is less some large emerging markets may have rotated from building up more capacity in manufacturing china is one example over time that may feed into a situation where there is more cost pressure on global manufacturing do you have anything to support this or are these just theories we have regular surveys with euro area corporates which are conducted quite frequently that s backed up by the non financial business sector dialogue which is a roundtable with big corporates and the governing council going back to modelling our macro models tend to have mechanical pricing strategies for example there might be a kind of constant relation between costs and prices so these variations in margins should be looked at but it is still hard to analyse these periods when you have costs going up or prices the models are too rigid they don t allow for this sort of fixing of margins by companies i think there s room for improvement the world economy has changed the fraction of the world s overall global activity which is generated by the emerging markets is so much more than it used to be 10 or 20 years ago the nature of the global economy is quite different now because we now have a much greater contribution from emerging markets there is more productive capacity and more demand in the world and that is very welcome imagine how 2008 or 2009 would have gone without the emerging markets continuing to grow this is very welcome but it does require us to think hard about what is going on you ve talked there about cyclical effects what about the structural effects like demography and digitalisation that people say are causing these low inflationary pressures do you discount those as factors that are driving down inflation structural factors are relevant for understanding how the economy is changing over time but in the end inflation is a monetary phenomenon these are forces that can have one off transitory effects but if a central bank is doing its job it is probably not a useful approach to say that these factors permanently affect the inflation rate clearly one of the big trends in the world economy is the ageing of the population i think that ultimately has mixed effects on the inflation dynamics for example the shrinking of the labour force by and large could make over time labour more expensive it is surely changing the bounds of consumption of different types of goods and it has pervasive effects on the economy but i wouldn t classify it all as working in one direction in terms of inflationary pressure does it have an impact on savings rates i think it s definitely a force but you have to look closely at the whole distribution if you have a lot of people aged 40 to 60 depending on the country and its pension system that age group will tend to be orientated towards saving for retirement as more and more people reach advanced stages of life or maybe are dis saving that sign can change again it s also important to say that household saving is just one component of overall saving along with corporate and government saving there is also a question about saving versus the allocation of portfolios super safe versus riskier assets when people get close to retirement their portfolio might shift towards safer assets we think that is part of the reason why interest rates are super low it is this kind of safety preference that is emerging how much of this is due to demographics and how much due to people having been scarred by the financial crisis remains an open question on digitalisation again we think it definitely has an impact on those goods where an online presence is important going back to the difference between services and goods the online dimension is of course quite important for particular categories of goods but it would not be so important in setting services prices for example i do not think it makes a big difference to the rent you pay research indicates that digitalisation may also be making a difference to how firms set prices because they have a lot more information now their use of pricing algorithms may mean they respond differently to changes in demand and so on so it is changing the structure in some categories but we do not think that it is something that is so fundamental that the monetary drivers of inflation are somehow disconnected my basic point is that a lot of these digital developments may generate important relative price movements we know that certain goods are a lot cheaper now than they used to be because of online searches and so on but i am not so sure you can say that the overall inflation rate in the economy is permanently affected but you would say that wouldn t you because if you didn t then what s the point of monetary policy just look around the world you can see from the cross section of countries the fact that there is a limit to all of these arguments we know countries where the monetary forces are a lot looser and there is no problem with inflation getting high when you are in this kind of low zone where the advanced economies and many emerging markets are where inflation is super low and interest rates and our policy instruments are already quite extended then a negative shock to inflation is going to be more visible because we cannot instantly correct it the policy space is such that it takes time to restore inflation back to target when you have a low inflation and a low interest rate world with relatively small temporary shocks to inflation which are more visible and more persistent so you re not saying it hasn t had any impact at all you re just saying the impact might be more visible here in europe where we have very low inflation first of all low inflation means a small shock compared to the overall inflation rate looks bigger and second our ability to quickly eliminate those shocks is less since 2014 the mantra of the ecb has been patience that we are intent on getting inflation back to target our monetary policy remains effective and we do respond to shocks but it does take longer when you can only do relatively small policy moves when you look at geographically within the euro zone different countries and different areas it does seem like there are some countries where inflation is above your target and others where it s very low are there any common themes that you spot there i know you prefer to look at the euro zone as a whole but when you have a common currency the best way to think about the differentials inside the euro area is real exchange rate adjustment in those countries with stronger economies you might expect to see inflation stronger and the labour market tighter what you are seeing there is a real exchange rate appreciation among the countries once you eliminate the noise of national currencies the very standard classical prediction that faster growing countries should see real exchange rate appreciation is much more visible the economics of the differentials within the euro area are fairly well understood but compared to the big picture these are quite small differentials and they are self correcting this is why in the end we do look at the aggregate because the economics of appreciation and depreciation are that if you live in a country which persistently has inflation above the euro area aggregate all else equal it basically means a loss of competitiveness therefore that economy will slow down and come back equally a country where inflation is below the average over time would gain competitiveness and will climb by and large we think there is a self correcting element to those differentials within the euro area that is why the aggregate is the ecb s responsibility those differentials play a very important role but it is not fundamentally an inflation issue it is a relative price level issue the current scenario that you ve very well outlined are there parallels between the situation we re in now and previous points in economic history if you go back long enough there are definitely periods of time when price level inflation was very low but by and large in many of those cases that was a period when you had the gold standard or bretton woods and so on essentially under bretton woods the us had a monetary policy everyone else was more or less fixing equally under the gold standard the responsibility for inflation at national level was quite different at that level we understand that you can have periods of very low interest rates and very low inflation rates but in terms of the history of modern central banking there isn t such a clear parallel because you had the inflationary pressures in the 1970s and the 1980s and then the disinflation and then the convergence to around 2 in the late 1990s early 2000s what is different is that getting inflation back to target from below is something where the playbook is quite different to getting inflation back to target from above that is the big challenge for years it was about getting it down yes we have learnt a lot over the last six or seven years remember the big pivot in the ecb was 2014 the motivation was to rule out deflation there were signs of inflation dynamics approaching zero or even going negative phase 1 of the ecb s pivot was to address that to restore enough inflationary pressures that we would be back into sustainably positive inflation territory then phase 2 which has been a number of years now not being satisfied with eliminating deflation risk but wanting to bring inflation back towards the target the scale of excess in unemployment across europe was so high that it took a while even for wage inflation to pick up there are two forces at work now one is that as the european economy continues to grow wage pressure is maintained unemployment is stabilising around 7 5 the level of unemployment is important for wage pressure we have persistent wage inflation now we talked earlier on about the low likelihood of permanently squeezed profit margins at some point already we see it in services inflation we think we will have it in goods inflation as well that is a scenario by which inflation will climb over time the contest is between that and the fact we also know inflation is very persistent so if you are in a situation where firms and workers have spent several years in a world where inflation has been around 1 then that kind of model influences their expectation of what is going to happen next year and the year after and the year after that in other words if inflation is low and there is a belief that it will remain low then the incentives to raise prices come down this is basically the conflict because people expect inflation to be low people keep inflation low exactly because if you are an individual firm saying what happens if i raise prices and my competitors do not or let s say i have already observed in my industry that some firm raised prices last quarter so you have seen last year s pricing dynamics in turn for many firms it is going to depend on what the workers are looking for in terms of wage increases and workers in terms of what their representatives may ask for often they say well we need to compensate for an increase in the cost of living the ask when inflation is unexpectedly low is less than when inflation is high there s definitely a kind of self reinforcing nature of inflation that s true at high inflation it s true at low inflation it s sticky it is sticky but it is not totally immobile it is likely that inflation is going to move up slowly and that has been our forecast it is going to take a while the central bank has to be sufficiently proactive in policy making that people understand that inflation is going to rise over time if you are indifferent if you ignore the importance of getting inflation up over time then you can get locked into a kind of low inflation trap that we think would be quite dangerous so inflation is moving up this is why in september there might have been a difference of views about what to do but the importance of doing something was clear the two year ahead inflation forecast had come down from 1 8 at the end of 2018 to 1 5 by september 2019 whose expectations are that is that the market expectations or is that companies and households all of it is relevant when i talk about the inflation projection it is basically aggregating everything in our macro models all of it matters in different ways market expectation matters because the pricing of the whole financial system depends on investors on their view i just gave the example where it matters quite a bit what the expectations of those who are involved in setting wages are it matters quite a bit for firms as well but we also know especially in the world of very low inflation those factors are not directly controlled by the central bank in the end i share the view of many that the most important influence on expectations is actual inflation unless we get actual inflation up we can talk as much as we like and communicate as much as we like but in the absence of evidence that inflation is moving up then many people will ignore the central bank s communication why does it matter if inflation is at 1 2 1 3 percent or 1 7 1 8 percent why does that matter that doesn t sound like a massive difference to most people in the world right so this is why it is not so easy for macroeconomics to provide intuitive answers if you knew for sure inflation was going to be 1 0 forever 1 5 forever 2 0 forever then i would agree with you it doesn t really matter these are small differences if these were fully predictable fully certain the dominant macro reason to be concerned is let s say the underlying demography growth and others mean that the real rate of interest was zero long term zero the policy space when inflation is 2 means if there s a negative shock we basically have 200 basis points of cutting before getting to zero compared to 100 basis points if the inflation rate were 1 there is a universal consensus that you really don t want to get into a situation where a negative shock can drive you into deflation our ability to use the traditional policy tool which is a positive policy rate is bigger if the inflation rate is 2 than if the inflation rate is 1 or zero when you go out as i ve done recently i wrote a piece from mainz farmers market and i asked people what they thought inflation was they think inflation is much higher and i think your surveys at the ecb have shown this yes there s a lot of variation a lot of households think it is higher yes and a big part of that seems to be the cost of housing that in their minds you ask them about inflation and they think about things they buy every day so probably groceries and stuff and they think about rent or mortgages particularly house prices so they think about asset prices actually and that s in their consciousness when you ask them about inflation people don t think that you re measuring inflation properly is there a problem in terms of the share of housing costs i know it s something that s going to be looked at in the strategic review even before you get to housing there are huge differences in the inflation rates facing individuals depending where you are in terms of your point in life young versus old depending on whether you re in a country where you re renting versus where you are owner occupied depending whether you are in a country where house prices are falling like in italy versus where house prices are going up like in northern europe there s going to be a lot of variation in individual inflation rates in other words there is always going to be an issue around how you come up with an aggregate measure of the cost of consumer prices i think we at the ecb would agree that there should be more weight on housing but there is a difficulty and this has been looked at several times before one issue is about the consumption element of owning a home every day you are enjoying the services of living in your own home versus the fact that it s also an asset as you say so that dual role conceptually it is not an insurmountable problem and we are going to look at it again in the review we have to learn and review from the previous episodes of studying this issue is it to do with it being too difficult to measure i do not want to pre empt the review by saying that that is what we are necessarily going to conclude it is a real issue and we have to be practical about it the hicp is clearly our target when we set monetary policy but we also look at many other things for example at one of our recent meetings i was looking at what the inflation rate would look like if we included a measure of owner occupied housing in the index the inflation rate would be a little bit higher now how much higher you can read private sector estimates which i think look at around 20 to 30 basis points as of now but let me emphasise that sometimes it goes the other way housing is quite cyclical so in a downturn the inflation rate would fall more quickly because if you have a negative shock if you look at the proxy measures that are being generated they do fall more quickly in a recession it would be more hawkish though at the moment if you changed it to include this then you would be more likely to raise rates sooner because inflation would be higher automatically let me draw a clear line between what we look at in the strategy review and any near medium term policymaking the strategy review is about what is the best approach it should not be read as having any link back to today s policymaking do you worry about a liquidity trap this was something that people have talked about this goes back to the issue of inflation expectations if you do not provide stimulus that gets inflation back towards the target if inflation remains low for a longer and longer period of time and then if you have a negative shock you run the risk of being in a situation where essentially you hit the limits of monetary policy we don t think we are at that point now the ecb has been quite creative i think with going negative and all the different purchase programmes and we have continued to see monetary policy being effective through the end of 2019 and into 2020 what we are doing through these policies is reducing the lending rates facing firms and households we can do more but clearly we are closer to the lower bound than the federal reserve is we are closer to it than we would like to be can i ask you about sweden their explanation of their decision has been quite limited and left a lot of people frustrated as to exactly why they ve chosen to do this when it seems like their economy isn t strengthening enough to justify it i think they said that the longer you have negative interest rates there s a fear that it starts to have an impact on the behaviour of households and companies do you fear that it is an interesting issue the economics of low interest rates whether they are a bit above or a bit below zero and then i think there is something special about the economics of going negative we are always clear we do recognise that there are potential side effects and in the review we are going to look at that sweden s inflation rate is closer to target than the ecb s inflation rate is we look forward to a day when we can get out of negative rates at some point the comparison of benefits and costs is going to change that is true it is a lot easier to make that decision when inflation is closer to 2 percent as in sweden than when it is still too far away as it is here when you say that there s a difference in the economics of negative rates as opposed to low interest rates and the world changes a bit what are you referring to well first of all the ability of banks to pass these rates on second whether more and more households conclude that they need to save more not save less but deposits at banks have shot up ever since the negative rates were introduced the question is how much of that is down to more and more people entering their pre retirement phase so i am not so sure how much this is directly related to interest rates it fundamentally differs across countries according to pension systems the fact that more people are in work and that debtors get a break and governments get a break on their debt servicing that outweighs the fact that relatively wealthy people in a few countries may respond differently to low rates mario draghi said the main reason why inflation is so much higher in the united states than it is in the euro zone is to do with fiscal policy broadly speaking if we were to have the same fiscal policy as the united states then yes inflation would be a lot higher well you re seeing a bit more from europeans now even if it s only baby steps yes it is visible it definitely is making a difference i don t know if you ve read what my colleague martin sandbu wrote about monetary policy affecting supply versus demand but i d be interested in your views it struck me as quite an interesting way to look at it yes it is something we would think about quite a bit as well historically there was always a nice clean separation which is that supply is just driven by technology by innovation by demography monetary policy and demand in general matter in the short run but fade away but when you have a persistent phase of low demand i think it can have a long lasting effect there is a recent paper by alan taylor and some others which shows that the effects of monetary policy are visible in the supply data even ten years later if failing to deliver an effective monetary policy has long lasting damaging effects on supply that reinforces the importance of doing monetary policy well i agree with that and just think about the counterfactual imagine what the supply potential of europe would look like if the ecb had not provided monetary accommodation in the last six or seven years we know employment has gone up so just think about the supply capacity of people if more people spent the last six years unemployed than employed that would you re talking about 11 million people yes that would damage employment without that demand investment would have been a lot lower and therefore the stock of capital in the economy would also be lower i am pretty sure that in the absence of ecb policy over these last years the long term productive capacity of europe would be lower at the same time and this is why it is a nuanced debate there is a school of thought which argues that easy monetary conditions are preventing a shake out of unproductive firms the zombie companies well zombie is a catchy way of thinking about it that is an interesting perspective which i think you have to quantitatively compare with the fact that a kind of suffocation of demand is not good for the long term potential so your overall message is basically that it s working monetary policy is working you believe it has an effect we re in this extraordinary post double crisis period which is going to last for a bit longer but it s working it s just going to work slowly and we need to be patient the fact that we have this global low inflation environment also means if there is a turn there could be a global turn in a synchronised way this is not necessarily just a question of time it could be a change in the state of the world so our forward guidance leaves open the possibility that we should be appropriately humble about knowing the timeline i don t think everything is so certain that you can say this is all on a set course i think there are downside risks and while i would not like to call the forces that raise inflation upside risks because they may be bad news for the global economy like de globalisation but there could be forces that are inflationary that could kick in trade and geopolitical forces that could be good for inflation but not great for the economy yes i also think we should revisit the issue of energy prices historically i think the price of energy has always been very important in the overall dynamic if the world does adopt more transition friendly policies that means that the consumer price of energy trends upwards that could be a force that contributes to inflation dynamics the narrative of everything inevitably low for longer there is a lot of weight to that but i do not put all my probability on it you should watch out for other forces
taylor telford and thomas heath the washington post stock market volatility returned on friday as the spreading coronavirus that has brought china to a standstill fanned fears the epidemic will

coronavirus contagion is worsening with more travel restrictions and the number of infected already exceeding the total infected by sars said kristina hooper chief global market strategist for invesco

finished in the red with energy the biggest drag growth in the euro zone softened significantly last year fresh economic data showed friday expanding just 1 2 in 2019 its lowest level in six years experts say the slowdown is tied to a weakening manufacturing sector and strife in the automobile industry further complicated by global trade tensions u s economic growth dropped to its slowest pace since 2016 in 2019 the commerce department reported thursday the slowdown defies claims from the trump administration that stimulus from the 2017 tax bill which yielded big cuts for corporations and households would lead to 3 gdp growth despite a 2 1 rise in fourth quarter gdp growth for the full year was 2 3 compared with 2 9 in 2018 and 2 4 in 2017 consumer spending rose slightly at 0 3 in december the commerce department reported friday while incomes inched up 0 2 and inflation picked up 0 3 consumers are not as positive as they were in the middle of 2019 and are sitting on their wallets as the year came to a close which draws a great big question mark over the 2020 economic outlook chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank wrote in a note to investors friday business investment spending on equipment and structures are declining which doesn t suggest companies think consumer spending will be all that red hot in 2020 and this is before the china virus has spread generating uncertainty that will keep the consumer at home instead of taking those trips to the mall that the economy sorely needs to keep growing goldman sachs in a research note on thursday predicted the coronavirus will somewhat stifle u s economic growth in the first quarter the investment firm said that a bigger outbreak in the united states could pose a significant risk to consumer spending and business activity but in an interview with fox business on thursday commerce secretary wilbur ross claimed that the lethal virus could help the u s economy as businesses seek alternatives

impact of the coronavirus a 2004 study from the brookings institution korea university and the australian national university estimated that the outbreak delivered a 40 billion hit to the global

october and then again on friday it s not a free for all and not a panic said howard silverblatt of s p dow jones industries a pullback was expected the virus has been the trigger the question is how long does the virus scare continue and how much it impacts global supply chains ivan feinseth of tigress financial partners sees the virus scare as a potential opportunity for investors history has shown that any selloffs in stocks driven by health scares have been short lived and did little to change the upward ascent of stocks in the past feinseth said the s p 500 gained 31 in 1997 even in the face of a combination of the avian flu epidemic the asian financial crisis the russian sovereign debt default and the collapse of long term capital management but there are signs that the outlook for

global stock markets are experiencing an uptick in volatility as investors speculate on whether the coronavirus outbreak will have long term effects on the global economy so far the north american markets are holding up well considering all the negative headlines as both the tsx and s p 500 remain positive for the year there were a couple days when we saw triple digit drops but the selling pressure was short lived the indexes recovered over the next few days thanks to several high profile companies exceeding their earning expectations the chinese markets aren t faring nearly as well with china s stock market off by nearly 10 per cent since the virus took off comparison to sars other epidemics i m often asked about the economic effects of the coronavirus and how it might compare to past outbreaks such as sars it took six months before sars was fully contained and during that time 8 000 people were infected in 29 countries killing 774 people from an economic standpoint the outbreak significantly impacted asian economies especially tourism air travel retail real estate and food and drink industries surprisingly the markets performed well following the sars outbreak the s p 500 was up 20 per cent in the 12 months following sars and other outbreaks have experienced similar results for example the s p 500 was up 18 per cent one year after the avian flu epidemic and 38 per cent after the swine flu epidemic source charles schwab that said i don t believe there is a correlation between an epidemic and higher stock valuations i think it was lucky timing more than anything else as an example sars occurred in 2003 soon after the tech bubble burst which caused the s p 500 to drop by 49 per cent so markets were extremely oversold and due for a bounce in looking at the historical epidemics including ebola zika h5n1 h1n1 hiv the pneumonic plague and mers on average the s p 500 was up 8 5 per cent in the six months following an outbreak hopefully history repeats itself and a year from now we can say that the coronavirus economic effect on the north american s stock markets was short lived source dow jones market data short term impacts over the short term i expect more volatility with further drops in the chinese stock markets lower oil prices and a lower canadian dollar as the epidemic will negatively impact global economic growth and commodity prices money will continue to flow into traditional safe haven investments like gold bonds the u s dollar and japanese yen once the virus is contained and life goes back to normal financial markets have typically stabilized and areas of the market that might have been oversold due to panic selling recover world health organization officials discuss the coronavirus at a news conference in geneva in january martial trezzini keystone via the associated press with every crisis there are also opportunities for those needing to apply for or renew a mortgage we are seeing mortgage rates drop as money floods to the safety of the bond market as the coronavirus is bound to slow down global growth the bank of canada might have to cut the benchmark interest rate to stimulate our economy this will benefit those with variable rate mortgages if you have a long term horizon and a well diversified portfolio which should include some safe haven assets to dampen your portfolio s overall volatility you should be fine over the long run focus on what you can control rather than stressing over things that are completely out of your control you would be better served focusing on areas that are in your control such as updating your will reducing debt implementing tax saving strategies or earning extra money these actions will have much more impact on your financial health it s a little more complicated for those with investment time horizons of less than three years it might make sense to increase the allocation to safe haven assets or implement a low volatility equity strategy if you work with an advisor now would be a good time to set up a meeting to review your options this column is part of cbc s opinion section for more information about this section please read our faq

on the poorer outskirts of the city residents continue to struggle with water shortages and malnutrition and in the countryside beyond venezuela is falling apart with residents lacking even the most basic services like electricity and police but the wealthier areas dotting the capital have undergone a striking economic boom in recent months shopping malls that were deserted six months ago are bustling and imported suvs course through the streets new restaurants and bars are popping up weekly in the wealthier parts of town their tables packed with foreign businessmen fashionable locals and government insiders the people are tired of getting by said raul anzola manager of the 1956 lounge bar which hosted the party they want to spend they want to live almost overnight the country s authoritarian leader nicolás maduro has made that possible for some with the country s economy derailed by years of mismanagement and corruption then pushed to the brink of collapse by us sanctions maduro was forced to relax the economic restraints that once defined his socialist government and provided the foundation for his political legitimacy the changes have helped transform venezuela in ways few in washington or caracas had envisioned but that are reminiscent of how its allies cuba and nicaragua relaxed communist policies and allowed some private investment when faced with economic collapse in previous decades after years of nationalising businesses determining the exchange rate and setting the price of basic goods measures that have long contributed to chronic shortages maduro seems to have made peace with the private sector and let it loose and while the country s economy continues to contract overall the declining regulations have encouraged companies serving the wealthy or the export market to invest again dollars are now accepted everywhere despite maduro s frequent denouncing of the united states as the root of all of venezuela s problems the country s currency the bolívar made worthless by hyperinflation is hard to find i don t see it badly this process they call dollarisation maduro said in a television interview in december referring to the free circulation of dollars thank god it exists seeing shelves stocked again has also helped ease tensions in the capital where anger over the lack of basic necessities has over the years helped fuel mass protests under the new economy maduro s supporters among the venezuelan elite are living handsomely on business deals and stashes of hard currency which us sanctions prevented them from spending abroad at the 1956 lounge teenagers and their parents sipped champagne and discussed coming yacht trips the transformation also brought some relief to the millions of venezuelans who have family abroad and can now receive and spend their dollar remittances on imported food but the boom has also come at a cost the new free market economy completely excludes the half of venezuelans without access to dollars this exacerbated inequality that most capitalist of ills and undercut maduro s claim of preserving the legacy of greater social equality left by his predecessor hugo chávez and his bolivarian revolution people at a packed music festival with an entry fee of 70 14 months worth of the country s minimum salary in caracas venezuela dec 15 2019 the new york times in his speeches maduro continues to promote a vision of venezuela in which its resources are shared by all but the gap between the rhetoric and the reality is greater than ever said ramiro molino an economist at caracas andrés bello catholic university the fight for survival has forced the government to become pragmatic molino said only the narrative is still socialist even some members of the ruling party called the changes under maduro a betrayal of chávez s socialist inspired movement and its stated mission to help the poor this is savage capitalism that erases years of struggle said elias jaua chávez s former vice president who still sits on the board of maduro s socialist party oil production the country s biggest source of funds is stabilising after falling to the lowest levels since the 1940s as maduro relaxed the state s grip on the sector and embraced private investment but instead of continuing the lavish public spending that marked the chávez era there have been deep cuts to social programs venezuela s government spending dropped 25 last year according to caracas based consultancy ecoanalítica the drastic economic liberalisation has been accompanied by political repression designed to snuff out the last vestiges of organised opposition to maduro s rule this new model has led some venezuelans to call their country the tropical china weekend boaters and partiers in the clear caribbean waters at tucacas venezuela dec 14 2019 the new york times in a sign of newfound market confidence about 100 venezuelan companies have applied to issue new bonds in 2019 the highest figure in a decade the country s biggest rum producer ron santa teresa last week completed the country s first new issue of shares on the local stock exchange in 11 years the government has slashed red tape and turned a blind eye to taxation fuelling a boom in private exports of everything from oil to chocolate enriching politically connected and traditional business elites imports by private companies overtook those done by the state for the first time in venezuela s modern history last year according to molino the economist there s a lot of money going around at the moment you just need to know how to find it zairet lópez an accountant said recently at a packed music festival in caracas which charged a 70 entry fee or the equivalent of 14 months worth of the country s minimum salary the open air festival featuring venezuela s top émigré bands 12 hamburgers and artisanal beer was one of the myriad entertainment events that have blossomed around the once gloomy capital in recent months the economic opening has had a starkly unequal impact on venezuelans well connected officials and military officers have benefited from a plethora of new business opportunities and government concessions in everything from gold mining to beach hotels by reducing access to foreign travel and banking the sanctions have also forced these elites to spend at home boosting domestic luxury consumption tired of waiting for political change the upper and middle classes opposed to maduro have tapped into the foreign savings set aside during venezuela s oil bonanza of the 2000s when the government gave citizens billions of dollars at highly subsidised exchange rates beachgoers socialise during a party hosted by a car audio company in la guaira venezuela dec 22 2019 the new york times venezuelans held abroad deposits worth 136 billion in 2018 according to the country s central bank even if divided evenly among venezuelans this figure equals 4 500 a person but a few venezuelans held much more than that those lower down the social scale rely increasingly on money sent by the millions of venezuelans who have emigrated in recent years to survive about 40 of venezuelan households receive money from abroad a total of about 3 5 billion a year which has become crucial to keeping venezuela s economy afloat according to molina the economist the government has been able to achieve the effect of plenty and it s very powerful said félix seijas director of the caracas based pollster delphos it brings a certain relief that helps to lower the social tension but about half of all venezuelans have no access to dollars most of them live in the provinces where they barely survive on government handouts of devalued local currency and subsidised food according to delphos much of that food is imported or packaged by the private companies once derided by maduro as coup mongers and parasites and while the stocked shops and busy restaurants have improved the mood in the capital for some after years of unrelenting economic decline they have not turned around the country s overall economic prospects venezuela s gross domestic product is expected to lose another 10 this year after shrinking by more than two thirds since 2013 the largest decline in modern history outside a war zone according to the international monetary fund about 80 of venezuelans think they are worse off or the same now as a year ago according to delphos and while the government s economic changes have lowered the incentive for demonstrations at least in the capital almost 2 out of 3 venezuelans said they would protest if conditions were right the discontent has gone latent but it hasn t gone away seijas said for most venezuelans maduro s reforms have brought only marginal relief from the economic devastation of recent years mariely marin 30 sells cotton candy in a square in downtown caracas she makes 2 a day barely enough to buy food and insufficient to treat a respiratory illness that recently cost her a lung this is a way to cover up the reality she said of the throngs of people taking selfies on the lit up square lined with street sellers hawking popcorn and sweets those who have known another venezuela understand that things are not well it s obvious that the crisis continues
at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week president donald trump again talked positively about negative interest rates that s not a very good idea considering negative interest rates are a warning signal of deflation which can be as bad for an economy as runaway inflation but trump was right to herald this era of low nominal interest rates and inflation if you want to understand how the dow jones industrial average has risen from a low of 800 to a high of 29 000 in four decades look at the federal reserve s graph of the 10 year treasury rate showing the sharp and relentless decline in interest rates between 1980 and 2020 think about how the world has changed in 1981 10 year treasury bills paid an interest rate of 16 now they are at 2 dow tumbles 600 points as coronavirus fears rock stocks it may be the biggest unsung story of economic success a gift that just keeps on giving the biggest winner of all from low rates is of course uncle sam every 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates reduces federal borrowing costs by at least 1 trillion over a decade i remember in the early 1980s my local bank was trying to lure depositors by offering lifetime certificates of deposit paying 10 to 12 interest rates many of the banks that made such foolish offerings failed in the years to come what happened federal reserve chairman paul volcker teamed together with ronald reagan in a political partnership that slew inflation bringing it down from 12 to 4 in about 18 months the high nominal interest rates back then were simply the price we all paid for runaway inflation which rose to 12 in 1980 the consensus among economists and leading financiers was that double digit inflation was with us for decades to come as paul samuelson warned about in his weekly newsweek column whoops what was not foreseen was that reagan and volcker would start a new economic regime to kill inflation that prevails to this day we now live in an era with interest rates lower than at any time in decades and the forecast is for borrowing costs which are driven primarily by inflation and inflationary expectations to remain microscopic for years and decades to come coronavirus undermines health of u s economy goldman sachs why do these low rates matter to the economy let s start by imagining the added cost to buying or selling a home today if we still had mortgage rates as high as they were back then homeowners would be paying thousands of dollars of extra mortgage payments a year and real estate values would crash as would homebuilding second low interest rates raise stock values and wealth inflation and high interest rates are the thieves of the stock market the towering inflation of the late 1960s through 1980 corresponded with a near 60 collapse in the after inflation return on stocks it was one of the greatest liquidations of wealth in u s history a bloodbath disinflation and falling interest rates combined with a stable dollar have helped resurrect growth while u s assets owned by the public have reached 100 trillion in value third low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing costs for businesses and allow small firms that might not have access to equity markets to expand investment through loans by the way real inflation adjusted interest rates rise when there is a higher demand for credit which happened in the 1980s even as nominal rates plummeted the biggest winner of all from low rates is of course uncle sam every 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates reduces federal borrowing costs by at least 1 trillion over a decade a sudden spike in rates by say 200 basis points which would still be below the historical average in the post world war ii era means 2 trillion to 3 trillion of higher interest expenditures on top of 20 trillion of publicly traded debt get fox business on the go by clicking here a final point i keep hearing senior citizens and financial advisers complain that low interest rates hurt retirees on fixed incomes that s nonsense seniors tend to hold more stocks than young people so the surge in stock values has disproportionately benefited older people in the united states seniors who complain about today s low returns on bonds should be taking a look at how their stock portfolios are performing in just three years under trump index funds have seen better than a 50 return some 60 trillion of wealth is held by seniors today and will soon be passed on to the younger generations thanks to this 40 year surge in the stock market in the 1970s seniors living on fixed incomes were supposed victims of high inflation and interest rates because it cost them more to buy food medicine and energy higher interest rates would correspond with a higher cost of living so seniors should be careful of what they wish for so should trump his administration is benefiting mightily from low rates and tame inflation to which his supply side policies including tax cuts have

london with her recent announcement of the european central bank s ecb long overdue strategy review new ecb president christine lagarde has generated high expectations the review s outcome will be the first important signal of how lagarde intends to lead the institution and of how the ecb is likely to address persistently low inflation in the eurozone the world is very different than it was in 2003 when the ecb s strategy was last revised and the institution has itself undergone deep changes since the 2008 financial crisis faced with a global recession and then the 2011 2012 eurozone debt crisis the ecb abandoned the traditional approach of passively meeting banks demand for liquidity its initial response to the financial crisis instead the ecb started actively managing its balance sheet in order both to ease monetary policy and stabilise the financial system furthermore the ecb has radically expanded its operational tools in 2014 it introduced negative interest rates on banks deposits with national central banks and began providing the market with forward guidance concerning its future policies and since 2015 the ecb has engaged in asset purchases known as quantitative easing or qe causing its balance sheet to double compared to 2008 finally the ecb has assumed larger prudential supervisory responsibilities vis à vis european banks under the single supervisory mechanism the first phase of the ecb review will be narrow focusing on defining the bank s inflation target the role of monetary aggregates as signals of medium to long term inflation and communication this is expected to be concluded in the first half of 2020 to be followed by a second phase of reflection any meaningful review of these issues must objectively and critically analyse the decade since the financial crisis during which average eurozone inflation has been well below the ecb s objective of below but close to 2 per cent and also lower than in the united states and the united kingdom in particular the review should quantify the costs of tolerating a systematically below target level of inflation relative to pursuing other policy options there are at least three hypotheses to explain the ecb s inability to achieve its inflation objective the policy mistakes hypothesis maintains that the ecb should have implemented more aggressive policies in particular qe between 2012 and 2014 if these mistakes stemmed from an ill defined ecb strategy then its strategy will have to be adjusted if they were the result of political constraints then its decision making process should be changed the second explanation highlights the inadequate coordination of fiscal financial and monetary policy in the eurozone in 2009 for example monetary easing was accompanied by a delayed cleanup of the banking sector and fiscal austerity leading to a second recession that the ecb was late to identify and in 2012 2014 a neutral fiscal stance was coupled with both insufficient monetary stimulus and banking sector deleveraging both hypotheses suggest that the ecb would have fared better had it clearly committed to a symmetric quantitative target for inflation or nominal gdp that would have implied for example not increasing interest rates in 2011 as the ecb did in response to the temporary inflationary effect of higher oil prices it also would have implied starting asset purchases in 2012 instead of 2015 and not stopping them in 2018 the third hypothesis favored by some central bankers is that persistently low eurozone inflation reflects structural factors such as adverse demographics low growth expectations and the associated increase in demand for safe assets this explanation thus draws parallels between the eurozone and japan where aggressive monetary and fiscal policies since 2013 have failed to lift the economy out of its two decade long slough of low inflation advocates of the structural view argue that it would be better for the ecb s policymakers to adopt a lower inflation target rather than try to engineer a monetary stimulus that ends up inflating asset prices and jeopardising financial stability after all their argument implies there is little evidence that stable low inflation is bad for welfare but this third hypothesis can lead to two alternative policy recommendations the first is a do nothing approach coupled with a downward adjustment of the ecb s inflation target in line with actual inflation such a course of action is justified if policymakers assume that potential output growth in the eurozone has declined independently of past fiscal and monetary stabilisation policies the second option as under the first two hypotheses is to maintain an accommodative monetary policy possibly in coordination with fiscal policy this would be the right thing to do if policymakers believed that persistent slack in the real economy would end up affecting potential output most analyses imply that ecb policy has in general been too cautious during the last decade moreover even if one accepts the structural explanation for trend inflation and takes the view that inflation expectations have fallen independently of past policies the do nothing option is likely to cause expectations to spiral further downward possibly leading to a deflationary trap one then has to consider the costs linked both to the associated relative price adjustments and to the effect that the resulting upward pressure on the real interest rate would have on the burden of private and public debt these costs are likely to be greater than those associated with the financial stability risk of doing too much which in any case can be addressed using prudential tools the ecb s new strategy will have to be based on the kind of quantitative analysis needed to answer these questions but it also must recognise that economists are still a long way from understanding the dynamics of low inflation given this uncertainty the ecb should aim to adopt robust policies that cause the least damage under a broad range of scenarios lucrezia reichlin a former director of research at the european central bank is professor of economics at the london

shall see in today s post expect the punditry to be asking should investors bail out sit tight or wait for more information last week recap in my last regular installment of wtwa two weeks ago i

on their quarterback i like the parlay of niners and under since i think a victory for them will only come if their defense prevails the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart this week i am featuring investing com s version if you go to the interactive chart online you can see the news behind each of the n callouts the market lost 2 1 for the week the trading range was 2 4 although it felt larger to most observers monday trading was weak the mid week rebound was erased and more on friday in general each decline was attributed to the coronavirus story and the rebounds to the market shrugging it off you can monitor volatility implied volatility and historical comparisons in my weekly indicator snapshot in the quant corner below noteworthy tesla now worth more than ford and gm combined the news each week i break down events into good and bad for our purposes good has two components the news must be market friendly and better than expectations i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news and you should too new deal democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research this report is fact based ndd is consistent with the package of indicators each has a source and often an accompanying chart this week shows that indicators in all time frames remain positive although the short term and most volatile group is only a weak positive read the entire post for ndd s commentary on the specifics mortgage applications were very strong rising 7 2 versus last week s decline of 1 2 the start is even better than last year s excellent performance the good durable goods orders for december increased 2 4 versus expectations of 0 5 and november s downwardly revised loss of 3 1 consumer

a closer look at the data is less encouraging dr robert dieli shows the contribution of components broken down into core and noncore categories his full report explains why the import contribution is unusual and misleading consumers are doing the heavy lifting he also describes the results in terms of cyclical and non cyclical economic activity the dramatic changes over the course of the year become obvious jill mislinski provides another useful perspective on the rate of economic growth considering gdp per capita she points to the dramatic change in trend at the time of the great recession new home sales for december were 694k saar missing expectations of 725k november was revised lower from 719k to 697k calculated risk points to the year over year results up 23 over december 2018 and the 2019 total up 10 3 from 2018 he notes that comparisons will be fairly easy in the first five months of 2020 but more difficult later the bad pending home sales for december declined 4 9 versus expectations of a gain of 1 0 and november s 1 2 calculated risk also comments on the relationship between new and existing home sales for many years there was a tight relationship following the housing bubble there were many distressed sales bill has consistently followed this distressing gap which persisted as builders focused on more expensive homes that is changing personal income for december increased only 0 2 missing expectations of 0 3 and worse than november s downwardly revised 0 4 once again the year over year viewpoint looks quite different first trust personal income and spending continued to rise in december closing out 2019 on a high note for the year personal income rose a healthy 3 9 while spending increased 5 0 tied for the largest annual increase going back to 2006 within income gains for both december and full year 2019 were led by private sector wages and salaries which rose 0 3 in december and are up 5 5 over the past twelve months incomes were further supplemented in december by a rise in interest income which helped offset a decline in farm proprietors income due to lower subsidy payments from the department of agriculture to farmers impacted by the trade skirmish higher incomes in turn continue to drive spending which rose 0 3 in december purchases picked up for both goods and services as a drop in spending on autos and energy products both gasoline and home utilities fell in december was more than made up for by increased spending on medical care food and recreation the chicago pmi for january registered only 42 9 far below the expected 48 7 and december s downwardly revised 48 2 the earnings beat rate 69 and amount above estimates 4 1 are both somewhat below the average for the last five years factset here is the summary by sector

department of justice also released the names of two chinese researchers who allegedly acted against us interests 50 000 per month generous living expenses and 1 5 million to establish a research lab at wuhan university of technology all while getting federal funds from multiple agencies the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar theeconomic calendaris a big one including several of the most important economic reports both ism manufacturing and services and the monthly jobs reports there will be plenty to analyze we ll also get another 20 or so of the s p 500 earnings reports the iowa democratic caucuses will take place on monday the first actual voting in the 2020 presidential race the president will deliver the state of the union address on tuesday with the impeachment vote scheduled for wednesday until there is more information on coronavirus containment that issue will remain front and center briefing com has a good u s economic calendarfor the week here are the main u s releases next week s theme with so much going on anything might turn out to be a theme for the week often it would be the employment data or corporate earnings how can anything top impeachment and the first part of the 2020 election as topics the market will get around to those topics but first comes the need to reduce uncertainty how should investors evaluate the spreading novel coronavirus is it a time to sit tight whether in the market or note is it a time to learn something new should it be analysis or paralysis background as always a new worry generates a new bundle of experts to help us a close look often shows that these are old experts who now claim knowledge of a new field many of them have strong opinions about your investments i spent most of the week learning from some experts who were new to me i then pieced together a series of points that covers the key questions as you will see it is not specific advice but it should be a good guide to your own analysis viewpoints determining the facts the source of the coronavirus and transmission from animals this is a great interview with ecohealth alliance president peter daszak researchers are working on the source whether it is evolving and the size of the ultimate threat the scientist an example just one of the detailed work being done new england journal of medicine how fast can it spread here is the comparison to mers there is now a report of the first death outside china more countries adopt border restrictions here are the key factors on how bad it might get nyt this is a very good background article covering contagion how deadly how long for symptoms amount of travel by those infected evaluation of a response and the chances for a vaccine the article has some great graphics showing the results of various models much depends upon how many people are infected by each new case barron s reports on a model that zeroes in on china s ability to quarantine its infected population if china can effectively quarantine its infected population by march cascend s model forecasts as few as 30 000 people will be infected with 13 500 deaths that is a lot of people but as the cascend report notes the common flu kills 35 000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200 000 in the u s alone if the infected population isn t quarantined by september however the number of infected people could reach 800 000 lifting the death toll to 200 000 the figures could reach 2 3 million infections and 600 000 deaths if the world can t quarantine the infected population by the end of 2020 who is best prepared statista even though chinese authorities have said that they have observed evidence of person to person transmission health officials in orange and la countries in the united states have said that the precautions in place should stop any spread of the coronavirus that raises the question which countries are the most and least prepared to contain large outbreaks of disease promoting fear are people collapsing in the street snopes the heisenberg highlights joe weisenthal who caught an important bogus news report released when bond yields were already declining the fear trade is alive and kickin writes mike williams he writes about the noise about this latest monster and a possible recession will add to the worries that fuel market rallies claiming victory any pundit who has predicted a market crash is warning that this is the start you have already been bombarded with these stories so i will not cite any finding a bright side could there possibly be a bright side to this deadly disease one official had this to say in response to a question from maria bartiromo well first of all every american s heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus so i don t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate very malignant disease ross said in response to her point but the fact is it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain on top of all the other things because you had sars you had the african swine virus there now you have this he added ross said the virus is another risk factor that people need to take into account and he then made that prediction about north american jobs you really can t make this stuff up help from the fed i saw several articles wondering what the fed would do to deal with the crisis amazing apparently some believe in the need for a third fed mandate meanwhile the expectation of more rate cuts increased economic implications the general news summary is that the virus will weaken chinese economic growth and that will weaken the rest of the world this story does a great job of providing anecdotes to make the case persuasive but it does not help much with a quantitative handle on the problem employees closings supply chain problems all true impulse buys and trips are lost to the economy forever other items are merely delayed one estimate is that the economic impact will exceed the 40 billion attributed to sars mostly because the chinese economy is larger investment implications there are many sources suggesting a stock price decline art hogan cnbc says the market could pull back 3 5 because stocks are relatively priced for perfection and you tend to have a bit of an overreaction to bad news or in line news when that happens paul schatz says the unsurprising pullback has established a new trading range what

it would be aswath damodaran s an ode to luck revisiting my tesla valuation prof damodaran s analyses are always rigorous with a lesson about methods in addition to useful information about the company this post is especially interesting because he has been on both sides of the investment debate about this popular stock first lesson he warns against the dangers of bias when investing i am often my own biggest adversary handicapped by the preconceptions and priors that i bring into analysis and decision making and no company epitomizes the dangers of bias more than tesla it is a company where there is no middle ground with the optimists believing that there is no limit to its potential and the pessimists convinced that it is a time bomb destined to implode i have tried without much luck to navigate the middle ground in my valuations of the company and have been found wanting by both sides for much of tesla s life i have pointed to its promise but argued that it was too richly priced to be a good investment and during that period tesla bulls accused me of working for the short sellers they did not believe me when i argued that you could like a company for its vision and potential and not like it as an investment when i bought tesla in june 2019 arguing that the price had dropped enough to 180 to make it a good investment they became my allies but that decision led to a backlash from tesla bears who labeled me a traitor for abandoning my position again not accepting my argument that at the right price i would buy any company i would love to chalk it to my expert timing but luck was on my side the momentum shifted right after i bought and the stock has not stopped rising since when tesla s earnings reported its earnings yesterday january 29th the stock was trading at 581 before jumping to 650 in after market trading it is time to revisit my valuation and reassess my holding he describes his first valuation when it was a story stock he highlighted the

timing was lucky next he analyzes the improvements that he can put in his spreadsheet model some relate to company performance while others reflect external markets e g lower interest rates he then does a sensitivity analysis showing which of the factors was most important in the new estimate lesson four maintain rigor when evaluating your winners finally he contemplates the valuation reached 427 and the price post earnings 650 that is in the 90th percentile of his value distribution like most investors he likes to hold his winners and he thinks about taxes could he hold out until june when it would become a long term gain no he sold at 640 lesson five don t let tax considerations stop you when it is right to sell stock ideas chuck carnevale highlights the top three medical distributors he sees strong fundamentals he also provides a great lesson on how to find and monitor stocks like this he accurately notes the list of questions that the investor should ask drawing upon his invaluable fastgraphs analysis he concludes from the above screenshots each of these dominant medical distributors are clearly trading at significant discounts to their fundamental values and their historical norms moreover this also suggests that as i previously stated it is sector rather than company specific the negative sentiment surrounding these companies despite good fundamentals are related to the opioid epidemic and not too weak business results consequently we might initially want to look at what the potential liability that each company might face he goes on to consider

thousands of companies 15 000 to 20 000 globally international small caps have a first rate opportunity in the years ahead it s like the small cap world was in the late 1980s domestically with a long

randomly picked a trading day for the dow jones industrial average since 1970 there is a 95 chance that the market would close lower on some other trading day in the future this means that only 1 out

cnn president donald trump made 44 false claims last week 30 of them in a press conference and two interviews during his two day trip to the world economic forum in davos switzerland trump made 16 false claims about ukraine 13 about impeachment and nine about the economy he made 12 false claims in his davos press conference he added 10 in his interview with maria bartiromo of fox business and eight in his interview with joe kernen of cnbc while 44 false claims in one week would be a lot for most politicians it is below trump s average of about 60 false claims per week since july 8 when we started tracking this data at cnn the week we re discussing here from january 20 through january 26 ranks 22nd out of the 29 weeks we have tracked trump is now up to 1 729 false claims since july 8 the most egregious false claim obama and trade trump who frequently seems to have his predecessor on his mind for no particular reason is fond of claiming he has managed to do things president barack obama could not whether or not obama actually failed to do these things last week touting his trade discussions with the european union trump said at the davos press conference they haven t wanted to negotiate with past presidents but they re going to negotiate with me he continued later our country wanted to make a deal under president obama the eu refused to talk to him the european union didn t only talk to obama on trade it engaged in three years of extensive though unsuccessful negotiations with obama s administration on a proposed free trade agreement the transatlantic trade and investment partnership the most revealing false claim manufacturing jobs the economy has added 487 000 manufacturing jobs under trump manufacturing job growth slowed significantly in 2019 with a total gain of just 29 000 jobs from january through december but the president still has a pretty good true story to tell here instead trump often chooses to spout fiction he said in a speech to mayors last week we ve created 700 000 manufacturing jobs trump has consistently exaggerated manufacturing job growth and as the actual number of jobs created has continued to grow he has continually increased the inaccurate figure he uses when the actual number was around 350 000 he said it was almost 500 000 when it was just over 400 000 he said it was 600 000 the most absurd false claim trump s lying trump noted at the davos press conference that he had opposed the impeachment of president bill clinton he mused though that clinton did a lot of bad things such as a lot of lying fair enough but then trump said the following with a straight face now with me there s no lying we beg to differ here s this week s full list of 44 false claims starting with the ones we haven t previously included in one of these weekly roundups impeachment trump s lying trump said of his opposition to clinton s impeachment but in a certain way i was sticking up for clinton for bill clinton i mean what he did was nothing good there was a lot of lying going on there were a lot of things a lot of bad things now with me there s no lying there s no nothing january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first trump s claim that with me there s no lying is itself clearly false he has been so broadly dishonest about ukraine and impeachment that we were able to compile a list of 65 different false claims he had made on the subject john bolton and the democrats they didn t want john bolton and others in the house they were in too much of a rush now they want them all in the senate not supposed to be that way january 20 tweet facts first trump can criticize house democrats for being in too much of a rush with their impeachment inquiry to subpoena bolton trump s former national security adviser but it s not true that they didn t want bolton democrats asked bolton on october 30 to testify voluntarily on november 7 he declined to appear because trump s white house directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry democrats decided against issuing a subpoena because they were concerned about the possibility of a lengthy court battle you can read a full fact check here what happened after trump released the transcript when schiff made up the phony story and he repeated it to congress and the world and it was a totally phony story then i released the transcript when we released that conversation all hell broke out with the democrats because they say wait a minute this is much different than shifty schiff told us january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first as we have repeatedly noted trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky before not after house intelligence chairman adam schiff delivered an exaggerated rendition of the call at a committee meeting when trump released the transcript therefore democrats did not say it was different than what schiff had said a fox news poll on the impeachment trial majority of people say the u s senate already has enough information foxnews january 26 tweet facts first the fox news poll trump appeared to be referencing found that 48 of people questioned said the senate already has enough information to make its decision on trump s articles of impeachment versus 44 who said the senate needs to hear more witness testimony forty eight to 44 is a plurality not a majority accomplishments mark zuckerberg s white house visit and mark zuckerberg was in the white house two weeks ago and he said you re number one on facebook january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first zuckerberg the chairman and chief executive officer of facebook has not been to the white house since a dinner with trump there in october about three months prior to this trump claim facebook spokesman dave arnold told cnn arnold declined to comment on what zuckerberg said to trump and trump wasn t clear what he meant by number one trump has a long history of moving past events closer to the present intentionally or unintentionally the individual mandate and obamacare we ve done well with health care anyway we got rid of the individual mandate and if you look at that that was a big thing with obamacare that was the end of obamacare january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first the individual mandate which required americans to obtain health insurance was indeed a key part of obamacare but it was not the end of obamacare when republicans repealed the mandate in their 2017 tax bill key components of obamacare remain the bill did not eliminate obamacare s expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low income people the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases while trump continued to take other steps to weaken obamacare much of it still exists obama the european union and trade trump said he was going to start negotiating a trade deal with the president of the european commission then added they haven t wanted to negotiate with past presidents but they re going to negotiate with me he also said our country wanted to make a deal under president obama the eu refused to talk to him january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first it s not true that the european union refused to talk to obama about trade in fact the european union engaged in three years of negotiations with the obama administration on a possible us eu free trade agreement the transatlantic trade and investment partnership the negotiations faltered in 2016 michael bloomberg and hillary clinton but he bloomberg had a deal with hillary clinton that he was going to become secretary of state it was very simple people know that and it wasn t going to happen it was going to go to terry mcauliffe i mean so they were playing with michael january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen facts first there is no evidence clinton had a deal to give the secretary of state post to either bloomberg the former new york city mayor now running for the democratic presidential nomination or mcauliffe the former governor of virginia trump may have been basing his claim on a hacked 2015 email exchange released by wikileaks in 2016 clinton adviser neera tanden asked bloomberg adviser howard wolfson about a media report about some democrats having approached bloomberg to run against clinton in the 2016 election as the new york post reported wolfson responded that the idea was laughable tanden soon asked what role bloomberg might want in a clinton administration saying is like ambassador of china way too small wolfson responded secty of state which ain t gonna happen tanden then forwarded the exchange to clinton campaign chairman john podesta but the emails do not show any kind of deal bloomberg s campaign did not respond this week to a request for comment tanden told cnn this week there was absolutely no deal period it was a random email from me to a good friend who works for him tanden said she has never even heard any discussions about mcauliffe as secretary of state like ever at cnn s request chris bolling executive director of mcauliffe political action committee common good va put trump s claim to mcauliffe then quickly called back laughing he said mcauliffe had said i would love to be secretary of state but i had no deal to be secretary of sate the length of drug trials praising china for cracking down on illegal fentanyl trump said china s quick trials last merely one day he continued ours take 15 years theirs take one day january 24 speech to mayors facts first trump might have been intending this as non literal hyperbole but nonetheless us drug trials do not last 15 years even the trial of drug lord joaquin el chapo guzman took three months china s legal system of course affords few rights to accused people almost all of whom are swiftly convicted in the us some cases last longer than others and appeals can extend the process but veteran lawyers said trump was way off kenyen brown a former us attorney in alabama who now has a private litigation practice said trump s comment was hyperbole to the point of being ridiculous the typical possession with intent to distribute or drug conspiracy federal drug trial concludes after two to three days tops of course there are outliers in a few more complicated cases but the president s comment is nonsensical he said in an email trump was exaggerating even if he was describing the timeline for an entire case not just the trial alone president trump s statement is a gross exaggeration and it is not true said david haas a former federal prosecutor in florida who is now a criminal defense lawyer and has represented people accused of drug trafficking most federal cases are resolved either by plea or trial within months of being filed that length can vary but it would be unusual for any federal case to be pending longer than 12 18 months repeats here are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup impeachment the timing of schiff s comments remember this when schiff made up the phony story and he repeated it to congress and the world and it was a totally phony story then i released the transcript and we have people that are corrupt like adam schiff who misquotes i don t mean misquotes makes up a statement he had no idea that i was going to release the transcript he never thought i d do that and for that i thank the president of ukraine because we got their approval he had no idea i was going to do that january 22 press conference in davos switzerland it was so bad where he goes before congress and he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo it s a fraud i watched schiff prior to this he wouldn t say it now can t but he tried to make up a statement that i made that s why i released the transcript january 24 interview with fox news raymond arroyo facts first trump can reasonably criticize schiff for schiff s comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september as we ve written before schiff s mix of near quotes from trump s phone call with zelensky his own analysis and supposed parody was at the very least confusing but schiff spoke the day after trump released the rough transcript not before trump released the transcript schiff s comments and the law shifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call more january 26 tweet facts first schiff s words were not illegal as trump previously acknowledged the constitution includes a specific provision that gives members of congress immunity from legal jeopardy for comments during official meetings marie yovanovitch and trump s portrait but i am not a fan of that ambassador just so you understand from what i understand and i heard this a long time ago she wouldn t put my picture up january 24 interview with fox news raymond arroyo facts first there is no evidence that yovanovitch refused to hang trump s photo at the us embassy in ukraine it took the trump administration more than nine months after his inauguration to distribute an official photo of trump to government buildings such as embassies cnbc reported in 2017 more than seven months into the term the white house told the washington post that trump had not yet sat for the photo a state department official who has recently served in kiev said the former ambassador never sought to prevent trump s photo from being put up at the embassy the official said the photo did not arrive until late 2017 yovanovitch s legal team did not respond to cnn s request for comment but nbc received this response from a person connected to her legal team the embassy in kyiv hung the official photographs of the president vice president and secretary of state as soon as they arrived from washington d c the timing of aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo so they got the money in fact they got it very early january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen now here s the other thing they got their money long before schedule they got all their money january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first the aid to ukraine did not arrive early or before schedule while trump did lift his freeze on the aid on september 11 more than two weeks before a september 30 legal deadline the delay caused by trump s freeze meant that 35 million of the 391 million in aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline according to impeachment testimony from mark sandy deputy associate director for national security in the office of management and budget to deal with this problem congress had to pass an extension of the deadline had that provision not been included then any unobligated funds as of september 30 would have expired sandy testified the government accountability office a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for congress concluded that the aid freeze broke a law the impoundment control act the office s report was released the week after trump made this comment you can read a full story here the whistleblowers disappearing there was supposed to be a second whistleblower what happened to him there was supposed to be an informer what happened to the informer all of these people disappeared and when they saw this transcript they said we got problems but they went ahead because they were already there because they they had a phony concocted story made up january 22 press conference in davos switzerland the second whistleblower who vanished after i released the transcripts january 23 tweet facts first there is no evidence that either the second whistleblower or a source for the first whistleblower whom trump calls the informer have disappeared much less that they said we got problems when trump released the rough transcript of the july call with zelensky the second whistleblower s lawyers had always said that this person who was revealed after trump released the rough transcript never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint merely to offer corroborating information in private the whistleblowers have not vanished bradley moss a colleague of mark zaid a lawyer for the two whistleblowers said on twitter in october when trump made another version of this claim european aid to ukraine what nobody says this is very important to me why isn t germany paying why isn t uk paying why isn t france paying why aren t the european nations paying why is it always the sucker united states that s one january 22 press conference in davos switzerland but i want to make sure also in addition to collusion there s something else i m always stressing why isn t germany and france and uk and all these other countries in europe that are much more affected than us why aren t they paying something january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first european countries including france and germany have provided hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assistance to ukraine since russia s invasion in 2014 zelensky acknowledged european help during his meeting with trump at the united nations in september though he said the world s efforts had been inadequate so far and i m sorry but we don t need help we need support real support and we thank thank everybody thank all of the european countries they each help us but we also want to have more more you can read a full fact check here people talking about trump s calls with ukraine s president and i watched they don t talk about my conversation they don t talk about my transcripts and when we have the head of the world trade organization here and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect that nobody talks about i never see them talking about the transcription i never see them talking about the call because there s nothing to say january 22 press conference in davos switzerland i had a first call which was perfect and i had a second call which was perfect you notice they don t mention the calls though they never mention the calls they talk about everything but the calls january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen facts first to the contrary trump s call with ukraine s president was the subject of widespread discussion among members of congress and in the media at the time it was a central focus of democrats impeachment push rep al green s comments as congressman green said al green he s a beauty as congressman green said we got to beat him by impeachment because we can t beat him in the election january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first trump was at least slightly exaggerating green s comments in may green said this i m concerned that if we don t impeach this president he will get reelected in september when trump previously claimed green had said we can t beat trump without impeachment green told cnn i never said we can t beat the president obama s aid to ukraine president obama gave them nothing he gave them pillows and sheets and things like that and i gave them tank busters january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen facts first obama did refuse to provide lethal aid to ukraine but he didn t send mere pillows and sheets he sent counter mortar radars drones armored humvees and night vision devices among other things you can read a full fact check here what ukrainian leaders said there was one call which was perfect and then there was a second call i guess a couple of months later which was perfect the president of ukraine said it was perfect the foreign minister of ukraine said it was perfect so if we have a transcription we have the call and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first ukraine s president and foreign minister have made comments that bolster trump s argument that he did not pressure ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive us military aid but the president and foreign minister have never called the phone call perfect the foreign minister vadym prystaiko has said i have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance according to reuters citing russian news service interfax and prystaiko has said trump s july phone call with zelensky was friendly and that i think there was no pressure zelensky did say there had been no pressure from trump and made other statements to that effect but he has not gone so far as to say trump did nothing wrong in an interview published by time magazine in early december zelensky did say look i never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo that s not my thing but zelensky continued i don t want us to look like beggars but you have to understand we re at war if you re our strategic partner then you can t go blocking anything for us i think that s just about fairness it s not about a quid pro quo it just goes without saying the accuracy of the whistleblower in a january 23 tweet trump referred to the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with ukraine as the fake whistleblower facts first the whistleblower s allegations have been proven highly accurate in fact the rough transcript released by trump himself showed that the whistleblower s primary allegations about his call with zelensky were correct you can read a full fact check here immigration mexican soldiers and the border mexico has been terrific mexico has given us 27 000 soldiers at our southern border january 24 speech to mayors facts first mexico has deployed around 27 000 troops but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular cnn reported on november 2 nearly 15 000 troops are deployed to mexico s northern border where they ve set up 20 checkpoints mexican defense minister luis cresencio sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country s security strategy at the southern border 12 000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints acting us customs and border protection commissioner mark morgan has offered similar numbers telling reporters in september that 10 000 of approximately 25 000 troops were on mexico s southern border economy and trade manufacturing jobs i ve created almost 700 000 manufacturing jobs january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen and we ve created 700 000 manufacturing jobs january 24 speech to mayors facts first trump was exaggerating the economy added 487 000 manufacturing jobs between january 2017 when trump took office and december 2019 official data shows the number is 514 000 jobs added if you go back to november 2016 the month of trump s election as trump often likes to do what obama said about manufacturing jobs i ve created almost 700 000 manufacturing jobs the past administration said manufacturing is dead which i said tell me about that how do you you can t do that january 22 interview with cnbc s joe kernen a lot of that goes to farmers and manufacturers and we ve created 700 000 manufacturing jobs which we were told by past administrations but one in particular that you would never have manufacturing jobs i would say you have to be i mean how can you not have manufacturing jobs so we re at 700 000 manufacturing jobs january 24 speech to mayors facts first trump s comments appeared to refer to a remark obama made at a pbs town hall in 2016 but he was inaccurately describing what obama said obama scoffed at trump s promises to bring back what obama called jobs of the past without providing specifics on how he would do so contrary to trump s claims though obama didn t say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency saying we actually make more stuff have a bigger manufacturing base today than we ve had in most of our history why the european union was formed but we find i find that the european union is tougher to deal with than anybody they ve taken advantage of our country for many many years it was actually formed for the purpose of taking advantage of the united states if you really think about it january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first experts on the european union say it was not formed to take advantage of the united states the president s claims are preposterous the european communities forerunner of the eu were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint us western european plan to stabilize and secure western europe and promote prosperity by means of trade liberalization and economic growth throughout the shared transatlantic space desmond dinan a public policy professor at george mason university who is an expert in the history of european integration said in response to a previous version of this claim us presidents have consistently supported european integration efforts the eu was launched in 1993 on the shoulders of the european communities to promote peace and prosperity in the post cold war era an era also of rapid globalization american officials may have had their doubts about the feasibility of monetary union and about the possibility of a common european security and defense policy but the us administration strongly supported further european integration in the 1990s dinan said the trade deficit with the european union trump claimed three times that the us has long had a trade deficit with the european union of 150 billion per year or more facts first the trade deficit with the european union was 114 6 billion in 2018 101 2 billion in 2017 92 5 billion in 2016 the deficit was 169 6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services but trump as usual failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure we ll ignore trump s characterization of trade deficits as losses which is sharply disputed by many economists median household income trump claimed twice that median household income has increased by about 10 000 during his presidency he once said over 10 000 a family once said almost a 10 000 increase facts first it s not true that household income gains under trump have already hit 10 000 in less than three years a firm called sentier research found pre tax income gains of about 5 500 between january 2017 and october 2019 you can read a longer fact check here china s economic performance you know they re having the worst year that they ve had in 67 years right january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first china s second quarter gdp growth of 6 2 and third quarter and fourth quarter gdp growth of 6 each were its worst since 1992 27 years ago trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure but he has added additional years for no apparent reason china s agricultural spending the fact is we love our farmers but they were doing the maximum they ever did was 16 billion in one year to china january 24 speech to mayors facts first china spent 25 9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012 according to figures from the department of agriculture highway approval time trump claimed that highways used to take 21 years to get approved but we have that down to two years now and we think we ll have it down to one year january 24 speech to mayors facts first there is no apparent basis for trump s claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways according to the federal highway administration s national environmental policy act nepa page the department s median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018 up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016 at a trump event earlier in january council on environmental quality chairwoman mary neumayr said the council on environmental quality has found that the average time for federal agencies to complete environmental impact statements is four and half years further for highway projects it takes over seven years on average brad karkkainen a university of minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law said in an email that he has never heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years though it s certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years a few projects took twice as long perhaps more he said some projects can sail through much faster than the median time but to suggest as trump does that the typical time has gone from 17 years to two years is just nonsense the electoral college margin in 2016 trump claimed that his electoral college margin of victory in 2016 was 306 to 223 january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first hillary clinton earned 232 votes in the electoral college not 223 this was not a one time slip trump has habitually said 223 air quality we want to have the cleanest water on earth we want to have the cleanest air on earth our numbers as you saw we had record numbers come out very recently our numbers are very very good our environmental numbers our water numbers our our numbers on air are tremendous but we are doing better right now than we ve ever done in terms of cleanliness in terms of numbers january 22 press conference in davos switzerland facts first by several measures us air was cleaner under obama than it has been under trump three of the six types of pollutants identified by the clean air act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before trump took office according to environmental protection agency data additionally there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 799 days across the 35 american cities surveyed by the epa up from 702 though there were significantly more unhealthy air days in obama s first term than there have been in trump s the lowest amount of unhealthy air days 598 occurred in 2014 under obama military spending by nato members well you look at what i did with nato 530 billion more not total more january 22 interview with fox business maria bartiromo facts first trump s math was wrong stoltenberg explained during a meeting with trump on december 3 that non us nato members have added a total of 130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016 by 2024 stoltenberg said this number will increase to 400 billion the 130 billion current increase cannot be added to the 400 billion increase expected by 2024 the 400 billion is a cumulative figure that includes the 130 billion judicial confirmations 191 federal judges a record january 26 tweet facts first trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term according to data from russell wheeler a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments trump had appointed 187 judges as of the day after this tweet two supreme court justices 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges wheeler said it s possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding trump s three appointments to the court of federal claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge though he noted that claims court judges are generally not included in such counts regardless trump did not hold the record at the time president jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges as of the same date in his presidency wheeler said and as a percentage of the federal judiciary trump s 187 appointments represented 21 of all judgeships lower than the percentage for president richard nixon 32 carter 29 and clinton 22 trump did have the record for the total number of appeals court judges appointed wheeler said

on their quarterback i like the parlay of niners and under since i think a victory for them will only come if their defense prevails the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart this week i am featuring investing com s version if you go to the interactive chart online you can see the news behind each of the n callouts the market lost 2 1 for the week the trading range was 2 4 although it felt larger to most observers monday trading was weak the mid week rebound was erased and more on friday in general each decline was attributed to the coronavirus story and the rebounds to the market shrugging it off you can monitor volatility implied volatility and historical comparisons in my weekly indicator snapshot in the quant corner below noteworthy tesla now worth more than ford and gm combined the news each week i break down events into good and bad for our purposes good has two components the news must be market friendly and better than expectations i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news and you should too new deal democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research this report is fact based ndd is consistent with the package of indicators each has a source and often an accompanying chart this week shows that indicators in all time frames remain positive although the short term and most volatile group is only a weak positive read the entire post for ndd s commentary on the specifics mortgage applications were very strong rising 7 2 versus last week s decline of 1 2 the start is even better than last year s excellent performance the good durable goods orders for december increased 2 4 versus expectations of 0 5 and november s downwardly revised loss of 3 1 consumer confidence in january was strong and improving this week i show results from three different survey methods the conference board indicator was 131 6 beating expectations of 128 and the upwardly revised december reading of 128 2 michigan sentiment registered 99 8 beating expectations and december s reading both 99 1 gallup s polling also shows economic confidence at the highest level since 2000 pce prices were roughly in line with expectations with the closely watched core rate up 0 2 gdp increased 2 1 according to the first estimate for q4 2019 this beat estimates of 1 8 and equaled q3 a closer look at the data is less encouraging dr robert dieli shows the contribution of components broken down into core and noncore categories his full report explains why the import contribution is unusual and misleading consumers are doing the heavy lifting he also describes the results in terms of cyclical and non cyclical economic activity the dramatic changes over the course of the year become obvious jill mislinski provides another useful perspective on the rate of economic growth considering gdp per capita she points to the dramatic change in trend at the time of the great recession new home sales for december were 694k saar missing expectations of 725k november was revised lower from 719k to 697k calculated risk points to the year over year results up 23 over december 2018 and the 2019 total up 10 3 from 2018 he notes that comparisons will be fairly easy in the first five months of 2020 but more difficult later the bad pending home sales for december declined 4 9 versus expectations of a gain of 1 0 and november s 1 2 calculated risk also comments on the relationship between new and existing home sales for many years there was a tight relationship following the housing bubble there were many distressed sales bill has consistently followed this distressing gap which persisted as builders focused on more expensive homes that is changing personal income for december increased only 0 2 missing expectations of 0 3 and worse than november s downwardly revised 0 4 once again the year over year viewpoint looks quite different first trust personal income and spending continued to rise in december closing out 2019 on a high note for the year personal income rose a healthy 3 9 while spending increased 5 0 tied for the largest annual increase going back to 2006 within income gains for both december and full year 2019 were led by private sector wages and salaries which rose 0 3 in december and are up 5 5 over the past twelve months incomes were further supplemented in december by a rise in interest income which helped offset a decline in farm proprietors income due to lower subsidy payments from the department of agriculture to farmers impacted by the trade skirmish higher incomes in turn continue to drive spending which rose 0 3 in december purchases picked up for both goods and services as a drop in spending on autos and energy products both gasoline and home utilities fell in december was more than made up for by increased spending on medical care food and recreation the chicago pmi for january registered only 42 9 far below the expected 48 7 and december s downwardly revised 48 2 the earnings beat rate 69 and amount above estimates 4 1 are both somewhat below the average for the last five years factset here is the summary by sector earnings expectations are also declining with 2020 now expected to show a 4 5 year over year increase brian gilmartin the ugly prominent harvard chemist arrested for concealing ties to china the department of justice also released the names of two chinese researchers who allegedly acted against us interests 50 000 per month generous living expenses and 1 5 million to establish a research lab at wuhan university of technology all while getting federal funds from multiple agencies the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar theeconomic calendaris a big one including several of the most important economic reports both ism manufacturing and services and the monthly jobs reports there will be plenty to analyze we ll also get another 20 or so of the s p 500 earnings reports the iowa democratic caucuses will take place on monday the first actual voting in the 2020 presidential race the president will deliver the state of the union address on tuesday with the impeachment vote scheduled for wednesday until there is more information on coronavirus containment that issue will remain front and center briefing com has a good u s economic calendarfor the week here are the main u s releases next week s theme with so much going on anything might turn out to be a theme for the week often it would be the employment data or corporate earnings how can anything top impeachment and the first part of the 2020 election as topics the market will get around to those topics but first comes the need to reduce uncertainty how should investors evaluate the spreading novel coronavirus is it a time to sit tight whether in the market or note is it a time to learn something new should it be analysis or paralysis background as always a new worry generates a new bundle of experts to help us a close look often shows that these are old experts who now claim knowledge of a new field many of them have strong opinions about your investments i spent most of the week learning from some experts who were new to me i then pieced together a series of points that covers the key questions as you will see it is not specific advice but it should be a good guide to your own analysis viewpoints determining the facts the source of the coronavirus and transmission from animals this is a great interview with ecohealth alliance president peter daszak researchers are working on the source whether it is evolving and the size of the ultimate threat the scientist an example just one of the detailed work being done new england journal of medicine how fast can it spread here is the comparison to mers there is now a report of the first death outside china more countries adopt border restrictions here are the key factors on how bad it might get nyt this is a very good background article covering contagion how deadly how long for symptoms amount of travel by those infected evaluation of a response and the chances for a vaccine the article has some great graphics showing the results of various models much depends upon how many people are infected by each new case barron s reports on a model that zeroes in on china s ability to quarantine its infected population if china can effectively quarantine its infected population by march cascend s model forecasts as few as 30 000 people will be infected with 13 500 deaths that is a lot of people but as the cascend report notes the common flu kills 35 000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200 000 in the u s alone if the infected population isn t quarantined by september however the number of infected people could reach 800 000 lifting the death toll to 200 000 the figures could reach 2 3 million infections and 600 000 deaths if the world can t quarantine the infected population by the end of 2020 who is best prepared statista even though chinese authorities have said that they have observed evidence of person to person transmission health officials in orange and la countries in the united states have said that the precautions in place should stop any spread of the coronavirus that raises the question which countries are the most and least prepared to contain large outbreaks of disease promoting fear are people collapsing in the street snopes the heisenberg highlights joe weisenthal who caught an important bogus news report released when bond yields were already declining the fear trade is alive and kickin writes mike williams he writes about the noise about this latest monster and a possible recession will add to the worries that fuel market rallies claiming victory any pundit who has predicted a market crash is warning that this is the start you have already been bombarded with these stories so i will not cite any finding a bright side could there possibly be a bright side to this deadly disease one official had this to say in response to a question from maria bartiromo well first of all every american s heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus so i don t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate very malignant disease ross said in response to her point but the fact is it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain on top of all the other things because you had sars you had the african swine virus there now you have this he added ross said the virus is another risk factor that people need to take into account and he then made that prediction about north american jobs you really can t make this stuff up help from the fed i saw several articles wondering what the fed would do to deal with the crisis amazing apparently some believe in the need for a third fed mandate meanwhile the expectation of more rate cuts increased economic implications the general news summary is that the virus will weaken chinese economic growth and that will weaken the rest of the world this story does a great job of providing anecdotes to make the case persuasive but it does not help much with a quantitative handle on the problem employees closings supply chain problems all true impulse buys and trips are lost to the economy forever other items are merely delayed one estimate is that the economic impact will exceed the 40 billion attributed to sars mostly because the chinese economy is larger investment implications there are many sources suggesting a stock price decline art hogan cnbc says the market could pull back 3 5 because stocks are relatively priced for perfection and you tend to have a bit of an overreaction to bad news or in line news when that happens paul schatz says the unsurprising pullback has established a new trading range what about a vaccine a vaccine is at least a year away stat one problem is that the financial models for drug development do not promote vaccine research summary it is easier to answer in the negative what should investors not do become paralyzed react blindly to sources with no insight we need more facts and we ll have them soon i ll describe my own approach to this difficult question in today s final thought quant corner and risk analysis i have a rule for my investment clients think first about your risk only then should you consider possible rewards i monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update featuring the indicator snapshot both long term and short term technical indicators remain neutral but deteriorated significantly during the week the c score remains in a zone which suggests that we watch for confirming data like others we don t see much of that the yield curve flattening will show up in the indicator next week the featured sources bob dieli business cycle analysis via the c score georg vrba business cycle indicator and market timing tools the most recent update of georg s business cycle index does not signal recession brian gilmartin all things earnings for the overall market as well as many individual companies doug short and jill mislinski regular updating of an array of indicators great charts and analysis given the fresh data it is time for an update of the big four guest sources gdp expectations are drifting lower so much for the january barometer cnbc don t worry the lesson will be forgotten by next year meanwhile i am cheering for the niners and that super bowl indicator insight for investors investors should understand and embrace volatility they should join my delight in a well documented list of worries as the worries are addressed or even resolved the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely best of the week if i had to recommend a single must read article for this week it would be aswath damodaran s an ode to luck revisiting my tesla valuation prof damodaran s analyses are always rigorous with a lesson about methods in addition to useful information about the company this post is especially interesting because he has been on both sides of the investment debate about this popular stock first lesson he warns against the dangers of bias when investing i am often my own biggest adversary handicapped by the preconceptions and priors that i bring into analysis and decision making and no company epitomizes the dangers of bias more than tesla it is a company where there is no middle ground with the optimists believing that there is no limit to its potential and the pessimists convinced that it is a time bomb destined to implode i have tried without much luck to navigate the middle ground in my valuations of the company and have been found wanting by both sides for much of tesla s life i have pointed to its promise but argued that it was too richly priced to be a good investment and during that period tesla bulls accused me of working for the short sellers they did not believe me when i argued that you could like a company for its vision and potential and not like it as an investment when i bought tesla in june 2019 arguing that the price had dropped enough to 180 to make it a good investment they became my allies but that decision led to a backlash from tesla bears who labeled me a traitor for abandoning my position again not accepting my argument that at the right price i would buy any company i would love to chalk it to my expert timing but luck was on my side the momentum shifted right after i bought and the stock has not stopped rising since when tesla s earnings reported its earnings yesterday january 29th the stock was trading at 581 before jumping to 650 in after market trading it is time to revisit my valuation and reassess my holding he describes his first valuation when it was a story stock he highlighted the debt created a distribution of outcomes and put in a limit order to buy at 180 you can download his spreadsheet from the post second lesson don t pick a specific target price look at a range of outcomes his buy point was almost the very bottom was his spreadsheet that good lesson three don t mistake dumb luck for skill he describes several factors that combined for a turnaround but the timing was lucky next he analyzes the improvements that he can put in his spreadsheet model some relate to company performance while others reflect external markets e g lower interest rates he then does a sensitivity analysis showing which of the factors was most important in the new estimate lesson four maintain rigor when evaluating your winners finally he contemplates the valuation reached 427 and the price post earnings 650 that is in the 90th percentile of his value distribution like most investors he likes to hold his winners and he thinks about taxes could he hold out until june when it would become a long term gain no he sold at 640 lesson five don t let tax considerations stop you when it is right to sell stock ideas chuck carnevale highlights the top three medical distributors he sees strong fundamentals he also provides a great lesson on how to find and monitor stocks like this he accurately notes the list of questions that the investor should ask drawing upon his invaluable fastgraphs analysis he concludes from the above screenshots each of these dominant medical distributors are clearly trading at significant discounts to their fundamental values and their historical norms moreover this also suggests that as i previously stated it is sector rather than company specific the negative sentiment surrounding these companies despite good fundamentals are related to the opioid epidemic and not too weak business results consequently we might initially want to look at what the potential liability that each company might face he goes on to consider that question chuck remains one of the greatest sources of ideas and analytic methods how about netflix nflx beth kindig does her typical great job of analyzing the company its market and its competitors you will get an important lesson from reading the post time to buy she expects a better opportunity and eventual expansion to new markets james hanshaw provides an excellent description of the growing use of hydrogen as a fuel he reviews the history the current push for this environment friendly approach and the overall potential he even provides a specific idea linde lin how about

look ready to rebound and the move could be global chuck royce says did you know this the top two names in the s p 500 index have a combined market cap of 2 67 trillion the total market cap of the russell 2000 was 2 5 trillion at the end of 2019 when u s prosecutors were talking this summer about what they should do about facebook alphabet s google and amazon it was a powerful moment there will be more government scrutiny another bubble in the past five years has been the assets that passive investing attracted much of that has gone into large caps we didn t have this or zero interest rates in past periods and here is a good perspective on long term events and the proper time frame there is a high possibility of active managers in small caps doing well we are coming out of a low rate environment we aren t going to have rates go from 5 to 1 5 again more research people have dropped out of the small cap world there has been shrinkage with fewer initial public offerings but there are thousands of companies 15 000 to 20 000 globally international small caps have a first rate opportunity in the years ahead it s like the small cap world was in the late 1980s domestically with a long runway to come we also have the luxury of looking very long term it is one of the few remaining things that we can do in a cool way time arbitrage we are able to take advantage of what the market thinks today and what we think is happening five years from now more information on faang or faangm as the membership changes market timing nick maggiulli writes why market timing can be so appealing he asks why hoarding cash to buy dips is such a seductive idea despite the overwhelming evidence against its success one answer is that the ideas is usually right watch out for for example if you randomly picked a trading day for the dow jones industrial average since 1970 there is a 95 chance that the market would close lower on some other trading day in the future this means that only 1 out of every 20 trading days i e 1 a month closes at a price that will never be seen again only 1 in 20 trading days offers an absolute bargain read the full post to see how little perfect knowledge of bottoms which of course we don t have improves a dollar cost averaging approach final thought the coronavirus is an unusual test for investors but not unique the real challenge is to avoid a trap especially on this sort of issue there is nothing you can learn from the market action the message of the market is distorted in this modern trading era here are the steps algorithms trained on past market reactions react to key words human traders observe and participate in the moves intra day stories jump on the market move imputing deep significance regardless of facts or the size of the move nightly news stories needing an explanation for what happened grab the nearest handy narrative this is a market of noise not message there is an eventual verdict of course but we don t see it in this time frame great rotation hint of the week for those unwilling to do the work on individual stocks you can get part of the bang for your buck on well chosen etfs michael a gayed nominates the vanguard mid cap etf vo if you want to outperform the market i think you have to find sectors or investments that have been under owned and underperformed for several years the most likely way to beat the market is to invest smartly in things that will have a reversion back to the mean one glaring sector i have found in my research that needs to be highly owned is the mid cap sector and a great way to get invested in it is the vanguard mid cap etf vo my plan find the key variables and react accordingly i need to know the rate of transmission i need to know how well containment plans are working we ll know both pretty soon i then need to estimate the economic impact if it is a one time one month hit mostly on the chinese economy it is a temporary and modest hit if the virus affects many workers consumers and commerce around the world it will be longer and more significant this is an important issue but action is not urgent i have time to learn but i need to seek out expert sources of the type i cited today knowing how to find real experts is an important investment skill my default strategy remains one of taking advantage of volatility with more information available soon i am buying

by michael r czinkota after signing the united states mexico canada agreement and phase 1 of the china trade deal u s president donald trump has now moved his international trade focus onto one of the closest u s allies the european union during the world economic forum in davos switzerland he proposed tariffs on auto imports from the eu on wines cheese yogurt and handbags from france and on whiskies from ireland the international trade policy efforts by trump are remindful of president ronald reagan both presidents are stars of the republican party and very frowned upon by democrats trump and reagan were focused on reducing the u s trade deficit and increasing the global competitiveness of u s industry a look onto the past will provide a better understanding on whether trump s bold approach to trade policy wins over reagan s more sedate procedures the 1980s the u s trade deficit was significant and growing precipitously in the early reagan years it averaged 30 billion and reached 123 billion by late 1984 reagan s preference for free trade contributed to the administration s initial lassitude on this deficit gradually however calls for protectionism emerged examples were the u s automotive and footwear industries even clothespins were considered by some worthy of protection against foreign imports in response reagan signed the trade and tariff act of 1984 to reduce unfair global trade practices there were also additional efforts to increase exports reagan announced bilateral trade agreements with israel and later with canada new rules were implemented to ease u s trade with china yet the trade deficit continued to rise and reached 148 billion in 1985 the final major trade legislation of the reagan administration was the omnibus and competitiveness act of 1988 which authorized negotiations in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and required the u s trade representative to take aggressive corrective action against countries that had large trade surpluses with the u s the end of the reagan years coincided with a sharp rise in globalization forces the emergence of new technologies in transportation communications and information dramatically lowered the costs of international business and marked a rise of worldwide competition trade policy after 2016 similar to reagan trump has focused on fair trade some consider his approach more aggressive and populist trump ignited a new fervor in international trade policy his tariffs have been imposed rapidly and often with little debate his style has managed to concentrate the focus of trade partners the constantly hammered message says trade is now important to the u s trump has argued consistently that the u s has been ignored or treated unfairly for decades in trade related matters he has pushed an america first policy with no more ongoing global support from the u s he renegotiated the north american free trade agreement nafta withdrew from the trans pacific partnership tpp as well as criticized major companies such as carrier ford and mondelez for selecting their production location without patriotic consideration trump tariffs of 2018 covered about 304 billion of imports into the u s together with other forms of protection they have had limited effects on the u s trade deficit some countries filed formal complaints against the u s with the world trade organization wto trump responded by threatening corrective measures against the wto if u s interests were not considered comparing reagan and trump reagan s policy endeavors were initially quite modest but became more assertive over time efforts sought to reduce the growing u s trade deficit with japan and bolster american industrial exports trump s trade deficit is significantly larger both in real and relative terms trump s policy uses more harsh aggressive and clear approaches stating his expectations and demands as well as reflecting the consequences of nonconformity efforts by both the reagan and trump administrations to level the playing field have met with insufficient success the powers of china and emerging markets are rising american influence around the world should not become precarious the time is right for further enlightened action on international trade countries need to understand the drivers of u s policy which requires embracement of new approaches new linkages and new leadership directions for an entirely new era professor michael czinkota teaches international marketing and business at georgetown university his most recent book is in search for the soul of international business 2019 he served as deputy assistant secretary in the u s department of commerce in the reagan and bush administrations japan today
bloomberg opinion outside china thailand has the largest number of patients infected by the novel coronavirus unfortunately the export reliant 500 billion economy southeast asia s second largest was sickly even before the outbreak of the pneumonia like illness that reflects simultaneous blows from the sino u s trade war the worst drought in decades and a stubbornly strong currency add in beijing s newly imposed restrictions on chinese travelers who account for the lion s share of arrivals plus the knock on effect on other tourists and a recession begins to look imminent thailand has lagged its southeast asian neighbors for some time while political upheaval has been a major drag there are others too an aging population poor productivity flatlining consumption and hefty household debt the central bank now expects gdp growth of 2 5 for 2019 that s considerably worse than even lackluster peers like malaysia and indonesia and the country s weakest pace since 2014 the year a military junta took power exports also shrank in 2019 with shipments in the key carmaking industry declining thailand is a regional hub for vehicle manufacturers like nissan motor co which have been affected by poor demand in major markets such as china then there s the baht the thai currency outperformed last year despite policymakers efforts on the back of a yawning current account surplus weak inflation and near record foreign exchange reserves the baht s recent weakening has been one of the few positive side effects of the coronavirus epidemic in november thailand relaxed rules on capital outflows to ease upward pressure but central bank officials know that too much tinkering in the market could prompt washington to label it a currency manipulator advertisement meanwhile fiscal stimulus including an infrastructure drive was held up by wrangling around the 2020 government budget an interest rate cut this coming week to a record low of 1 looks likely story continues so the year had already started poorly now with 19 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus most of them chinese travelers and the illness spreading fast it looks a whole lot worse in the third quarter the economy expanded only 0 1 compared to the previous three months analysts say fourth quarter numbers reported this month could show a slip into negative territory a further contraction in the first three months of 2020 would put thailand into a technical recession the first and most direct factor is tourism depending on how you measure it the industry accounts for roughly a fifth of thailand s gdp visitor numbers were already depressed by the strong baht which made other tropical destinations cheaper chinese tourists who were supposed to flock back as the impact of a 2018 boat disaster waned were trickling in only slowly that makes china s restrictions to contain the pandemic all the more painful on jan 24 travel agencies were ordered to stop selling tour packages overseas while many more chinese now venture abroad alone roughly half still go with groups thailand s finance ministry warned last wednesday that the virus and related bans could have a three month impact meaning 400 000 fewer visitors tourism authorities have forecast an even steeper chinese drop for thailand that s more than a peak season blow china accounts for the largest number of visitors some 11 million traveled last year according to thai authorities they also splurge more per head than any other nationality amounting to an estimated total of almost 18 billion in 2019 that s just over a quarter of spending by overseas visitors as reported by thailand s tourism authority consider the knock on effect on other nationalities and it becomes clear why citigroup inc analysts have cut their expected increase in tourist numbers for 2020 to 0 5 from 6 5 there are also harder to measure second order impacts like the impact of slower chinese growth on the wider region on global growth and on trade consumption will suffer the experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome which brought the region to its knees in 2003 offers some consolation back then the most affected economies including hong kong bounced back quickly by august 2003 hong kong arrivals were back at pre sars levels in part thanks to rules that made it easier for mainland travelers to cross the border china appears to have moved more swiftly this time it is better equipped and this virus appears less deadly but the scale of the epidemic is still hard to measure and both china and tourism account for a far larger slice of thailand s economy than ever before add in a crippling drought and budget troubles have delayed much needed fiscal stimulus to go with lower interest rates thai stocks marked their steepest drop

bloomberg the message from wall street this election season is clear be prepared for surprises even before the first votes are cast monday in iowa investors are bracing for months of uncertainty senator bernie sanders s lead in polling for the state s democratic caucus is signaling an extended primary fight with myriad ups and downs ahead after president donald trump s surprise 2016 victory whipsawed markets no one wants to get caught off guard this time there s been unprecedented levels of equities hedging this early in the election cycle at cboe global markets inc and there are signs that currency traders are sizing up the democratic field and hedging their bets as they weigh the implications for november normally you can have plan a and plan b and now you re going to have plan a through almost z said sean simko global head of fixed income portfolio management at sei investments co there will be multiple plans as there are multiple contenders and each has a similar but different story while markets have been forced to focus in recent weeks mainly on the economic impact of the deadly coronavirus investors say they also need to start prepping for the electoral marathon ahead as they do a handful of themes are prevalent trade policy the bulging federal deficit and taxes trade the focus of trump s trade war has been mainly on china and it produced a phase one deal which the two sides signed last month easing tensions helped push the treasuries yield curve to the steepest in more than a year in december and drove the yuan to a multimonth high in january intensifying virus concerns since then have pummeled china s currency that s added to the uncertainty investors face as they mull whether u s presidential candidates will choose to make exchange rates and renminbi weakness in particular an electoral issue but looking to the next round of trade negotiations the talks may not be any less difficult even if a democrat were to win in november according to invesco s kristina hooper for example sanders s website lays out why he s against most trade agreements while his rival senator elizabeth warren has advocated an approach that departs from pro trade policies of past democratic presidents if we were to get a progressive democrat the u s attitude toward china wouldn t change said hooper invesco s chief global market strategist in new york sanders and warren are protectionist and i believe would take very similar positions that trump has toward china a victory by former vice president joe biden who s perceived to offer a more moderate path than some of his rivals may pressure yields higher on speculation that he might be more inclined than other candidates to roll back tariffs hooper said in national polling for the democratic nomination biden has the lead followed by sanders and warren according to realclear politics averages michael bloomberg is polling fourth he s the founder and majority owner of bloomberg lp the parent company of bloomberg news the top three democratic candidates are leading trump in head to head polls by roughly two or more percentage points according to realclear politics deficits for brad bechtel at jefferies llc in new york there s at least one near certainty an already bulging u s deficit is likely to swell in his view that could spell trouble for the dollar which has gained in five of the last seven years the white house is working on plans for a post election tax cut meanwhile an adviser to sanders says the u s can safely add 500 billion to its deficit which is already poised to exceed 1 trillion without risking a jump in inflation democratic candidates have advanced spending proposals on areas such as climate change infrastructure and education a scenario where a significant fiscal plan emerges combined with a pickup in global growth and trade a prospect that looked more likely before the viral outbreak in china would present a perfect storm for the dollar bechtel said to be sure markets have yet to reach a tipping point on america s swelling budget shortfall despite years of warnings record low yields are within reach even as the treasury is selling historic amounts of debt taxes for zhiwei ren at penn mutual asset management a victory by some of the top democratic candidates risks quicker inflation because the spending increases they advocate may not be funded by sufficient tax increases it matters more if warren or sanders are the candidate from the democratic side because a lot of their policies are extremely inflationary said ren who s firm is based in horsham pennsylvania ten year yields are set to rise if one of these candidates wins the nomination and then november s vote he said of course trump has expanded the deficit and the need for increased debt sales mainly through his tax cuts and he isn t likely to become fiscally conservative if he s re elected ren said so while yields may rise with a trump victory the increase would be more dramatic under some of the democratic candidates ren said hideout no matter how the primaries shape up history shows investors may want to bet on a flatter yield curve in the six to nine months before november s vote that s what s happened in u s election cycles since the 1980s according to deutsche bank ag investors tend to reduce risk and hide out in treasuries as electoral uncertainty is resolved said strategist stuart sparks in new york the starting gun has already fired three month treasury rates are above those on 10 year notes for the first time since october in the wake of the federal reserve s meeting last week bechtel expects that questions around the election will only intensify as nov 3 the day americans vote for president approaches while trump s moves and tweets have been far from predictable upheaval may ensue even if he loses the big issue in markets is certainty bechtel said if you get a democrat into office then uncertainty increases depending on the candidate to contact

these dynamics could put an end to the market s record bull run the u s closed out the last decade with a record period of economic expansion marking the first time in the country s history that the economy went 10 years without recording a gross domestic product gdp decline in two successive quarters the stock market has been on a tremendous bull run that dates back to march 9 2009 with the s p 500 index rising nearly 392 across the stretch and the dividend adjusted total return for the spdr s p 500 etf coming in at roughly 509 major stock market indexes like the s p the nasdaq and the dow all trade near record highs the american economy continues to look strong early in 2020 but an eventual slip into recession is a question of when and not if a recent poll conducted by fortune found that 58 of investors thought that a recession was likely to occur this year on the other hand just 5 of respondents thought that the stock market would decline in 2020 that disparity evidences a worrying disconnect it might even be described as irrational exuberance there are indicators suggesting that the current period of record u s economic expansion will continue through this year and help prolong the stock market s bull run however the economy could avoid posting two successive quarters of declining gdp that mark a recession and still see a market crash in addition to world events like the coronavirus outbreak and an upcoming u s presidential election that s poised to be highly contentious investors should be aware that the following four economic factors could help create the conditions for a substantial stock sell off in 2020 1 earnings growth is soft on the surface and concerning under scrutiny stock market performance this year can be expected to have a close relationship with earnings growth shareholders want to see that companies are expanding their profits because this paves the way for the earnings generated to match the share price at the time of investment faster and propels valuations higher according to research from refinitiv corporate earnings climbed 22 7 in 2018 following the tax cuts and jobs act that was passed in the previous year but earnings growth was much more muted in 2019 coming in at an estimated 1 1 other estimates suggest that earnings actually decreased in 2019 as my colleague sean williams recently pointed out analysis from factset research suggests that earnings for s p 500 companies fell in each quarter last year with the index growing roughly 29 last year and no meaningful increase in net income that s something that investors should be paying close attention to and thinking about this year earnings momentum is projected to be stronger in 2020 with refinitiv laying out a 9 6 annual growth target analysis from goldman sachs projecting an increase somewhere in the neighborhood of 6 and the average analyst target modeling for 4 7 growth however if earnings for s p 500 companies grow in 2020 it s likely that buybacks will be a driving factor in the gains the issue there is that buybacks don t do anything to directly strengthen the underlying businesses as noted by the harvard business review only 47 of companies in the s p 500 listed any research and development expenses in 2018 and 38 companies accounted for 75 of total r d spending some of that disparity can be explained by large mature companies having less incentive to spend on the category and industries like technology being heavily dependent on it but there are signs that businesses aren t spending enough on initiatives that power revenue driven earnings growth at the same time margins also slipped over the last year due to factors including rising labor and materials costs factset s data as of jan 24 shows the market trading at a 12 month forward earnings multiple of 18 6 that multiple is significantly above both the five year average forward p e of 16 7 and 10 year average of 14 9 with the potential for relatively weak buyback driven earnings growth in 2020 that sets up a dynamic that could prompt weakness in the market this year or at some further point in the not too distant future 2 stock buybacks are slowing down the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35 to a flat rate of 21 and kicked off a huge stock buyback push that has powered the market s gains over the last three years the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in a new influx of cash being funneled into share repurchase programs and provisions in the bill also allowed companies to repatriate money held in non domestic bank accounts at a significantly lower tax rate many companies that transferred large overseas cash holdings back to the u s opted to pass some of these funds along to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends when a company buys back shares from stockholders it typically retires them meaning that there are fewer total shares outstanding and overall earnings per share are elevated as a result this major growth catalyst has started to slow and will likely be further weakened this year stock buybacks hit roughly 835 billion in 2018 dipped 15 in 2019 to 710 billion and are projected to fall another 5 in 2020 according to research from goldman sachs the decline in share repurchases when viewed in conjunction with other factors such as a projected decline for capital spending signals that fewer companies are viewing their shares as undervalued while a 5 decline this year doesn t look like cause for alarm goldman is concerned that a bigger drop for buybacks could result in significant market volatility corporate buybacks have been a driving force in the market s rally and current models show that catalyst weakening this year if potential conditions such as weaker than expected performance in key economies or another turn for the worse in the u s china trade war saga were to occur the drawdown on share repurchases could come in significantly worse than goldman s most recent projection heightening the potential for a market crash 3 corporate debt is at record levels and climbing higher according to the washington post u s corporate debt hit nearly 10 trillion at the end of 2019 a figure that represented roughly 47 of gdp for the year that s been facilitated by low fed interest rates and other central banks and a weak bond market low interest rates mean that retail investors can take advantage of cheap loans and this can have the unfortunate effect of prompting them to pursue risky investments the same is true for corporations issuing bonds or otherwise using debt to buy back their own stock or invest in other companies what s worse much of the big buyback push has been dependent on debt being used to repurchase the shares according to goldman sachs 2019 saw the amount that corporations returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends exceed free cash flow for the first time since 2007 with dividend and buyback spending coming in at 104 of total cash flow in the twelve month period ending in march taking on debt in order to fund buybacks isn t always a bad move if the underlying business is sound and there s a strong case to be made based on the fundamentals and growth prospects it s a move that can wind up working out very well for a company and its shareholders that s hardly the case for every company that has taken this avenue in recent years and big names like boeing and bed bath beyond spring to mind as examples of companies that have squandered billions in value on buybacks and now have much bigger debt and liquidity problems to show for it even if the majority of management teams using debt to fund substantial buyback initiatives can be said to have made prudent moves the record level of corporate debt combined with too many poorly conceived share repurchasing programs could weaken the broader market 4 key international economies showing signs of weakness the u s economy has been posting strong performance beating expectations in 2019 and showing signs of strength early this year goldman expects annual gdp growth of 2 3 in 2020 and u s national economic council director larry kudlow recently forecast that the economy will post a growth rate above 3 that would seem to bode well for stock market performance however most u s companies now have substantial exposure to international markets and slowdown in key territories could create a meaningful drag on performance for stocks german gdp shrank 0 1 in the second quarter of 2019 and grew 0 1 in the third quarter according to the company s federal statistics office just barely dodging recession germany s federal statistics office reported full year growth of 0 6 marking the 10th year of economic expansion in the country however the full year expansion was also significantly below the level of government and analyst forecasts from earlier in the year and represented the country s weakest growth since 2013 better than expected consumer spending helped germany avoid entering recession but with the country s industrial production already in a period of decline the consumer retail market could soon feel more pressure germany is europe s largest economy and the country s performance both affects other countries in the region and functions as a bellwether for the continent s overall macroeconomic environment performance for the french economy in the third quarter surpassed expectations but still grew at a meager 0 3 meanwhile moody s forecasts that gdp growth in britain will slow to just 1 in 2020 down from its estimate for 1 2 growth in 2019 key economies outside of europe are slowing as well the international monetary fund recently cut india s gdp growth forecast for 2020 to 4 8 a substantial reduction from the 6 1 annual growth target that it laid out in october meanwhile china posted its lowest economic growth in 29 years with a 6 1 gdp expansion in 2019 and many sections of the country s manufacturing industry saw steep year over year declines growth for consumer spending has been powering the chinese economy in recent years but substantial slowdown for the country s industrial sector casts a shadow over the consumer outlook signs of weakness are already evident in slowdown for smartphone and automobile sales which both fell 8 year over year in december according to nikkei china which has the world s second largest economy behind the u s was broadly projected to grow somewhere in the 6 range in 2020 but developments early in the year suggest that it could miss that target with many businesses schools and transportation centers in urban hubs near the outbreak of the coronavirus in wuhan shutting down and indications from the country s government that the spread of the virus is accelerating the outbreak could have a significant effect on china s economy the overall picture is that the global economic performance is showing some signs of weakness even as things are generally looking pretty good in the u s right now the american market doesn t exist in a vacuum however a major european economy like germany slipping into recession or a more turbulent business climate in china could cause investors to reevaluate the global economic picture kicking off a reduction in confidence in markets that leads to a substantial sell off for stocks what should investors do to prepare for the next crash timing when a market crash will occur is incredibly difficult and history has shown that it s almost impossible to do with any meaningful degree of consistency at the same time a correction will happen eventually and prudent investors should be looking at the market s record run in the context of previous trends and what appears to be a mounting set of risk factors that doesn t mean that investors should panic and dump all their holdings history has also shown that investors are better served by remaining in the market instead of trying to predict its highs and lows but those concerned that the bull run has reached a late stage may want to shift their holdings toward high quality defensive stocks reducing positions in speculatively valued growth dependent companies and increasing positions in resilient dividend paying stocks can be a way to prepare for potential volatility while still staying engaged in the market the long term trajectory is that the market will continue to rise and even highly growth dependent stocks should emerge from a crash and go on to reach new heights if the underlying business is strong with the bull market approaching the 11 year mark investors should feel good about the record run and evaluate their holdings to determine if a shift toward more defensive stocks is in line with their risk tolerance
these dynamics could put an end to the market s record bull run the u s closed out the last decade with a record period of economic expansion marking the first time in the country s history that the economy went 10 years without recording a gross domestic product gdp decline in two successive quarters the stock market has been on a tremendous bull run that dates back to march 9 2009 with the s p

in significantly worse than goldman s most recent projection heightening the potential for a market crash 3 corporate debt is at record levels and climbing higher according to the washington post u s corporate debt hit nearly 10 trillion at the end of 2019 a figure that represented roughly 47 of gdp for the year that s been facilitated by low fed interest rates and other central banks and a weak bond market low interest rates mean that retail investors can take advantage of cheap loans and this can have the unfortunate effect of prompting them to pursue risky investments the same is true for corporations issuing bonds or otherwise using debt to buy back their own stock or invest in other companies what s worse much of the big buyback push has been dependent on debt being used to repurchase the shares according to goldman sachs 2019 saw the amount that corporations returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends exceed free cash flow for the first time since 2007 with dividend and buyback spending coming in at 104 of total cash flow in the twelve month period ending in march taking on debt in order to fund buybacks isn t always a bad move if the underlying business is sound and there s a strong case to be made based on the fundamentals and growth prospects it s a move that can wind up working out very well for a company and its shareholders that s hardly the case for every company that has taken this avenue in recent years and big names like boeing and bed bath beyond spring to mind as examples of companies that have squandered billions in value on buybacks and now have much bigger debt and liquidity problems to show for it even if the majority of management teams using debt to fund substantial buyback initiatives can be said to have made prudent moves the record level of corporate debt combined with too many poorly conceived share repurchasing programs could weaken the broader market 4 key international economies showing signs of weakness the u s economy has been posting strong performance beating expectations in 2019 and showing signs of strength early this year goldman expects annual gdp growth of 2 3 in 2020 and u s national economic council director larry kudlow recently forecast that the economy will post a growth rate above 3 that would seem to bode well for stock market performance however most u s companies now have substantial exposure to international markets and slowdown in key territories could create a meaningful drag on performance for stocks german gdp shrank 0 1 in the second quarter of 2019 and grew 0 1 in the third quarter according to the company s federal statistics office just barely dodging recession germany s federal statistics office reported full year growth of 0 6 marking the 10th year of economic expansion in the country however the full year expansion was also significantly below the level of government and analyst forecasts from earlier in the year and represented the country s weakest growth since 2013 better than expected consumer spending helped germany avoid entering recession but with the country s industrial production already in a period of decline the consumer retail market could soon feel more pressure germany is europe s largest economy and the country s performance both affects other countries in the region and functions as a bellwether for the continent s overall macroeconomic environment performance for the french economy in the third quarter surpassed expectations but still grew at a meager 0 3 meanwhile moody s forecasts that gdp growth in britain will slow to just 1 in 2020 down from its estimate for 1 2 growth in 2019 key economies outside of europe are slowing as well the international monetary fund recently cut india s gdp growth forecast for 2020 to 4 8 a substantial reduction from the 6 1 annual growth target that it laid out in october meanwhile china posted its lowest economic growth in 29 years with a 6 1 gdp expansion in 2019 and many sections of the country s manufacturing industry saw steep year over year declines growth for consumer spending has been powering the chinese economy in recent years but substantial slowdown for the country s industrial sector casts a shadow over the consumer outlook signs of weakness are already evident in slowdown for smartphone and automobile sales which both fell 8 year over year in december according to nikkei china which has the world s second largest economy behind the u s was broadly projected to grow somewhere in the 6 range in 2020 but developments early in the year suggest that it could miss that target with many businesses schools and transportation centers in urban hubs near the outbreak of the coronavirus in wuhan shutting down and indications from the country s government that the spread of the virus is accelerating the outbreak could have a significant effect on china s economy the overall picture is that the global economic performance is showing some signs of weakness even as things are generally looking pretty good in the u s right now the american market doesn t exist in a vacuum however a major european economy like germany slipping into recession or a more turbulent business climate in china could cause investors to reevaluate the global economic picture kicking off a reduction in confidence in markets that leads to a substantial sell off for stocks what should investors do to prepare for the next crash timing when a market crash will occur is incredibly difficult and history has shown that it s almost impossible to do with any meaningful degree of consistency at the same time a correction will happen eventually and prudent investors should be looking at the market s record run in the context of previous trends and what appears to be a mounting set of risk factors that doesn t mean that investors should panic and dump all their holdings history has also shown that investors are better served by remaining in the market instead of trying to predict its highs and lows but those concerned that the bull run has reached a late stage may want to shift their holdings toward high quality defensive stocks reducing positions in speculatively valued growth dependent companies and increasing positions in resilient dividend paying stocks can be a way to prepare for potential volatility while still staying engaged in the market the long term trajectory is that the market will continue to rise and even highly growth dependent stocks should emerge from a crash and go on to reach new heights if the underlying business is strong with the bull market approaching the 11 year mark investors should feel good about the record run and evaluate their holdings to determine if a shift toward more defensive stocks is in line with their risk tolerance
the focus was inevitably on britain as the clock ticked down on friday night towards the moment of departure from the european union how would the economy fare on the outside of the world s biggest market in the years to come what sort of trade deal with the eu would be cooked up in the scant time available for negotiations how easy would it be to do a deal with the arch protectionist donald trump those are all perfectly reasonable questions but they are based on an assumption that britain is weak and doing badly and the remaining 27 members of the eu are strong and doing well that most definitely is not the case official figures showed that growth in the eurozone eased back from 0 3 to 0 1 in the final three months of 2019 france and italy the second and third biggest monetary union countries both recorded falls in output data for germany europe s powerhouse economy has yet to be released but the signs are that it grew by as little as 0 1 strikes in france were partly responsible for the 0 1 drop in french gdp but industrial unrest was not to blame for the 0 3 contraction in italy a country where output has yet to regain pre financial crisis levels germany meanwhile has been struggling because its economy depends on the export of manufacturing goods these have been adversely affected by a slowdown in global demand exacerbated by president trump s aggressive approach to trade at the start of the year there was some hope that the global economy had bottomed out central banks had provided a fresh dose of monetary stimulus and demand seemed to be picking up washington and beijing called a truce in their trade war the international monetary fund was starting to sound a bit more optimistic about the state of the global economy europe has never really recovered from the last crisis then the coronavirus struck it is too early to say whether the deaths in china represent a black swan event something that comes as a shock and has a major impact but the crisis certainly has the potential to be one already there have been indications of slower growth in china curbs on air travel and fears that global supply chains could be severed none of which is good for germany or the wider european economy if as most economists expect the chinese government quickly gets to grips with the coronavirus the hit to the global economy will be brief and modest if it doesn t the eu is in serious trouble why first there is not a great deal of scope to loosen policy at least in the conventional sense the european central bank is operating with negative interest rates and has restarted its quantitative easing or money creation programme there is not a lot more the ecb can do second europe has never really recovered from the last crisis the ecb was slower than the us federal reserve to cut interest rates slower to experiment with quantitative easing and lacked the wherewithal to sort out the bad debt problems of europe s banks so while the credit channels in the us are again functioning in the eurozone they are still blocked making monetary policy less effective than it would otherwise be there is one final problem monetary union will remain half baked without a banking union and a unified eurozone budget neither largely due to german opposition is remotely in prospect the year ahead is going to be tough just as tough if not tougher than it will be for the uk aston martin pins its hopes on bond and an suv aston martin s much hyped stock market float has ended with a humiliating bailout by a billionaire not even 18 months later the luxury carmaker s executives international shareholders and bankers made fortunes from the initial public offering in late 2018 aston martin was worth 4 3bn at the time a valuation that was rapidly revealed to be fanciful a plan that relied on a new factory doubling total production meant that the company s chief executive andy palmer was always walking a tightrope when sales dropped and costs kept rising aston martin was left horribly exposed the serial fashion investor lawrence stroll who led the rescue consortium and will now become executive chairman at least appears to have his heart in it with a pledge to use the aston martin brand on his formula one racing team for the next decade investors have welcomed stroll following a cash injection to stave off bankruptcy the shares rose 24 on friday though they are still just a quarter of their 19 float price with the prospect of a james bond marketing blitz around the latest film in april just as aston martin starts production of its new dbx suv and the stardust of formula one there might finally be a few reasons for cautious optimism at the company s hq in warwickshire still there are bumps ahead the bet on an untested suv is not a surefire winner nor are luxury products aimed at the rich immune from shocks china is key for the suv so the coronavirus could not have come at a worse time slashing investment in zero emissions electric battery technology will surely store up problems for the future for shareholders not to mention the planet palmer needs the dbx launch to go to plan if the bailout is not to become his swan song view image in fullscreen 007 to the rescue daniel craig in the forthcoming bond film no time to die photograph metro goldwyn mayer ticketing watchdog needs rather more bite no one familiar with secondary ticketing will have been surprised to see the ticket resale site stubhub criticised by the competition and markets authority cma for allegedly misleading consumers and potentially breaking consumer law after all we ve been here before the cma has fought a long running battle with stubhub s chief rival viagogo which refused to change its ways until the cma resorted to legal action stubhub styles itself as the more acceptable face of ticketing now it has been accused by the regulator of viagogo style transgressions such as selling tickets without warning buyers that they might be refused entry to events when artists have imposed prohibitions on resale the company also allegedly misleads consumers about the scarcity of available tickets a pressure selling tactic if both major resale sites behave like this what hope is there of any improvement if viagogo s proposed 3 1bn takeover of stubhub goes ahead creating an unrivalled industry powerhouse the cma is currently weighing up whether to intervene in the british part of this tie up on monopoly grounds it is hard to imagine why it would allow the two major players in the uk s ticket resale market to get together even if they had spotless records while the watchdog has the power to intervene in the merger its teeth are less sharp when it comes to consumer law the cma can go to court but it s a lengthy and costly process that requires a judge to make a ruling that s why the cma s chief executive andrea coscelli used the stubhub announcement to call for the regulator to be given greater powers to determine when consumer law has been broken and to issue fines given the difficulty it has had in bringing stubhub and viagogo to heel it is hard to argue that the cma should be denied more effective ways of exercising its authority
bloomberg opinion outside china thailand has the largest number of patients infected by the novel coronavirus unfortunately the export reliant 500 billion economy southeast asia s second largest was sickly even before the outbreak of the pneumonia like illness that reflects simultaneous blows from the sino u s trade war the worst drought in decades and a stubbornly strong currency add in beijing s newly imposed restrictions on chinese travelers who account for the lion s share of arrivals plus the knock on effect on other tourists and a recession begins to look imminent thailand has lagged its southeast asian neighbors for some time while political upheaval has been a major drag there are others too an aging population poor productivity flatlining consumption and hefty household debt the central bank now expects gdp growth of 2 5 for 2019 that s considerably worse than even lackluster peers like malaysia and indonesia and the country s weakest pace since 2014 the year a military junta took power exports also shrank in 2019 with shipments in the key carmaking industry declining thailand is a regional hub for vehicle manufacturers like nissan motor co which have been affected by poor demand in major markets such as china then there s the baht the thai currency outperformed last year despite policymakers efforts on the back of a yawning current account surplus weak inflation and near record foreign exchange reserves the baht s recent weakening has been one of the few positive side effects of the coronavirus epidemic in november thailand relaxed rules on capital outflows to ease upward pressure but central bank officials know that too much tinkering in the market could prompt washington to label it a currency manipulator meanwhile fiscal stimulus including an infrastructure drive was held up by wrangling around the 2020 government budget an interest rate cut this coming week to a record low of 1 looks likely story continues so the year had already started poorly now with 19 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus most of them chinese travelers and the illness spreading fast it looks a whole lot worse in the third quarter the economy expanded only 0 1 compared to the previous three months analysts say fourth quarter numbers reported this month could show a slip into negative territory a further contraction in the first three months of 2020 would put thailand into a technical recession the first and most direct factor is tourism depending on how you measure it the industry accounts for roughly a fifth of thailand s gdp visitor numbers were already depressed by the strong baht which made other tropical destinations cheaper chinese tourists who were supposed to flock back as the impact of a 2018 boat disaster waned were trickling in only slowly that makes china s restrictions to contain the pandemic all the more painful on jan 24 travel agencies were ordered to stop selling tour packages overseas while many more chinese now venture abroad alone roughly half still go with groups thailand s finance ministry warned last wednesday that the virus and related bans could have a three month impact meaning 400 000 fewer visitors tourism authorities have forecast an even steeper chinese drop for thailand that s more than a peak season blow china accounts for the largest number of visitors some 11 million traveled last year according to thai authorities they also splurge more per head than any other nationality amounting to an estimated total of almost 18 billion in 2019 that s just over a quarter of spending by overseas visitors as reported by thailand s tourism authority consider the knock on effect on other nationalities and it becomes clear why citigroup inc analysts have cut their expected increase in tourist numbers for 2020 to 0 5 from 6 5 there are also harder to measure second order impacts like the impact of slower chinese growth on the wider region on global growth and on trade consumption will suffer the experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome which brought the region to its knees in 2003 offers some consolation back then the most affected economies including hong kong bounced back quickly by august 2003 hong kong arrivals were back at pre sars levels in part thanks to rules that made it easier for mainland travelers to cross the border china appears to have moved more swiftly this time it is better equipped and this virus appears less deadly but the scale of the epidemic is still hard to measure and both china and tourism account for a far larger slice of thailand s economy than ever before add in a crippling drought and budget troubles have delayed much needed fiscal stimulus to go with lower interest rates thai stocks marked their steepest drop since 2016 last monday it s hard

the u s closed out the last decade with a record period of economic expansion marking the first time in the country s history that the economy went 10 years without recording a gross domestic product gdp decline in two successive quarters the stock market has been on a tremendous bull run that dates back to march 9 2009 with the s p 500 index rising nearly 392 across the stretch and the dividend adjusted total return for the spdr s p 500 etf coming in at roughly 509 major stock market indexes like the s p the nasdaq and the dow all trade near record highs the american economy continues to look strong early in 2020 but an eventual slip into recession is a question of when and not if a recent poll conducted by fortune found that 58 of investors thought that a recession was likely to occur this year on the other hand just 5 of respondents thought that the stock market would decline in 2020 that disparity evidences a worrying disconnect it might even be described as irrational exuberance there are indicators suggesting that the current period of record u s economic expansion will continue through this year and help prolong the stock market s bull run however the economy could avoid posting two successive quarters of declining gdp that mark a recession and still see a market crash in addition to world events like the coronavirus outbreak and an upcoming u s presidential election that s poised to be highly contentious investors should be aware that the following four economic factors could help create the conditions for a substantial stock sell off in 2020 1 earnings growth is soft on the surface and concerning under scrutiny stock market performance this year can be expected to have a close relationship with earnings growth shareholders want to see that companies are expanding their profits because this paves the way for the earnings generated to match the share price at the time of investment faster and propels valuations higher according to research from refinitiv corporate earnings climbed 22 7 in 2018 following the tax cuts and jobs act that was passed in the previous year but earnings growth was much more muted in 2019 coming in at an estimated 1 1 other estimates suggest that earnings actually decreased in 2019 as my colleague sean williams recently pointed out analysis from factset research suggests that earnings for s p 500 companies fell in each quarter last year with the index growing roughly 29 last year and no meaningful increase in net income that s something that investors should be paying close attention to and thinking about this year earnings momentum is projected to be stronger in 2020 with refinitiv laying out a 9 6 annual growth target analysis from goldman sachs projecting an increase somewhere in the neighborhood of 6 and the average analyst target modeling for 4 7 growth however if earnings for s p 500 companies grow in 2020 it s likely that buybacks will be a driving factor in the gains the issue there is that buybacks don t do anything to directly strengthen the underlying businesses as noted by the harvard business review only 47 of companies in the s p 500 listed any research and development expenses in 2018 and 38 companies accounted for 75 of total r d spending some of that disparity can be explained by large mature companies having less incentive to spend on the category and industries like technology being heavily dependent on it but there are signs that businesses aren t spending enough on initiatives that power revenue driven earnings growth at the same time margins also slipped over the last year due to factors including rising labor and materials costs factset s data as of jan 24 shows the market trading at a 12 month forward earnings multiple of 18 6 that multiple is significantly above both the five year average forward p e of 16 7 and 10 year average of 14 9 with the potential for relatively weak buyback driven earnings growth in 2020 that sets up a dynamic that could prompt weakness in the market this year or at some further point in the not too distant future 2 stock buybacks are slowing down the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35 to a flat rate of 21 and kicked off a huge stock buyback push that has powered the market s gains over the last three years the reduced corporate tax rate resulted in a new influx of cash being funneled into share repurchase programs and provisions in the bill also allowed companies to repatriate money held in non domestic bank accounts at a significantly lower tax rate many companies that transferred large overseas cash holdings back to the u s opted to pass some of these funds along to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends when a company buys back shares from stockholders it typically retires them meaning that there are fewer total shares outstanding and overall earnings per share are elevated as a result this major growth catalyst has started to slow and will likely be further weakened this year stock buybacks hit roughly 835 billion in 2018 dipped 15 in 2019 to 710 billion and are projected to fall another 5 in 2020 according to research from goldman sachs the decline in share repurchases when viewed in conjunction with other factors such as a projected decline for capital spending signals that fewer companies are viewing their shares as undervalued while a 5 decline this year doesn t look like cause for alarm goldman is concerned that a bigger drop for buybacks could result in significant market volatility corporate buybacks have been a driving force in the market s rally and current models show that catalyst weakening this year if potential conditions such as weaker than expected performance in key economies or another turn for the worse in the u s china trade war saga were to occur the drawdown on share repurchases could come in significantly worse than goldman s most recent projection heightening the potential for a market crash 3 corporate debt is at record levels and climbing higher according to the washington post u s corporate debt hit nearly 10 trillion at the end of 2019 a figure that represented roughly 47 of gdp for the year that s been facilitated by low fed interest rates and other central banks and a weak bond market low interest rates mean that retail investors can take

did you know that 30 of americans still believe to this day that the u s dollar is backed by gold let me tell you what money used to be what it is now and find out why that 100 bill in your pocket is actually almost worthless money as a store of intrinsic value the problem around 5000 years ago in mesopotamia some smart minds figured out a way to trade their goods better say i was a sheepherder back then needed a new pair of shoes and went to the shoemaker to get me some probably not shiny white sneakers but some leathery somethings that protected my feet when herding i offered the man a sheep but unfortunately my old rival sheepherder jack went to him yesterday in need of a new pair of shoes and had already sold him a sheep so my shoemakers sheep needs were met what he needed though was somebody to fix his leaking roof so in order to get me those nice new kicks i had to find somebody who knew how to fix leaking roofs and needed a sheep not the most convenient thing in the world the solution so some smart minds figured out a way to do it better what did everybody need back then right food so the shekel was invented it was a standardized unit of weight for a certain amount of barley smart move because now i could go to the market sell my sheep for 3 shekels and buy me a new pair of shoes with one and this is just one example where money was based on a commodity other regions of the world used cowry shells for example these units of trade had an inherent worth on their own money was invented money as a voucher let s make a tiny little leap in history say a few thousand years during wwi the dollar had already started to rise to power due to europe emptying their gold chests in order to fund the war as well as borrowing money from the u s in the form of dollars until that point the british pound had been the world s reserve currency
this year will be a time when top management of companies around the world will stop thinking and make serious evaluations starting with geopolitical tensions that the atlantic alliance s american and european wings have ignored due to either impotence or other interests severe uncertainties triggered by the global trade wars led by the u s are forcing millions of companies on a global scale to seek new markets and new supply chains to sell worldwide the companies that saw the asia pacific countries as the most important supply partner for a long time are now seriously questioning dependency on a single geography the global ceo survey published by pricewaterhousecoopers pwc one of the world s well known management consultancy and audit firms points out that ceos who put forward a highly optimistic expectation for the growth performance of the world economy in 2018 today have moved toward pessimism for 2020 and beyond while the highest pessimism is showing itself in north america and western europe a relatively low pessimism is observed in the central and eastern european countries including turkey and russia and in the asia pacific region globally ceos expectations for an increase in corporate returns and real sector confidence in a medium term of three years were twice the highest in 2011 and 2017 at 51 percent this rate fell to 34 percent in 2020 next year it is estimated to decline to 27 percent excessive regulations by governments political uncertainties inadequacy in the company s core skills trade disputes and cyberattacks were perceived as the top five threat topics in 2019 in 2020 ceos kept over regulation by governments in first place moved trade disputes from fourth place to second uncertainty toward the growth of the world economy from the 12th to third place and cyberattacks from fifth to fourth place on a global scale ceos do not perceive uncertainties in taxes excessive fluctuations in exchange rates and parity changes in consumer trends and protectionist inclinations among countries as priority risk topics among the most fundamental 15 threats in north america cyberattacks in western central and eastern europe excessive regulation of governments in latin america populism in asia pacific trade disputes in africa political uncertainties and in the middle east geopolitical uncertainties are at the top of the list in the asia pacific africa latin america and the middle east who represent a large part of the world s population and economy uncertainty in economic growth is the second most important threat and risk topic globally the ceos pessimistic perception and threat perception toward growth also adversely affect investment tendencies in order for 2020 to be the year of an investment move it will be necessary to pave the way for positive developments that will disperse this pessimism the investment move since the 2008 global financial crisis for more than 11 years the fact that an investment move at a global scale could not be realized to help the workable population find job opportunities is making economists think this problem manifests itself in every continent from europe to america from africa to asia of course this problem is experienced in different dimensions in each country the international monetary fund imf which announced its global economic outlook report in january revised its growth forecast for 2020 once again by lowering it by 0 2 points to 3 3 imf which stated that the world economy grew by 2 9 in 2019 foresees a 3 4 global growth for 2022 imf expresses that the most critical aspect of growth worldwide is the investment move a move predominantly focused on the private sector and public infrastructure superstructure investments will also mobilize global employment imf expects that the difficulties in financing investments will be reduced due to the relatively expansionary monetary policy measures of leading central banks the imf in this context owing to improvements and possible activation in investments in turkey and the dynamism in russia raised its growth expectations for the developing europe region to 2 5 for 2020 and 2021 the growth number for this region was announced as 1 8 for 2019 for the euro area which grew by 1 2 in 2019 the imf reduced its forecast for 2020 by 0 1 to 1 3 and for 2021 to 1 4 the primary reason for the decline in imf s projection for global growth is the possible slowdown in india and similar emerging economies united nations international labor organization ilo on the other hand predicted that according to the current global economic picture 2 5 million more people will be added to the global unemployment figure in 2020 and shared that in a world where over 5 billion people above the age of 15 can work 188 million will

with great fanfare and without the presence of the democratic congressional contingent that pushed for ratification president donald trump signed the u s mexico canada agreement on the south lawn of the white house on wednesday morning with some 400 guests including farmers ceos and workers in attendance the deal is a reboot of the north american free trade agreement that has governed trade between the united states and its neighbors since 1994 although trump has promoted usmca as a wholesale overhaul that replaced the nafta nightmare as he called it in his remarks wednesday trade experts said this characterization was inaccurate usmca is 95 percent the existing nafta agreement said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics there are provisions in there that cover things like e commerce and digital services but with regard to the manufacturing sector for instance there s very little change trump claimed the deal will cost u s economic growth by 1 2 percent but economists voiced skepticism white house officials had previously estimated the economic boost at nearly 0 5 percent which some also viewed as overblown mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics described the new north american deal as a tweak to the original it s more marketing there he said trade economists say a few economic sectors will see an incremental boost higher automotive rules of origin requirements will increase the percentage of car parts that need to come from north america and enhanced labor and environmental standards cut down on the financial incentives automakers have to make cars and car parts in mexico where labor costs are lower and environmental regulation more lax the deal expanded intellectual property protections and provisions for digital trade a sector that has burgeoned since nafta was originally negotiated usmca also opens up the canadian market to american dairy products an element on which trump focused when touting how the deal will benefit farm states he didn t get much he got to rename it zandi said the deal could provide a lift at the margins to the automotive and dairy industries but would not generate the kinds of figures the white house has pushed like 68 billion in new economic activity and 176 000 jobs he didn t get much he got to rename it kirkegaard said to the extent that trump can claim credit for an economic lift provided by the usmca economists said that was more a function of the white house keeping most of the existing agreement in place after initially threatening to pull out of nafta entirely without a replacement in place i would think of this more in terms of what would ve happened if this agreement didn t go back into place that would ve been disastrous for the economy said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america exiting nafta without replacing it would have forced the three nations to revert to wto rules around trade which would have upended supply chains and disrupted production throughout the continent we have to view it as a bullet dodged because the alternative would have been trump pulling out of the whole thing which would have been far worse kirkegaard said he was threatening to overturn over the table in this regard trade experts drew parallels between wednesday s signing ceremony and the white house s phase one china deal signed in washington this month the phase one trade deal with china will also have no macroeconomic impact except forestall an escalation in the u s trade war with china which would have likely pushed the global economy into recession zandi said according to the nonpartisan tax foundation the china tariffs already imposed shaved roughly a quarter of a percentage point off gdp growth reduced wages and cost nearly 200 000 jobs the threatened tariffs that were avoided when the china trade deal was struck would have doubled the hit to gdp the key achievement of the usmca was to keep the north american trade system intact much as it was under nafta and ending a very destructive period of uncertainty said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school we are better off with these trade agreements than without them because we ended costly uncertainties but we are worse off in trade policy than three years ago he said

uae expatriates sending money home to europe are currently receiving more euros for their dirhams with the euro falling from about dh4 6 to dh4 over the past two years they are effectively enjoying a pay rise in their own currency at a time when few private sector companies are increasing salaries at the same time the british pound has been recovering from its previous decline against the euro since last september the british currency is up from 1 07 to 1 19 the euro is now looking a little oversold and ready for a re rating from a contrarian perspective the euro is probably the place to go longer term compare sterling to the us dollar however and a recovery to 1 35 since december s general election has stalled it now stands at 1 32 one message the currency market could be sending us is that it thinks the recovery of the british economy will be swift after its agonising three and a half year wait for brexit that eventually happened at the end of last week you could argue that currency markets are saying that the damage from brexit to the european union will be greater than it will be to britain although that would surely be accompanied by a more sustained rally in the pound versus the us dollar currency markets are always difficult to interpret and there is also a danger of reading too much into them something they do consistently reflect are the dynamics of interest rates and their outlook the european central bank cannot really lower interest rates any further they are already at negative 0 5 per cent and the ecb s new president christine lagarde has just ordered a strategic review the euro is now looking a little oversold and ready for a re rating from a contrarian perspective the euro is probably the place to go longer term saving your highly valued dirhams in currently lowly valued euros might be a good plan meanwhile the federal reserve lowered its interest rates three times last year at the behest of us president donald trump yet they remain higher than in the uk or asia and so the dollar is currently king a wall street boom with stocks up around 30 per cent last year sucked in cash from far and wide with a great deal of money flowing in from europe and brexit battered britain in the hunt for yield that gave the dollar a final hike but last week us stocks fell sharply on fears of the spreading coronavirus and a dollar weakening share correction could just be starting hence you have a weak euro a dollar riding for a fall and a somewhat healthier pound now that the uncertainty surrounding the brexit has been lifted or at least kicked down the road the british economy has a few green shoots a 65 million dh315 11m london house deal was finalised the day after the conservative party won the election house prices have bounced a little my nephew who works in house extensions has never been busier a bit of flag waving or rather the removal of the union jack from the line up of the 27 other eu member states last friday and some catchy initiatives to stop immigration and promote big public spending projects might rally the pound for a short period now that the brexit is done at last yet behind the scenes at the bank of england the talk has been about when to lower interest rates to buck up the anaemic uk economy it would most likely have enjoyed a mini boom over the past few years without the brexit debacle remember that before the brexit referendum the pound stood above 1 50 versus 1 32 today brexit has already cost the country dearly unless there is some sort of spontaneous economic boom post brexit and it is hard to see any such dynamism emerging this week with markets traumatised by the coronavirus epidemic in china then it is only a matter of time before the uk lowers its interest rates that is not usually good news for pound sterling the euro has fallen from dh4 6 to dh4 over the past two years bloomberg the bank of england itself issued a warning about the dangers of the brexit to the uk economy four years ago when it published a negative assessment you change the terms of trade on one half of your national exports and we will not know what the new terms are until the end of this year at the earliest and this will definitely have an economic impact a deal with the us on the 20 per cent of trade it represents simply cannot compensate even if a generous president donald trump decided not to put america first what is now billed as a soft brexit could well end up being a lot harder than optimistic british nationalists believe and nobody has ever claimed that a hard brexit would mean anything except a weaker pound its current strength against the euro would then be fleeting too buy the weak euro for a bargain although all currencies will likely devalue against gold peter cooper has been writing about gulf finance for two decades

simply put the s p would have to hit 5 100 for it to be valued at the previous two market peaks value investor update the dallas fed reported the 12mo trimmed mean pce which is used in the calculation of the value investor index for the s p 500 12mo inflation dipped slightly to 1 96 which keeps it close to a trend line of 2 00 the past 10yrs the value investor index vii is 2 432 using 70yr trends for real gdp and s p 500 median earnings the s p 500 sits at a premium of 33 to the vii which is roughly â½ of the previous premiums of the last two market cycle peaks there are no signs of this economic cycle ending even with current pessimism should the s p 500 repeat past premium levels in 2024 the potential for 5 100 is possible real gdp government spending m2 and inflation the chart from jan 2000 shows us real gdp reported this week with a trailing 12 months of 2 32 the real private gdp which subtracts out govt exp inv was 2 18 both values are coming off a surge in gdp 2017 2018 as a result of tax and regulation reductions real govt exp inv which continues to under pace real gdp at 2 09 reflects an uptick with recent military spending the chart from jan 1947 provides a perspective on gdp money supply inflation and key events though connected with inflation note that money supply m2 has soared as inflation has plummeted also note that key government spending initiatives sometimes do and do not correlate with inflation wars do correlate as both expensive and inflationary the lack of a specifically identifiable causation for inflation has left economists scratching their heads for hundreds of years there has been a long held concept apparently first observed in print by aristophanes in the frogs 405bc today spoken of as gresham s law or copernicus s law that bad money drives out good governments which simply print currency to support spending over time do not create economic value the net result is that a currency expansion without the same real expansion of gdp is inflationary germany of the 1930s and argentina and venezuela have done this today the same was feared in the us with the rapid expansion of m2 2009 present to many that the pace of inflation remains unchanged overturns well held tenets that government spending is inflationary especially during war time can be found in the correlation of govt exp inv to inflation real govt exp inv fell at a 2 annual rate 2009 to 2014 while m2 soared and continues to soar oil prices which are not shown rose sharply beginning in 2009 and nearly tripled by 2011 held well over 100bbl till late in 2014 only to plummet 80 when russia invaded ukraine inflation over the whole period continued lower without noticeable impact while govt exp inv has some correlation to inflation m2 and commodity prices not so much this forces one to look elsewhere for another inflationary input it looks like it has been discovered the mystery of inflation solved inflation has multiple causes but likely all come from one source government policy wars and excessive government spending without adding economic value in the form of an increased and long lasting improvement in society s standard of living expands the amount of currency spread over the same level of sustainable gdp only peacetime additions through innovations which better the standard of living by adding non inflated value to one s gdp in a free market like the us as compared to anywhere else especially china russia venezuela argentina and etc innovation enters the economy via entrepreneurs who often receive bank loans lending creates temporary currency when the loan is paid back by successful businesses making profits selling innovations to consumers the currency created through the earlier loan is now made permanent innovation by this process is turned into equity for society the most important part of the process is individual freedom to choose to buy or not depending on how well a new product advances one s standard of living the spending choice always involves deciding if one is getting more value for one s earnings vs not spending at all the companies that offer the greatest level of innovation at the most attractive valuation succeed because they attract consumers it is a constant process of offering faster better and cheaper alternatives to consumers to maintain business success which drives the entire production consumption system every individual transaction is a decision to improve one s standard of living simple reasoning leads one to the conclusion that innovation is deflationary and that the most creative of societies should have the lowest inflation but society is not that simple society at any point in time has a breadth of perspectives and there have been multiple instances when some believed it correct to even out the benefits society has but have been distributed unequally it is when the governing group decides to regulate for a specific policy outcome that costs are added to goods and services there is a fine line between regulating a society for opportunity or for outcome the power of the state vs the freedoms of its citizens has been argued since the time of socrates aristophanes and socrates were contemporaries the clouds 423bc is a greek comedy play written by the playwright aristophanes lampooning of intellectual fashions such a period occurred in the 1970s this surge in regulatory activity is seen in the rise in the number of pages in the federal register the inflation spiraled higher in near lockstep with the pages in the federal register the federal register more than tripled from 20 000 in 1970 to more than 73 000 by the end of 1980 while inflation also more than tripled from 3 4 to nearly 11 the us had shifted markedly towards an economy regulated by government this shift was much towards forms of socialism we see failing globally today the next presidential election brought ronald reagan into the oval office recognizing that regulations were stifling the us economy he proceeded to deregulate over his two terms regulations fell by 41 not recognized in the process was the impact that deregulation had on lowering costs to consumers inflation fell from 11 back to 3 4 range and actually reached as low as 2 at one point during his tenure even today many observers continue to be amazed and confused about the origins of reagan s miracle economy the decline in the number of pages in the federal register and inflation are again nearly in lockstep now we have it inflation comes from the adverse impact of government on converting entrepreneurial innovation into currency government is necessary as the only organized force to protect society in times of outside threats natural disasters and to ensure that members of society treat each other fairly the cost of government adds costs to society and the reason behind inflation some costs like self defense are visible other costs such as regulations tend to go unnoticed but can be even more impactful than any visible costs when government regulates excessively costs rise and inflation is the outcome the current economy is in the early stages of reagan s miracle economy federal register pages spiked just under 100 000 in 2016 with a sizable rise since 1986 level of 47 000 the inflation normally associated with this rise was held in check by congressional disagreements leading to a decline in real govt exp inv under sequestration since 2017 the number of pages has dropped to 61 000 businesses and individuals received tax reductions the us economy accelerated some of this economic strength is being used to negotiate new trade agreements lower tariffs globally and counter anti democratic forces with economic sanctions further reductions in the federal register page count are anticipated the current level of market pessimism is wholly unjustified economic activity is strong and should continue to rise with inflation remaining tepid investors should treat any decline in market prices as a buying opportunity once we have passed through this period equity prices should rise for several years original post editor s note the summary

when the us house rejected the wall street bailout bill on september 29 2008 i was hunched over in a swiveling wooden bar stool with a camel turkish gold burning between my right fore and middle fingers the vote was broadcast live on a dozen channels but that wouldnâ t have mattered if mikey and becca didnâ t have cable on that day they did but no thanks to them for most of the two years i knew the couple their old sony trinitron sat on a particle board tv stand against the blank back wall of a dungeon like living room on the bottom floor of a two story townhouse one day the stand was gone replaced by one of those cheap plaster corinthian column pedestals â looks good right â becca beamed â hobby lobby on sale â i smiled â just like tony â she punched me jokingly in the shoulder in the hbo series the tv in tony sopranoâ s bedroom sat on a similarly tacky decorative pedestal like everyone else in those days the cable guy for mikey and beccaâ s building owed me a favor so that old trinitron had a few channels they would have never splurged on cable of their own accord i watched every agonizing second of the house vote on the bailout bill there was a cream colored couch with forest green stripes in the living room but i never sat there i never stayed long enough to get comfortable despite the coupleâ s well meaning pretensions to hospitality instead i usually perched on one of three bar stools situated around a weird looking octagonal table within reach of the cocktail shaker set i bought them as a â gift â truth be told i bought everybody cocktail shaker sets back then along with tanqueray and roseâ s so i could be sure that wherever i went i could shake up a gimlet â thatâ s that then â i distinctly remember saying as the house rejected the 700 billion package aimed at rescuing wall street and averting a depression the vote was 228 205 i winced dragged the camel down to its patterned filter the turkish golds had a distinctive filter design and smushed it in an overflowing ashtray â thatâ s what â mikey asked he and becca were staring blankly at the trinitron with no conception whatsoever of what had just happened or why it mattered i expelled the cigarette smoke from my lungs in a half exhale half sigh â thatâ s the end â the dow settled down 777 points that day at the time it was the biggest point decline in history heisenberg the s p fell 8 7 â i honestly donâ t even know where we go from here â dave rovelli then managing director of equity trading at canaccord told cnbc amid the despair â the problem is out in the boondocks people donâ t realize what this means â he added â when they canâ t get a loan at the bank then theyâ ll figure it out â bloomberg rovelli was right mikey and becca didnâ t live â out in the boondocks â but they were blissfully ignorant as to just how close to economic oblivion we all were that day i didnâ t bother to explain my business there was done anyway i dumped three gin soaked ice cubes in the sink rinsed the glass out and found a place for it in the dishwasher which was always full i never knew whether the dishes were dirty or clean and iâ d stopped asking â iâ ll check in with you guys in a week â â roger that â mikey invariably said i donâ t remember exactly but â roger thatâ was his response to everything it was his catchphrase he didnâ t understand that catchphrases were supposed to be unique â watch the news tonight â i told them i knew they wouldnâ t i turned the bottom lock on my way out the door the bailout package eventually passed of course the atms never went dark and although rovelliâ s â boondockâ people would eventually come around to the reality that something had gone horribly awry there were no soup lines and the stores never ran out of milk one of the most curious things about the months around the meltdown was how generally oblivious so many of the folks who should have known what to expect seemed to be about the likely next steps once armageddon was averted you neednâ t have been particularly well versed in the literature to know that bernanke was a depression aficionado and you neednâ t have been an economist to be vaguely familiar with the kinds of policy prescriptions he was destined to write and keep writing until the patient was thoroughly addicted by september 2008 it had been so long since i had checked my account at vanguard that i no longer remembered my username let alone my password i had to call them to get access because i couldnâ t remember the answers to my secret questions either and the e mail address attached to that account was long since dead it was a â set it and forget itâ account and i had â set itâ years and years and years previous but at that juncture i could scarcely think of a better idea than to plow as much money as i could possibly spare into a balanced index fund the writing was on the wall in terms of the policy response and as far as the fate of the financial universe was concerned we were either doomed or we werenâ t and there was really nothing in between if we werenâ t it was the greatest buying opportunity i was ever going to see and the series of simple transfers from one of my bank accounts to that idiot proof vanguard balanced index fund still count among some of the best â tradesâ i ever made more than a decade later some of the biggest names in the business are busy declaring that the boom bust cycle is over so said no less than bridgewater co cio bob prince in davos last wednesday in an interview with bloomberg and he may be right but he may be wrong too in explaining why he could be correct last week i cited deutsche bankâ s aleksandar kocic who in 2017 suggested that it may not be possible for policymakers to emancipate markets â to lift martial law if you will â the fed and central banks in general carries an implicit responsibility for orderly reemancipation of the markets which makes stimulus unwind especially tricky â he wrote â the accommodation has been in place for a very long time during which traditional transmission mechanisms have atrophied and investorsâ mindset has changed in a way that has altered irreversibly their behavior the market functioning and its dynamics â recent notes from kocic suggest that for a variety of nuanced reasons he generally agrees with the premise that the likelihood of booms and busts is diminishing in favor of an environment characterized by more or less of stagnation but itâ s worth revisiting a few passages from another 2017 note in which he outlined the spiraling trajectory of volatility and leverage consider the following passages from kocic which will likely resonate with readers who cringed when prince suggested the boom bust cycle is no more again these are from a 2017 note however the most interesting thing for us at the moment is the question of what comes after each crisis namely how is the recovery engineered and economy brought back on track to be specific letâ s choose as the starting point 1999 the beginning of the internet bubble and follow in the clockwise direction the subsequent economic trajectory in the vol leverage plane in the figure below as the economy is heating up volatility declines and leverage increases until the bubble bursts sometime in the late 2000 there is a volatile deleveraging for the next 2 3 years when low rates and expansion of the real estate market created conditions for the turnaround and beginning of another cycle the only difference is that this time around the bubble was bigger and the limits were more extreme instead of being a periodic object e g ellipse the trajectory now becomes an outward spiral â in the second sweep the leverage is higher and risk premia compression more extreme leading naturally to a deeper crisis and a need for an even more extreme measures of recovery deutsche bank the vestiges of crises past always linger â creative destruction isnâ t a viable option in the modern world â on the austrian analysis recessions give a chance to re allocate â mal investedâ productive factors to efficient uses they should therefore be allowed to run unhindered until they have done their work â robert skidelsky writes in money and government before noting that â economists whose common sense had not been completely destroyed by their theories rejected the drastic cure of destroying the existing economy in order to rebuild it in the correct proportions â as skidelsky alludes to the idea of letting it all burn to the ground in order to ensure that every last bit of misallocated capital is purged is at best implausible at worst itâ s madness but we should recognize that in the absence of that future crises will be i inextricably linked to their predecessors and ii likely more spectacular than those that came before that second point i e the idea that a defining feature of a fiat regime is a rolling boom bust cycle that snowballs with each turn means that policy responses will need to grow in magnitude over time to keep pace with ever larger busts eventually the busts become so large that the policy responses required to combat them become caricatures of themselves that border on absurdity some would suggest thatâ s the point weâ re at now â the policy response is cartoonish and easily meets the threshold for absurdity writing more than two years ago kocic noted the following spiraling leverage cannot continue indefinitely at some point the bubble becomes too big and cannot be subsumed by a bigger bubble â the damage of its burst would become irreparable therefore when that moment comes the market faces a dilemma one of the choices is to persist in the above mentioned â state of exception â to wit we continue to operate in a regulated environment leverage is limited but care is taken not to overconfine the system so we avoid the japanese scenario while this appears as a prudent approach to reality it implies giving up all the ideas of unlimited growth something that made us economy look better than the rest of the world compared to what we have seen before this means settling for much less than this country is used to aspiring although a reasonable proposition it is emotionally a difficult choice that is and will remain subject to substantial political manipulation it is unlikely that populist narrative will not continue to challenge this choice as kocic suggested that is a decidedly unpalatable proposition â especially in the trump era â settling for lessâ is not at all consistent with trumpâ s amorphous maga promise in fact inherent in maga is a certain deliberate ambiguity that implies an infinitely high bar â as trump himself put it on the campaign trail in 2016 â youâ re going to say mr president stop itâ s too much winning and iâ m going to say â no we have to win more â â fast forward three years and trump continues to lament the forces he claims have kept the us economy from delivering emerging market like growth just last week in davos for example he blamed boeing ba hurricanes and of course monetary policy for holding america back economically but if abandoning the dream of blistering growth is a proposition too hard to swallow and if it would have been a bitter pill before itâ s been rendered even more so for large swaths of the american electorate in the trump era we risk making decisions that catapult us from the lower left quadrant in figure 10 shown above into the upper right quadrant hereâ s what kocic said in 2017 flirting with high tail risk deregulation and deficit spending could result exactly due to abandoning the first path as its direct challenge under political pressure that american economy can restore its old status and resume its pace of the previous decades this is a serious tail risk as it is playing against the backdrop of considerable overhang of the post 2008 one side positioning central banks are massively short convexity in this scenario any inflationary maneuver or anything that would be a bear steepener of the curve could force disorderly unwind of the bond trade and reinforce the trend thus creating another crisis from which there could be no way out that might seem far fetched at a time when the fed and central banks in general are struggling to bring inflation up to target indeed the disinflationary impulse is now so vexing that both the fed and the ecb have embarked on wholesale rethinks of their policy frameworks in 2020 itâ s the lack of a bear steepener thatâ s disconcerting as market participants fret that renewed bull flattening means faith in the reflation narrative which defined the fourth quarter is slipping and yet through it all the risk outlined in that last excerpted passage from kocic has never truly gone away an explosive bear steepening episode that forces a disorderly unwind of the still entrenched â duration infatuationâ in all its various manifestations would likely be highly destabilizing as my good friend kevin muir points out whenever he gets the opportunity inflation is the most underappreciated risk in the market today and itâ s always the one nobody sees coming that sparks the next crisis i can only hope that if prince is wrong and the boom bust cycle is not in fact dead that iâ ll be as sure footed as i was in 2008 the trick then wasnâ t so much being â smartâ or hewing to some amorphous buffett aphorism about being â greedy when others are fearful â rather i viewed the situation as binary â either the world was ending or it wasnâ t sometime in the summer of 2014 i was standing in line at a shop in grand central with about 10 minutes to spare before i had to catch the metro north to the tuckahoe station i got a text from mikey who had read something online that briefly quoted me also quoted in the same piece was one of the most famous hedge fund managers on the planet mikey doesnâ t know what a â hedge fundâ is and there was no chance he understood the context of the article but that didnâ t matter he saw my name and it made him feel like a vicarious â somebody â and that was ironic because i felt the same way about that article â i was vicariously

ignoring the dissenting voices of workers the federal government is intent on raiding a portion of the pension funds to overcome the misgivings the national economic council is on a charm offensive couching its words in woolly statements meant to persuade workers whose future is dangling precariously essentially nec chaired by vice president yemi osinbajo with the 36 state governors and the central bank of nigeria governor as members is unwavering in its daring bid to utilise n2 trillion out of the pension funds for infrastructure upgrade if the mismanagement that defined the pension schemes before 2004 is anything to go by then this is a suicidal undertaking that should not be allowed data from the national pensions commission and national bureau of statistics are categorical on how the funds were invested 71 43 per cent or n6 84 trillion of the funds is invested in the federal government of nigeria securities bonds and treasury bills the remaining percentage has been taken up by mutual funds state government securities at n125 24 billion or 1 31 per cent and other instruments bearing in mind that government had generated trillions of naira in the past with nothing to show for it and is borrowing heavily to fund the excessively high cost of governance there are legitimate fears that it might soon ruin the future of retiring workers if it is able to dip its itchy fingers into the pension pot truly infrastructure has recently become an asset class in its own right for private sector investors mostly notably pension funds here infrastructure is yet to be an ideal asset class undoubtedly nigeria is running a dysfunctional economy morbidly dependent on crude oil revenue this pedestrian economy is short on revenue high on debts and recurrent extremely reliant on imports for goods it can produce like petroleum products and basic foods suffers from massive corruption and inefficient deployment of resources all this makes for imminent disaster therefore government cannot be trusted with the hard earned pension of workers fiscally the nigerian government is living on borrowed time always biting off more than it can chew a new cbn report says that the federal government recorded a n4 62 trillion deficit in 2019 that year its highest expenditure went on recurrent at n4 05 trillion out of a budget of n8 9 trillion this is an unworkable economic paradigm it is wrong for the country to keep allocating more resources to consumption government ought to provide infrastructure not fritter resources on few public office holders and civil servants at the same time government cannot meet its expensive lifestyle part of which is that its lawmakers are overpaid for mediocre productivity petrol alone cost nigeria n2 95 trillion to import in 2018 the nbs said illogically the federal government is reluctant to privatise the four loss making refineries that gulped about 400 million between 2013 and 2015 such a policy is irrational because the private sector can run these assets profitably read also pension funds should be invested not borrowed group additionally the cbn coughed up 10 02 billion to the different strata of the market in the third quarter of 2019 and 9 98 billion in q4 2019 to stabilise the naira the bank said nigeria s unwillingness to liberalise is thus hurting the economy deeply like all its predecessors this regime has yet to privatise the ajaokuta steel company the toll of government control is obvious to cover up government resorts to borrowing as of september 2019 the country had a debt outlay of n26 21 trillion or 85 3 billion the debt management office figures state imprudently government deceives itself that its debt to gdp ratio is less than the 25 per cent threshold recommended by the multilateral organisations but what is the repayment plan when debt servicing gulps over n2 trillion annually on the average sentimentally nec states that the n2 trillion will be pumped into revamping the rails roads and electricity inasmuch as these are desirable it cannot forcibly divert pension funds to these sectors its statist policy in the rail and electricity sector discourages private capital uneconomically it is building a modern railway network with public resources when it lacks the resources to do so this hinders private operators coming in to take up the slack in power it admits that after the november 2013 privatisation it has channelled n1 7 trillion to stabilise the sector without the expected result in fact if the entire n2 trillion is poured into the sector there is no prospect that any improvement will be recorded the government is even too weak to bring economic offenders to book a few well placed nigerians owe over n5 trillion that the assets management corporation of nigeria deployed in bailing their firms out of the 2008 economic crisis this money is double the n2 trillion it is looking for in the same vein borrowing the n2 trillion through private bonds is blatantly unreasonable all the funds to private organisations like the aviation fund and textile fund went down into a bottomless hole and unaccounted for and the offenders are walking free the main argument that pension funds are deployed in building infrastructure in other parts of the world is self serving and dangerous it is a half truth in those countries the ratio of the pension funds to gdp is substantial according to the paris based organisation for economic co operation and development the pension funds to gdp ratio in australia 132 6 per cent canada 85 6 per cent chile 70 2 per cent iceland 150 8 per cent the netherlands 171 0 per cent switzerland 126 9 per cent the united kingdom 104 5 per cent and the united states 76 3 per cent these countries can conveniently afford to put a slice in infrastructure without jeopardising the future of their workers there too the infrastructure market is well developed and properly regulated also the argument of kaduna state governor nasir el rufai that the pension funds are partly government money is insulting it is purely contributors money why is the regime adamant on ruining a good thing that emerged from the ashes of the discredited defined benefit scheme in which pensioners retired into penury and died in abject poverty in contrast nigeria s pension funds to gdp ratio was 6 7 per cent as of 2018 oecd data this is inconsequential it should first be strengthened with the right policies nigerians should feel free to take this up through dialogue and class action litigation if government does not renounce its intention to build the much needed infrastructure government has several options before it first it should withdraw from the rail and electricity sectors the money it saves from there should be used to intensify the construction of roads and provide other social services critically it should get the railway act 1955 repealed to promote private capital intervention in addition it should instil investor confidence in the infrastructure market through proper regulatory framework experts have warned against the risk of infrastructure nationalism on november 29 211 the british government reportedly unveiled a plan to encourage not force large scale pension investment in infrastructure it should resist the temptation of tampering with the pension reform act 2004 to satisfy its ambition to build infrastructure this was the case with argentina when its then president cristina fernandez manipulated the parliament and seized the country s 30 billion pension funds instantly international investors confidence wobbled the outcome was that that country s economy went into a free fall the cost of governance is just too high this should be scientifically reduced with a debt overhang government is still creating the impression that it is rich it is not government should reduce drastically the presidential air fleet cut the vulgar emoluments of public officers and live frugally in line with the current harsh economic realities rather than secure all manner of debts according to an oecd report previously pension fund exposure to infrastructure has been via listed companies such as utilities or via real estate portfolios however some larger funds globally are beginning to invest via private equity funds or occasionally even directly australian canadian and dutch pension funds may be considered as leaders in this field however barriers to such investment still exist not least from the political risks involved with such long term investments and the experience of pension funds around the world with such assets has not always been positive such challenges only multiply if investment in projects in developing countries is considered this is the caveat pencom the regulating authority should not put pension funds in undue risk political office holders are birds of passage they have no stake in the pension funds as such they should not be allowed to tamper with the future of workers so whatever it does government should keep away from the pension funds to avoid argentina s disastrous experience copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other

slower economic activity has led to a scenario where even existing jobs are being lost not to mention the millions that were never created pti photo did finance minister nirmala sitharaman present a feel good budget or did she show up empty handed will this budget provide the necessary impetus to spur economic growth in india or is it bereft of any cogent strategy to lead an economic recovery why didn t the government simply break free from the so called fiscal responsibility norms and spend heavily as many have demanded to boost growth if the government is not spending by itself then what is the central idea of the budget as she rose to present her second union budget in the space of seven months the finance minister had an unenviable task that is because india s economic growth rate which was the fastest in the world until about 2017 has since slowed significantly what was the context of the budget in 2019 20 which is the current financial year the real gross domestic product gdp growth is expected to touch a six year low of 5 per cent the situation is worse if one looks at nominal gdp growth which is expected to fall to a 42 year low of just 7 5 per cent real gdp is nothing but the nominal gdp minus the rate of inflation advertisement from farm sector to personal finance here s the indian express full coverage of budget 2020 if this was just a momentary dip in the growth rate possibly because of strife in one sector of the economy the worry may not have been too much but the fact despite the government s strenuous denials is that the indian economy has been losing power in one engine of growth after another and that during the past 12 months the slowdown has intensified rapidly it has in the process also exposed weaknesses of the indian economy which are generally hidden when times are good slower economic activity has led to a scenario where even existing jobs are being lost not to mention the millions that were never created the resultant decline in incomes has been compounded by a sudden unexpected and sharp rise in food inflation towards the end of 2019 what is the problem with the economy broadly there are four engines that provide the power to drive gdp growth in an economy these are consumption of private individuals c demand for goods from the government g investments from businesses i and the net demand from exports and imports nx gdp c g i nx advertisement as mentioned earlier with each passing year the indian economy has been losing its engines of growth the corporate investments i engine has been slowing sharply since 2011 this has happened because most businesses that took loans in the preceding decade when the going was good found their bets failing in the aftermath of the global financial crisis as such most businesses that could be expected to invest in the economy were hamstrung as they were severely over leveraged the new businesses found that the financiers to the economy that is the banks especially the public sector banks which accounted for 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all lending were themselves struggling with non performing assets many of these npas were the same loans that they had extended to the big businesses who were now hamstrung thanks to domestic bottlenecks and a middling global demand net exports nx were struggling this trend was not helped by a renewed wave of trade protectionism across the world reflected in events like brexit in europe and the trade war between the united states and china advertisement that left only c and g that is private consumption and government expenditure as the engines of growth private consumption demand was first hurt in the rural areas with poor commodity prices while this meant that retail inflation was under control the purchasing power of farmers declined this weakness in rural demand was compounded by a collapse in urban demand after credit flow from the non banking financial sector companies stopped following the meltdown in il fs this is being witnessed in the sales slump across the board from cars to shampoo sachets government demand carried the day for a considerable time but with a sharp fall in revenues thanks to a slowing growth there is no way the government can spend without massively flouting the fiscal responsibility and budget management frbm act targets advertisement the finance minister has promised a lot of small but meaningful changes that may make it easier for the economic activity to happen if they are implemented in right earnest the finance minister has promised a lot of small but meaningful changes that may make it easier for the economic activity to happen if they are implemented in right earnest what were the options before the government in the indian context c or private consumption demand accounts for roughly 57 per cent of total gdp investments i are the next big chunk accounting for 32 per cent government spending g is the smallest contributor with net exports nx being negative for india under normal circumstances it would have been natural for the government to increase its expenditure and thereby provide a strong growth impulse to the economy that is because what the government spends turns into someone s personal income this income when spent again say on buying a car or a bar of soap generates more economic activity and further incomes in the run up to the budget many had argued that this is what the government should do but these are not normal circumstances a slowing economy has upset the government s tax collections as such because the nominal gdp grew by just 7 5 per cent in 2019 20 instead of the budgeted growth of 12 per cent the gross tax revenues of the government fell from rs 24 61 195 crore to rs 21 63 423 crore that is a shortfall of rs 3 lakh crore advertisement the government could have still gone ahead and borrowed more money from the market but here too there was a problem of supply in other words there weren t enough savings in the market to fuel government demand as such the total expenditure of the government is slated to go up by just over 9 per cent over fy20 s budgeted figure the other option was to boost investments to a great extent the government had already tried to do this outside the budget when it announced a sharp cut in corporate income tax last year the tax cut cost the government over rs 1 5 lakh crore in 2019 20 with little to show in terms of new investment activity to be sure investment decisions are not taken in a hurry and even though the corporate tax cut was a welcome decision and one that is likely to benefit the indian economy in the medium to long term at present in the immediate term it has been ineffectual that is because investments follow demand and consumer demand has been declining sharply this has resulted in high unsold inventories and is reflected in capacity utilisation falling to an all time low late last year advertisement still the finance minister announced that there will soon be a scheme to encourage investments for the manufacturing of mobile phones electronic equipment and semi conductor packaging similarly she has allowed the electricity generating companies to benefit from the corporate tax cut that left the biggest driver private consumption demand and by the looks of it the government has tried its best to nudge people to consume more and by that route kickstart a virtuous cycle the government has tried to do this by providing people with some options that enhance their disposable income however in the process it has disincentivised savings the best example of this is the option of a new income tax regime which removes all exemptions and deductions but also cuts the tax rates the government likely hopes that taxpayers will be enthused to opt for this structure because it is likely to leave them with more money in hand this is likely to be especially true for those taxpayers who are young and lie towards the lower end of the income brackets that is because in that age and income brackets the so called marginal propensity to consume is higher the richer and higher salaried workers tend to save most of their income advertisement what else has been done the finance minister has promised a lot of small but meaningful changes that may make it easier for the economic activity to happen if they are implemented in right earnest for instance the budget outlines several measures to incentivise start ups in the country similarly for msmes too there was relief from the compliance burden as the finance minister raised the turnover threshold for auditing of accounts for small retailers traders shopkeepers etc five times from rs 1 crore to rs 5 crore will this strategy boost growth this is not a big bang budget by any measure in essence the government has tinkered with several different aspects of the economy even this tinkering has been made possible only after it has announced that it will stray from the frbm act path for two consecutive years fy20 and fy21 essentially the government is hoping that its belief that the slowdown is temporary and that it has bottomed out is true and that with a little nudge to consumers and businesses the economy will dig itself out of the current trough if not in fy21 then by fy22 however nothing can be said for certain there is no way right now to estimate how far disposable incomes could or would increase or indeed if when people do get some additional cash they would spend it at all a spurt in business activity is directly dependent on consumption demand increasing advertisement and that is where the threat to the bid for a recovery lies there are many ways in which the plan can go wrong what if private consumption demand doesn t go up substantially or what if the government is not able to raise the budgeted revenues from tax and non tax sources this is especially true about disinvestment the government hopes to raise rs 2 1 lakh crore in fy21 but it raised just about rs 66 000 crore in fy20 editorial budget is an admission of govt s limitations in fast tracking growth could the government have done something else at one level this budget has exposed the failings of the government when it comes to fiscal health the fact is that the government seems to have run out of revenues just when it needed them the most and it is a reflection of not doing more towards achieving fiscal rectitude when the economy was growing rapidly to be fair this limited the government s ability to do a lot but there is one telling example of where the government missed out even under the current restrictions that s in the data related to trends for fiscal deficit or the net borrowings by the government from the market and revenue deficits the gap between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts for fy20 and fy21 the budget shows that over these two years while the fiscal deficit is expected to decline the revenue deficit is expected to increase opinion p chidambaram writes take away from the budget speech is that the bjp has given up on reviving the economy what this essentially means is that the government will be increasingly using its borrowings to fund revenue expenditure not capital expenditure there is a big difference between the two when it comes to how it pushes economic growth research has shown that in india when government spends rs 100 on building capital such as roads and bridges the economy gains rs 250 however when government spends rs 100 on revenue such as salaries the economy gains just rs 99 sukanya

it s state of the union time and one of the few bright spots so it seems is the u s economy preoccupied by impeachment politics has descended into acrimonious anarchy we are at loggerheads with our traditional allies the spreading coronavirus casts a cloud of dread meanwhile the economy plods along at about a 2 percent annual growth rate though unspectacular this has been steady enough to reduce the unemployment rate from a peak of 10 percent in 2009 to 3 5 percent the lowest since the 1960s it s hard not to admire the economy s resilience after the great recession there was a palpable fear that the economy would perform poorly the downturn was the worst since the great depression of the 1930s when the annual unemployment rate hit a high of 25 percent but nothing like that has happened recently given this record it s plausible that the u s economy and maybe the global economy too has escaped another severe slump the federal reserve and other important central banks the bank of japan the european central bank and the bank of england have kept interest rates low advertisement the strategy has been to sustain the recovery allowing consumers and companies to regain confidence and for the least employable workers to find jobs in that sense economic policy is also social policy federal reserve chair jerome h powell has repeatedly argued that prolonging the economic expansion now the longest in u s history in its 11th year is needed to spread low unemployment s benefits yes at some point there will be another recession we haven t yet conquered the business cycle but the next downturn need not be a disaster since world war ii there have been 12 recessions as dated by the national bureau of economic research nber a group of mostly academic economists the nber usually declares a recession if the economy s output or gross domestic product declines for two consecutive quarters advertisement it can be argued that the present slow rate of economic growth is safer than a burst of faster growth that though initially pleasurable creates instability by encouraging financial speculation that s what happened with the housing crisis of the early 2000s credit standards had weakened and millions of homeowners defaulted on their mortgages could it happen again well yes under certain circumstances some sort of global credit collapse is conceivable with global growth already so slow any negative shock such as a worldwide pandemic could tip countries into recession indeed many economists think the seeds of a crisis have already been planted there can be no doubt that we have been experiencing a global credit market bubble that an unprecedented and prolonged period of ultra easy monetary policy writes economist desmond lachman of the american enterprise institute for the bulwark a conservative website advertisement the same dynamic applies to stock markets low interest rates induce investors to put their money in stocks pushing prices up global stock markets are frothy says lachman u s equity prices have increased now by more than threefold since their nadir in march 2009 share this article share the amounts of new credit are sizable according to data from the institute of international finance iif a research and advocacy group for banks and other financial institutions in late 2019 the iif estimated total global debt at nearly 253 trillion up from slightly more than 200 trillion in 2012 these figures include government business and household debt the crucial questions involve how much of this debt is going to solid borrowers with the ability to repay or whether it s fueling dubious loans for risky projects by weak borrowers in some countries the united states brazil the added debt comes from governments elsewhere the heavy borrowing has favored households south korea or businesses china including state owned enterprises advertisement the implications for economic stability are plain if countries can t develop self generating sources of economic demand that is unless they can wean themselves off credit induced demand they risk becoming vulnerable to doubts that eventually lenders won t continue lending either borrowers default or lenders cut off credit to protect their money this leads to a credit squeeze that depending on the economy s condition could be weak or powerful then the government often the central bank such as the federal reserve intervenes to prevent a full fledged collapse that s what happened in the 2008 2009 financial crisis any verdict on the economy s true state must be tentative it depends on the basic strengths of the united states and on how or whether the credit injections translate into sustainable growth for us and for much of the rest of the world economic interdependence is a cliche but it s also a reality we depend on other nations and they depend on us advertisement read more from robert samuelson s archive
until friday night it appeared neither fire disease nor war could stop it a seemingly unstoppable force for months global stocks have been on a relentless bull run powered by the sheer weight of money a debilitating trade war that has chipped away at global growth and left european powerhouse economies on their knees couldn t dent the enthusiasm each time the market faltered the white house wheeled out the prospect of a truce and punters dived back in even the prospect of a military conflagration in the middle east sailed blithely past the trading desk jockeys as they pushed company valuations into the stratosphere we ve been a little late to the party but once aboard there has been no looking back from new year s eve on even as the nation burned our stock market went wild punching through new records as it piled on almost 7 per cent in just a few weeks the unwelcome and frightening arrival of the coronavirus may change all that on friday night wall street took a backward step while the market reaction has been decidedly muted it s now becoming clear that the pandemic has the potential to hit our national income and tip the economy into a period of contraction possibly even recession that prospect will weigh heavily on reserve bank officials as they gather around the table in martin place tomorrow for the first time in two months if you believe the financial market pundits there s almost no chance the rba will cut rates but with the devastating toll of the bushfires yet to be tallied and the prospect of a complete shutdown of our most lucrative tourism market for several months the odds of an interest rate cut are significantly higher than the 10 per cent chance predicted just a few days ago tied to china china some say we have an unhealthy relationship with the middle kingdom that we are too reliant on one nation one third of all our trade is done with china chinese tourists now generate around 20 billion of export revenue for australia up from just 3 billion in 2003 supplied ubs not only is it our biggest export market for minerals but it also ranks number one in our third biggest export tourism ironically it s a health issue creating ructions in our economic relationship last week as the coronavirus infections gathered pace beijing decreed that all outbound group tours would be halted for two months last year almost 1 5 million chinese tourists visited australia with the most lucrative portion being the 165 000 students in our universities and colleges student cancellations are flooding in with serious flow on effects to those who provide housing and other services if previous health contagion events are anything to go by the economic impact while severe is likely to be temporary but at this point it is impossible to quantify the damage to our economy where things could get messy is if the virus hits asian region and global growth which has the potential to seriously damage our sputtering economy beijing on the weekend announced yet another stimulus program adding to its already eyewatering debt levels even worse this comes as a catastrophic bushfire season is still in full swing the entire world has been focused on australia and fires and there is no doubt our reputation as a safe tourism destination has taken a battering which could last well beyond this year even treasurer josh frydenberg conceded yesterday on abc s insiders that he was concerned the fires and the virus had the potential to hit investment consumption and trade what we do know is that these events outside our control are going to have a significant impact on the australian economy he said money markets tipping swift action stock markets may have merely taken a breather from their relentless march northward but the reaction on debt markets has been swift and severe us government bonds a safe haven for worried capital are in hot demand as cash floods in money markets are making a bet that the virus will hit global growth and that america will be forced to cut interest rates yet again it s a similar story here bond yields have slumped in anticipation of a rate cut in the near future if not tomorrow then within the next few months the australian dollar has slumped around 4 per cent in a month for the past week most financial commentary has focused around a recovery in the local economy inflation was gathering pace and unemployment improved they argued while the headline numbers suggested some much welcomed relief a dig beneath the surface revealed a drop in full time employment and core inflation stubbornly below rba targets even without the crippling impact of the twin disasters confronting us further rate cuts seem almost inevitable china now accounts for 38 per cent of australia s exports up from 8 per cent in 2003 supplied ubs why the disconnect with stock markets back in october something weird happened a relatively obscure part of the us money market known as the repo market ran out of cash it s officially called the repurchase market and it allows banks to lend to one another overnight using high quality collateral like us treasury notes interest rates which had been hovering between 1 and 2 per cent suddenly jumped to 10 per cent and more the main reason appeared to be that america s central bank the us federal reserve had been winding back the stimulus it injected into the market as part of its desperate moves to reignite the us economy after the global financial crisis it was trying to gradually retrieve the cash it had injected wall street sputtered as the cash shortage hit stocks and in a panic the us fed again began injecting cash into the system us federal reserve reigniting cash splash between august and now it has pumped more than 400 billion into the us economy around two thirds of the money it had withdrawn in the previous 18 months between august and now the us federal reserve has pumped more than 400 billion into the us economy supplied us federal reserve as it did wall street again took off and global stock markets followed all of which leaves the us with a dilemma how on earth will it ever be able to wean americans off stimulus without causing a stock market crash fed boss jerome powell knows only too well that a wall street collapse would most likely precipitate a recession so from now on it is likely global interest rates will remain low and are likely to be cut again if only to keep stocks afloat add in a global crisis like a health pandemic and rate cuts are a certainty us president donald trump may be right it seems the system really is rigged

last week millions of vendors suppliers and sundry service providers took to emails voice calls whatsapp and other chatbox platforms to align figures with clients and replace invoices ahead of the take off of the new value added tax vat rate with effect from yesterday costs of vatable goods and services increased by 2 5 per cent an unpleasant marginal add on that may not in itself cause an atrocious upset as it ordinarily appears but as typical of any economic analysis the devil is hidden in its multiplier effects close to three decades since the general ibrahim babangida s regime introduced vat via decree 102 there has never been an evident reform of the consumption tax in the scale of what is now being witnessed the federal government which says that only 15 per cent of vat comes to its coffers while the other federating units share the remaining 85 per cent only recently realised that nigeria s vat is among the least in africa in strict monetary terms the country s vat is low when compared with its peers the standard vat in kenya is 16 per cent in south africa it is 15 per cent while egypt imposes a 14 per cent vat charge standard vat is gaining currency as countries are increasingly realising that a flat vat is retrogressive for instance kenya does not vat food items in some countries also certain sizes of purchases are vat refundable a sort of discriminatory approach making it rather progressive european countries such as malta sweden turkey spain poland and germany have all set minimum purchases that qualify for vat refunds vat when it is discriminatory as common in different regions that have embraced the form of tax is not a mere revenue generating medium but a fiscal policy used to address income inequality and achieve specific economic objectives hence food items and other essential commodities are exempted in many climes countries have also used vat to incentivise the consumption of professional services vat on professional service in egypt for one is lower than the standard rate vat can indeed be progressive when it takes more money from the rich and improves the economic wellbeing of the poor and this includes raising substantially their net revenues it is much when this is even complemented with better public utilities and social welfare which depends largely on how the government uses the tax revenue unfortunately the federal government has no history of efficiency in public spending but notorious for extravagance and misappropriation a major worry as an average nigerian ponders over heavier tax burden one hundred and sixty eight countries have adopted vat by whatever names a tax collected in small bits at every stage of production but whose burden lies on the final consumers however when an economy is desirous of raising its public revenue profile vat is often not the first port of call perhaps because of its extreme distortionary capacity vat like every consumption tax and income tax affects individuals purchasing power consumption ability to save and invest these three variables affect and are affected by the productive capacity of the economy vat is not just any other tax as nigerians are wont to believe it is directly linked with the speed and scope of the growth of the economy countries that have realised this do not see it as a government s automated teller machine atm but an enabler and economic restructuring tool compare vat with property or capital gain tax property or capital gain taxes are not targeted at those at the bottom of the economic pyramid whose marginal propensity to consume is strong enough to keep the factories open but the wealthy it is thus not happenstance that some leading economies think more of capital gain taxes when they want to plug short term holes in their public finances and less of consumption taxes again this raises another fundamental challenge about the country s public sector administration an absence of proper documentation in which case it seems that vat increase is convenience policy the argument by the minister of finance zainab ahmed and other public officials to the effect that nigeria s vat is the least in the world is not only seen as uninspiring but also seems to have narrowed the government s thinking of the tax as a money machine also the argument by the senate president ahmed lawan that the purchasing power of an average nigerian would not be affected as the increment in vat was targeted at luxury items seems to have betrayed the government s lack of understanding of how the economy works is electricity not going to be affected by the new rate are telecommunication service and banking services also exempted from vat or is the senate unaware that the poor also enjoy these that the government has been magnanimous in its vat rate is a ruse nigeria s tax system in its entirety deviates from the underlining principles of taxation efficiency fairness and conveniance weighed against global practices and the underpinnings of the concept of social contract nigeria ordinarily does not have any business in tax collection despite the federal government s claim of a robust anti graft campaign nigeria sits at the bottom of global corruption index the reason prof godwin owoh a renowned economist and consultant to the world bank said that the country should not be mentioned in the same sentence with a tax increase at this critical time of its life according to him corruption is the biggest tax burden on an average nigerian when a country is extremely corrupt as nigeria currently is he said the malfeasance is a tax on the citizens and it is so costly that it has reduced millions of nigerians to abject poverty and perpetual misery owoh also argued that increasing vat to fund deficit without a commensurate downward review of bloated political office holders allowances is as structurally defective as it is morally wrong this shows that the government is only interested in high volume cash to play with you cannot raise vat and maintain unjustified public officers salaries and allowances it does not show that the government means well for the country and can be taken seriously he stated a report by the nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti and trust africa indicates that the country loses between 15b and 18b yearly through illicit financial flows iff that figure could fund nigeria s annual budget about 10 years ago the upper range of the estimate can fund half of the 2020 budget the funds which are stolen by public officials and their cronies are originally meant for construction and rehabilitation of roads hospitals schools bridges and sundry projects as well as for the provision of security pension and to increase power supply each day hundreds rebate the looting of public resources via deaths illness epidemics gridlock waste of man hours unemployment loss of investment fire incidents and dozens of other made made misfortunes that are not supposed to be challenges if the government were responsive responsible and committed to the social contract it entered into with the people nigerian households are possibly the highest spenders on supposed public utilities with each new public policy or law comes an assurance of a better future sadly the citizens realise each day that the share of spending on security health basic education power roads etc which the government should have used their taxes to provide for free has continued to balloon and take an increasingly larger share of their incomes when nigerians say each family is a local government it is a real complaint that manifests in the monthly household budgets on neighbourhood security generator fuel children s education and others the common challenges nigerians are grappling with are taken for granted in most countries that the federal government races to catch up with in terms of vat rate ghana a neighbouring country whose vat the government has benchmarked its argument provides quality free basic education to its citizens whereas nigerians are too ashamed to register their wards in public schools once upon a time those eager to relocate abroad were mostly young graduates artisans poorly remunerated individuals and the unemployed the trend is becoming increasingly common among middle class and high flying professionals a situation chief economist of pwc nigeria dr andrew nevin says is deepening skill shortage in the country while the youths are fleeing for lack of economic opportunities established professionals are moving their families abroad in search of better living conditions especially for their children the drift underscores the sorrowful state of the country s infrastructure and public services that the government has long abdicated the current inflationary pressure requires contractionary fiscal policy but this sort of measure is most effective when the inflation is caused by an excess supply of money but nigeria s inflation is largely cost push which could be best tackled by addressing the supply factors chief of which are defective market structure exchange rate volatility and infrastructure the government will achieve a better result by addressing these inadequacies which however require more thinking when economy bleeds like nigeria s currently does what is required are expansionary tactics that increase consumption production and increase jobs in fact this is the thinking that has made quantitative easing a fanciful economic theory despite its tendency towards inflation president barack obama literally dashed americans money via his famous stimulus package to buy back a booming economy when he assumed office in 2009 obama s decision then sure had vagaries of hiccups but it did bail an ailing us economy this is the thinking when an economy contracts tightening consumption with higher taxes is not a solution to fixing a bleeding economy like nigeria
an outbreak of a novel coronavirus appeared in wuahn china just ahead of the lunar new year holiday the period of the largest annual human migration on earth what if the most terrible scenarios about the coronavirus come true and the disease outpaces the measures taken by the international community and china itself the peak of the new epidemic in china may come in february with that in mind let us think about the possible geopolitical and geoeconomic consequences the coronavirus outbreak coincided with an economic slowdown as china contends with rising debt cooling domestic demand and aggressive u s tariffs the 6 1 percent gdp growth rate for 2019 was near the bottom of beijing s target range and sharply down on the previous year s 6 6 percent on january 15 china and the united states signed an interim trade deal the first steps toward the end of u s china trade war but the celebration was short lived as just a few days later the severity of the coronavirus began to become clear an outbreak in china s industrial heartland wuhan the capital of hubei province is at the center of the chinese industrial heartland looking at a map this city is located in the very middle of the industrial square of the country the area bounded by beijing tianjin chengdu chongqing macau hong kong and shanghai hubei province is home to seven crucial economic zones hubei jingzhou chengnan economic development zone wuhan east lake high tech development zone china s largest production center for optical electronic products wuhan economic and technological development zone wuhan export processing zone wuhan optical valley guanggu software park is in wuhan east lake high tech development zone and xiangyang new and hi tech industrial development zone wuhan in particular boasts the largest river port in china and the largest airport of central china whereas in the national economy of china saw a growth slowdown in 2019 wuhan saw higher growth at 7 8 percent according to the hubei provincial government the added value of high tech sectors and digital economy are estimated to account for 24 5 percent and 40 percent of the gdp wuhan s prospects looked bright for 2020 as well as the hubei government noted over 300 of the world s top 500 companies have settled in wuhan the number of newly added high tech companies hit a record high with a net increase of about 900 the government work report delivered at the 14th wuhan municipal people s congress ironically as the outbreak was gaining steam estimated that the gdp of wuhan would grow between 7 5 percent to 7 8 percent in 2020 with 220 000 new jobs created just a few weeks after this rosy outlook was given the terrible pictures from wuhan seem to many people in the world to be images from hollywood apocalyptic movies if the outbreak expands it could bring the fabric of the global economy to a halt beijing has already demonstrated that it is able to mobilize millions of people for the goal of containing the virus and simultaneously isolate millions of others from their families and friends hubei province with a population of 58 million of people has essentially been cut off from the entire country compare wuhan to california or more precisely to silicon valley and imagine the harm done to the national and global economy if the state was effectively shut down for weeks on end foreign and international companies react in a less dramatic scenario when beijing eventually soon triumphs over the virus the harm to the chinese and global economy might not be so great for example during the 2003 sars outbreak china s retail sales growth bottomed out at 4 3 percent but promptly rebounded and the third quarter growth clocked in at 9 7 percent similarly passenger transport fell by 42 percent and 22 percent in may and june 2003 respectively before bouncing back in september but there is potential for the outbreak to seriously harm the chinese economy and consequently the global economy japan s nissan and french groups psa and renault have stressed that they were going to stop production in china and would pull their foreign staff from the country global equity markets and oil prices are reacting rapidly to the events in china s p 500 nasdaq and dow indices all dropped by 1 5 percent or more on january 27 amid coronavirus fears the shanghai composite index dropped from its maximum of 3 115 on january 13 to 2 978 on january 23 according to andrew milligan head of global strategy at aberdeen standard investments even on the assumption that the authorities do get on top of this outbreak there will be some short term economic shock but he added that is a long way from saying the outlook for global markets will be materially different it s still early days however the general vision of many financial experts is that short term investors can be negatively impacted by the political and economic effects from the coronavirus as a case study alibaba group holding ltd provides a clear example of how the virus is already harming the chinese economy alibaba is a symbol of contemporary china as superpower its name is synonymous with chinese economic might unfortunately for alibaba the coronavirus now strikes at the very heart of its identity in almost in every country there are new stories about citizens fearful of deliveries from china including from the most famous chinese company alibaba group as a result the company s stock price has dropped from 231 on january 13 to a low of 2035 by january 28 sars coronavirus and gdp the economist intelligence unit estimates the novel coronavirus outbreak in china could reduce real gdp growth in 2020 by 0 5 1 percentage points the first economic victims were air carriers and travel companies the travel and tourism industries will be hit hard however some sectors like pharmaceutics e commerce and automotives could benefit the eiu s projected growth rate for china was 5 9 percent and if epidemic reaches the status of sars chinese gdp can drop to 4 9 percent the coronavirus has already infected more people than sars did but the latter was deadlier sars in 2003 killed 650 people while the current outbreak has a death toll of 171 it should be noted that in 2003 the chinese gdp was 1 6 billion versus 14 3 trillion in 2019 in 2003 chinese economy was the seventh largest now it is the world s second largest economy the role of china in the global market is indispensable in 2004 a year after the sars outbreak the u s national academy of sciences published a report on learning from sars in it scientists calculated the global economic loss from sars at close to 40 billion in 2003 this is a figure much greater than any calculation of the medical costs of treating sars patients the report noted in addition to purely humanitarian motivations beijing is trying to head off the most dangerous consequences of the epidemic so that it does not deliver another crushing blow to the economy as experienced in 2003 the numbers show how great the consequences are in 2019 during the chinese new year holiday retailers and restaurateurs profit exceeded 148 billion and tourism revenue exceeded 76 billion the talent deficit problem the consequences will run deeper than lost revenue however since 2010 china has started to think about international prestige in terms of soft power especially in the education and attraction of talented people from around the world so far china worked hard to change its image and invited as many foreign students and talented specialists as possible in 2017 2018 there were just under 12 000 u s students in china including 1 000 in wuhan compared to over 360 000 chinese students in the united states in 2019 there were 21 000 u s 20 000 russian 10 600 french and 14 200 japanese students in china according to the china ministry of education in hubei province alone there are 21 371 foreign students now all of china s success in attracting foreign talent in the last decade could be ruined by the spreading of this deadly virus european and north american countries have initiated the process of evacuating their nationals from wuhan where a quarantine is in effect if the coronavirus reaches a mass scale in other provinces we are going to witness organized flights from china on an unprecedented scale to western countries particularly geopolitical implications as it has already been stated the coronavirus is spreading amid the u s china trade war and a general slowdown of the chinese economy in order to tackle such great challenge china needs to mobilize the resources of the entire nation and its 1 4 billion people and yet those resources must now be diverted to fight an epidemic which could eventually force the chinese economy into hibernation and even necessitate a temporary withdrawal from world politics the geopolitical as well as economic consequences could be huge in the nearest future if beijing determines that given the dramatic situation temporary seclusion is the best measure cruel as it sounds the united states is the biggest beneficiary of the crisis the chinese economic slowdown will continue and it is still unclear how large the impact will be from the current crisis temporarily the balance of power might temporarily shift back in the united states favour currently groups of sovereign countries are striving for independent foreign policies which often contradicts the u s vision in particular iran china russia and now turkey are sure that when they join in one axis all members are capable of resisting the americans and the west in general but if one country is pushed out especially from the tripartite china russia iran axis the global balance of power would tilt in favor of the west thus the seclusion of china from the outside world would be a nightmare for russia and iran especially the diplomat
the rapid spread of the coronavirus will loom large in the minds of economists in the coming days as the number of global cases soars and the impact on commerce spreads while the world health organisation did not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade when it declared the outbreak a global health emergency more than two thirds of china s economy will remain closed as a result of the virus this week and disruption could spread further the us federal reserve and bank of england have both indicated they are closely monitoring the situation while economists are re examining their calls for 2020 expansion bloomberg economics forecasts the hit to growth will be most severe in china and ripple across the world back on the regular economic calendar the us is set to release its first jobs report for 2020 on friday while a raft of fed policymakers and peers from australia europe and canada are due to speak with donald trump staking his re election bid on the strength of the us economy that topic is set to feature in his state of the union address on tuesday meanwhile officials from the fed are back on the road speaking after their january decision to hold rates steady bank of canada deputy governor carolyn wilkins one of the front runners to take the top job at the central bank later this year speaks in toronto on wednesday in europe the euro area economy has looked on a somewhat surer footing recently despite a fourth quarter stumble that may prove short lived final purchasing managers indexes this week will offer more insight as will industrial production numbers from germany and france the region s biggest economies european central bank president christine lagarde who has been a bit more optimistic on the outlook will have a chance to give her take when she speaks to european policymakers on thursday russia enters the week with a sequence of economic data releases before holding its first interest rate meeting of the year on friday with growth data expected to show an expansion of only 1 3 per cent last year the government has come under pressure to boost the near stagnant economy inflation probably slowed to 2 5 per cent in january well below a target of 4 per cent set by the russian central bank which may cut its key rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent polish romanian and czech central bankers also meet this week in turkey inflation data on monday will probably show a reading of 11 9 per cent leaving real interest rates in negative territory following a cumulative 1 275 point reduction over the central bank s last five meetings the institution held its year end inflation projection at 8 2 per cent on thursday in asia china s returns after the lunar new year holiday was extended to curb the spread of a deadly new sars like virus that s likely to mark the largest remote work experiment to date as millions of people are being asked to log on from home the virus is set to curb travel and spending in hong kong which reports fourth quarter and full year gdp numbers on monday that will probably show the biggest full year contraction since 2009 central banks in australia thailand the philippines and india will also decide on interest rates in latin america brazilian policymakers are expected to cut the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on wednesday in their first board meeting of the year with the move following four previous half point cuts central bank president roberto campos neto has said that a food price shock at the end of last year is passing quickly while recent activity data fell short of analysts estimates the same day argentine economy minister martin guzman will meet with international monetary fund director kristalina georgieva on the sidelines of an event at the vatican the south american country s new government is looking to renegotiate billions of dollars of debt held by creditors and the imf
post brexit era is a concept that is subject to different interpretations first it can refer to the first referendum held in 1975 to determine whether or not britain should continue to sustain its membership of the then european economic community eec or should simply withdraw its membership since brexit is about withdrawing from the eec or politics of withdrawal brexiteering era can be argued to have begun in 1975 and we can rightly talk about the first post referendum withdrawal era secondly the word brexit is believed to have been coined from grexit withdrawal of greece from the eurozone by mr peter wilding to mean britain s withdrawal from the european union as noted in may 2012 peter wilding warned that unless a clear view is pushed that britain must lead in europe at the very least to achieve the completion of the single market then the portmanteau for greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word brexit this is the origin of the coinage if we are to reckon with the time of birth and first use of the word post brexit era can be rightly argued to begin after may 2012
in his news conference following the federal reserve s january meeting which wrapped up wednesday chairman jerome powell said the chinese coronavirus is a situation that bears watching even as he stressed that the fed s mandate would remain focused on u s economic growth powell also once again emphasized the many ways trade uncertainty has trickled into decisions made by executives and policymakers even as he sounded a reassuring town about the overall economic outlook uncertainties about the outlook remain including those posed by the new coronavirus powell said in his prepared remarks a theme he expanded on during the question and answer period it s a very significant issue he said of the virus which to date has sickened more than 7 700 people and killed 170 powell acknowledged the potential for worldwide disruption and uncertainty about macroeconomic effects in china saying we are very carefully monitoring the situation the issue with the coronavirus is we re not really clear on what this virus is all about said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america north pointed out that the sars epidemic of 2002 and 2003 spooked the markets but ultimately had little bearing on the trajectory of chinese gdp growth we think as does the futures market it s likely we ll see one more cut this year north said if the economic situation were to worsen between now and march if hiring were to slow or wages were to decelerate there s room for an insurance cut with rates running low if conditions warrant but the fed would hope not to use it said chris battifarano chief investment officer of finemark national bank trust the trio of rate cuts the fed undertook last year might have been enough to ward off an economic slump in the short term but powell as well as other market observers noted that these interventions leave policymakers with fewer tools to fight a recession in spite of numerous criticisms from president donald trump the federal reserve has stayed away from the negative interest rates that have characterized many other central bank approaches to monetary policy and powell indicated this wouldn t change anytime soon explaining that low interest rates could become a self fulfilling cycle from which economies can struggle to emerge we re determined to avoid it here in the united states he said it s become very clear that inflation is the problem that central banks can solve battifarano said but he pointed to japan s prolonged economic slump as a cautionary tale of how negative interest rates can play out long term not only does it not work it s damaging to banks traditional spread lending mode he said and analysts readily point out that the u s has thus far managed to avoid the broader economic weaknesses present in economies like japan and germany i do think they were able to preemptively act and give the market an additional cushion said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel fixed income they feel they were able to navigate this soft landing she said noting how powell worked to thread the needle between encouraging and cautious in his remarks on wednesday the consumer is still shouldering the entire economy said one analyst the fed wants to look reasonable in their acknowledgement about some of the downside risks she said powell also addressed the one significant change economists picked up on in the statement the bank released noticing that the fed shifted from characterizing household spending as moderate rather than strong piegza said this was significant given that powell s remarks emphasized the singular role the u s consumer is playing in sustaining the country s economic momentum it s hard to see other bright spots besides the consumer she said noting that metrics on manufacturing exports and business investment remain lackluster even with low unemployment and a soaring stock market the consumer is still shouldering the entire economy she said the chairman said progress on trade between the u s and china along with the signing of the usmca were beneficial but he emphasized that the businesses and markets still perceive cause for concern those are potentially positive things for the economy without question powell said but he added that a sustained reduction in uncertainty over time would be necessary to pull business investment out of its slump a reduction that currently is not present trade policy uncertainty remains elevated it hasn t gone away powell said there s a bit of a wait and see attitude some experts also pointed out that it still is unclear whether or not the reduction in trade tensions will benefit american workers and shoppers we don t know how that s going to trickle down yet to the u s consumer said brian pirri principal of new england investment retirement group it s a positive that there was an initial deal done and a holding off on some of the tariffs but i think it s too early to say it s going to have a meaningful impact on the u s and the consumer he said
daniel axelrod daxelrod th record com it didn t kill the residential real estate market it just made it stronger a high performing mid hudson housing market persisted last year despite a lack of affordable inventory according to the latest market data bolstered by strong national and local economies and low interest rates orange sullivan and ulster counties remained sellers markets for median priced single family homes in 2019 local realtors said following the release of year end figures orange county s sales total for single family homes fell 4 2 percent to 3 672 in 2019 according to statistics from the hudson gateway association of realtors but that s because of a lack of homes to buy local realtors said indeed the county s inventory of unsold listed single family homes fell 5 9 percent to 1 588 down from 1 687 in 2018 that tally is nearly identical to 2017 s year end total 1 686 but down from a whopping 2 115 as recently as 2016 when properties are priced well and marketed right they go said ron garafalo middletown office manager for john j lease realtors and hgar s 2019 president some people are expanding their search saying i want to be in this town but i m having trouble finding something so i ll consider this town as well orange county s median price for single family homes meanwhile continued its steady rise increasing 4 8 percent to 271 000 up from 258 000 in 2018 243 000 in 2017 and 228 000 in 2016 the average number of days on the market for orange county s single family homes rose slightly 5 1 percent to 116 days from 111 in 2018 but the 2019 year end total is still down markedly from 165 days in 2016 the local market for multi family homes also gained strength as investors looked for larger returns than low interest certificates of deposit garafalo said two hundred forty seven sold in orange county in 2019 a 2 6 percent increase from 2018 as their median price skyrocketed 26 7 percent to 209 000 from 165 000 orange county s condo market stayed hot in 2019 with the median price climbing 16 7 percent to 185 500 an increase from 174 600 in 2018 164 200 in 2017 and 146 600 just a few years ago in 2016 one reason for the condo market s strength condos are a more affordable option for those who ve been priced out of the single family home market especially first time and younger buyers local realtors and other experts said america s median age of first time home buyers is now 33 the oldest since recordkeeping dating to 1981 according to a recent national association of realtors report and the median age of all home buyers hit a new record of age 47 in 2019 following a third straight year of increases that overall median age was just 31 in 1981 young people face home buying challenges rising home prices and a shortage of local affordable housing are compounding difficulties young people already faced buying a home because they re over leveraged from student loans and other debts said joe czajka a senior vice president with hudson valley pattern for progress a local research institute and those challenges say nothing of the tighter lending standards banks have instituted since the last housing bubble burst czajka who said he s been calling the lack of affordable housing in the hudson valley a crisis for the past 30 years thinks the shortage of affordable options is worse than ever allowing younger generations to become home owners means local municipal leaders will have to allow for smaller subdivisions lots and homes and builders will have to accommodate young people s differing tastes too czajka said the younger demographic those 25 to 35 are not looking for the same home that those who are between 45 and 55 today are looking for czajka added young people don t want the 3 000 square foot mcmansion on two to five acres they want the 2 000 to 2 200 square foot home on a half acre or an acre nancy hernandez agreed the 27 year old mother to be and her partner struggled for eight months to find the 167 000 single family home that they re in the process of closing on in middletown after help from john j lease realtors most mid hudson homes on the market were far too big and unaffordable on her state corrections officer salary she said and then there was her partner s student loan debt and her credit card debt to contend with the homes that are listed are definitely above our comfortable price range and we re not looking to live outside our range where we have to work overtime said hernandez adding she didn t even attempt to find a home in her hometown of goshen given the prices and taxes

reaching 142 000 an 11 3 percent gain from 128 000 in 2018 and up from 118 750 in 2017 and 116 000 in 2016 year end inventory fell 12 3 percent to 752 unsold listed homes from 857 in 2018 a typical sullivan county single family home spent 165 days on the market in 2019 about the same as 2018 161 but down markedly from 201 days as recently as 2016 sullivan ulster markets remain hot sullivan county s economy like that of the state and neighboring orange and ulster counties just keeps humming said bill rieber thompson s supervisor and co owner of rieber realty in monticello from new hiring at major employers like the center for discovery to the addition of big employers such as the resorts world catskills casino and the kartrite resort indoor waterpark more sullivan county residents have a shot at home ownership rieber said i see people coming into the market now who three or four years ago didn t have a chance didn t have a job didn t make enough money couldn t get a mortgage said rieber adding that there s room for the county s median home price to rise much more over in ulster county single family home sales stayed nearly flat at 1 522 in 2019 versus 1 500 in 2018 according to the ulster county board of realtors but inventory fell precipitously 37 percent to 357 unsold homes from 566 at year s end in 2018 596 in 2017 and 708 in 2016 indicating that the market remains robust a typical ulster county single family home spent 101 days on the market in 2019 down from 108 in 2018 115 in 2017 and 134 in 2016 in ulster and sullivan counties respectively sales of

homeservices hudson valley properties among the most in demand markets in the county particularly for youngers homebuyers are kingston woodstock stone ridge new paltz saugertis and the town of shandaken safier said we re still in a situation where the inventory for most price points is too low in ulster county the demand is strong and the interest rates are very appealing said safier he added that ulster county s home prices and the number of single family homes sold are likely at their highest levels since just before the housing market went bust about 13 years ago one local issue a problem throughout the hudson valley is that affordable housing options are being swallowed up by short term rentals such as those offered via airbnb safier and pattern s czajka with the local economy and housing markets strong across the hudson valley we need more affordable product for a lot of the demographics so younger people and others who don t make as high of an income can enjoy home

by bola a akinterinwa post brexit era is a concept that is subject to different interpretations first it can refer to the first referendum held in 1975 to determine whether or not britain should continue to sustain its membership of the then european economic community eec or should simply withdraw its membership since brexit is about withdrawing from the eec or politics of withdrawal brexiteering era can be argued to have begun in 1975 and we can rightly talk about the first post referendum withdrawal era secondly the word brexit is believed to have been coined from grexit withdrawal of greece from the eurozone by mr peter wilding to mean britain s withdrawal from the european union as noted in may 2012 peter wilding warned that unless a clear view is pushed that britain must lead in europe at the very least to achieve the completion of the single market then the portmanteau for greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word brexit this is the origin of the coinage if we are to reckon with the time of birth and first use of the word post brexit era can be rightly argued to begin after may 2012 thirdly and more importantly post brexit era can still refer to the period following the time of second referendum on brexit on 23rd june 2016 when there was majority voting in favour of withdrawal from the european union there were 17 410742 votes representing 51 89 in favour of brexit while 16 141 241 48 11 voted in favour of remaining in the union fourthly and again more specifically the post brexit era can also begin after britain invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty on 29 march 2017 article 50 of the eu treaty provides that any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements and perhaps most importantly since britain was unable to meet its own constitutional requirements and room has to be given by the european union for flextension that is the initial deadline for withdrawal was extended on 28 october 2019 for a further three months from october 31 2019 until january 31 2020 the post brexit era could not have begun before january 31 2020 the extension until january 31 2020 was considered to avoid a situation of brexit without a deal with the union with these conceptual clarifications our choice here is the use of post brexit era to refer to the period of flextension and thereafter that is with effect from february 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and thereafter in therefore explaining the likely dynamics of the relationship it is useful to note that when the british joined the then european economic community eec in january 1973 it was with much difficulty and expectation of either trial or give it a trial by then great britain refused to go along with the idea of the 25 march 1957 rome treaty that gave birth to the eec because of the then british attitude france in particular not only frustrated britain s interest in the early 1960s to join the eec but also made life difficult for the former colonies of britain to become associate members of the eec while france ensured the inclusion of articles 131 136 which provided for the associate membership of the former colonies of france nigeria s interest in becoming an associate member of the eec was frustrated by general charles de gaulle who also ensured that britain s membership was not allowed until he left power the way president de gaulle treated britain angered a good number of the british to the extent that it created both proponents and opponents of britain s membership of the eec the division surrounding britain s membership was to the extent that a plebiscite had to be organised on june 5 1975 just about two years after adhesion to the rome treaty the plebiscite was to determine whether or not britain should continue to sustain its membership of the community by large margins not to say by luck the proponents of membership won with 17 378 581 votes 67 23 compared to 8 470 073 32 77 scored by the proponents of withdrawal however the truth remains that hostility against uk membership of the eec later european community ec and currently european union eu continued to grow gradually until 2016 when majority of the british felt that enough was really enough and another plebiscite had to be organised on whether or not to withdraw from the eec again like it was difficult to join it has also been more difficult to withdraw while the opposition to uk membership of the eec as at the time of joining came essentially from france all the other five original members of the eec were in favour the new opposition as from 2016 essentially came from within the british parliament it was a house divided against itself the division led to the resignation of two british prime ministers theresa may and david cameron the current prime minister boris johnson had to take the risk of organising an early election which his party luckily won and which now gives him a new source of strength to brexit and negotiate with the eu leaders with or without a deal the d day for the withdrawal was last friday january 31 2020 at 11 pm gmt britain s intention to withdraw has been made manifest on january 31 it is now history however the withdrawal cannot be made complete until the end of 2020 because of the need to still iron out some critical issues especially concerning the modalities of relationship between britain and the eu as a body corporate and as member states of the eu our major concern here is not the post brexit ties between the eu and britain but the ties between britain and nigeria in the post brexit era in other words what are the likely dynamics of the relationship will it be better a relationship with britain out of the eu more interestingly what are the likely scenarios of the relationship current dynamics currently nigeria s foreign relations are guided by varying factors and according to countries and issues involved grosso modo all nigeria s bilateral relations even the plurilateral ones are often described as warm the warmth however needs to be put in context no matter how warm nigeria s relationship with france may be for instance it is always largely driven by caution and suspicion simply because of the factor of nigeria s ties of geo political contiguity with the francophone neighbours and geo political ties of propinquity with france nigeria s ties with the united states are largely influenced by the many american trained public officials still serving and retired in nigeria the relationship is more vertical than horizontal in manifestations relationship with china is driven by the belief in give china a trial or a trial may convince you many people believe that the traditional partners of nigeria are generally exploiters it is believed that since nigeria acceded to national sovereignty in 1960 and development assistance has always been given to nigeria the observation is that the more the development assistance the lesser the development or the poorer the people and the more corrupt the polity becomes hence the belief is that even if the chinese are to become a new generation of colonisers they still appear to have a better attitudinal disposition with their foreign policy of win win generally proposed to africa as regards ties with britain the dynamics are more complex they range from colonial to neo colonial factors particularly the commonwealth values which are more or less of mutual deceit or hide and seek game there is no manifestation of concrete wealth that is common to the members of the commonwealth beyond the claims of shared values of democracy and conditionality driven development assistance apart from the many agreements already signed by the two countries there are also the influence of civil society organisations and business groups such as nigeria british chamber of commerce british council nigerians in diaspora organisation uk branch and chevening scholarship recipients the attitudinal disposition of the nigerian president muhammadu buhari is also an important dynamic he is favourably disposed to the western world as an elected president records have shown that the united states largely funded his election campaigns the rapprochement between the uk and the us is quite warm it can therefore be expected that both britain and the us are likely to continue to influence nigeria under president buhari in more concrete terms trade is an important segment of nigeria british relations cooperation in the area of defence and security cultural and scientific economic and political are equally significant all these considerations are most likely to remain part of the determinants of anglo nigerian relations in the post brexit era other major determinants of the relationship are derivable from the type of deal that will be achieved by britain in the eleven month transition period beginning from february 1 2020 but whatever is the deal some critical issues have to be addressed trade remains number one and particularly the issue of backstop and special customs arrangement the european union wants a withdrawal deal with the british in which there would be no border posts or barriers between northern ireland and the republic of ireland in the post brexit era this was part of the negotiations with theresa may as prime minister boris johnson who succeeded her rejected the factor of backstop and came up with the suggestion of a new customs arrangement for northern ireland immigration is a second issue it is essentially about labour mobility which in the eyes of many british has become an irritant it is believed that the level of immigration inflow is too high and that the cost of labour from central and eastern europe is quite cheaper thus undermining employment opportunities and pay for british workers brexit as a policy strategy is partly aimed at addressing this problem there are still other issues of an intra european character which include access to fishing waters licensing and regulation of medicines electricity and gas supplies data sharing and security aviation standard and security law enforcement and more importantly the rights of eu citizens in the united kingdom and british citizens in the eu member states in this regard for instance all british companies currently operating in eu countries are required to register within the framework of the eori economic operators registration and identification number without which they may not be able to operate in the post brexit era the eori is an european union identification number that must be possessed by businesses and people seeking to trade with the european union trading requires the application of tariffs as distinct from vat the number is to be inserted on customs declarations of the businesses concerned at least 72 000 businesses are on record to have applied for eori numbers above all issues is the question of british indebtedness to the eu the debt has been estimated at over 30 billion pound sterling negotiations on the modalities of payment cannot but be a matter of priority in the next eleven months for instance in 2018 alone britain s gross contribution to the eu was put at 20 billion but this amount was never actually transferred to the eu besides the eu commission has made it clear that any trade agreement between the eu and britain cannot be linked to payment of financial settlements whereas mr dominic raab noted in september 2018 when he was still brexit secretary that britain would not pay the financial settlement to the eu in a no deal scenario this means that payment is subject to reaching a deal whatever deal britain is likely to reach with the eu cannot but also have implications for nigeria britain relations in the post brexit era in the same vein boris johnson told the house of commons on 25 july 2019 that in the event of no deal the british would of course have available the 39 billion in the withdrawal agreement to help deal with any consequences although the amount payable has been reduced to 33 billion this is the amount britain has negotiated to pay under prime minister theresa may as divorce bill unofficially and financial settlements in official terms in this regard how is the relationship between britain and nigeria likely to be affected with the emerging misunderstanding between the francophone member states of the ecowas on the one hand and the anglophone countries on the other can we begin to imagine an eventual withdrawal of membership from the ecowas after mauritexit mauritania s withdrawal from the ecowas can we rule out nigexit nigeria s withdrawal libexit liberia s withdrawal siexit sierra leones withdrawal or ghanexit ghana s withdrawal we ask these questions in light of the fact that both the 1975 ecowas treaty and the 1991 abuja treaty establishing the african economic community were largely inspired in their contents by the eec rome treaty future dynamics one common dynamic of bilateral ties in international relations is exchange of visits which can take the form of state official officious and unofficial as well as working visit the importance of visit is determined by the level or status of the visiting official type of visit as well as the frequency of the visit in the post brexit era state visit is not likely to be frequent while official and working visits at the cabinet level are likely to be frequent frequency of visit is a mark of friendliness and warmth in a relationship interference is another factor that may not be ruled out in the foreseeable future especially in terms of general elections in which international observers will have to be invited in order to give credibility to such elections nigeria of today has become another terra cognita for modern slavery kidnappings human trafficking armed banditry insecurity in short is now the hallmark of political governance under president muhammadu buhari this is in spite of the fact that his declared policy of national development was predicated on a tripod of corruption fighting economic revamping and neutralisation of insecurity these issues particularly electioneering and protection of human rights cannot but compel international interferences there is the likelihood of a re emergence of franco british rivalry in west africa in general and in nigeria in particular even though france is only a political member of the north atlantic treaty organisation nato having opted out of the military integration of the organisation in 1966 and turning the nato headquarters in paris into university of paris dauphine france has generally been the lead country protecting western interests in africa in fact the west gave france a free hand to do and undo on behalf of the west this has also been so within the framework of the european union the expected problem now is that with brexit the extent to which britain will have sympathy for eu interests in nigeria is likely to decline anglophone west africa has the potential to receive sustained help from the british which can be to the detriment of the francophone and lusophone as well as to the arabophone countries in fact one recent manifestation of anglophone francophone rivalry was shown in january 2020 within the context of the ecowas the authority of the ecowas has agreed on the principle that their single currency within the framework of the ecowas monetary union will be called eco however the francophone countries have announced the renaming of their current currency the cfa communauté financière africaine franc eco france has quickly agreed to the announcement but why is this so are the french behind it whatever is the case nigeria has kicked against the announcement what implications the emerging disagreement will have on the future of the ecowas remains a mute question will the ceao the francophone version of the ecowas that comprised exclusively french speaking countries be revived there is also the issue of the economic partnership agreement with the european union which is still a divisive factor francophone support for morocco s membership of the ecowas is another divisive question in all these cases the division between the anglophone and francophone member states of the ecowas which is on the increase cannot but also impact on franco british ties in such a way that the protection of neo colonial interests will become preferential again situations of force majeure cannot be ruled out they include the deepening situation of insecurity which britain is not likely to allow to break up nigeria three factors always point to a possible disintegration of nigeria the first is the boko haram insurgency leaders of which do not believe in the corporate existence of nigeria as it is they want the transformation of nigeria into an islamic state a second situation is the sustained secessionist struggle as epitomised by massob and ipob the igbo ethnic stock wants autonomous existence a third and of course a more critical issue is the operation àmòtékùn a self defence mechanism against the aggression of fulani herdsmen put in place by the six south western governors the fulani herdsmen are reported to have 1 123 cells in the whole of south west forests this situation has encouraged the yoruba south west to resolve to embark on self defence rather than waiting for the federal government for security protection this situation cannot but invite foreign interference not to say foreign intervention in the post brexit era africa uk investment summit was held in london on monday january 20 2020 with the ultimate objective of making the united kingdom the first partner of choice for trade and investment in this regard africa is strongly believed to be the continent of the future in terms of economic opportunities for instance by 2050 it is expected that over two billion people will live in africa and one in four global consumers will be african the british will want to harness the potentials of the continent and create new lasting partnerships that will deliver more investments jobs and growth even though british stock of investments in africa attained 39 billion in 2018 and britain did make investments supporting over 370 000 jobs across africa the impact investment that britain is much interested in cannot but target nigeria being africa s biggest market in other words advancement of economic interest will remain a major dynamic of the relationship in the post brexit era and more expectedly the ambitious new innovation partnerships with african countries 29 august 2018 is likely to also impact the more the british government has it that the innovation partnerships are a unique opportunity for uk entrepreneurs to work alongside and collaborate with african entrepreneurs at the cutting edge of technology he tech sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in africa the continent s start ups raised 50 more venture capital in 2017 than in 2016 and the majority of this is being invested in south africa 130 million kenya 114 million and nigeria 89 million this cannot be ignored in nigeria s foreign policy and strategic calculations the population of nigerian born residents in the united kingdom has the potential to remain unchanged but with the possibility of little increase over time this will be mainly because of the new immigration policy that will be expected to be more hostile to fresh immigrants according to the uk 2011 census there were 191 183 nigerian born residents in england and wales but the figure was estimated to have reached 196 000 in 2016 there were also 9 458 nigerian born residents in scotland and 543 nigerian born residents in northern ireland in terms of likely inflow or repatriation of funds from them to nigeria there may not be any significant increase as living conditions gradually become tougher in essence nigeria s relationship with the united kingdom has the potential to be largely driven by economic and security considerations at the economic level three factors are noteworthy the diaspora nigerians in the uk in light of the current activities of the nigeria diaspora commission innovation partnerships with africa and trade development at the level of security cooperation cannot but require uk assistance to nigeria in light of the increasing threats to national unity largely prompted by government s inability to meaningfully address the boko haram insurgency the malaise of the fulani herdsmen s recidivist attacks on farmers and the increasing attacks on and brutal killing of christians to no avail in nigeria all of which can precipitate a second civil war in fact the future of the relationship cannot but trigger crisis and conflict of interest when the environment of the relationship becomes unnecessarily insecure in other words crisis and cooperation cannot but remain another important dynamic of the relationship in the post brexit era and one major element of the crisis cannot but also be a resurgent rivalry between france and britain in nigeria
steiner lauded the new authorities for engaging in talks with rebel groups for ending conflicts in d source afp the united nations has urged the united states to remove sudan from a list of state sponsors of terrorism arguing that the international community would pay a terrible price if it fails to help rebuild the african country s dilapidated economy as it transitions to civilian rule the story of sudan in year 2020 is not the story of the previous government united nations development programme undp administrator achim steiner told afp in an interview during his visit to sudan this week it is the story in which waiting for too long to actually step in and support this development process may have a terrible price economic challenges more than a year after the start of a nationwide protest movement that led to the ouster of longtime ruler omar al bashir last april sudan faces a series of challenges driven by an economic crisis years of recession were a key trigger for the protest movement against bashir s 30 year old autocratic regime months after he was ousted the economy remains burdened with foreign debt of more than 60 billion inflation of about 60 percent soaring unemployment and chronic shortage of fuel and foreign currency but these challenges are exactly the opportunity for the international community to step in and help sudan said steiner the first undp chief to ever visit the northeast african country here is a country in which the youth and particularly the women have not only managed to pull off a peaceful revolution in large part but they actually have an agenda to build a developmental state steiner said the international community must recognise how unusual and how extraordinarily helpful this is in a region that is otherwise providing more and more worrying news about political instability and about extremism support sudan sudanese officials say there has been a lacklustre response from the international community to the country s reform process led by new prime minister abdalla hamdok a well respected economist most blame washington s continued blacklisting of sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism which makes international banking cumbersome and keeps overseas investors away in october 2017 washington lifted its 20 year old trade embargo imposed on sudan but kept the country on the terrorism blacklist along with iran syria and north korea removing sudan from the blacklist is likely to take time with washington seeking assurances that bashir s regime is being fully dismantled steiner said that for many sudan s blacklisting was no longer a crucial issue and he urged the us congress to expedite the delisting he said the international community was taking sudan a little bit for granted we are in danger of forgetting that sudan is actually a story that is more hopeful than it has been for 30 years and are we missing an opportunity to actually lean in and support it said steiner we as undp are certainly committed to increase our engagement this is a win win proposition call to international institutions global financial institutions demand that sudan launch widespread reforms to revive its economy including cutting subsidies which according to steiner should be done gradually our role and that of the world bank the imf is to come up with wiser and smarter advice than simply saying to sudan well you are failing in your reform if you don t do x or y he said steiner lauded the new authorities for engaging in talks with rebel groups for ending conflicts in darfur blue nile and south kordofan regions riven by fighting under bashir over the years hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in fighting between bashir s forces and rebels in these regions steiner said it was up to the sudanese people to decide what kind of society they now wanted but they needed the help of the international community to build that society when you are on your knees when a previous government has raided the coffers of a nation for decades you have to look to the international community to also be part of that recovery effort and i think this is the story that is unfolding before our eyes in sudan today he said

and spur growth creating broader prosperity advertisement the new tax deal lower rates for those earning up to rs 15 lakh a year and no tax on annual income up to rs 5 lakh albeit without any exemptions is aimed at leaving more money in the hands of people so that they loosen their purse strings spend more and help the economy come out of the slowdown the other motivation behind the twin cuts must have been sitharaman s faith in arthur laffer the chicago university economist who had contended that high taxes would at some point discourage effort and reduce growth there have been debates over laffer s prescription for years as the ronald regan administration in the us didn t reap the benefits that it had expected by slashing tax rates in recent years french economist thomas piketty and his colleagues concluded after analysing economic data of over three decades from the developed world that they found no meaningful correlation between cuts in tax rates and economic growth the indian experience since the corporate tax slash also confirms the findings of team piketty as companies despite enjoying higher earnings have been reluctant to invest amid weak consumer demand and the slowdown has only worsened since then that the deceleration in growth is an economy wide phenomenon has become clear in recent months with the poor show in key segments like agriculture electricity gas and water supply hotel and transport financial real estate sectors and professional services against this backdrop an obvious question is why sitharaman chose the path of offering tax breaks to the small group of tax paying individuals at a time india s growth is seen dipping to an 11 year low of 5 per cent in the current financial year and joblessness of youths has become a talking point across the country besides ordinary people who live mostly in rural areas have cut spending even on food as real rural wages have contracted over the past few months economists have been discussing how the government can induce higher consumption in the economy especially in rural areas to revive demand and hence growth the telegraph picture in january sitharaman had indicated possibilities of cuts in income tax rates in her budget proposals but several economists had suggested that she should give direct benefits to the lower income deciles in rural areas to push consumption so that the economy chugs out of slowdown such direct benefits to the poor with higher spending propensity than the tax paying class who have higher savings propensity would have helped the economy besides leaving a welfare impact on rural and agrarian india although sitharaman said in her speech that it was the budget to increase the purchasing power of the people her proposals suggest she chose a different path which can further compound the problems facing the indian economy there is little doubt that the decision to lower the tax rate would cost the government dear on the income side the budget numbers show that the projected gross tax revenue for the next fiscal would be around rs 38 000 crore less than the target she had set for this fiscal given the record of tax collections the difference between budget and revised estimates in this fiscal is around rs 3 lakh crore questions on whether the target can be met cannot be wished away the telegraph picture if sitharaman misses the tax mop up target her budget arithmetic for the next fiscal will go awry with the likelihood of she missing the fiscal deficit target of 3 5 per cent of the gdp fiscal deficit is the difference between the government s revenue receipts plus non debt capital receipts and the total expenditure and that s why is reflective of the total borrowing requirements thanks to the largesse to the corporate sector the finance minister has missed this year s target as the revised estimate has pegged it at 3 8 per cent of the gdp while she had plans to contain it at 3 3 per cent of the gdp when she had presented her first budget last july her fiscal deficit target will also critically hinge on meeting the divestment target pegged at rs 2 10 000 crore in view of the centre s experience while trying to sell off air india this target also seems suspect all these discussions on fiscal deficit do not mean that the finance minister has to be a fiscal purist given the state of the economy and the need for measures to revive it eyebrows would not have been raised had she pressed a pause button on fiscal consolidation and tried to give a better deal to the people living in rural areas instead she tried to be within the limits of fiscal responsibility and budget management frbm act by spending rs 75 000 crore less on food subsidy than the budget estimate for this fiscal the note on variations between the budget and the revised estimates linked the slash to lower requirements this two word explanation captures the priority of the government which has also lowered outlay on rural employment for the next fiscal by over rs 9 500 crore the budget documents reveal lower requirement under mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee programme so the story of the budget in a poor country with highest ever unemployment rate is lower requirement of food subsidy and jobs in rural areas

senate and house democratic leaders said friday afternoon the general assembly will vote on a tractor trailer tolls bill the week of feb 10 though they have not resolved a small detail that loomed large thursday night when they cancelled a special session slated for next week which chamber will vote first that remains to be determined said senate president pro tem martin m looney of new haven looney and house majority leader matt ritter of hartford told reporters outside the governor s office in the state capitol they had just assured gov ned lamont that his signature first year issue is back on track while hundreds of opponents and supporters lined up in the legislative office building to testify on the bill at a public hearing the annual 2020 legislative session opens wednesday and a vote on the transportation financing bill so early in the session would require looney and house speaker joe aresimowicz of berlin to deem it an emergency certified bill a status that exempts the measure from further review by legislative committees or another public hearing house minority leader themis klarides r derby and senate minority leader len fasano r north haven said the democrats are intent on finding a process that minimizes public vetting of the legislation before a full traffic and fiscal analysis can be completed this is beyond irresponsible fasano said how dare you looney and ritter said they had votes for passage and both tried to minimize the obvious question raised by the inability to quickly determine where the bill would come to its first floor vote the obvious distrust between the chambers each controlled by democrats asked if he trusted ritter and house speaker joe aresimowicz of berlin looney said i do ritter who stood next to looney outside the governor s office after a half hour meeting said the issue is less with leadership than some rank and file members sometimes ritter said there s distrust issues between the house and senate i think it s just there are elements of both caucuses who want their votes to be final action looney said lamont shook off the previous night s cancellation saying his fellow democrats assured him they had sufficient votes and the only challenge was to find a day when every lawmaker supporting the measure would be available democrats have solid majorities of 22 14 in the senate and 91 60 in the house but every republican is opposed democrats can survive the loss of four democratic votes in the senate and achieve an 18 18 tie that would be broken by lt gov susan bysiewicz in the house they need to keep 76 of their 91 members on board i feel as confident today as i did yesterday as i did the day before that lamont said i just met with the leaders and had a good discussion about scheduling when we can do this the bill which is available on line would authorize the state to charge tolls on tractor trailers at 12 highway bridges the opening hours of the hearing friday were consumed by questioning of the governor s top fiscal official secretary melissa mccaw of the office of policy and management and the state transportation commissioner joseph j giulietti administration officials warned that if lawmakers fail to find new revenues for infrastructure before the next recession or before the transportation program falls into deficit in five years connecticut s economy stands to lose tens of billions of dollars the special transportation fund is in crisis mccaw told the legislature s transportation committee at friday s hearing it needs a suitable reliable revenue stream the current situation is untenable the fund is financed by fuel taxes and various fees and it pays for debt service on transportation bonding and the operating costs of the department of transportation and department of motor vehicles between state borrowing and matching federal grants connecticut spends about 1 6 billion per year on highway bridge and rail repairs the 19 1 billion investment lamont is supporting for the coming decade will be transformative for our economy giulietti testified about 172 million in annual toll receipts coupled with additional sales tax revenues dedicated to transportation would prop up the special transportation fund the plan crafted by lamont and democratic legislators would take advantage of low interest federal financing with interest rates close to 2 to minimize borrowing costs over the coming decade these are very very aggressive rates giulietti said the best we ve ever seen economic studies have shown connecticut s congested highways and rail lines cost businesses and residents a collective 4 2 billion to 5 billion annually in delays and other complications mccaw said adding it s a price the state has been paying for years the metro north commuter rail system has slower running times than 50 years ago said giulietti the former president of metro north mccaw warned that if the lawmakers do not act now the prospects of modernizing transportation infrastructure would be vulnerable to an economic downturn a delay of five or six years could cost the economy as much as 30 billion mccaw said and for those who believe the next economic crisis is many years away mccaw said the current special transportation fund still won t be sufficient to address future needs the stf s longtime revenue sources fuel tax revenues and various motor vehicle fees are growing at less than 3 per year while transportation costs are growing by 4 mccaw said if toll receipts or some other revenues aren t added to transportation the stf would fall into deficit by 2025 she said major bridge work is needed at all 12 of the highway structures where toll gantries would be located under the plan giulietti said the tolls would go into effect in 2023 republican legislative leaders pushed back friday against the democratic governor s plan calling it a first step to a broader tolls plan though that would require the passage of a second transportation bill most likely after 2023 and requiring a legislative consensus that now seems unfathomable it may be trucks today but we all know it will be cars tomorrow said patrick sasser founder of no tolls ct who said the need for tolls is decades of fiscal mismanagement of state finances sadly the trust is broken and we have had enough democrats have tried to underline that passenger tolls are permanently off the table by proposing bond language barring them but klarides said such language would be worthless wall street never would try to enforce them since investors in bonds want only one thing they want to be paid rep laura devlin r fairfield noted that the 2007 legislature approved about 2 billion in bonding to shore up the teachers pension fund pledging in that bond covenant not to alter the schedule of contributions to the pension system until those bonds were paid off around 2032 the language was not binding she said last may lawmakers approved a proposal from lamont and state treasurer shawn wooden to restructure pension payments the governor and treasurer asserted this would not violate the bond covenant as long as connecticut set aside an amount equal to the maximum yearly debt payment on the bonds about 380 million connecticut which had 1 2 billion in its rainy day fund last may and was on its way to amassing 2 5 billion by september 30 had no problem fulfilling that 380 million reserve requirement the lamont administration projects that at least 50 of the truck tolls receipts would be paid by out of state truck drivers a factor that hartford mayor luke bronin said should be persuasive it s like going to the store seeing a 50 discount and saying no i would rather pay full price bronin said the bottom line is we have to make investments now they have to be big it is our only chance to be competitive but kurt lindeland who runs connecticut mulch distributors in enfield said plenty of connecticut companies will pay a high price his among them his company owns 38 trucks and makes 11 000 trips annually in the state we re estimating 400 000 to 700 000 lindeland said of his projected cost and that s a pretty scary number the administration tried to minimize the impact on connecticut businesses by exempting all classes of trucks other than tractor trailers and no truck would be charged more than once a day at any one gantry unions turned out members to support a transportation financing plan that they say will produce jobs in a depressed construction industry american trucking associations filed written testimony reminding lawmakers that trucks only tolls in rhode island are facing a legal challenge by their industry

individuals in both countries it should open all services markets without exception to competition from providers of the other country it should ensure that the rules that determine whether products and services are originating meaning that they come from one or both of the agreement s parties are not so restrictive that they limit the scope for supply chain innovations those rules should reflect the fact that globalization has made it difficult and sometimes arbitrary to define a product s origin because of cross border investment and global supply chains the dna of products and services is very difficult to trace nowadays and that is good finally the agreement should simplify streamline and make transparent all administrative procedures governing customs clearance for goods and the admission of all qualifying persons for the purpose of conducting business services in addition to those free market requirements the u s uk agreement must also include rules governing e commerce digital trade data flows that are essential components in the provision of goods and services in the 21st century must remain untaxed and protected from misuse and abuse rules that prohibit governments from imposing localization requirements or any particular data architecture that reduce the efficacy of digital services should be included and obligations should be imposed on entities to ensure data privacy consistent with the requirement that data flow as smoothly as possible when border barriers come down the potentially protectionist aspects of regulation and regulatory regimes become more evident if those regulations are comparable when it comes to achieving the same social outcomes consumer safety product reliability worker safety environmental friendliness there may be scope to allow businesses to comply with only one set of rules a regulatory cooperation mechanism to promote mutual recognition would be a useful innovation as a means to reducing business costs provided no deep cultural aversion or science based reason exists for considering one regulation better than the other and worth the greater cost finally the rules must be enforceable what s the point of a trade agreement if its terms are just suggestions to make sure governments keep their promises the agreement should include a binding and enforceable dispute settlement mechanism that mechanism would not be a true court with the power to order governments to comply rather the standard mechanism used in most trade agreements with recourse to a third party adjudicator for a ruling and then self enforcement through authorized suspension of the trade agreement obligations is sufficient on the other hand some common free trade agreement provisions simply don t belong in free trade agreements among the more prominent examples is overly protective intellectual property rules it is important that intellectual property rules protect what is actually intellectual property and do not go beyond that or create rights where none actually exist other examples include provisions on labor rights and environmental protections these rules have expanded the scope of trade agreements far beyond traditional trade and commercial issues the scope and reach of labor laws and environmental protections are a controversial domestic policy issue and the use of international agreements to create a one size fits all solution in these areas is problematic furthermore the united states and the united kingdom are open transparent and free market oriented economies but if a u s uk fta is to be a model that applies to others it is useful to set it up in a way that deals with issues that may arise down the road other countries economies are less open and have more state intervention therefore it is worth having the united states and the united kingdom work out rules in this fta that could apply to others who might want to join later examples include rules promoting transparency and disciplining the behavior of state owned enterprises the united states and united kingdom should be able to agree to very high standards in these areas standards that other parties might not reach and then through the open accession clause parties that wanted to reap the benefits of this agreement would have to accept these disciplines summing up an eventual u s uk fta should remove barriers to trade in goods and services open up all sectors of the both economies to investment and ultimately go as far as possible to remove all administrative impediments to economic integration without encroaching on the sovereignty of governments to pass laws and regulate in the public interest in ways that do not discriminate against foreign goods services and companies in practical terms that means subject to good faith non discriminatory public policy exceptions zero tariffs on all goods agricultural commodities primary industry resources and manufacturing industry goods zero discriminatory non tariff barriers which means no discrimination by either party in the content or exercise of the laws regulations or practices affecting the provision of services of either party including no restrictions on the entry of business people in the conduct of the provision of business services zero restrictions on competition for government procurement zero restrictions on foreign direct investment in the economy zero restrictions on cross border data flow elimination to the fullest extent possible of impediments to expeditious customs clearance procedures for both imports and exports preclusion of antidumping or safeguard measures between the parties and special consideration for waivers when either party imposes trade restrictions for national security reasons this

if we aspire to build world class enterprises in india that do not thrive on cost arbitrage arising from cheap labour we need to ask why is that we have only managed to create best in class education institutes that provide a launching pad for further education and not necessarily to global leadership arvind krishna has been appointed as the global ceo of ibm and this has caused much celebration in india bjp mp tejasvi surya called this indian domination there are many who agree with such sentiments and are elated at krishna s achievement make no mistake krishna s achievement is stellar he has not just become the ceo in waiting of ibm the company that unleashed the power of computing upon the world but is being asked to lead the tech behemoth at a very crucial time of its journey to be amongst the pantheon of leaders comprising of luminaries such as thomas watson and louis gestner jr is no mean feat advertisement krishna is currently the head of ibm s cloud business cloud is what made microsoft which had ceded its leadership position a few years ago reclaim its numero uno status and be the first company ever to touch a market capitalisation of 1 trillion cloud is the key to growth and profits in today s computing world krishna is also the head of ibm s cognitive software division which leads ibm s strides on new age technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning which are the technologies of the future krishna also spearheaded ibm s acquisition of red hat which is ibm s largest acquisition till date clearly krishna has proven his capability to provide direction to the elephant as the former ceo of ibm louis gestner jr had called the company notwithstanding his achievements it will will be a big mistake if we look at the ceos of microsoft alphabet adobe systems and ibm as the growth and domination of indians satya nadella sundar pichai shantanu narayen and arvind krishna are americans of indian origin which is very different from being indians indians are citizens of a nation that has a gdp per capita of 2000 ibm on the other hand with a revenue of 79 59 billion and an employee base of 3 50 000 has a revenue per capita of 2 27 000 which is 113 times india s gdp per capita alphabet microsoft and adobe have revenue per capita at 660 times 425 times 210 times india s gdp per capita respectively advertisement hence before we celebrate their achievements as one of our own we need to think hard as to why do such talented people leave india nadella krishna and narayen were all born in andhra pradesh pichai was born in tamil nadu but soon after completing their graduation they all left india to pursue their higher education in the united states advertisement if we aspire to build world class enterprises in india that do not thrive on cost arbitrage arising from cheap labour we need to ask why is that we have only managed to create best in class education institutes that provide a launching pad for further education and not necessarily to global leadership advertisement be it a raghuram rajan or abhijit banerjee their success has been largely scripted by their academic associations in the united states and it is certainly not enough if governments under both the major political parties think that opening more iits with inadequate physical infrastructure and low faculty quality will prepare india for the next level of opportunities if excellence in education could be promoted by opening more institutes then we would have many more oxfords harvards stanfords and mits advertisement india does not even have a single university in the top 300 of the world it s therefore not at all surprising that extraordinary talent such as nadella pichai krishna and narayen among others who hail from middle class families exited india at their first opportunity indian policy makers need to seriously get their act right in preventing this which can be accomplished in a meaningful manner only by creating and allowing for world class universities in india as much as it is important to build toilets and bring more than 300 million poor people into the financial net it is also important that we take at least one indian university into the global top 50 even among the elite indian administrative services there is a huge clamour to go to the us and enroll in an ivy league university at tax payer s expense it s perplexing how a nation that can reach to the moon and mars can t build one world class university advertisement even more important is to ask why indians living in india who probably are as talented as many global ceos of indian origin aren t able to transform indian companies to global leadership standards what is it about the business environment here that does not allow a single indian company to enter the fortune 100 list advertisement the indian leaders in the fortune 200 500 list are predominantly oil companies and state owned banks india may be within striking distance of the 50th rank in the world bank s ease of doing business index but the entry of first generation indian companies that are neither conglomerates nor state owned enterprises is the real metric to measure the ease with which business could be carried out in india advertisement the solow growth model is a robust economic theory that explains the factors that go into facilitating the development of a nation nobel winning economist robert lucas expanded the theory and included human capital as a powerful component that contributes to the growth of a nation education as explained by robert lucas is not about merely increasing school enrollment or building more engineering colleges while these objectives are mandatory only quality of research and education can act as force multipliers building a world class research university that expands the imagination of technically trained minds is not easy to accomplish and therefore it is a national imperative advertisement in addition to aspects detailed in the solow growth model another factor that accounts for economic growth is ease of doing business wealth is created by business enterprises governments only spend it hence the ease with which businesses can function in india is a key metric that can power india s economic growth it s probably as important as the government s ability to tax its citizens so far despite india s increase in global rankings on this front any real and lasting change seems to be evasive largely because it calls for a serious behavioral and mind set change at so many levels and layers of the governance machinery advertisement till such time we don t see indians from indian universities rising to great heights and till we don t see indian companies rising to global stature sundar pichai satya nadella arvind krishna and shantanu narayen are a stark reminder of the distance that india has to cover and not the distance that india has covered advertisement the author is a fulbright fellow clinton global fellow and a current student of economic policy management at columbia university views expressed are personal
cnn us farm bankruptcies were up 20 in 2019 despite the billions of dollars in aid president donald trump has paid to farmers hurt by the trade war with china that s the highest level since 2011 following the great recession according to court data analyzed by the american farm bureau there were 595 chapter 12 family farm bankruptcies nearly 100 more than in 2018 the trade group said trump s trade wars created a lot of uncertainty about markets negotiations with canada and mexico two of us farmers biggest export markets over the rewrite of the north american free trade agreement went on for more than two years china retaliated to trump s tariffs with duties on a range of american farm goods as a result exports of soybeans to china nearly stopped for about a year prices plunged and a record number of soybeans to piled up in storage to make up for some of those losses and shore up political support trump has allocated a 28 billion aid package for farmers over the past two years most of that money was paid to farmers directly and about 4 billion was used to purchase surplus food for food banks and given to groups that promote agricultural aid the aid payments boosted farm income which was projected to be up 10 in 2019 it would have shrunk without the subsidies but many farmers say they would rather have strong trade than aid payments but the money has helped fill in the gap during a rough two years aside from the trade wars last year s wet weather made planting season tough and many american farmers have for years been facing low prices for their commodities including dairy corn and soybeans wisconsin long known as america s dairyland saw the most bankruptcy filings last year not every closing farm files for bankruptcy suggesting that the number of farms going out of business could be even higher this loss of farms and this number of farm bankruptcies is deeply disturbing and completely predictable said kara o connor government relations director at the wisconsin farmers union she blamed overproduction farm policy and low prices the trade wars were salt in an existing wound she said adding that new trade deals aren t going to save them yet many farmers are optimistic about future economic conditions according to a purdue university cme group ag economy barometer survey in december congress recently passed the us mexico canada trade agreement which ensures that most agricultural products will remain tariff free when traded within the region the preliminary phase one deal with china reached earlier this month has also restored some certainty for farmers it suggests trade tensions have softened for now and beijing promised to step up its purchases of american agricultural products pledging to buy about 32 billion more than it did before the trade war began but analysts are skeptical those numbers can be met especially while china keeps tariffs on us commodities in place even if beijing keeps its promise the purchases might still not make up for the losses agriculture exports to china fell by about 21 billion in 2018 alone
gone are the days of leaving it to the world trade organization to deal with allegations of dumping and other such disputes president donald trump is using tariffs instead including a 25 percent tariff on steel imported from the european union canada and mexico that went into effect in june lately there s been little downtime at lexcentral steel s bedford park processing plant thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors workers put spools of steel each weighing as much as five cars through machines called slitters where they re sliced into threads that are sold and shipped to companies across the midwest that produce everything from car doors to lockers to shelving walk through any area hardware store target or walmart and chances are you ll see shelving and other products that were processed at the bedford park plant shipments are up about 10 to 15 percent compared with last year owners project shipments are up as much as 40 percent from the bottom of the doldrums around 2005 or 2008 steel has been in the spotlight thanks to trump following through on a campaign promise to take decisive action to revive the american steel industry thank you all and i m thrilled to be here in granite city with the men and women of u s steel great company trump said in his speech there last month today we re celebrating a great victory a victory for all of you for this community and for our entire country it s all good news for the offshoots of lexgroup co celebrating 50 years as a one of the nation s largest flat rolled steel distributors this is the first time in a decade i ve gone into customers and the number one concern is we need more people we need workers we need welders we need tool and die guys we need guys to work in a factory lexcentral steel president bill douglass said i think people are looking tariffs a little too narrowly it s not about protecting the steel industry it s about opening markets every product that we can open up overseas for our products our cars our manufacturing goods our stuff anything we can open up overseas which is heavily tariffed is going to bring manufacturing back here and i think that s ultimately what we want his father lexgroup ceo robert douglass who has spent his entire career in the steel industry is a trump fan who appreciates the flexibility tariffs provide their ability to poke and to prod especially compared with dumping cases that he said are so carried out with repercussions that come too late tariffs are an immediate tool and it s just a tool it s a tool to get attention it s a tool to renegotiate he said you don t have a trade war that you ve already lost we have a deficit trade with darn near every product that we have so all we have to do is get the attention that ok renegotiate some of these things trade wars are saber rattling but when you ve already got a horrendous deficit what more do you have to lose that s the whole thing he too says the focus on tariffs is overblown compared to the effect of the congressional tax code overhaul on the economy the tax changes and depreciation laws really incentivize manufacturers to buy new equipment and we will be doing it next year people are doing it now he said so more important than tariffs are the tax laws that enable new equipment to be purchased but that equipment thanks to tariffs it could cost more the steel tariffs and the aluminum tariffs are going to create winners and losers by either putting taxes on imports coming from foreign suppliers or by putting quotas that limit how much we can buy from abroad that s going to raise the price of steel and aluminum in the u s said jonathan dingel associate professor of economics at the university of chicago booth school of business so that makes firms that produce steel and aluminum happy the price of their output is higher it makes customers that use that steel and aluminum unhappy so a lot of companies from coca cola to caterpillar have announced that they ll be passing through some of those cost increases as price increases for the consumers that buy their goods the university of chicago recently surveyed leading economists from uchicago yale harvard and mit they were asked whether the new u s tariffs on steel and aluminum would help americans welfare every economist who responded said the tariffs would not help americans trade policy and the steel industry are complicated so dingel says it s hard to say when you ll start to pay more for that can of coke a new car or condo but there are already fears and reports of higher steel prices hurting construction then there s the question of a trade war i would say at the moment it might be a trade spat or a trade skirmish more than a trade war but of course you worry that spats or skirmishes can turn into a full blown war dingel said i think what s really difficult for businesses right now is the amount of uncertainty surrounding trade policy it s hard to make investments or make plans if you can t be sure what the tax rate is going to be on steel aluminum auto parts etc that uncertainty comes not just from questions about what trump will do but what additional possible retaliatory actions other countries may take and which industries they will affect but the leaders of lexgroup steel aren t concerned pointing out that in a war both sides have a lot to lose dingel says illinois is like a microcosm of the nation there are clear winners and losers here u s steel and companies like lexgroup are feeling the advantages of tariffs while local manufacturers even soy farmers hit by retaliatory swipes are on the losing side follow amanda vinicky on twitter amandavinicky related stories us economy strong but trump s tariffs could cause problems us chamber 3 8 billion worth of

i m sure you ve already heard the big news out of buckingham palace prince harry and meghan markle the duchess of sussex have chosen to remove themselves from their royal duties which has in turn likely cut them off from their royal allowance this move represents a considerable pay cut for the couple to the tune of 4 million a year instead of continuing multiple royal allowances these royal rebels want an opportunity to make their own professional wage of course they have little worry of impoverishment since the couple is currently worth about 30 million combined harry and meghan have officially left the payroll related harry meghan to quit royal jobs give up highness titles i wrote an article in 2018 called kids on the payroll the biggest retirement problem no one talks about this issue is huge for american retirees their happiness and their financial stability when i created the piece i never imagined that two of the most famous royals on the planet would give up their family obligations and a massive annual income wouldn t it be nice if all of our kids wanted off the payroll i say kudos to them related opinion divorce rate would plunge if more followed in prince harry s steps back in the real world i want all the parents out there to listen up in my new money and happiness survey of almost 2 000 retirees across the country the data revealed that more than 40 are providing their adult children with some level of financial support that s nearly half of all of my survey participants now this figure doesn t mean helping support children with special needs or the occasional gift of disneyland tickets and extra cash in the christmas card what we re talking about are the cases where retirees are subsidizing the everyday life of their adult kids these expenses fall into the categories of payment for private school tuitions cars housing credit card and other debt etc they pay these expenses because their grown children can t afford the lifestyle they ve chosen for themselves i don t at all believe that my group is alone in their well intentioned generosity and there s even more data to support my assumption recently a study by creditcards com painted a similar picture their research findings suggest that nearly 75 of parents offer some financial support for children over the age of 18 the study cites expenses like cellphone bills 39 transportation 36 and student loans 20 the data showed that respondents over the age of 55 were increasingly likely to help out with debt payments as opposed to merely subsidizing necessary living expenses the baby boomer population i surveyed said they were in essence bankrolling late 20 30 and even 40 somethings related pondering your grown kid s failure to launch look in the mirror our issue here isn t just the failure to launch syndrome or adult children living beyond their means and becoming dependent on mom and dad there s a correlation between providing this type of financial support and happiness during retirement during my survey the most unhappy retirees overwhelmingly responded that they still support their adult children in dollars and cents the unhappiest retired couples averaged over 700 per month in support of their kids while the happiest of the lot kept the monthly allowance under 500 at the extreme end of the spectrum a couple giving over 2 000 per month in support was over 400 more likely to be unhappy than a family with financially independent children the ability to be generous is one of the retirement season s greatest joys but what starts as generosity could take an unfortunate turn let the data be a lesson there are limits to the happiness that your generosity will bring and there is a tipping point where it turns into outright unhappiness if you re in the thick of bankrolling your kids lifestyles it can be tough to get out there s no one right approach to tightening your boundaries and your pocketbooks every parent child dynamic is complicated to some degree no matter our age plus there are different circumstances and financial situations that add to the mix let s not forget about the emotional piece there are competing interests that underlie the entire setup on the one hand parents have an instinct to continue to support and nurture their children on the other is a sense of shame for enabling their adult kids to continue to spend beyond their means it doesn t help that discussing financial assistance for grown children is one of the more difficult areas to find agreement between couples during retirement planning conversations our bottom line is this the data shows that kicking kids off the payroll or at least giving them a pay cut boosts happiness in retirement believe me i get it as a dad of four young kids i want to protect them help them and give them every opportunity to succeed but i have to count the cost of this support once they re older it s not just dollars and cents it s the happiness of my wife and me at stake too i know this can be a sensitive and emotional financial topic so i d love to hear your thoughts and stories send them to me at hello wesmoss com wes moss has been the host of money matters on news 95 5 and am 750

the united states dollar has had a complete turnaround during the month of january against the chinese yuan as the market initially broke down only to turn around and reach towards the 7 0000 level this is a large round psychologically significant figure that of course will continue to attract a lot of attention that being said i do believe that we eventually break above this large round psychologically significant figure mainly because the final week of the month has closed that the very top of its range sitting right at that level that being said you should also keep in mind that the coronavirus situation and china seem to be getting worse and that of course will send the value of the chinese yuan lower beyond all of that we are in an uptrend to begin with the trade war has wreaked havoc on the chinese economy and it should be noted that the americans haven t lifted the tariffs yet that being said the coronavirus was probably then used as the reason to start buying this pair again there are a whole host of issues involving china shadow banking system and debt as well so there s no reason to think that this pair should suddenly fall apart risk is certainly in the risk off mode and as the coronavirus gets worse it s very likely that this pair will continue to go higher however if sometime during the month we start to see signs of the coronavirus abating that will send this market lower don t get me wrong i don t think that we shoot straight up in the air but i recognize that the trend is still very much intact i think there will be the occasional pullback but look at that as a buying opportunity as the market will continue to favor the greenback as it is a much safer place to put your money than china right now this is especially true considering that the us treasury market will continue to attract a lot of attention as well it s not until we break down below the 6 80 level that i would consider the uptrend over and that something that will take quite a bit of good news to make traders go out and looking for some type of major yield i suspect that this month will be positive for this pair yet again after forming a hammer for the month of january

the second claim that unemployment is at a 49 year low is accurate based on the latest jobs data the first claim that american workers are seeing the best wage growth in a decade is inaccurate there was a higher growth rate under president obama after the super bowl the trump campaign aired an ad with two claims about the economy in one of two 30 second multi million dollar super bowl advertisements president donald trump pointed to a strong economy as one reason voters should re elect him in 2020 the ad first uploaded to youtube on jan 30 mixes clips of trump rallies and military operations with tv news segments and videos of american workers claims about the economy occasionally flash across the screen in text best wage growth in a decade unemployment at 49 year low and ladies and gentlemen the best is yet to come trump says near the end of the video the ad closes with a shot of the president holding what appears to be an executive order we looked into both of the ad s central claims about how the economy has performed under trump s presidency we found that the claim about wages is wrong while the claim about unemployment is correct trump can t claim largest growth in wages first we took a look at the super bowl ad s claim that american workers are seeing the best wage growth in a decade this is inaccurate we rated a similar claim false in march 2018 to analyze the ad we looked at what economists say is the best measurement for changes in wages median usual weekly real earnings for full time wage and salary workers 16 years and older this measure tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment it is adjusted for inflation data from the federal reserve bank of st louis show that while wages have been steadily increasing since october 2017 it has not been the largest relative change over the past decade and there was a significant dip in growth after trump took office between april 2014 and april 2017 median inflation adjusted wages grew by about 6 9 a change that happened almost entirely while barack obama was president for comparison the change in wages between october 2017 and october 2019 the latest year we have data on was about 4 9 looking at the entirety of trump s time in office the rate of growth shrinks median inflation adjusted wages have increased by about 2 8 since january 2017 it might be possible to choose a wage growth measure that averages out to higher over the last few years trump s presidency as compared to a selected previous period but there s a lot going on in the labor market and wages are an area where the performance has been surprisingly weak given where other indicators such as the unemployment rate currently are said tara sinclair an associate professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university in an email unemployment has hit a 49 year low next we analyzed the trump ad s second claim unemployment is at a 49 year low this is accurate based on the latest unemployment numbers data from the federal reserve bank of st louis show that the unemployment rate was 3 5 in december 2019 the latest month it has numbers for over the past 49 years that s the lowest unemployment has ever been the unemployment rate first dipped below 4 during trump s presidency in may 2018 prior to that it had only ever been that low for a few months in 2000 unemployment hit a 49 year low in may 2019 trump officials have insisted that the economy s growth is because of the president s tax cuts and deregulatory policies some experts say that the president s 2017 tax plan did produce modest economic growth over a short period of time but some of that growth started under president obama the fact of the matter is that the economy has grown about as fast under president trump so far in his first term as it did throughout president obama s second term said gary burtless an economist with the brookings institution in an email if we give president trump some credit for keeping the long obama era expansion on track his stewardship has contributed to the low unemployment rate we ve recently enjoyed

more than 3 1 2 years after the landmark brexit referendum the united kingdom will finally leave the european union at 11 p m gmt on friday that means britain will exit the bloc of 27 remaining countries and the bloc s economic market of about 450 million people and will begin to forge its own way in the world the u k has been a member of the eu since 1973 leaving is one of the biggest riskiest and most divisive steps the country has taken in decades here are some of the ways brexit is expected to play out in the near term what happens at 11 01 on friday night does trade stop do eu citizens living in the u k and brits in the eu have to head back to their respective countries no the u k and the european union will immediately enter a transition period until the end of this year during which the free movement of people and trade between them will continue as before there is no expectation of long lines at ports on the english channel britons will no longer be eu citizens but they will still broadly enjoy the same rights they do now the u k will keep paying into the eu budget during this transition period but british lawmakers will no longer sit in the european parliament or help shape eu rules next month british and eu negotiators will begin trying to hammer out a free trade deal to take effect when the transition ends on dec 31 brexit took a long time how long will it take for the u k to reach a free trade deal with the eu british prime minister boris johnson insists he can get a deal in the next 11 months but the eu and trade experts are deeply skeptical given the complexity of such trade negotiations there are several scenarios if the u k can t reach a deal it could crash out of the eu at the end of this year trade would default to world trade organization terms which would place tariffs on some goods and cause pain for the british and to a lesser extent the eu economies johnson could ask to extend the transition period but he would face opposition within his conservative party he has also vowed never to request an extension again it s important to remember that the brexit process does not end on friday night most analysts say that negotiating a new relationship with the eu will be much harder than leaving it what might a u k eu trade deal look like this is a huge question and the answer could have a significant impact on the british economy u k treasury chief sajid javid has said that there will be no alignment between british and eu regulations in their new relationship which economists say would create trade barriers and raise costs potentially hurting the u k s agriculture and auto sectors among others consider this many foreign manufacturers built plants in the u k to take advantage of its free trade with the eu if the country s exports to the eu face tariffs in the future that might reduce the incentive for foreign companies to invest in the united kingdom the british economy has proved more resilient since the 2016 brexit vote than many economists expected but it faces big challenges the british pound has still not recovered from its sharp drop in value after britain voted to leave the eu unemployment is low but so is economic growth the fact is that we re hardly growing at all now said jonathan portes an economics professor at king s college london who cited troubles with the global and european economies as well as brexit uncertainty portes added that the risks of a recession are high what does brexit mean for the u k s special relationship with the u s without the leverage that comes from trading as part of a much larger market like the eu the united kingdom is anxious to negotiate a good trade deal quickly with the world s largest economy the united states president trump supports brexit he criticizes multilateral institutions like the eu on thursday in london u s secretary of state mike pompeo said that leaving the eu would free up the u k and allow it to reduce transaction costs with the united states both pompeo and u k foreign secretary dominic raab said they thought a deal could be done this year but trade experts remain skeptical aside from being a longtime ally with shared democratic values the u k has been attractive to the u s because it could help america with its agenda in europe once britain is outside the eu its influence and therefore its usefulness to washington are expected to decline brexit strained ties within the united kingdom what is the future of scotland and northern ireland scotland voted to stay in the eu and many there are angry that the u k leadership from their perspective is dragging them out against their will brexit has accelerated discussions in scotland about breaking away from the u k including the scottish parliament s vote this week to hold a new independence referendum a binding referendum would need the central u k government s approval which johnson says he won t grant but if the pro independence scottish national party has a strong showing in next year s scottish parliamentary elections independence supporters will press their case even harder brexit has also accelerated talk of an eventual vote on the reunification of the island of ireland although the republic of ireland is staying in the eu northern ireland is leaving the eu with the rest of the united kingdom the brexit withdrawal agreement requires customs checks between great britain and northern ireland which has infuriated many in northern ireland who support remaining a part of the united kingdom that said there are many barriers to ireland s reunification including the cost to the republic of ireland of absorbing the considerably poorer north any change to the status quo is likely many years away what are the main lessons from this long brexit ordeal the brexit vote is part of a much larger trend in parts of the west that values national sovereignty and independence over political and economic integration simply put it s a backlash against a long running trend toward globalization british politicians learned that taking a question as complex as membership in the eu to a public referendum is very risky the british people have found that unraveling decades of relations with the european union is far more fraught than anyone imagined finally some britons have discovered after years of domestic political chaos and the u k s failure to have its way with brussels that their country is nowhere near as politically powerful or as influential as they thought copyright 2020 npr to see more visit
in this interview a former minister of cooperation and integration in africa dr abimbola ogunkelu tells mudiaga affe on a need for members of the economic community of west african states to have a single currency and also the imperative of establishing community policing in nigeria due to rising insecurity among others the proposed single currency for the ecowas sub region has dragged on for too long why do you think it is so and what is the significance of the single currency the ecowas single currency is an important economic programme for member states in the region it is likened to the significance of the euro to the european union it simply means that you can do business across the borders without losing money by changing from one currency to the other it also enhances the unity in the region apart from political unity which is not absolute because every country has its government and political parties if you have an economic bond then you are stronger part of the ecowas protocol is the free movement of persons goods and services when you go from nigeria to togo through the benin republic you change currencies if you continue to ghana the currency further changes and you continue changing currencies if you move to guinea liberia and so on so people are always changing currency and in the process there are shortfalls and you may think it is not so much but if you pull the aggregate together it goes into millions in that currency or even of dollars now the question is who gets those millions of dollars it is the middlemen and they do not translate into the direct improvement of the economy so the single currency is very good for the region january 2020 was fixed as a benchmark for the take off of the single currency regime but there appears to be some areas of policy conflicts what should be done when i was the minister of african integration i was also the minister responsible for ecowas i must state that this single currency was nigeria s proposal that we should use eco which was got from the word ecowas at some point i was the chairman of the convergence council to bring about the monetary union we must have a convergence of your economic policies of inflation and others so that when they now have a common currency it becomes easy these are all the policies that should have been in place as stipulated in the convergence policy at that time ghana wanted the cedi to be used as the common currency guinea wanted guinea as our money but nigeria came up with the idea of eco and in 2002 or so we adopted the name eco for the currency of course we had to lobby by getting some other countries together and eco was approved as the name for the currency since that time we had the west african central bank that should have been functioning but i do not think it is functioning part of the convergence principles would be that the inflation rate must not be double digits in any country and not meeting those convergences delayed the implementation if they later agreed for january 2020 i see it as almost 20 years late because some countries are not moving in the time that i was referring to nigeria was at the forefront of ecowas being developed as a strong building bloc for the african union it is the community blocs ecowas the one in south east central and north africa that should be the building bloc for the au but the au has since been formed having the common currency in the ecowas region will be a start of greater things to come from the colonial era the francophone countries have been using the cfa franc and with that they already have a common currency and when we proposed eco they bought into it and they have now gone to use eco we hope that eco will not just replace cfa franc because if they meet the convergences then eco is the currency we hope that nigeria and other countries will move quickly over the years we nigeria have been tagged as the big brother of africa but are we truly still big we are a big brother because we are the largest in terms of population and the largest economy but right now when you are a big brother without money in your pocket will your little siblings come after you for largess i think it is a temporary thing for nigeria because in the last couple of years the economy has gone down except those who are deceiving the public after all all the indices of poverty are high while the indices of a wealthy nation are low if the government takes the economy seriously and works in the right direction nigeria will come back to be the big brother of africa again at the moment we are faced with insurgencies coming from bandits to boko haram and other groups now considering the peacekeeping role we have always played in other nations do you think we have got that commensurate payback role from other african countries the first question we should ask is whether nigeria has called other african countries to come and help in peacekeeping i am not aware if we have asked if we ask i think they will except for countries like cameroon chad and niger that are protecting their areas we do not have countries that are directly working in nigeria for the peacekeeping mission but nigeria will tend to ask the united states of america european union to assist them when the african brothers are here who can assist we played key roles in the congo in 1960 also played a key role in liberia côte d ivoire and even south africa because they could not have got rid of apartheid without the key role that nigeria played but if nigeria behaves that it is self sufficient they cannot just come with their soldiers to assist us if nigeria tells the other african countries that the crisis in nigeria would require extra hands i am sure they will come read also efcc forced me to declare assets put me in underground cell shehu sani the president major general muhammadu buhari retd recently said that he was surprised that boko haram still exists what do you read of that i think for a long time the president and the all progressives congress led government has been in denial about boko haram they have not been truthful to nigerians because they keep telling us that boko haram is decimated and we keep read that the same boko haram has struck in borno yobe adamawa and other states in the north east how can the president just wake up not to say that he is surprised i am sure that he is also surprised that fulani herdsmen are carrying ak47 riffles all over the country there are bandits in all our forests who are just jumping on travellers on the highway to kidnap people it shows that there is total insecurity in nigeria and the president is not aware of it just as the president was saying that members of the national assembly also raised concern over the rising wave of insecurity do you think it was by coincidence it is not by coincidence the truth is that most members of the national assembly cannot go to their villages without facing one form of challenge or the other even many of them in the south west will hardly travel by road to ondo ekiti or osun because they are not too sure so if the president is now saying that he is not aware that there is so much violence then i think he has been living in a cocoon he is not living with the people he is living far away from the people when i was minister of african integration we were aware that west africa and nigeria in particular was awash with light weapons and guns and there was an ecowas protocol that we must ensure that non security people do not have access to them some efforts were made and quite a few weapons were recovered and the customs and others had to take all of them to the ministry of defence for them to be destroyed we took them there but did not know what they did with them there are too many guns in circulation and it is only in recent times that fulani herdsmen also started moving with ak47 rifles the herders used to take care of their cattle with the stick and sometimes dagger for domestic use but now they carry ak47 and the question is who gave them that power and how did they get into our borders what has happened with the nigeria immigration services and customs that are supposed to guard our borders it is a major issue and the violence in this country is unbelievable do you think the recent visa on arrival policy that is being implemented is a welcome development at this time the government itself has alleged that the borders in the northern part of the country are porous if you go to katsina there is hardly any restriction between nigeria and niger in terms of movement these people just walk across a fulani cleric recently said they do not need a visa to enter nigeria and that is the truth he said this because he knew the borders are porous but the fact that they just enter nigeria does not make them nigerians the fact that they are fulanis does not make them nigerians if the government is saying that you can come to nigeria without a visa it could be a policy but i do not think it was well thought out the president just went to egypt and announced it and i think if it is a nigerian policy it should have been announced here and not in a foreign land i think what probably would happen is that if you get in through the controlled borders like the airports or seaports of land borders where there are customs and immigration you will be required to bring in your passport and then they can give you visa on arrival but is it being reciprocated by other african countries that should be a policy that should be tabled at the au to be accepted by all in the ecowas countries it was when i was a minister that we did the ecowas passport now in any nigerian benin republic ghanaian passport you will see the ecowas logo on it and it simply means that a nigerian going to any of the ecowas countries do not need a visa that is part of the integration we are talking about worried by the deplorable state of insecurity in the country the south west governors recently constituted operation amotekun but they were confronted by the initial opposition by the federal government what is your reaction to this it was after the plans to establish amotekun was hashed that the president is saying that he did not know of the level of insecurity in the country if he knew it before the amotekun plan was unveiled he probably would have realised that it was a way for governors to protect their people in our constitution it is said that the governor is the chief security officer of the state but he is a cso that has no police or army so if he wants anything he will have to ask the commissioner of police who in turn will get directive from the inspector general of police all of these are the anomalies that came into play when the army took over at the time we got independence there were local government police and in 1963 we changed from parliamentary to presidential system and now became the federal republic of nigeria but today we are more like a unitary republic of nigeria because a lot of things that are on the concurrent list are things that should belong to states look at agriculture the federal government has no land by the land use decree of 1978 all lands are vested in the governors so where is the business of the federal government having the ministry of agriculture again the ministry of water resources ought not to be in the federal structure because the waters are with the states the military because of their unitary system with a single command structured the country along that line whereas democracy is not like that it simply means that restructuring is very necessary tagging the operation amotekun as illegal was greeted with a lot of responses from across the country what is your reaction to that action it was the attorney general of the federation abubakar malami that declared it illegal and we know that the decision was not reached at the federal executive council meeting the attorney general on his own went off the handle and declared it illegal whereas it is not if you say that it needs legal backing by the promulgation of laws in the various state houses of assembly it is a different matter i want to believe that he did not seek the view of mr president before he came out with that pronouncement i think he acted unilaterally and ultra vires to declare a thing like that as illegal you first take it to the fec and it is after then you make such pronouncement after a robust discussion must have been held so i think our attorney general is over bloated in his view at this point of insecurity is the issue of community policing apt it is not only community policing by state police look at the united kingdom the united states germany and canada there is state police county police and city police go to italy there is the vigilia ulvano which is the police for the city these things are not new they only keep criminals in check if in my community in epe the divisional police office is from sokoto state who does he know in the community and how does he reach the community people and how will the people access him he will just be like a foreigner who is there whereas if the dpo is a citizen of the area he will know nearly everybody so if there are miscreants he will know and there are people who will tell them i understand that the national assembly is already saying that community policing is long overdue but i think community state and city police is long overdue in lagos we have over 22 million people we are seriously under policed you may also like some communities practised cannibalism to survive during civil war ex biafran soldier enlisted at 14 do you think our leaders have the political will to tackle insecurity so far in the last five years the government has not shown any political will they have just relied mostly on propaganda if you say you have conquered boko haram and they keep killing people don t they have a sense of shame that they should stop deceiving the people and accept that boko haram is still a serious problem on the day of the election in some parts of borno boko haram threw bombs the federal government should stop deceiving the people you can tell lies and keep telling it a bit one day the lies will bottom out different countries are already mapping plans on how to tackle the recent coronavirus do we have the facility to curtail it if it enters nigeria it is the political will that determines what the government does or not when ebola came into the country we did not have the facilities on the ground to tackle it yet there was the political will the government of lagos state under the administration of mr babatunde fashola took the bulls by the horn we were able to curtail ebola which started in lagos and during the process we lost some precious people like dr stella adadevoh and we stopped ebola to the extent that the united states asked nigeria how we did it if coronavirus comes to nigeria we can curtail it because we have structures on the ground we have public health quarantine and others but it must be done swiftly timeously and in the proper way from what we have read china is making a lot of moves and it is having quarantine units in cities and areas anybody coming from china should be quarantined because the incubation time for the virus is about 14 days so it is important for the government to make these various sectors functional where should the pendulum swing towards in the 2023 presidential election my position is that no part of the country should have the monopoly of leadership leadership should be given to whom it is due if they say it must be retained in the north they are holding it now and the economy is in a bad state should it continue because it is north but if there is a northerner that is known and can revamp the economy and revive it i cannot say no it cannot however be in the north just because they are north unfortunately some northerners behave as if they own nigeria it is not so they do not own nigeria copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on

by sun xi after several rounds of tough negotiations over the past two years the long expected phase one trade deal between the u s and china was eventually signed at the white house in washington by u s president donald trump and chinese vice premier liu he negotiation is the art of compromise clearly both sides made certain concessions to reach the deal on china s side it agreed to increase purchases of u s manufacturing energy and agricultural goods and services by at least 200 billion over two years to enhance protection for intellectual property to root out forced technology transfers and further open its financial market etc to save face china emphasized that those compromises were actually in line with chinese consumers growing appetite for u s products and the nation s general direction of deepening reform and opening up as well as its inherent need to promote high quality economic development in other words china did not give in simply because of u s pressure and the deal was equal on the u s side its compromise seemed to be simpler reducing both existing and planned tariffs on chinese products in fact the biggest concession washington made was to leave those thornier issues of government subsidies and state influence in china for the next phase of negotiations in the deal both nations also agreed to abide by the international monetary fund s principles on avoiding the manipulation of exchange rates just before the signing the trump administration revoked its decision to label china a currency manipulator some said that the phase one trade deal was not a real victory for either china or the u s however it is much better than no deal the deal was clearly welcomed by the business community and most stock markets rallied because of it chinese president xi jinping called the deal good for china for the u s and for the whole world while president trump called it a momentous step one that has never been taken before with china towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade as deng xiaoping the chief architect of modern china wisely predicted the china u s relationship can never be too good or too bad even without the trade war there will be other conflicts between the two ideologically different nations such as recent struggles over huawei hong kong and xinjiang issues president trump will travel to china at a later date to begin talks on the second phase of the trade agreement before the coming presidential election in november that is good as dialogue is always better than confrontation the writer sunshinelkyspp gmail com is a china born independent commentary writer based in singapore
a petrol station of shell in buenos aires argentina reuters royal dutch shell is reining in its vast 25 billion share buyback programme after lower oil and natural gas prices halved its profit in the last three months of 2019 and sent its shares to their lowest in nearly three years the anglo dutch energy company warned again that a slowing global economy could affect its buyback programme which is the world s largest and chief executive ben van beurden said the coronavirus epidemic was dominating the negative backdrop shell is set to buy back about 1 billion of its shares in the first quarter of 2020 down from 2 75 billion previously which means it will probably miss its target of completing the programme by the end of 2020 analysts said van beurden said shell still planned to complete the programme but did not provide a new time frame all economic indicators are working against us he told reporters shell s shares traded in london slumped more than 4 and were 2 8 lower underperforming the overall ftse 100 index which was down 0 7 mainly on fears about the fallout from the coronavirus shell shares hit a low of 2 037 pence matching their lowest on april 21 2017 shares of the world s biggest oil and gas companies have struggled in recent years caught between an unsteady recovery in oil prices and growing investor concerns about the future of the sector as the world tries to shift away from fossil fuels shell had already warned in october that the buyback programme could miss its target because slowing global growth due to the sino us trade war had hit demand for oil natural gas and chemicals with 15 billion done to date it now looks extremely challenging to complete the programme by year end redburn analysts said a rise in shell s debt ratio or gearing to 29 3 in its fourth quarter from 27 9 in the previous quarter added to the pressure on the oil company and van beurden said it was likely to remain above its of 25 target this year shell which pays about 15 billion in dividends every year is aiming to increase payouts to investors through dividends and share buybacks to 125 billion between 2021 and 2025 while rising tensions in the middle east and a phase 1 trade deal between washington and beijing sent oil prices above 70 a barrel in early january they dropped below 60 this week as the coronavirus exacerbated concerns about global growth shell s fourth quarter headline profit fell 48 to 2 9 billion from 5 7 billion in the same period of 2018 its lowest in more than three years as weaker oil and gas prices pushed the company to take a 1 65 billion charge on its us gas fields shell s cash generation a key metric for its operations that have undergone deep cost cuts in recent years also fell sharply to 10 3 billion from 22 billion a year earlier van beurden said if the current global economic conditions continued to weigh shell s cash flow could fall by more than 7 billion in 2020 compared with last year shell s fourth quarter charge was mainly related to its shale natural gas fields in north america rivals including chevron and bp have also booked a number of significant provisions in recent months the drop in net income attributable to shareholders based on a current cost of supplies ccs and excluding identified items to 2 9 billion was below a forecast of 3 2 billion in a survey of analysts provided by shell for 2019 as a whole shell s profit came in at 16 5 billion down 23 from 2018 free cash flow a measure of the amount of money shell has to pay for dividends and share buybacks plummeted to 5 4 billion in the quarter from 16 7 billion a year earlier meanwhile weaker crude oil and gas prices drove quarterly results sharply lower at exxon mobil corporation and chevron corporation pushing down shares at the two largest us oil producers and signaling a weak start to the new year while one time asset sales or write downs were large factors the two companies said earnings suffered from weaker margins in crude oil natural gas chemicals and fuel production they gave tepid outlooks for the near term there s no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment said chevron chief executive mike wirth you roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things shares of exxon and chevron were about 4 lower on friday pressured by the results and worries about global economic growth that drove the broader market lower exxon lost 2 67 to close at 62 12 and chevron fell 4 26 to 107 14 reuters
as the coronavirus epidemic spreads beyond china to become a global threat its possible impact on the world economy has become a hot topic economists warn that the outbreak will have a negative impact on china s economy noting the cost of the virus may rise further if the number of people infected or the mortality rate grows although the chinese city of wuhan is the focal point of the outbreak the virus has spread throughout china and to at least 16 countries globally including thailand france the u s and australia at least 213 people have died in china and at least 9 821 have been infected worldwide on wednesday in an interview with france 24 kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund imf said it is too early to assess coronavirus impact on the chinese and global economies countries suffering from chinese slowdown according to the report coronavirus gauging the market fall out released by dutch based ing bank risk aversion has hit asset markets as the world takes in the news of the coronavirus with uncertainty starting to inflict a further risk premium on assets exposed to chinese demand who would suffer the most from a chinese slowdown the answer to this question seems as yet unclear but some economists have ventured assessments according to the report it will take some time to make proper forecasts of the impact of the virus yet clearly slowing chinese domestic demand will impact the global economy this comes into greater focus when we look at the effects of the 2018 2019 trade war between china and the u s the exact extent to which a weaker chinese economy will impact its global trading partners is also uncertain referring to a 2016 imf study the report offered some insights the impact of a 1 cyclical slowdown in china is largely felt in the apac region where trade linkages are the highest and also in the commodity producing countries it said as the world s largest commodity consumer china lies at the heart of the global commodities market the longer factories remain closed travel restricted and construction stalled the larger the ramification for commodities demand it said adding that this asset class has seen a massive selloff since the virus outbreak countries such as singapore south korea hong kong thailand and malaysia are considered the hardest hit by the crisis on the oil side wider travel restrictions are apparently affecting demand for jet fuel gasoil and other middle distillates within china possible impact on turkey s economy as for turkey any forecast of the outbreak s economic impact must be careful and provisional since it is uncertain how quickly the virus will spread according to erhan aslanoglu a professor of economics at istanbul based piri reis university although in the short term the coronavirus crisis could have a positive impact on turkey s economy in the long term it could carry some risks and uncertainties a decline in commodity prices would be one of the positive impacts the less chinese demand for iron or oil the more the decrease in commodity prices from which turkey as a commodity importer country could benefit said aslanoglu another economic analyst who asked not to be named said that due to the outbreak some turkish goods such as textiles may be preferred instead of china countries would rather do business with turkey the analyst told anadolu agency adding that turkey has a good pharmaceutical industry and such outbreaks can drive up drug demand likewise turkish health tourism could benefit the analyst said adding that as people will avoid traveling to china for some time healthcare demand may shift to turkey as for risks a chinese cyclical slowdown would have a negative impact on eu countries that are selling china technology and engines said aslanoglu he added that if the eu economies struggle so will turkey whose main export markets are the eu around 50 aslanoglu also said that when the global economy faces trouble these fuels demand american japanese and british bonds he said another factor is that if china manages to quickly overcome the crisis in the second quarter pent up global demand for chinese goods will emerge triggering the start of a recovery in china s economy turkish central bank governor at a thursday press conference murat uysal the governor of turkey s central bank also weighed in on the issue if this outbreak continues to spread and grow in one of the world s key economies it will have a serious impact on growth figures uysal said firstly it had an effect on risk aversion and growing risk perception in the markets however it caused a downward pressure on oil prices he said the crisis may have an impact on global trade and commodity prices he added according to uysal if oil prices continue to fall then the impact of the crisis on turkey could seem positive yet in terms of trade and capital flow the country would feel a negative impact as well source anadolu agency

pedestrians wearing facial masks are reflected on an electric board showing stock prices outside a brokerage at a business district in tokyo japan january 30 2020 reuters kim kyung hoon saikat chatterjee i reuters london widely blamed for volatile flash crashes in currencies and equities high frequency algorithms may also be why shock global events including the current coronavirus seem to have lost their power to spook markets for any length of time whether stocks bonds currencies or commodities asset prices seem less prone to any selloff for very long the u s killing of an iranian general and iran s retaliatory missile attack are among potential catastrophes that triggered violent but surprisingly shortlived reactions just since the start of 2020 in both cases knee jerk yen buying and selling of equities faded within hours allowing stocks to scale new record peaks now even as china s coronavirus threatens to throttle economic growth global stocks are not far off all time highs certainly many factors are shaping the resilience not least central bank money printing and rising global savings which boosted the value of world stocks by 25 trillion in the past decade yet it is hard not to link the shift in reaction by financial markets to the rise of automated trading strategies in the past six years the share of algo trading in the 6 6 trillion a day fx market has more than doubled to 27 among fund managers a survey by greenwich associates found there is some reason to believe algos cause volatility especially when trading thins and the humans overseeing them vanish for instance during public holidays that s what likely happened during the wall street flash crash of 2010 and dramatic but fleeting yen moves in jan 2019 but they also offer the advantage of being able to transact at lightening speed at any hour of the day or night with razor sharp accuracy and lower overall costs being machines they are also alien to the common human impulses of fear and greed that tend to take over algorithmic trading is dispassionate said scott wacker global head of fixed income currency and commodity e sales at jpmorgan one bank at the forefront of the algo revolution as a result the reaction function in currency markets to even major geopolitical news has considerably shortened which enables stability to return more quickly in short when left field events hit not only can algos scan and react swiftly to newsfeed many now can gauge the potential asset price impact the most sophisticated can be trained to learn from the experience before the next shock one currency trader familiar with algo use said a machine reading coronavirus cases would typically buy stocks if informed of 500 new cases 10 deaths if it s 3000 new cases 200 deaths they might sell the point being that as soon as a headline is out the machine led market is trading on it the trader said speaking on condition of anonymity but the machines had vol triggers he said meaning they can stop trading when the market moves beyond specified limits how it works simple first and second generation programmes merely broke down large buy sell orders into chunks to minimise market impact now algos can be hooked up to sophisticated language processing technology to read and analyse news feeds then react accordingly all in the space of seconds said antony foster head of g10 fx trading at nomura however this can lead to overreaction in the first instance foster warned the impact in fast moving markets can be outsized if the models rapidly push prices towards existing buy sell order levels trip them and trigger other orders that s what happened when news broke of iran s jan 8 attack according to a quant fund manager who said algos had bought yen with the aim of triggering larger buy orders once a key option barrier was tripped a plausible comparison may be the 0 6 plunge in the s p 500 within the space of half an hour on jan 29 the move came after american airlines and lufthansa said they were suspending their china flights but an hour later the losses had been recouped stephane malrait ing bank s head of market structure and innovation says in such instances algos are programmed to check if moves are in line with price trends if the swings are in response to the an incident human traders can step in to smooth out the trade malrait added next the algos may gauge the seriousness of the incident based on patterns of investor behaviour and economic consequences that followed previous such episodes after the iran missile attacks the message from the specialised data crunchers to the algos was stand down one was geoquant a u s firm which monitors geopolitical events and models the asset price impact we modelled our iranian geopolitical indicator back to seven years and put the current tensions against that backdrop said geoquant ceo mark rosenberg who concluded the risk would subside with minimal oil price impact another firm predata applied its machine reading algorithm to last september s attacks on saudi oil facilities which had raised fears of a regional war to predict what might happen next the programme compares interested parties online attention to a subject with the media coverage it receives predata ceo hazem dawani said the saudi event elicited little reaction from military officials and policymakers the amount of news was far more than the amount of attention being devoted on the particular subject by investors politicians companies directly impacted by them dawani said he concluded rightly that there would be no escalation virus unknowns executives at half a dozen firms providing risk analysis for algo strategies told reuters their services were increasingly in demand but declined to give figures but they acknowledged limitations reactions to the coronavirus for instance could be hobbled because the only meaningful precedent is the 2003 sars epidemic which also coincided with the u s invasion of iraq second the pathogen and its dangers are relatively unknown rosenberg said geoquant s china health risk index was at record highs that has pushed up the firm s social instability risk index for china pressuring chinese markets however he said this correlation breaks down beyond short periods the longer term relationship between chinese health risk and equities chinese or global is basically zero he said
but it offered no large stimulus program to provide more jobs or money in the pockets of india s 1 3 billion residents most of whom barely get by through farming or work in the informal economy nor did the budget propose any additional support for the country s weakened financial institutions the government s 428 billion budget for 2020 2021 laid out a series of modest initiatives including planned investments in new roads and airports and personal income tax cuts along with an increase in bank deposit insurance to reassure customers rattled by high profile bank failures new delhi india is stuck in its biggest economic slump in more than a decade but prime minister narendra modi s budget for the new year unveiled on saturday offers only small steps to try to create a turnaround advertisement our government shall work towards taking the country forward so that we can leapfrog to the next level of health prosperity and well being said modi s finance minister nirmala sitharaman while announcing the budget but jayati ghosh an economist at the jawaharlal nehru university in delhi had a different view it s all smoke and mirrors she said ghosh said the signs of economic distress were everywhere people have gone back to two meals in a day she said children are going without milk india s economy grew about 4 8 percent in 2019 a sharp drop from 6 8 percent in 2018 according to the international monetary fund last year inflation rose and business investment ground to a halt from underwear to automobiles sales of consumer products slowed unemployment rose to 7 5 percent in the last three months of 2019 with city dwellers and young people hit hard according to the centre for monitoring indian economy the weak economy threatens modi s grip on power in the world s largest democracy his bharatiya janata party recently lost state elections in two states advertisement on friday the modi government projected that economic growth would rebound to as much as 6 5 percent for the fiscal year that begins on april 1 international organizations such as the international monetary fund predict a more modest turnaround but forecasting is especially tricky at present with the global economy facing risks from the deadly coronavirus outbreak in china from britain s exit from the european union and from an unresolved trade war between the united states and china modi s government is facing its biggest challenge in years as indians from all walks of life have taken to the streets to protest against the government the protests began in december over a divisive citizenship law that makes it easier for immigrants except those who are muslim to become indian citizens concerns about the weak economy are also seeping into some of the protests economists are worried that the current problems could deepen in the next few months unless the government takes more aggressive action the kind of crisis the economy is currently facing and also the scale of it what is still missing is how you restore the consumption demand which has collapsed said sunil kumar sinha principal economist at india ratings and research a credit rating agency
during a background call with media a senior administration official gives a preview of what to expect and the five points president trump will focus upon during his remarks to congress 1 blue collar boom 2 working families 3 healthcare affordability 4 immigration enforcement 5 national security senior administration official hi everyone so i ll give you a topline issues that will be talked about in the speech a few key insights talk about tone and then take your questions i know there s a lot going on so i ll try to be as brief as i can the topline president trump is looking forward to delivering his third state of the union address and his fourth address to a joint session of congress next tuesday the theme of the state of the union is the great american comeback in his address the president will lay out a vision of relentless optimism he will encourage congress to work with him to continue to building an inclusive economy where the least well off are making some of the fastest gains and where people of every background are finding new opportunities the president will expand on the themes he developed in his davos speech earlier this month and put forward an agenda focused squarely on the needs of working families addressing issues that affect american s quality of life and laying out solutions with can do optimism in the face of unjustified pessimism we are hearing from some in congress now i ll tell you about five areas you ll certainly hear about five issues five buckets you might say so the one first is the blue collar boom the president will report on how the strong economy is lifting up americans everywhere the president will address the importance to the economy of the new trade agreement with china and the usmca explain the results we are seeing from opportunity zones and celebrate america s energy revolution that has led to energy independence second large issue supporting and promoting working families the president will address a range of issues facing working families from ensuring that every child can get a great education to supporting america s parents as they manage the demands of working jobs while raising children he will call on congress to empower parents with school choice the president will highlight his support for paid family leave and expanding access to affordable childcare he will celebrate the administration s workforce training initiative such as the pledge to the american worker third lowering the cost of healthcare for american families the president will call on congress to support the administration s many efforts to lower the cost of healthcare while continuing to provide the highest standards of care in the world with access to the most innovative cures and medical breakthroughs he will contrast his vision with radical proposals being floated on the left clearly socialism is a rising force in the democratic party with very specific designs on our healthcare system and the president will build on last year s address and present a sharp difference the president will emphasize the importance of lowering the cost of prescription drugs he will also address many of the concerns everyday concerns that families face confronting the healthcare system surprise medical billing transparency price and quality information accountability and flexibility to choose the plan and the doctor that is right for them fourth a safe and legal immigration system the president will talk about the incredible progress we have made in securing the southern border he will also take head on one of the most significant threats to public safety sanctuary cities fifth and finally protecting america s national security the president will update congress on diplomatic and military efforts around the world so a few key insights into what people will i think what the speech will communicate what people can take away today s middle class boom is also a blue collar boom america is strong once again president trump has kept his promises president trump is totally focused on creating a better future for working families and then finally i d share that american strength and resolve is the best strategy for keeping americans safe and protecting american interests i think it s fair to say the speech will celebrate american economic and military strength and present an optimistic vision of america s future i can also preview now traditionally we have guests in the gallery and there are two i can preview right now that are going to be there on tuesday i think on monday we ll be able preview some more so the first is a gentleman tony rankins q how do you spell it senior administration official r a n k i n s tony rankins i ll give you a little a brief bio on him after serving in the u s army in afghanistan tony rankins suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and became addicted to drugs he lost his job and his family served several prison sentences and ended up living out of his car a

commissioner mark morgan called deputy chief ortiz an agent s agent who quote epitomizes the core values of u s customs and border protection and with that i ll take questions q hey the president when he delivers the state of the union will either have been in the middle of an impeachment trial towards the end it will have just concluded whatever impeachment is going to be a factor here will he is it safe to assume he will address it will he what will his message be and how will he address sitting in front of the chamber that just either had him on trial or wrapped it up senior administration official what i do it s never safe to assume anything so i m not previewing what the president is going to say about that today clearly there s a lot going on but i m not going to preview q will he say something though senior administration official i m not going to get ahead of what the president will say q thanks last year the president spoke just after democrats gained control of congress and he warned them if there s going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation this doesn t work that way and he said the only thing that could stop inaudible was ridiculous partisan investigations is there going to be any sort of ultimatum laid down this year or any kind of reference to congress s oversight efforts or the now just about to be concluded impeachment investigation i mean is he going to maybe ask for a truce perhaps senior administration official right well you know i m up here to help you sort of get a broad sense of what is going to be in the speech and so there s certain things i ve been asked to preview i certainly haven t been asked to preview exactly what that would look like if it s going to be entertained at all i would say speaking to sort of the spirit of your question i mean if you re sort of wondering what the tone i think the speech is going to have a very optimistic tone and the last three years should give a good indication of you know i think how the president views the state of the union moment for talking about the future and presenting an optimistic vision so q it seems like there s a heavy dose of the economy here can we just ask you a few if you don t mind is the president going to address debts and deficit is he going to address entitlement spending is he going to address tax cuts senior administration official i m not going to address any of those things i mean i m giving you a preview he s going to talk about the accomplishments he s going to talk a lot about the economy he s going to talk about building an inclusive economy where people have opportunities but i m not going to preview what he s going to say about any of those issues q should he touch upon them though at least should we expect to hear those talked about senior administration official sure q what can we expect to hear from the president on the issue of healthcare specifically is there going to be any new initiatives rolled out should we expect something or should we wait for him just to lay out some basic guidelines going into this coming election senior administration official well as in past years this address will have specific calls to congress to act in certain areas i would say if you were looking at the weighting of issues i think healthcare certainly is a key part of the speech and i think you can expect very deliberate or excuse me not deliberate very specific requests for the congress to do certain things on healthcare q and just to follow up on hallie s question we re obviously not operating in a vacuum here impeachment we think the president will have just moved past that what s the tone of the speech as it relates to this moment coming out of what has been this contentious period for the president senior administration official well i would again say if you look at the past three years i mean last year we were just coming off of a government shutdown and nevertheless i think last year could be i think was widely seen by independents and others as a very optimistic forward looking speech a visionary speech i think this will be an optimistic speech and you know without previewing you know no speech is ever final until it s delivered so it s not as if this is in a vacuum pack until tuesday but i think the president will be focused on you know the interests of the american people and in that spirit i think he s going to give a positive forward looking vision q i m just wondering broadly which foreign policy points he might touch on particularly china trade and the middle east peace plan senior administration official as you noticed i didn t give a lot on the national security section but if you look at the last several years of the joint session speeches the state of the union speeches you ll see that he does a fair bit of going through areas of the world but i won t preview anything in particular q just following up on the foreign policy question can you address iran specifically i know you re not going to get ahead of the content but again going back to the question of tone what tone can you expect to hear from him as it relates to iran which is arguably been one of his biggest foreign policy challenges this year senior administration official i think it s fair to say determined you know forceful strong those would be good adjectives q i m not asking you to get into the details because i m sure you won t but will there be any big ticket policy items that he will unveil on tuesday night senior administration official often depends on one person s interpretation of big ticket but i think you know very important in terms of his agenda yes i mean q just along those same lines senior administration official did i already call on you q you did senior administration official oh you asked me to spell sorry go ahead laughter q along those same lines that john just asked will he kind of give an outline of what he would expect for a second term if he were to win should we expect that and what kind of items will he inaudible senior administration official well he s going to he s going to call on the congress working with him on several things in terms of a second term agenda i mean some things take time so i think things that he s calling for this year if they don t happen he ll continue to call for them i ll come next to you q as we see it right now we don t all know whether the impeachment vote will happen before or after the speech sort of like a choose your own adventure thing two forks in a road are you guys committed to is he going to give the same speech no matter what or are you preparing contingencies based on the calendar senior administration official i wouldn t call it contingencies i mean i ve been here a couple years here and things events always happen and so it wouldn t be out of the ordinary for the speech to evolve before it s delivered so it wouldn t be anything different than any other significant q right but at this point given this is such a big choose you own adventure moment have you guys written blocks of the speech in case the vote happens or blocks the speech in case it s still pending senior administration official well i don t want to get into the process but the president is always adaptable to speak to the moment and what s required and we re fleet of foot to be able to do that q thank you q you said me next senior administration official oh sorry yes i did say you sorry q just a reminder laughs senior administration official yeah laughs q this very much seems like a campaign rally speech that the president is directing toward his supporters in order to address the other half of the country during this moment of extreme division in the country will the president talk about unity like he has in the past and how will you get around the criticism that follows after that he s just reading from a prompter and doesn t really want to unify the country senior administration official well i take issue with your characterization that he only speaks to one part of the country in terms of the blue collar boom i mean for example more minorities and women got jobs last year than otherwise the 72 percent i think of women got jobs in the last year the greatest wage gains are for people at the lower lower end of the income area the focus on jobs and opportunity training with the pledge to american workers covers all ranges of people in society so i think that it s unifying because i think the speech will be unifying in part because the president is focused on opportunity for all americans so i would strongly disagree q but is he going to acknowledge that other half that doesn t have any faith in him right now senior administration official well the president is focused entirely on helping all americans rise in this economy and if you read the davos speech you ll see in mind numbing detail the economic indicators that he s doing that he s doing that with passion because he believes that his job is to put the american people first and american workers and american families way in the back q yeah thank you given that this is number four this will be the first time the president has done one of these while there are people in the chamber who are wanting to replace him as president how does the president feel about that will he mention any of those people or allude to them in any way senior administration official i won t preview if he s going to call anybody out because i but i think the president will be entirely comfortable with that i think yeah i ll just i ll just say that have i called on q right here senior administration official yes q is there any chance that if the vote hasn t happened yet that the date of this changes senior administration official that is beyond anything that i would be able to address q and can i ask one more question senior administration official sure q has anyone outside the white house helped the president craft this speech senior administration official the president talks to lots of people and certainly you know i wouldn t give you any specific information about anyone who s outside the white house crafting a speech q jeff mason senior administration official yeah q will there be any legislative proposals in the speech and a follow up on i think maybe blake asked about tax cuts the president has previewed that he wants to do a tax cut 2 0 can we not assume that that s something that he ll talk about on tuesday senior administration official well i wouldn t make any assumptions but i didn t preview that and i don t there are a lot of things i haven t previewed but i don t want to un preview them so q and with regard to legislative and with regard to legislative proposals will there be any legislative proposals in the speech senior administration official well as i mentioned like in years past he will have calls for the congress to do certain things i think they call q thank you very much senior administration official yeah q will the president address about the north korea nuclear issues or korean peninsula in his speech senior administration official no comment on you know i m not going to address it or preview that and you know in years past he s addressed the north korean situation so way in the back gentleman way in the back yeah you q which of the president s proposals do you expect democrats to stand and applaud senior administration official i think there could be a couple q which ones senior administration official i ll come back to you one second q thank you very much sir what are we expecting as far as small businesses are concerned because they are the ones in general to create jobs and also middle class what are we expecting from the president senior administration official well as i mentioned he ll talk about how the economic policy that he has pursued has lifted up the middle class and especially blue collar workers he ll talk about the manufacturing jobs i expect that have been created he ll talk about how the tax cuts have helped small businesses he ll talk about how the energy revolution has really lifted everybody up in terms of you know lower gasoline prices lower energy prices q thanks a lot last year one of those rare instances of bipartisan applause was when the president said that america will never be a socialist country do you see a return to that theme at all in the speech senior administration official well all i will say to that is that as i said in the topline you know he s going to build off what he said last year and present some contrasts especially when it comes to healthcare so q will he acknowledge that will he mention the fact that this is an election year and acknowledge how difficult it is to get things done in presidential election years senior administration official no comment on what he ll say about that i mean i m not going to preview anything he ll say about inaudible q well will he specifically mention hey i know it s an election year senior administration official you know i don t know i mean everybody knows that laughter so i don t know if he ll make it explicit or not q in 1999 president clinton delivered a state of the union in the middle of impeachment i guess two questions about that one have you guys studied that speech at all or looked at how he dealt with it and also that was a super over the top bipartisan let s talk about bipartisanship kind of speech do you expect this speech to have any sort of overtures to bipartisanship senior administration official well i would just say that the economy doing so well and the president s emphasis on continuing the policies that are lifting people from all walks of life every age background that s unifying i ve heard the president say in a different in a public forum that he always thought americans could unite around success and you know in that respect whether certain people don t see the president being uniting or unifying the facts of the matter the facts of the economic consequences are they in a way they do unite because people can be united around success q should we expect any major initiatives in the foreign policy portion of the address could you talk about that without going into specifics senior administration official well of course this past week the president laid out his peace plan proposal i don t think we ll have anything of that magnitude in the speech but i wouldn t i didn t preview anything but he may he may talk about that to some degree but i think there won t be anything you know certainly earth shattering or new with respect to foreign policy q yes the president just signed the usmca in a ceremony no democrats who were invited is there are there going to be any democrats as guests is there going to be any way that he talks about the fact that things have been not very friendly between to the two parties senior administration official i don t know actually whether any i don t know the party affiliation of the guests i would not be surprised if some of them are democrats but that s just speaking about the guests i don t think the president is going to address that in particular i don t think he s going to be explicit about it q is there a nexus between the opportunity zones and this guest tony rankins did something good happen to him because of the zone specifically senior administration official i mentioned that the company is operating that has hired him and trained him is in an opportunity zone q what did it do for the company how did it help him senior administration official the opportunity zone made the company capable of doing what it s doing and we can provide more information on that way in the back the gentleman there in the back q yeah thank you the president spoke last year in last year s address about ending endless wars i m wondering if he would talk about that again or speak at all about trying to bring u s troops home from overseas senior administration official i think the president has talked very consistently about that i won t preview what he ll say in the speech but he has talked very consistently about that in the past right here in the front q can we anticipate anything on coronavirus and efforts being made to make sure that this doesn t become a bigger problem senior administration official yeah i won t preview what s going to be said as you know this is a busy news day and i think the state department put some things out and the cdc i expect you know people i mean i know the president is closely monitoring it and i wouldn t be surprised between now and tuesday there will be more that will said about that but i won t preview what the state of the union will say about that because i q thanks a lot senior administration official yeah q it s been a busy week for the president he s had the rollout of his vision for peace in the middle east the usmca a rally last night in iowa what s been the rhythm of his engagement with speechwriters this week how often has he been dipping into the speech how engaged has he been and when has he found time to do that senior administration official well you know we travel yesterday i was on travel yesterday saw the president spoke to the president you know we hear from the president all of the time whether we re in the room or not by what he is saying what he is you know like the usmca we have a very clear idea of what the president s vision is in a lot of areas and then when necessary we ask specifically and engage q did he veto any guests that you guys have planned senior administration official i m not going to get into the speechwriting process other than to say that the process begins and ends with the president trust me on that q thank you very much regarding the mentioning of the u s china phase one trade deal will the president be giving more details about future steps senior administration official i m not going to preview what he s going to say on trade but yes q can i just ask about timing do you expect this to be a little shorter speech a longer speech compared to the last couple addresses senior administration official i think comparable comparable to last year s i mean to the last several years yes q do you anticipate him mentioning anything of the first lady s initiatives inaudible senior administration official i would not be surprised in years past the first lady has had guests that reflect her initiative and i wouldn t be surprised if that s the same this year as i mentioned earlier we ll have some more people for you on monday who will be guests in the gallery q will he be mentioning though any of her initiatives or there will be guests reflecting her initiatives senior administration official i m not going to preview that today but on monday we ll have some more guests mr deere we ll take one last question q no you haven t called on me senior administration official i haven t called on you okay q so just back to the tone i m not asking for content but you re a speechwriter so we re very used to his speeches now you know every week or two weeks with some very let s say colorful language which his supporters like you know just last night we had adam schiff shifting like a sweaty dog or sweating like a dog or something like that we ve got the democrats will end basically end the entire country as we know it ripping babies out of wombs and so on is this the type of language that will be in there or will it be a different kind of president trump speaking senior administration official well i d say very generally as i said i think the tone will be optimistic in the past i ve sort of said if there s one word to describe his speech and vision last year i think i said visionary and another year i said unifying i think optimism optimistic is the adjective i would use you know in davos he had a line in the davos speech something to the effect of this is not a time for pessimism and doubt this is time for optimism and hope so i think q will he talk about the apocalypse laughter senior administration official i think it will be generally in that spirit that this is not a time for pessimism this is a time for optimism q you mentioned optimism and hope what connection do you think he might make to the perceived threat of undocumented immigrants senior administration official well in the past he s you know he talks about immigration he s going to talk about success on the southern border i think that there have been illegal crossings have declined by i believe it s 72 percent over the last seven eight months you know the border wall is going up and he s going to talk about that success as i mentioned he s going to talk about the challenge of sanctuary cities q you got a running time yet senior administration official someone asked me about the running time and i said it will probably be comparable to last year q and just to clarify the theme is the great american comeback a vision of relentless optimism all together senior administration official no no the great american comeback q oh okay q and sorry just quickly how many people were involved in working on the speech would you say senior administration official well you know basically the whole government works on this speech because you engage in a process that it touches upon every department q yeah but i mean like writing it really involved in it senior administration official well several people like i said it begins and ends with the president are we done laughter mr deere thanks very much everybody just remember is on background to a senior administration official your embargo is now lifted thank you

the prices big power generators receive have collapsed but don t expect that to show up on your power bill any time soon if ever average active wholesale contract prices have fallen roughly 36 per cent over the past three months forward prices are depressed way off into the future too down 26 per cent in 2020 15 per cent in 2021 and around 10 per cent into 2022 and 2023 but at the household level there is little change in sight it has a lot to do with the slow transmission of pricing signals to the households through annual regulated price reviews as well as the factors framing a power bill then there are the supply and demand dynamics within the electricity grid itself a quarter or a third lopped off your power bill forget it it might work out to 1 or 2 per cent in a couple of years time according to leading analysts such as david leitch principal at energy consultants itk at the household level half the price is poles and wires that s fixed and if anything will go up mr leitch said only around 25 per cent of a household power bill directly relates to the wholesale price and the other 25 per cent cover retailers margins and costs such a meter reading so if the wholesale price goes down say 10 to 15 per cent down the track it amounts to a couple of per cent on the bill mr leitch said consumers will see little change this year prices might come down 1 or 2 per cent over two years for big consumers it would be a bit more maybe around 5 per cent greenview strategic consulting director jon dyson agrees households will not see much difference not in the short term mr dyson said even if you see a sustained 10 per cent drop in wholesale price it translates to 2 5 per cent on a power bill and that s assuming it all gets passed through as we ve seen with banks and interest rate cuts it s something you can t assume jp morgan energy analyst mark busuttil does not see the wholesale electricity and gas price collapse as sustainable particularly with forward looking futures prices lower than spot prices the rapid and significant collapse in wholesale electricity prices over the last three months has caught us by surprise mr busuttil told clients in a research note on the gas side we estimate queensland gas producers require 8 10 gj gigajoule to be economic well above current prices of 6 50 gj on electricity renewable power plants are only marginally economic and there has been a noticeable slowing of capacity coming online demand down supply up mr leitch said the slump in the wholesale price was a complex issue as much if not more to do with a sudden fall in demand for electricity rather than improvements on the supply side demand for the big generators has fallen by 0 5 per cent per annum this march quarter there so far hasn t been the big peaks in demand there were last year he said electricity consumption across the national electricity grid was down almost 20 per cent last week and that has been the trend since the start of the year mr leitch said falling demand was not a surprise given the rapid uptake of rooftop behind the meter solar generation that now makes up around 7 to 8 per cent of energy consumption energy efficiency is also ongoing and that s also encouraged by high prices he said look at the us california has higher unit prices but their power bills are lower than texas with its much cheaper power on the supply side the loy yang 2a coal fired unit and the mortlake gas peaking plant are up and running again despite doubts they would be ready for summer new wind and solar are also having some impact as are lower coal and gas prices what about gas more gas generation is coming online which should help chisel off the peaks in sudden price spikes agl has just opened a 210mw fast start generator at barker inlet in south australia a smaller 132mw unit in southern queensland at gatton is in the pipeline as is a 330mw plant at dandenong on the outskirts of melbourne as for more supplies from new gas fields that is problematic given spot prices are uneconomic and future contracts are more than likely to be discounted substantially the current spot price is 6 50 because the queensland producers can t sell it to the chinese for more so they re just as happy to sell it domestically and take the heat off canavan s gas reservation plans mr leitch observed mr busuttil said the downward pressure on prices continued to reflect a sustained increase in new supply east coast gas production has trebled from around 640 petajoules in 2014 to 1900 petajoules last year unless there is a response from high cost producers to lower prices further supply growth could continue to weigh on spot prices this calendar year mr busuttil said noting projects from senex in queensland as well as beach and santos in the cooper basin are likely to add to supply electricity futures v gas prices electricity futures prices fell with collapsing gas prices source jp morgan bloomberg aemo mr dyson said more gas would help keep wholesale prices down particularly heading off sharp spikes gas helps cap wholesale prices roughly between 100 and 200 mwh if more gas is exported that shifts up to 300 mr dyson said however mr leitch argued the new plants would ultimately be only intermittent contributors to the power grid they would largely be battling it out with the expanding fleet of big batteries both aiming to make big money in short sharp bursts of low supply and increasing spot prices they will provide extra security in places like victoria and south australia particularly if yallourn closes early mr leitch said however emissions from gas generation will become an issue just as it has with other fossil fuels he said it is already a big emitter anyone thinking of building a cogen plant designed to operate in the daily balancing market is likely to have to confront a carbon cost during the lifetime of the plant

gone are the days of leaving it to the world trade organization to deal with allegations of dumping and other such disputes president donald trump is using tariffs instead including a 25 percent tariff on steel imported from the european union canada and mexico that went into effect in june lately there s been little downtime at lexcentral steel s bedford park processing plant thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors workers put spools of steel each weighing as much as five cars through machines called slitters where they re sliced into threads that are sold and shipped to companies across the midwest that produce everything from car doors to lockers to shelving walk through any area hardware store target or walmart and chances are you ll see shelving and other products that were processed at the bedford park plant shipments are up about 10 to 15 percent compared with last year owners project shipments are up as much as 40 percent from the bottom of the doldrums around 2005 or 2008 steel has been in the spotlight thanks to trump following through on a campaign promise to take decisive action to revive the american steel industry thank you all and i m thrilled to be here in granite city with the men and women of u s steel great company trump said in his speech there last month today we re celebrating a great victory a victory for all of you for this community and for our entire country it s all good news for the offshoots of lexgroup co celebrating 50 years as a one of the nation s largest flat rolled steel distributors this is the first time in a decade i ve gone into customers and the number one concern is we need more people we need workers we need welders we need tool and die guys we need guys to work in a factory lexcentral steel president bill douglass said i think people are looking tariffs a little too narrowly it s not about protecting the steel industry it s about opening markets every product that we can open up overseas for our products our cars our manufacturing goods our stuff anything we can open up overseas which is heavily tariffed is going to bring manufacturing back here and i think that s ultimately what we want his father lexgroup ceo robert douglass who has spent his entire career in the steel industry is a trump fan who appreciates the flexibility tariffs provide their ability to poke and to prod especially compared with dumping cases that he said are so carried out with repercussions that come too late tariffs are an immediate tool and it s just a tool it s a tool to get attention it s a tool to renegotiate he said you don t have a trade war that you ve already lost we have a deficit trade with darn near every product that we have so all we have to do is get the attention that ok renegotiate some of these things trade wars are saber rattling but when you ve already got a horrendous deficit what more do you have to lose that s the whole thing he too says the focus on tariffs is overblown compared to the effect of the congressional tax code overhaul on the economy the tax changes and depreciation laws really incentivize manufacturers to buy new equipment and we will be doing it next year people are doing it now he said so more important than tariffs are the tax laws that enable new equipment to be purchased but that equipment thanks to tariffs it could cost more the steel tariffs and the aluminum tariffs are going to create winners and losers by either putting taxes on imports coming from foreign suppliers or by putting quotas that limit how much we can buy from abroad that s going to raise the price of steel and aluminum in the u s said jonathan dingel associate professor of economics at the university of chicago booth school of business so that makes firms that produce steel and aluminum happy the price of their output is higher it makes customers that use that steel and aluminum unhappy so a lot of companies from coca cola to caterpillar have announced that they ll be passing through some of those cost increases as price increases for the consumers that buy their goods the university of chicago recently surveyed leading economists from uchicago yale harvard and mit they were asked whether the new u s tariffs on steel and aluminum would help americans welfare every economist who responded said the tariffs would not help americans trade policy and the steel industry are complicated so dingel says it s hard to say when you ll start to pay more for that can of coke a new car or condo but there are already fears and reports of higher steel prices hurting construction then there s the question of a trade war i would say at the moment it might be a trade spat or a trade skirmish more than a trade war but of course you worry that spats or skirmishes can turn into a full blown war dingel said i think what s really difficult for businesses right now is the amount of uncertainty surrounding trade policy it s hard to make investments or make plans if you can t be sure what the tax rate is going to be on steel aluminum auto parts etc that uncertainty comes not just from questions about what trump will do but what additional possible retaliatory actions other countries may take and which industries they will affect but the leaders of lexgroup steel aren t concerned pointing out that in a war both sides have a lot to lose dingel says illinois is like a microcosm of the nation there are clear winners and losers here u s steel and companies like lexgroup are feeling the advantages of tariffs while local manufacturers even soy farmers hit by retaliatory swipes are on the losing side follow amanda vinicky on twitter amandavinicky related stories us economy strong but trump s tariffs could cause problems us chamber 3 8 billion worth of illinois goods threatened by trade war escalating trade war sparks fear for wall street us consumers thanks to our sponsors view all sponsors
super bowl viewers hoping for a break from partisan bickering and politics are in for a disappointment democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg bought a commercial for the widely watched event and decided to use his chance to reach millions of americans to push misinformation and fearmonger in favor of his anti gun agenda meanwhile president trump tapped into his war chest to run an ad of his own making the case for his reelection trump spent 11 million on the commercial which emphasizes his strong economic record it highlights the record low unemployment rate we ve seen during this administration as well as burgeoning wage growth and strong economic prospects for african americans and hispanics the president makes the case that voters should back him because the best is yet to come as my washington examiner colleague tiana lowe noted it s a strong ad with the right focus trump is wise politically to focus on the economy rather than repeat his 2018 midterm mistake and make 2020 about anti immigration sentiment and the president absolutely does deserve credit for the successful economic results we ve seen in part due to his tax cuts deregulatory agenda and pro business policies but as most political ads do trump s commercial leaves out a few key economic realities that voters ought to be aware of for one trump has completely utterly failed to reign in the national debt and the annual budget deficit on the campaign trail in 2016 he promised to eliminate the debt entirely within eight years a very very unrealistic promise instead we re back up to 1 trillion annual deficits bloated budget deals and woeful future fiscal projects from the congressional budget office this isn t entirely trump s fault as both parties leaderships in congress deserve serious demerits for such reckless spending as well yet it s a blight on his tenure nonetheless especially in light of the unrealistic promises he made racking up this much debt is a ticking time bomb and it unfairly burdens future generations to the benefit of those who cash in now additionally trump s trade war and use of protectionist tariffs have taken the shine off of his economic results yes we ve had decent economic growth and recently seen an uptick in wages and yes employment figures look strong but in all three cases we would have better results today if we hadn t lost billions due to the president s foolish anti trade policies the tariffs levied on china have killed more jobs than they protected also protected them from what economic progress and efficiency plus they ve imposed higher prices on us all as american consumers not china largely pay for the tariffs as costs are passed along so sure nod along when you see trump s ad flash across your tv screen during the super bowl i sure did just don t forget that the complete economic picture isn t nearly as rosy as the president would have you believe

can a septuagenarian socialist who just survived a heart attack and would be 80 years old in his first year in office be elected president of the united states it s hard to believe but not impossible as of today bernie sanders looks like one of the better if not best bets for the nomination polls have him running first or second in the first three contests iowa on monday and then new hampshire and nevada if bernie can best main rival joe biden in iowa he will likely thump joe in new hampshire biden s campaign built around electability could suffer a credibility collapse before he reaches south carolina where joe is banking on his african american base to rescue him if necessary and give him a send off victory straight into super tuesday if sanders can beat biden two or three times in the first four primaries in february the last remaining roadblock on sanders path to the nomination could be mike bloomberg s billions hillary clinton may sneer nobody likes him but bernie has a large dedicated loyal following especially among millennials and tens of thousands more small dollar donors than any other democratic candidate he is flush with cash he has a radical agenda that appeals to the ideological left and the idealistic young the rising star of the party alexandria ocasio cortez is campaigning alongside him and say what you will sanders is no trimmer or time server he has consistently voted his values and views he voted no to bush 41 s gulf war no to bush 43 s iraq war no to nafta no to gatt in the 80s when president reagan battled the marxist sandinistas in nicaragua sanders was on the other side but what makes sanders an appealing candidate for the democratic nomination may prove poisonous to him as a party nominee in the fall for what does bernie promise free tuition at public colleges and forgiveness of all student debt medicare for all a single payer government run health care system that would require a huge hike in middle class taxes and abolish private health insurance for the 160 million americans currently enrolled he would break up the big banks go after wall street add 60 trillion of federal spending in the next decade and raise income corporate capital gains estate and inheritance taxes he would expand the government s share of the u s economy to levels rivaling that of france the highest in the free world bernie was first to back the green new deal and pledges to reach carbon neutrality in 10 years in energy and transportation as for our oil gas and coal producers says sanders they have evaded taxes desecrated tribal lands exploited workers and poisoned communities how would sanders deal with the millions of illegal migrants now within the country he d welcome them all in bernie has proposed the abolition of immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection and wants to provide a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million to 22 million illegal migrants already here he would decriminalize border jumping and give health and welfare benefits to the invaders he would decriminalize the breaching of america s borders my first executive orders tweeted bernie last week will be to reverse every single thing president trump has done to demonize and harm immigrants including his racist and disgusting muslim ban leaders of the center left think tank third way warn that a sanders nomination risks a democratic rout of the magnitude of the 49 state losses of george mcgovern in 1972 and of walter mondale in 1984 vulnerable democrats in moderate and swing districts would have to jump ship abandoning the ticket to survive the slaughter fearful of such an outcome to a sanders trump race super pacs run by moderate democrats have begun to dump hundreds of thousands of dollars into attack ads to blunt his momentum in iowa what socialist jeremy corbyn did to britain s labour party leading it to the worst defeat since the 1930s sanders could do to the democratic party write jon cowan and jim kessler of third way in 2016 sanders ran a surprisingly strong race for the nomination and it was later learned that a supposedly neutral dnc had been in the tank for hillary clinton the democratic establishment the party elite had collaborated to put the fix in against bernie yet sanders supported clinton that fall if however bernie s last chance at the nomination is aborted by an establishment piling on party super pacs running attack ads against him and major media taking time out from trashing trump to break sanders the democratic party will have the devil s time of it bringing bernie s backers home in the fall bernie s believers might just conclude that the real obstacle to their dream of remaking america is neither the radical right nor donald trump but the elites within their own party the dispatch editorial board is made up of publisher peter imes columnist slim smith managing editor zack plair and senior newsroom staff
