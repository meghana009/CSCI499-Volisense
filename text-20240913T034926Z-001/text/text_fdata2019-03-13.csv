while the global financial crisis appears to have been contained stress fractures continue to appear in various parts of the world interestingly while growth prospects for advanced countries are sluggish asia and africa are turning out robust performances there has been a sigh of relief among policy makers that the global financial storm did not trigger the economic depression and protectionism of the 1930s world trade is steadily increasing thus reviving output growth and commodity prices although the recovery is still tepid especially in the oecd regions and largely jobless ben bernanke the us central banker summing up this sombre mood said notwithstanding some important steps forward i think we would all agree that for much of the world the task of economic recovery and repair remains far from complete olivier blanchard chief economist at the international monetary fund imf agrees the world economic recovery is proceeding but it is an unbalanced recovery sluggish in advanced countries much stronger in emerging and developing countries the imf expects growth in advanced economies at 2 7 this year and 2 2 in 2011 with the us and euro area again slowing down as policy stimulus is gradually withdrawn banking sector weaknesses still remain hindering both credit provision and consumption in marked contrast asian led emerging markets ems are projected to surge at 7 1 and 6 4 respectively this year and next concurrently global output is forecast to grow by 4 8 in 2010 and 4 2 in 2011 but a sharper downturn or double dip recession is unlikely according to latest world economic outlook survey the 2009 crisis inflicted colossal human cost in terms of job losses and rising poverty unemployment is a major worry since 210m plus people across the globe may be jobless an increase of over 30m since 2007 the international labour organisation ilo believes the advanced world must wait until 2015 to regain the total level of employment registered before the crisis and warned that this delay can increase social tensions in communities it noted in the 35 countries for which data exists nearly 40 of job seekers have been without work for more than one year and therefore run significant risks of demoralisation loss of self esteem and mental health problems the impact is far more severe in poorer nations with no social safety nets for vulnerable groups areas of conflicts the challenge is to engineer a smooth transition from public to private sector led growth in several oecd economies and from external to domestically inspired growth in key dynamic ems the world is now strongly integrated and that requires closer coordination unless advanced countries can achieve robust private demand both domestic and foreign they will find it difficult to regain fiscal consolidation conversely if growth in advanced world were to stagnate ems would suffer from a plunging export demand and lower diaspora remittances with a fragile and very uneven recovery national interests are diverging and the progressive era of international cooperation pledged at the g20 summit in april 2009 is rapidly fading yet to avoid renewed crises there needs to be a sense of shared responsibility between the developing and advanced economies and the international institutions the imf s first deputy managing director john lipsky said the long running conflict is between washington and beijing over the undervalued yuan alongside china s huge 2 42 trillion forex accumulation the us favours the yuan s appreciation in order to aid a rebalancing between surplus and deficit countries for beijing the cheaper currency supports export growth guido mantega brazilian finance minister recently spoke of the risk of a currency war over the past year the use of money printing schemes i e quantitative easing to pump liquidity into the economy via the purchase of government bonds and ultra low interest rates in the us and western europe has led to swelling capital inflows into leading ems that led to upward pressure on currencies asset prices and inflation rates with the risk of economic destabilisation caused by asset price bubbles some countries have imposed or are planning controls on hot money the influx of short term capital brazil has doubled a tax on foreign purchases of domestic debt to 4 whilst thailand reinstated a 15 withholding tax on interest payments and capital gains on bonds held by foreign investors south south trade we are witnessing a new world order with the surge of ems that now account for the bulk of global expansion and the erosion of us european power for sub saharan africa ssa the stellar growth of em economies presents ideal opportunities to diversify trade and fdi flows which are already happening at a faster pace with china india malaysia and russia chinese fdi stock reached 7 8bn by end 2008 40 confined to south africa and one tenth of india s total outward fdi is in ssa mostly in mauritius with its offshore financial facilities and attractive tax regimes côte d ivoire senegal and sudan have also attracted indian investors this year india s bharti airtel bought much of the african mobile phone networks of kuwait s zain for 10 7bn while the total value of african mergers and acquisitions sales to russian investors in 2009 reached 2bn recently arab gulf investments in ethiopia sudan and tanzania have risen especially in agriculture but seizing this opportunity requires strengthening african economic competitiveness notably by improving public infrastructure taking advantage of faster emerging market growth also requires bringing economic policies back on an even keel by rebuilding the policy buffers that served so well during the crisis explained imf s african department head antoinette sayeh fortunately most of ssa weathered the external downturn with greater resilience thanks to prudent macro financial policies and improved state institutions regional growth is predicted at 5 this year and 5 5 in 2011 thus close to regaining levels seen before the crisis not enough credit was given to the countries policy leadership nancy birdsall president of the centre for global development told the panel in new york significantly health and education spending rose in real terms in 20 of the 29 ssa countries during 2009 improving local capacity the 2009 recession has set back progress towards achieving the millennium development goals mdgs which aim to cut hunger disease maternal and child deaths and other ills by the 2015 deadline the world bank estimates that 71m fewer people will have escaped abject poverty by 2020 and 100m more people could lack access to clean water in 2015 while an additional 1 2m children might die before age five between 2009 2015 to regain momentum it s vital that rapid and inclusive growth be restored quickly low income countries lics face substantial financing needs to close the infrastructure gap barrier to sustainable development with tighter global markets reflected in scarcer and more costly capital as well as diminishing official aid these economies will need to increasingly rely on domestic sources of funding this puts a premium on financial development hence the need for developing well regulated viable local capital markets and banking systems to spur growth and attract foreign capital lics should invest more in basic infrastructure mainly power generation and transportation and nurture a pro business environment public private partnerships in stable legal frameworks that minimise fiscal risks and diaspora bonds also offer innovative financing the imf stressed countries need to mobilise and use domestic resources more effectively create conditions to attract fdi and strengthen their capacity for safe borrowing all these should aim at engendering private sector led growth the main goal is making lics more resilient to future exogenous shocks the rich world should keep intact their gleneagles promises on bilateral aid and liberalise trade by unlocking agricultural markets and providing technical assistance moreover initiatives are needed to improve poor countries market access for example extending 100 duty free and quota free access to the least developed countries with liberal rules of origin such initiatives will promote manufacturing based exports hence greater diversification of the economy improved market access need to be supported by stronger trade facilitation and aid for trade programmes to enhance these countries trade capacity foreign trade is one of the most effective ways that rich nations can help their poorer counterparts without much budgetary cost a long awaited conclusion to the doha round would unblock trade in sum much of the world continues to struggle through a jobless recovery and the growth outlook is subject to downside risks lacklustre progress with financial restructuring weighs on credit thereby slowing the normalisation of fiscal monetary policies with adverse effects on ems everything hinges on restoring balanced and sustainable global growth growth is not enough but certainly without it other efforts to achieve the mdgs will be frustrated urged imf chief saleh more efforts are needed to improve supervision regulation of the banking sector which was at the heart of near global disaster but still remains a weak point
are social conditions in ecuador beginning to deteriorate a report released in june 2018 on poverty and inequality by ecuador s national institute of statistics and census found that poverty crept up slightly between june 2017 and june 2018 with 24 5 of the population living in poverty up from 23 1 the year before while these numbers may appear low they could be a sign of things to come as the ecuadorian government under lenín moreno doubles down on economic policies favoring austerity and deregulation while attempting to discredit the left the political and economic prognosis appeared quite different when moreno was elected in april 2017 representing the center left ruling party alianza país country alliance narrowly defeating neoliberal banker guillermo lasso the latin american left against the backdrop of a resurgent right turn was relieved onlookers expected moreno to continue the progressive advances his predecessor rafael correa had made during his tenure in office under the citizens revolution with perhaps a softer edge but once in office moreno swiftly pivoted on his campaign promises governing with a right wing neoliberal agenda that has already chipped away at the gains of the citizens revolution and could threaten to bury it entirely alianza país is now split moreno who served as correa s vice president from 2007 to 2013 has changed the party leadership and its priorities correa and his supporters left the party in january 2018 and have not been allowed to form their own party structures since meanwhile under moreno s leadership alianza país has lost much of its previous support since his inauguration moreno has claimed his government inherited an economic and institutional crisis presenting neoliberal adjustment policies and austerity as the solution in the process moreno and his allies have lambasted correa era infrastructure projects as examples of government corruption and mismanagement as well as cornerstone education and technology projects such as the innovation hub known as yachay city of knowledge he also cautioned that the recently refurbished oil refinery in esmeraldas was severely damaged its scheduled temporary shutdown was postponed repeatedly until it was finally enacted in march 2019 moreno has claimed that correa installed a camera in the presidential palace to monitor his every move the new authorities also tried to put correa on trial on numerous occasions in a clear attempt of political persecution one of the attempts was to put correa on trial for kidnapping without noteworthy evidence interpol failed to issue a red alert notice citing human rights far from a personal feud between two leading politicians less than two years into his term in office moreno has proven that despite being elected as a candidate of the left his government is executing a right wing agenda the citizens revolution the citizens revolution led by rafael correa from 2007 to 2017 followed a period of high instability and dissatisfaction with the neoliberal development model influential and politically well connected business groups were able to negotiate special regulations and capture rents through cartels and monopolies between 1996 and 2006 no elected president had been able to complete his term of office in the late 1990s ecuador slid into a severe crisis following financial deregulation economic output plummeted and the state shelled out billions to rescue the banks then president jamil mahuad whose government had close ties with the financial sector was eventually overthrown in a popular uprising in early 2000 shortly after announcing the country s official dollarization even before the crisis inequality had increased massively in the period between 1999 and 2005 hundreds of thousands of ecuadorians left the country mainly to spain and the united states the remittances they sent home along with rising oil revenues were essential to economic recovery however while economic crisis eased political instability continued in 2005 the next elected president lucio gutiérrez was toppled the slogan que se vayan todos or out with them all illustrated that protests took aim at the entire political economic establishment rafael correa s election marked a fundamental change in ecuadorian politics his citizens revolution passed one of the world s most progressive constitutions in 2008 approved by popular vote in 2008 the new constitution marked a clear departure from neoliberalism by enshrining the principle of good living or buen vivir in spanish or sumak kawsay in quechua and emphasized social and cultural rights a stronger role of the state and socially and environmentally sustainable development given the dissatisfaction with the established party system and its ties to business elites correa s actions to limit the influence of the special interest groups were highly popular his approval rating was close to 74 percent in 2007 and only dropped below 50 percent in 2016 according to latinobarometro the correa government owed much of its popularity to its massive investments in public infrastructure roads hydroelectric power plants schools health centers and other projects in order to reduce reliance on volatile oil revenues the government spearheaded a fight against tax evasion and avoidance leading to significant increases in fiscal revenues including social security from 12 7 percent in 2006 to 20 5 percent in 2015 oil revenues were no longer invested abroad for low returns at home but used to strengthen social and economic infrastructure in ecuador many of these investments help to stabilize today s foreign trade balance ecuador s per capita economic growth averaged 1 5 percent between 2006 and 2016 well above the growth rate of 0 6 percent from 1980 to 2006 the proportion of residents with unmet basic needs fell from 52 percent in 2006 to less than 36 percent in 2014 however the government faced criticism for pushing through an extractivist agenda and not going far enough to put the rights of nature enshrined in the constitution into practice the government s relations to social movements and trade unions were fraught social movements opposed correa s rejection of a rapid transition from extractivism which has long been a cornerstone of ecuador s economy at the same time some of the better organized trade unions and social movement organizations that had gained niches of influence in the government before the citizens revolution found themselves shut out of political decision making under the correa government when correa began to push through an anti corporatist agenda the most affected groups were elite representatives but trade unions and social movements lost presence within the state apparatus as well in response these groups started to oppose the government beyond that the correa government s confrontational style fueled conflicts with social movements government attempts to withdraw legal status from the environmentalist ngo acción ecológica certainly contributed to the narrative of an authoritarian government as well as government attempts to ouster the indigenous conaie federation from its head office in quito allegedly due to continued violations of the legal terms of usage while the correa government denounced violence by anti government groups indigenous and environmentalist movements saw government support for extractivism as the root cause for violence though in some cases these movements charged correa with not going far enough most saw his party as more supportive of the rights of nature than other parties owing in part to social movements initial support for moreno the citizens revolution entered a difficult period in 2014 in part due to the crash in oil prices oil exports plummeted from about 13 billion in 2014 to little more than 5 billion in 2016 total exports fell from 25 8 billion to just 16 8 billion a devastating earthquake in 2016 worsened the situation due to dollarization the government had less recourse for adjusting exchange rates credit requirements rose while interest rates for new loans increased ecuador s economic output stagnated in 2015 and fell by 1 2 percent in 2016 according to eclac figures yet by 2017 the economy was growing again the correa government withstood pressures for more radical steps towards austerity that would have deepened the crisis instead it developed creative mechanisms to withstand external shocks and stabilize the economy for instance by making use of central bank loans to the government given the severity of the unexpected events and the limited capacity of a dollarized economy to respond the economic downturn was surprisingly mild and short compared to previous crises despite that ecuador s conservative opposition portrayed a supposedly large and unproductive state apparatus as the root cause of an unprecedented economic emergency though corruption in large infrastructure projects no doubt played a role accounts in corporate media are exaggerated in particular opponents used the large scale corruption scandals surrounding the state owned oil company petroecuador and the brazilian construction company odebrecht to emphasize a narrative of a rotten state that begged a radical shift in the country s development strategy elected left governing right once elected moreno declared that unlike correa he would fight corruption and reduce debts by adopting the right wing s framing moreno gave legitimacy to neoliberal policies and the return of business elites to the highest levers of state power net public debt which is more telling than gross public debt figures was still relatively low when moreno took office in may 2017 it had reached 27 7 percent up from 12 2 percent in 2009 but still far from the 65 1 percent it had reached in 2000 in early 2018 moreno gained support for institutional changes through a seven part referendum carried out in february 2018 without the approval of the constitutional court and lacking basic conditions of a fair process questions on the referendum were politically misleading for example it proposed to restrict the territory for additional oil production in yasuní national park from 1030 to 300 hectares but the state owned extraction company only planned to drill in 236 hectares of the national park even prior to the referendum meaning the passage of that section of the referendum meant little in practice moreno also proposed to add close to 60 000 hectares to the zone as a way to cull support from environmentally concerned or progressive citizens while planning to loosen restrictions to oil extraction and tourism in the buffer zones close to the park meanwhile the government s attempt to repeal a capital gains law revealed the new administration s ties with the real estate sector without proof the moreno administration presented the law as responsible for a downturn in the construction sector one of the main goals of the referendum however was to block correa s eventual return to power by banning reelection and to dissolve the council for citizen s participation and social control cpccs the autonomous cpccs was part of a transparency effort responsible for appointing authorities to various federal electoral and judicial posts the new government labeled it as too close to correa and made it responsible for the selection of officials who turned out to be corrupt instead of trying to find ways to make it more autonomous the referendum gave the executive branch alone the right to nominate the members of a new transitional council the transitional council cpccs t was granted powers far beyond the constitution justified as necessary to fighting corruption cpccs t president julio césar trujillo oversaw the ouster of dozens of high ranking officials in the justice department and state regulatory agencies and appointed interim successors in august 2018 the cpccs t purged the constitutional court judges alleging that their predecessors in the original cpccs had not acted independently when designating the judges although new judges have been selected in a questionable process ecuador has been without a constitutional court for months today the moreno government caters to the interests of rent oriented sectors whose influence the correa administration had sought to curb with some success although moreno initially kept correa s economics team mostly intact he has since replaced the remaining progressive economists with neoliberal ideologues and representatives of private sector interests most notably moreno appointed richard martínez former president of the ecuadorian business committee as minister of finance in may 2018 marking a radical shift to the right in comparison to moreno s first finance minister carlos de la torre while martínez is moreno s third finance minister he is the first to accept moreno s figures on the country s debt moreno s figure of about 60 billion in public debt is an exaggeration as it includes liabilities such as fines from international arbitrations that are usually not counted as public debt as well potential fines that may turn into liabilities in future moreno has used the calculation to accuse correa of surpassing the official limit for public debt which the citizens revolution set at 40 percent of gdp which he used to justify another lawsuit against correa this along with other actions has undermined investors confidence in ecuador s ability to service its debt and increased the risk premium for government bonds in spite of rising oil prices this has limited the country s ability to effectively restructure its public debt in a useful way in february 2019 ecuador reached a loan agreement with the imf alongside additional loans from the world bank and other financial institutions information on their terms and conditions is still limited but recent massive layoffs in the public sector could provide a first hint without winning an election the economic elites and their representatives have gradually returned to the levers of state power as moreno has appointed right wing figures to top offices after the elected vice president jorge glas was removed from office and imprisoned on corruption charges based on shaky evidence maria alejandra vicuña became moreno s second vice president vicuña a long term supporter of the citizens revolution a former parliamentarian and a member of the leftist bolivarian alfarist alliance aba a current within alianza país began to denounce alleged corruption within the citizens revolution but was herself forced to step down over corruption allegations she allegedly compelled her office staff in parliament to contribute a fraction of their salaries to her personal bank account which she later declared was to benefit the aba movement in late 2018 radio broadcaster otto sonnenholzner was appointed moreno s third vice president while vicuña whose leftist background did not inspire confidence in economic elites had been elected by a narrow margin sonnenholzner received the support of moreno s alianza país and the main right wing parties the parliamentary faction of the citizens revolution loyal to rafael correa voted against sonnenholzner what s more vicuña s corruption has apparently been used to provide cover for larger scandals such as thousands of unauthorized bank debts for allegedly contracting insurance policies without clients consent or offshore funds allegedly used to furnish moreno s apartment in geneva the latter was the tip of the iceberg of a much wider scandal of bribes and offshore bank accounts surrounding moreno to protect the president ecuadorian institutions have so far blocked demands for an investigation of these events meanwhile moreno s policymaking has severely affected the state s capacity to monitor control and regulate private economic activities after the 2018 referendum the government started to propose and implement neoliberal economic policies more directly namely through moreno s new economic policy adopted in june 2018 its measures include liberalizing foreign trade introducing new tax exemptions creating tax loopholes removing barriers to capital flight into tax havens and implementing austerity measures the law prohibits the central bank from lending to the government and requires public banks and social security to invest in private bonds and equities the law also slashes any leeway in the field of monetary policies despite dollarization an attempt to impose fiscal discipline at the same time the legislation includes an amnesty for billions of unpaid social insurance contributions and tax payments the limits of conservative restoration initially moreno s turn against his predecessor appeared to pay off politically with a spike in approval ratings in his first months in office he was able to rely on a broad alliance of left and right wing critics of correa private media profoundly hostile towards correa boosted his cause scandals media spectacle and a discourse of an oppressive state under correa have enabled moreno to dismantle the citizens revolution and undermined confidence in the public sector meanwhile moreno s assertion that his government inherited a severe economic crisis and a highly indebted country is used to justify economic adjustment for example in late 2018 his administration increased the price of fuel which may be a positive step environmentally in the long run but in the short term will trigger growing discontent among the population and will weaken the purchasing power of ecuadorian consumers as moreno pursues his conservative agenda a growing number of social sectors have begun to distance themselves from the government the government s neoliberal policies have not thus far led to the promised economic success and reflexive attempts to blame problems on correa are losing effectiveness the deterioration of social conditions that we have seen already is a warning that ecuador is in danger of sliding back into the same kind of instability and political crisis that characterized the era before the citizens revolution timm benjamin schützhofer is a political scientist and holds a masters degree in global political economy as part of his recently completed doctoral studies at kassel university he examines the fiscal policy challenges of resource dependent states using ecuador as an example
he drew attention to the fact that the people s republic has already become the world s biggest economy in real terms adding that it will likely become the world s largest in nominal terms only in the middle of the next decade china thinks in centuries and will not be hurried the analyst underscored he recalled that china benefited greatly from a cheap yuan policy during its period of phenomenal export driven economic development between 1979 and 2010 china s average annual gdp growth amounted to 9 91 percent it sold high quality manufactured goods in return for newly minted dollars which were initially invested in us treasury securities so as to maintain a cheap yuan and more recently have been swapped for real assets in africa asia and europe and china runs down its us dollar reserves which no longer serve the purpose they once did the analyst noted according to kraus while china now benefits from a very gradual internationalisation of the yuan the central bank of china is very wary of losing control over their currency which is allowed to fluctuate only within relatively narrow bands the yuan is allowed to rise or fall only by 2 percent from its central parity rate each trading day in the country s spot foreign exchange market a truly globalisation of the yuan would first of all require convertibility kraus highlighted china will render the yuan freely convertible only when they consider it in their own interests to do so while china is increasingly able to price its exports in yuan providing a cost savings to already highly competitive chinese corporates which are no longer required to hedge their dollar exposure imports will continue to be priced in dollars for the foreseeable future
the purpose of this article is to assess the macro fiscal flows for france and determine what effect these flows will have on the stock market and the economy macro fiscal flows impact investment markets with a lagged effect of typically one month a flow of funds now from government spending or bank credit creation will lead to a boost in investment markets one month later to understand the fiscal flows one has to look at the balance of sectoral flows within the french economy using stock flow consistent sectoral flow analysis professor wynne godley first comprehended the strategic importance of the accounting identity which says that measured at current prices the government s budget balance less the current account balance by definition is equal to the private sector balance gdp federal spending non federal spending net exports as a percentage of gdp all three sectors sum to zero and balance each other out the chart below shows the national budget information to january 2019 france is not sovereign in the currency that it uses it has no legal right to put more euros into circulation if it so chose france uses the currency of the european union and borrows euros at interest from the european central bank in effect france operates on a fixed exchange rate system similar to a gold standard in the case of france and the other eu members a federal government deficit means that the government is in effect indebting itself to a foreign power and if it were to have trouble paying its national debt it could find itself treated like greece and cyprus were in the last sovereign debt crisis following the gfc boom bust todayâ s neoliberal washington consensus reverses classical liberalism by favoring predatory rent extraction regressive tax policy and deregulation â reformâ now means undoing what in the 20th century was considered to be reform anti labor policies to reduce union power and workplace protection are labeled reform as is the rewriting of bankruptcy laws reversing the long trend of more humanitarian treatment of debtors nowhere is the doublethink vocabulary more blatant than in the financial conquest of greece by the eurozone â troikaâ â the european central bank european commission and imf james galbraith an advisor to greek finance minister yanis varoufakis was asked whether â the institutions the imf the ec and the ecb will have to rescue greece indefinitely â he answered there is no â rescueâ going on here there is no â rescue â there is no â bailout â there is no â reformâ going on i really need to insist on this because these words creep into our discourse they are placed there by the creditors in order for unwary people to use them but there is nothing of the kind taking place what is going on is a seizure of the assets owned by the greek state by greek businesses and by greek households there is no sense that this has anything to do with the recovery of the greek economy or with the welfare of the greek people on the contrary the policy is utterly indifferent to those considerations source hudson michael j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception islet verlag kindle edition the greek and cyprus experience is no doubt what prompted the brexit decision in britain an example of another democratic referendum like the one that greece held and said no to austerity that will not be allowed to be implemented the two charts below show credit creation and loan growth by commercial banks over the last year over the past calendar year credit creation has been constructive and has consistently grown at over 4 6 this comes off a large base in terms of percentage of gdp as the chart below shows and represents the private domestic sector deficit the stock of private debt is over 257 of gdp that is a lot and is more now that after the gfc the following chart shows the current account over a similar period france s current account is in deficit meaning that it is swapping euro credits which as a foreign currency it has to borrow or earn for real goods and services and it s trading partners are content to save in euros not being sovereign in its currency france is not able to create euros at its central bank to meet its balance of payments deficit in the way that the usa does the latter is a good situation to be in few understand the concept of the privilege that a coveted sovereign currency provides it is essentially a free lunch earned from the quality and good standing of the currency the stronger the currency the more resources one can obtain with it what becomes relevant for a nation not sovereign in its currency is to what level it has been loaded up with foreign debt and this is shown in the chart below france s national government debt is in effect its stock of external debt owed to the ecb at interest and if not paid greece and cyprus type economic solutions are applied france s external debt is 97 of gdp and makes france vulnerable to outside influence under today s global linkages this foreign debt is the main lever to turn democracies into oligarchies the 2012 2015 crises in argentina and greece showed how little sovereignty debtor countries have in the face of the absence of an international court recognizing the ultimate need to write down sovereign debts threats by bondholders to cut off credit cause banking chaos and seize public assets to pay vulture funds and other creditors enable the imf the european central bank and even vulture funds to override democratic regimes and public referendums the upshot is that it doesn t matter what voters want or whom they elect economic policy is dictated by the bondholders and they are rapacious in demanding austerity and kindred imf conditions source hudson michael j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception islet verlag kindle edition sectoral balances taking the above information for international and national macro fiscal flows one can calculate the sectoral balances and these are shown in the table below source trading economics dot com plus author calculations estimate to be updated when the end of year numbers are known forecast based on existing flow rates and plans the table shows that the private domestic sector is in positive territory which allows it to accumulate net financial assets the drain from the external sector is offset by the positive flow of funds from the government sector france s membership of the eu means that it will be commanded by the eu and ecb to reduce its deficit spending because it has a stock of government debt larger than the guideline of 60 of gdp and even then only allowed a maximum of a 3 deficit budget per year like italy france is expected to reduce its deficit spending and lower its stock of debt to below 60 of gdp that is regardless of the actual need to have a deficit larger than 3 of gdp to advance or maintain the public purpose the famous yellow vests have emerged to show what happens when a government cuts into the public realm too much to obey brussels and its neoliberal policy agenda and shows the danger of giving up one s currency sovereignty it is not long before one has lost ones national sovereignty too impact on the stock market france has had the worst performing stock market since the 2000 dot com and 2008 gfc boom busts as the chart below shows the question is how and why has this occurred below is a chart of the stock market over the last 10 years set above a chart of the national government budget and the current account balance over the same period the steadily decreasing government budget is the reason why private sector assets such as the stock market are performing worse as compared to others the french government presents its national budget in september each year the fiscal year and calendar year are the same in france from the chart above one can see that this makes a distinctive impact on government fiscal flows taxes are paid at the end of the year and there is a massive drain in liquidity at this time and the stock market tends to drop at the juncture of the new year the new budget is approved in september and spending gets underway soon after and the stock market tends to rise in the second and third quarter of each year then december comes around and a large part of what was spent into the economy is taxed out again the difference is the government s deficit which by mathematical definition is the private sector s surplus private sector assets can rise by the amount of this private sector surplus plus how much the banks can leverage this small increase the chart below for this last year shows this flow of funds impact to good effect one notices the lagged effect of the flow of funds the tax cash drain peaking in december caused the stock market to fall and then the stock market rose again in tandem with government expenditure while the government flow of funds has a steady identifiable budget based heartbeat pattern to it the same cannot be said of the current account the current account flow of funds appears random and because it is a small percentage of gdp it has little or any influence on the stock market on a consistent tradeable basis when one contrasts this phenomenon with the stock market in the chart above one sees that generally speaking each calendar year begins with a dip and then a recovery money extraction followed by money injection one must also observe the current account flow of funds and the global macro influences as well the chart above was kindly produced for me by mr robert p balan as part of his pam service and shows global financial flows for the five largest developed economies in the world i recommend the pam service for its advanced fiscal flow analytical capabilities the chart shows that global g5 bank balances are bottoming at present and will rise sharply into june 2019 french national liquidity each monthly is generally better than the last until peaking in september october this will be taking place against a background climate of higher world fiscal flows until june july and means that the french stock market is likely to perform well into summer and then sag into the end of the year as both national and international fiscal flows peter out the french stock market may outperform others after june given the strong national flow of funds and then sink into december of 2020 there are three broad fiscal flows to watch 1 national that tend to have a lag one month lagged impact on the stock market 2 us m2 flows lag 6 months 3 g5 m2 flows lag 12 months the last two flows in the chart above have been advanced to represent the lagged impact on the market and in this role are a leading indicator for the stock market the chart uses a rate of change calculation as experience has shown that it is not the size of the flows that matter but their rate of change an investor wishing to trade these stock market movements could do so using the following french etf funds that mirror the broad stock market index

in the us are imported as are about half of the fresh fruits and fruit juices and almost one third of the wine and sugar as high us incomes drive consumption the volume of us agricultural imports has increased by 4 per cent annually on average since 2000 mexico and then canada are expected to remain the top us agricultural suppliers in fiscal year 2017 regulation what is the regulatory environment for primary agriculture and primary food processors in your jurisdiction a number of federal and state statutes regulate agricultural activity in the us the us congress has the power to regulate agricultural production under article 1 section 8 of the federal constitution programmes and laws that pertain to farming are overseen by the secretary of agriculture who represents the us department of agriculture usda in the president s cabinet the usda is the federal executive department responsible for developing and executing federal government policy on farming forestry and food it has a number of purposes such as being responsible for the safety of poultry egg products and meat the 10th amendment of the constitution gives states the right to pass laws that promote the general safety and wellbeing of the public courts have found that agricultural production and consumption directly affect public health and safety thus the 10th amendment provides the basis for states to enact their own agricultural laws provided that such laws are not in contravention of federal laws and regulations the us addresses agricultural and food policy through a variety of programmes including commodity support subsidies nutrition assistance and conservation the primary legal framework for federal agricultural policy is set through a legislative process that occurs approximately every five years the current farm law the agricultural act of 2014 2014 farm act was signed on 7 february 2014 and will remain in force through 2018 and beyond with respect to some provisions the effects of the 2014 farm act included major changes in commodity programmes new crop insurance options streamlined conservation programmes modification of certain provisions of the supplemental nutrition assistance programme and expanded programmes for specialty crops organic farmers bioenergy rural development and beginning farmers and ranchers as of september 2018 a new farm bill has not been passed on 18 may 2018 a block of conservative republican lawmakers joined democrats in the united states house of representatives to vote against the 867 billion new farm bill points of contention for the new farm in congress revolve around more robust work requirements before someone can claim food stamps immigration tariffs and environmental conservation furthermore the federal food and drug administration fda is responsible for ensuring that the us food supply is safe wholesome sanitary and properly labelled the fda regulates the production and supply of food products through the food drug and cosmetic act fdca and related rules and regulations parties that violate federal and state laws and regulations for food production and distribution can face severe civil and criminal penalties and lose the ability to distribute food products relevant organisations what are the main non governmental organisations and non profit organisations in the agribusiness sector in your jurisdiction non governmental organisations ngos and non profit organisations play integral parts in shaping us agricultural policies and programmes overarching programmes such as the farm credit system farm credit finance rural infrastructure projects and agricultural activities across the sector with its source of capital from wall street farm credit made its first loan more than a century ago and comprises a nationwide network of 77 customer owned lending institutions that are cooperatively owned institutions that lend to farmers ranchers farmer owned cooperatives and other agribusinesses rural homebuyers and infrastructure providers in rural america combined farm credit organisations provide more than us 235 billion in loans leases and related services which is more than one third of the credit needed by us agriculture capital extended by farm credit finances approximately 500 000 borrower owners in agricultural production activities land and farm equipment acquisitions and the construction of facilities for commodities storage packaging and processing other ngos and nonprofit operate at the state or federal level for instance the american farm bureau federation provides a national advocacy platform to advance the educational economic and social interests of farmers and ranchers state farm bureaus provide targeted agricultural support at the local level additionally specific sectors and states have trade organisations that focus on particular commodities and geographical areas such as the california fresh fruit association the corn refiners association and the us dairy export council finally organisations such as 4 h serve as youth development programmes that encourage students to pursue agricultural related interests and careers to bolster the pipeline of the next generation of farmers and ranchers land acquisition and use legislation identify and summarise the legislation addressing agricultural property transactions in your jurisdiction outline how farmland is typically held there are no federal laws requiring tendering or prior approval for the sale of privately owned agricultural land and as such private parties can contract for the sale of agricultural land this is usually facilitated by a purchase and sale agreement however there may be reporting requirements for foreign investors of us real property a breach of which could lead civil penalties and cause the land to escheat to a specific state with a reimbursement to the foreign owner at market value additionally the us government currently owns approximately 28 per cent of the country s total land base property owned by the federal government is not usually available for purchase by the public however if government property is deemed surplus the general services agency can ultimately make it available for purchase through a competitive sale process finally while most states have legislation addressing agricultural leases federal law primarily relates to grazing the 2008 farm act expanded support for conservation practices on all cultivated land including fallow land to remain eligible for specified programme benefits farmers cropping highly erodible land are required to implement an approved conservation plan highly erodible land conservation provisions or sodbuster and to be in compliance with wetland conservation provisions programmes such as the environmental quality incentives programme and the new conservation stewardship programme provide assistance on lands in production land retirement programmes including the conservation reserve programme crp the conservation reserve enhancement programme and the wetlands reserve programme wrp remove environmentally sensitive land from production and establish long term resource conserving cover under the 2014 farm act the acreage cap for the crp was scheduled to decline from 32 million acres to 27 5 million acres beginning in fiscal year 2014 and by 24 million acres in 2017 agricultural conservation easements are used by the federal and state governments and non profit to preserve farmland development restrictions are recorded on deeds and run with the land either permanently or for an agreed length of time landowners voluntarily restrict their land in order to receive benefits either in terms of direct cash payments or tax incentives non agricultural land rules outline any rules related to use of farmland for non agricultural uses the us is primarily an urban population living in a rural nation according to the us department of agriculture economic research service usda ers a key policy objective is to mitigate the loss of farmland for reasons of food security preservation of rural lifestyle environmental protection and the prevention of urban sprawl all 50 states have enacted their own right to farm laws these statutes seek to protect qualifying farmers and ranchers from nuisance lawsuits filed by people or companies that move into a rural area where normal farming operations exist and who later use nuisance actions to attempt to stop such farming operations a variation of the right to farm law creates agricultural districts agricultural operations located within these districts are protected from nuisance suits and local regulations that limit normal agricultural practices in addition to nuisance suit protection some districts may include tax incentives for landowners additionally some states use zoning as a means of protecting farmland zoning regulations can dictate minimum parcel size limit permissible uses and deter sale for other uses permissible uses are generally associated with the overall agricultural purpose and include farm labour housing processing facilities and marketing facilities furthermore urban growth boundaries ugbs are planning boundaries used to focus urban expansion and growth inward ugbs set the limits for a city s projected growth an urban development cannot extend past an ugb and more compact efficient development occurs in already urban neighbourhoods within the boundary finally several states have statutes or constitutional provisions that restrict the power of certain corporations to engage in farming or agriculture or to acquire purchase or otherwise obtain land that is used or usable for agricultural production most corporate farming laws are enacted as statutes rather than constitutional amendments nine states have laws that prohibit or limit corporate farming these are south dakota north dakota oklahoma iowa minnesota wisconsin nebraska missouri and kansas the primary goal of corporate farming laws is to protect the economic viability of family farms in light of the threats from competition with corporate owned or corporate managed farms lending how is lending secured by farmland addressed in your jurisdiction do special rules apply for farm lending us farm debt has been steadily rising the usda estimates that total farm business debt was 357 billion at the end of 2015 an increase from 279 billion in 2010 the usda s current estimates reflect that farm business real estate debt outstandings rose 36 per cent and non real estate farm business debt rose 18 per cent in the five years ending in 2015 while traditional mortgages allow for the purchase or refinance of a residential property farm financing is specifically for properties that are zoned agriculturally and as such the property has to involve the production of agricultural products such as growing fruits and vegetables or raising livestock additionally agricultural lenders typically require that a borrower have enough experience working on and running a farm or agricultural property to justify a loan farm credit continues to be the dominant lender to us agriculture commercial banks held nearly half of all non real estate production farm debt with farm credit holding more than 46 per cent of farm business real estate debt farmland secured debt in 2015 loans priced through farm credit are based on bonds issued by the farm credit funding corporation fcfc the bonds are considered to be risk free because they are guaranteed or backed by the fcfc a government sponsored entity the farm service agency fsa is a part of the usda the fsa offers loan programmes to farmers that are unable to obtain personal or commercial loans the fsa offers loans that are guaranteed and are direct loans to the borrower guaranteed loans provide the lender with a guarantee of repayment of 95 per cent of the loan amount if the borrower defaults on the loan these guarantees help borrowers because it makes agricultural lending more attractive to lenders congress created the federal agricultural mortgage corporation farmer mac farmer mac as a secondary market for farm mortgages in order to accomplish its goal farmer mac offers three loans programmes farmer mac i farmer mac ii and rural utilities farmer mac is not a direct lender instead offering its programmes through various lenders around the country creditors rights are there provisions relating to creditors rights on default by farmers that apply in your jurisdiction the us constitution delegates authority to congress to enact uniform bankruptcy laws thus barring states from having individual forms of bankruptcy however state laws defining and regulating the debtor creditor relationship affect bankruptcy proceedings since some sections of the bankruptcy code incorporate these state laws the bankruptcy code is found in title 11 of the us code it provides five different types of proceedings under the two broad categories of liquidation or reorganisation the individual proceedings are referred to by the code chapters where they are established chapter 7 involves liquidation while chapters 9 11 12 and 13 involve reorganisation chapter 12 applies specifically to eligible farmers farms and farm businesses the agriculture crisis of the 1980s led us congress to enact emergency legislation creating a bankruptcy proceeding specifically applicable to farmers chapter 12 was created to provide farmers with a mechanism to reorganise their debts and retain their land owing to the urgency surrounding the enactment of legislation and the uncertainty of its ultimate successfulness chapter 12 was originally enacted as a temporary measure and contained a sunset provision that required periodic action to renew the code section in 2005 however congress enacted the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 codified in scattered sections of title 11 of the us code which made chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code once a debtor files for chapter 12 the proceeding automatically stays most collection agents the court appoints an impartial trustee to evaluate the case and aid with disbursement each debtor however is entitled to remain in possession of the farm assets subject to specific duties and can only be removed for cause after a debtor has organised a repayment plan a meeting of creditors is held where creditors and the trustee question the debtor regarding their financial affairs and the proposed plan after the court confirms the repayment the debtor must meet their obligation to make regular payments to the trustee in order to ensure creditors receive payment publicly controlled property describe any rules relating to public control of farm property in your jurisdiction what legislation governs them the federal government under the fifth amendment to the constitution and state governments under the 14th amendment to the constitution can take privately owned land for public uses us constitution amendments v xiv section 1 this right to take private property is called eminent domain there is no definition of public use but courts have upheld public use to include the construction of governmental buildings transportation improvements the development of utilities and other purposes benefiting the public if a government exercises its eminent domain powers under the constitution it must give the landowner just compensation for taking the real property this is generally the fair market value of the property ie the amount a buyer would willingly pay a seller foreign ownership restrictions are there any restrictions on foreign ownership of farm property in your jurisdiction what legislation governs them foreign investors in agricultural land are subject to the agricultural foreign investment disclosure act of 1978 and state anti corporate laws see question 5 though not specific to agriculture the us has established a committee to review foreign investments in domestic companies committee on foreign investment in the us cfius if a foreign investment is subject to cfius approval the parties must first submit a voluntary notice to cfius however cfius can review transactions under its jurisdiction even if no notice is submitted upon receipt the staff chairperson confirms that the notice satisfies the regulatory notice requirements and if so circulates the notice to the other cfius members triggering the start of a 30 day review period cfius then reviews the transaction to identify whether it poses any national security concerns cfius can request additional information initiate another investigation or refer the transaction to the president in its discretion all of which extend cfius review period in addition to the cfius approval there are several statutes that require information gathering and disclosure relating to foreign investment in domestic companies the international investment and trade in services survey act of 1976 authorises the us president to collect information on international investments and us foreign trade the foreign direct investment and international financial data improvements act of 1990 directs the bureau of the census and the bureau of economic analysis of the department of commerce to exchange business data obtained under the census that is relevant to the international investment and trade in services survey act the agricultural foreign investment disclosure act of 1978 requires a foreign person acquiring an interest in agricultural land to report the transfer or acquisition to the secretary of agriculture within 90 days the domestic and foreign investment improved disclosure act of 1977 requires any party acquiring 5 per cent or more in a company registered with the securities and exchange commission a public company to disclose certain identifying information to the government finally foreign investments can also be subject to antitrust laws and restrictions government programmes support programmes does the government provide agriculture support programmes to producers processors or agriculture related businesses and organisations outline the programmes and how they are generally accessed the usda administers programmes to support farm income assist farmers after disasters and conserve natural resources the usda provides support through agricultural subsidies and insurance which cost about 20 billion annually insurance crop insurance provided by the usda s risk management agency has become the largest farm programme with annual outlays of about us 8 billion subsidised insurance protects against various business risks such as adverse weather low production and low revenues and covers more than 100 crops the risk management agency subsidises both insurance premiums and the administrative costs of the 19 private insurance companies that offer policies to farmers agricultural risk coverage arc this programme pays subsidies to farmers if their revenue per acre or alternately their county s revenue per acre falls below a benchmark or guaranteed level more than 20 crops are covered by the arc while arc subsidies fluctuate they amounted to approximately 7 billion in 2016 price loss coverage this programme pays subsidies to farmers based on the average national price of each particular crop compared to the crop s reference price price loss coverage subsidies cover more than 20 crops and were about 2billion in 2016 conservation programmes the usda runs numerous farm conservation programmes which cost more than 5 billion a year the largest is the crp which pays farmers about 1 7 billion a year to conserve millions of acres of their lands by keeping them out of production see question 4 marketing loans this programme delivers higher payments to farmers when market prices are low and cost about 400 million in 2016 disaster aid the government operates various disaster aid programmes for different types of farmers such as wheat growers livestock producers and orchard operators in addition to permanent disaster programmes congress sometimes distributes additional aid after adverse events disaster and supplemental amount to 1 to 2 billion a year marketing and export promotion the agriculture marketing service spends about 1 2 billion a year on farm and food promotion activities the foreign agricultural service spends about 1 4 billion a year on a range of activities including marketing us farm and food products abroad through 93 foreign offices research and other support the usda spends about us 3 billion a year on agriculture and food research at more than 100 locations the department also provides other support services such as statistical information and economic studies finally the usda offers a variety of grants and loans to assist farmers in producing and selling agricultural commodities are there any programmes addressing assistance or government incentives for investment by foreign ownership in agribusiness while the us does not directly promote foreign investment in us agriculture it is a strong proponent of investment in agriculture overseas food safety certification programmes animal safety and disease livestock legislation outline the applicable legislation for primary processors of live animals is any distinction made between meat for domestic consumption and meat for export there are specific regulations for meat and poultry the federal meat inspection act was passed in 1906 and is intended to ensure that only healthy meat products are sold by regulating slaughter processing and handling the act requires the usda to inspect meat processing plants that conduct business across state lines the pure food and drug act enacted on the same day in 1906 also gave the government broad jurisdiction over food in interstate commerce the four primary features of the meat inspection act are mandatory inspection of livestock before slaughter cattle sheep goats equines and swine mandatory post mortem inspection of every carcass sanitary standards established for slaughterhouses and meat processing plants and authorisation of the usda s ongoing monitoring and inspection of slaughter and processing operations the wholesome meat act also called the equal to law amended the federal meat inspection act in 1967 to establish a statute for federal meat inspection programmes it required that states have inspection programmes equal to that of the federal government which are administered by the food safety and inspection service fsis of the usda similar to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act of 1957 was enacted to ensure that only healthy poultry products are sold by regulating slaughter processing and handling food safety regime describe the food safety regime in your jurisdiction including applicable legislation and regulations food safety is regulated through several bodies of legislation the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca is the predominant legislation governing food safety it authorises the fda to oversee the safety of food drugs and cosmetics the fda food safety and modernization act of 2000 fsma is the most significant food safety legislation since the ffdca it focuses regulations on preventing contamination and authorises the fda to regulate how foods are grown harvested and processed as noted in question 12 the meat inspection act and the poultry products inspection act regulate meat and poultry the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra regulates pesticides and is designed to protect applicators consumers and the environment while several federal agencies are involved in food safety the fda and the usda fsis are primarily responsible for enforcing the regulations the fda has jurisdiction over all us food and the fsis has jurisdiction over products containing meat poultry and processed egg products under the fsma the fda promulgates safety standards first the fda publishes a proposed standard in the federal register which makes the standard available to the public and provides an opportunity to comment for a period usually ranging from 30 to 90 days next the fda reviews comments submitted on the proposed standard and may revise the standard based on the feedback received the fda then publishes the final standard in the federal register and those parties subject to the final standard must come into compliance by the effective date of the standard as published in the federal register it should be noted that state agencies may promulgate additional safety regulations safety enforcement what enforcement can take place in relation to food supply chain safety what penalties may apply the array of enforcement tools available to the fsis and the fda include warning letters adverse publicity injunctions product retention seizure criminal prosecution and recall these tools are not mutually exclusive there is a considerable overlap of food enforcement authority between the states and the fda by comparison fsis s enforcement authority is more narrowly defined encompassing primarily meat poultry and eggs owing to federal pre emption there is less overlap with state authority in this context the recall of food is considered the most important tool in the enforcement of food safety regulations with the amendments made to the fsma in 2010 the fda has the statutory authority to order companies to recall food while all recalls administered by fsis remain voluntary section 11 017 of the food energy and conservation act of 2008 farm bill 2008 requires any establishment subject to fsis inspection to promptly notify the usda if it has reason to believe that a misbranded or adulterated meat or poultry product has entered commerce fsis inspected establishments are also required to develop and maintain recall plans for inspectors to copy and review since fsis inspection is mandatory for certain products under its oversight fsis can sanction a firm by withdrawal of inspection loss of inspection often results in the closing of the business establishment the threat of criminal penalties against corporations and individuals for violations of food regulations is the ultimate enforcement tool for the fda and fsis offences may be prosecuted as misdemeanours or felonies and penalties may involve fines or imprisonment the legal standard for individual criminal liability under the fdca is set forth in united states v park 421 us 658 1975 the us supreme court held that fdca is a strict liability law with respect to responsible corporate officials meaning that corporate officials can be responsible irrespective of whether they have actual knowledge of the violative condition product certification describe any certification programmes and rules for genetically modified foods organic foods or other differentiated products if a food product is organic the producer may choose to label it as such but then must satisfy the criteria of the usda and national organic program before it can label any food product as organic nutrition labelling and education act of 1990 nlea 7 cfr section 205 individual states may also have voluntary organic certification programmes new technologies have generated considerable controversy with the safety of food one is biotechnology which is the manipulation of the genetic material of living seeds or embryos usually before they reach the farm the us approach to the regulation of genetically modified organisms gmos is termed substantial equivalence under this standard of new gm products are compared to conventional products that have been consumed for many years new crop varieties produced through biotechnology if they are substantially equivalent are treated the same as their conventional counterparts food labelling requirements what are the food labelling requirements including the applicable legislation enforcement and penalties nlea dictates how prepared foods including canned and frozen crops must be labelled raw fruits and vegetables are not subject to the nlea s labelling requirements pursuant to nlea labels for regulated foods must identify food type volume ingredients and other information the 2002 farm bill introduced country of origin labelling requirements these requirements oblige sellers of perishable agricultural products including fresh fruits and vegetables and related items to identify the country where the product was produced with respect to gmos currently three us states have laws on the books mandating the labelling of gm foods connecticut and maine respectively passed their laws in june 2013 and january 2014 both including trigger clauses requiring four neighbouring states to pass similar legislation in april 2014 vermont became the first state to pass labelling laws without a trigger clause which went into effect on 1 july 2016 civil and criminal penalties can apply to farmers and food processors that breach food labelling food animal legislation outline any applicable legislation regarding health of food animals including transportation and disease outbreak and management the majority of animal cruelty laws are enacted and offences prosecuted on the state level on the federal level the first statute enacted was the animal welfare act awa initially passed in 1966 to prevent pets from being stolen for sale to research laboratories and to improve the treatment and wellbeing of animals intended for research since that time it has been amended six times with the latest change occurring in 2007 under the awa businesses and others with animals covered by the law must be licensed or registered and they must adhere to minimum standards of care farm animals are among those not covered by the act which nonetheless provides a broad set of statutory protections for animals at the state level laws to prevent deliberate animal cruelty sometimes apply to farm animals but few states have prescribed on farm treatment standards the three exceptions are florida where voters in 2002 approved a ballot measure outlawing gestation crates for pigs arizona where voters outlawed pig gestation crates and veal stalls in 2006 and california where pig gestation crates veal stalls and battery cages for hens were prohibited in the november 2008 election animal movement restrictions what are the restrictions on the movement of animals within your country the twenty eight hour law 49 us code section 80 502 was first re enacted in amended form in 1994 by public law no 103 272 it is also known as the cruelty to animals act the live stock transportation act and the food and rest law it provides that a rail carrier express carrier or common carrier except by air or water a receiver trustee or lessee of one of those carriers or an owner or master of a vessel transporting animals may not confine animals in a vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours without unloading the animals for feeding water and rest the twenty eight hour law also provides that nimals being transported shall be unloaded in a humane way into pens equipped for feeding water and rest for at least five consecutive hours however the statute does not apply when animals are transported in a vehicle or vessel in which the animals have food water space and an opportunity for rest the 28 hour period however is subject to several exceptions such as allowing extra confinement for sheep under certain conditions abeyance of the statue with respect to all animals if such animals cannot be unloaded because of accidental or unavoidable causes that could not have been anticipated or avoided when being careful and when the owner or person having custody of the animals requests that the period be extended to 36 hours violation of this statute allows the us attorney general to bring a civil action against the violator and the penalty is a fine between 100 and 500 for each violation import restrictions describe any restrictions on import of food animals the importer must obtain a permit from the animal and plant health inspection service aphis since there are different import protocols depending on the species and country of export the importer would need to work directly with aphis in order to determine the exact process and requirements needed for the proposed import the importer must generally obtain a usda veterinary permit the procedure varies depending on the type of animal product and intended purpose such as whether the product is intended for human consumption some animals and animal products do not require an aphis permit a list of such animals and animal products is available on the usda s website www aphis usda gov slaughter legislation what are the regulations related to livestock slaughtering the humane slaughter act is enforced by the secretary of agriculture under provisions of the federal meat inspection act 21 us code section 603 b the central provision of this statute outlines the methods of slaughter that are deemed to be humane and thus appropriate for use in slaughtering livestock while poultry is excluded from the provisions of this act their slaughter is governed by the poultry products inspection act 21 us code a section 451 472 ppia ppia and accompanying regulations require that poultry be slaughtered using good commercial practices and give the fsis the authority to govern those practices pest control requirements outline the regulatory regime relating pest control and pesticides and other management regimes in relation to disease and pests in plants and animals the us environmental protection agency epa is the primary entity charged with regulation of pesticides although it works in conjunction with state agencies the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra establishes the general system of federal pesticide regulation and the ffdca establishes the system to govern pesticides in food and feed states are generally permitted to enact legislation that restricts pesticide use more than federal law requires the epa regulates pesticides through registration and labelling requirements as part of the registration process under fifra manufacturers must submit scientific data on pesticide toxicity and environmental behaviour if a pesticide will be used on food or a feed crop data must be supplied to identify scientific methods that will detect the pesticide or its residues on food and specify the acceptable amounts that may be present in the food pesticides may not be sold unless they are registered and labelled the portions of the ffdca that affect pesticides guide the establishment of tolerances for pesticides and their residues in food and feed foods that have residue amounts higher than allowable tolerances or where no tolerance has been specified are deemed to be adulterated and cannot be sold business organisation typical organisation how are agricultural operations typically organised in your jurisdiction cooperatives are typically utilised in the agricultural sector because they enable farmers and other industry participants to maximise the value of their goods and services though not specifically regulated with respect to foreign investment it is challenging for a foreign party to invest in a cooperative because members must provide and use the services of the cooperative therefore a local presence is generally required other entity types such as corporations and limited liability companies llcs are regularly used in agriculture foreign investors should also note whether a corporation is an s corporation and whether a llc has elected an s status as these designations prevent ownership by a foreign person pursuant to the us tax code 26 us code section 1361 b 1 c outline any restrictions on foreign ownership of agricultural operations or businesses other than farming operations as noted in question 9 foreign ownership of agricultural operations is also subject to antitrust prohibitions in recent years there have been numerous antitrust cases in the us agricultural industry particularly among seed companies three bodies of law combine to form us antitrust law sherman act of 1980 prohibits transactions and activities that lessen trade and create monopolies clayton act of 1914 covers those mergers and acquisitions that lessen trade and create monopolies that are not already covered under the sherman act hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act amends the clayton act and requires parties engaged in covered transactions to receive approval that such covered transaction will not negatively impact us commerce pursuant to the us antitrust laws upon filing of a pre merger notification with the us federal trade commission ftc and department of justice and federal trade commission act of 1914 prohibits unfair competition and deceptive practices and also establishes the ftc together these laws prevent practices that unreasonably restrict trade lessen competition and create monopolies finally most states have individual antitrust laws that are based upon and supplement the federal antitrust laws agricultural workers immigration and health and safety worker rights describe any specific rules or laws governing the rights of workers or employees for agricultural operations the fair labor standards act of 1938 flsa is a sweeping federal statute that sets minimum wages requires overtime wages restricts child labour and mandates some record keeping by employers the flsa covers employees of employers engaged in interstate commerce directly or engaged in the production of goods and services for interstate commerce however agricultural employers are exempt from certain requirements of the flsa under the flsa agriculture is defined as farming and all its branches raising livestock or poultry and any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations regulations and case law further define agricultural employees as persons employed in farming by a farmer or on a farm the exemptions for agricultural employers are different for each broad coverage area of the flsa immigration regulation how is farmworker immigration regulated in your jurisdiction the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act of 1983 mspa was enacted to protect migrant and seasonal workers and is the primary agricultural labour statute mspa establishes in part wage and working condition requirements and requires the registration of farm labour contractors farm labour contractors are defined by the statute as any person other than agricultural employers their employees or agricultural associations that recruit solicit hire employ furnish or transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker for money or other valuable consideration the only workers covered by mspa are persons engaged in seasonal or temporary agricultural employment while mspa is enforced by the us department of labor it also creates a private right of action the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca limits unauthorised immigration into the us the statute creates employer sanctions for employing unauthorised aliens all employers are required to verify the employment eligibility status of employees once verified as eligible employers may not discriminate against employees based on citizenship or national origin the immigration and nationality act as amended by irca also creates the current h 2a programme this allows agricultural employers that have a shortage of qualified domestic workers to import non immigrant aliens into the us these workers are permitted to remain only temporarily for the purpose of seasonal agricultural work the current administration s enforcement of immigration policy is impacting the agricultural sector as of september 2018 the immigration and customs enforcement agency has conducted high profile raids on sugar pig and wheat farms in the us the ramifications of these raids are being felt both by undocumented employees who are subject to deportation and their employers who face steep penalties and reputational risk work health and safety regulation outline the health and safety regulations

also issues phytosanitary certificates for plants and plant products to be exported from the us as well as export certificates for processed plant products to obtain a phytosanitary or export certificate an applicant must request an inspection and certification from ppq in writing under the meat inspection act and poultry products inspection act the fsis is responsible for determining the equivalence of other countries meat and poultry safeguards a foreign plant cannot ship products to the us unless fsis has certified that its country has a programme that provides a level of protection that is at least equivalent to the us system in addition fsis operates a re inspection programme at us border entry points under the fdca the fda can refuse entry to any food import if it appears based on a physical examination or otherwise to be adulterated misbranded or in violation of the law tariffs and quotas may tariffs quotas or similar measures be put in place the us levies tariffs and imposes quotas on various agricultural commodities under the us constitution s commerce clause congress has exclusive power to regulate international trade united states president donald trump has imposed a series of tariffs commencing in january 2018 some of these tariffs particularly those enacted on chinese goods has elicited retaliatory measures that have adversely impacted us agricultural commerce as of september 2018 the us has imposed tariffs on 50 billion of chinese goods and china has responded by assessing tariffs on an equal amount of us exports particularly soybeans soybeans are the us s largest agricultural export to china with more than 14 billion exported to china in 2016 to offset losses in july 2018 the trump administration announced it would pay farmers up to 12 billion

managing the environmental impact of agricultural production in your jurisdiction the epa is the primary federal regulatory body that administers and enforces environmental laws in the us when congress drafts an environmental law the epa implements it by writing regulations the epa sets national standards that states and tribes enforce through their own regulations nearly half of the epa s budget is allocated to grants to state environmental programmes nonprofits educational institutions and other sources states and municipalities also enact environmental laws water and air pollution regulation describe how water and air pollution is regulated in relation to primary agriculture in your jurisdiction the clean water act cwa is the primary legal and policy instrument for regulating the pollution of the nation s waters the epa is the primary agency tasked with implementing and enforcing the cwa although it works in conjunction with state environmental agencies and the us army corps of engineers the cwa is designed to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation s waters it operates by authorising water quality standards for surface waters requiring national pollution discharge elimination system permits for point source discharges of pollutants into navigable waters assisting with funding for construction of municipal sewage treatment plants and planning for control of nonpoint source pollution navigable waters defined in the statute as the waters of the united states is a controversial term that has been further defined by agency regulations and numerous conflicting judicial interpretations enacted originally in 1955 to protect the nation s air quality the clean air act caa was amended in 1990 to its current form the caa seeks to protect human health and the environment from emissions that pollute ambient or outdoor air it requires the epa to establish minimum national standards for air quality and assigns primary responsibility to the states to assure compliance with those standards by requiring the development of state implementation plans areas not meeting the standards referred to as non attainment areas are required to implement specified air pollution control measures finally it addresses the prevention of pollution in areas with clean air and protection of the stratospheric ozone layer waste regulation describe how liquid and other waste is regulated in relation to primary agriculture in your jurisdiction several federal environmental statutes address the storage handling and disposal of hazardous waste the key pieces of legislation include the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the toxic substance control act tsca and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla resource conservation and recovery act congress passed rcra in 1976 which gives the epa the authority to control hazardous waste from the cradle to grave encompassing the generation transportation treatment storage and disposal these materials rcra also sets forth a framework for the management of nonhazardous solid wastes such as garbage the 1986 amendments to rcra enable the epa to address environmental problems that could result from underground tanks storing petroleum and other hazardous substances toxic substance control act in 1976 congress also enacted tsca under this act the epa was given the responsibility to track and publish a database of the numerous industrial chemicals currently produced or imported into the united states the epa repeatedly screens these chemicals and can require reporting or testing of those that may pose an environmental or human health hazard comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act in 1980 cercla also known as superfund was enacted this federal statute addresses discharges of hazardous waste into the environment by potentially responsible parties administered by the epa it develops a federal superfund through the collection of taxes on hazardous materials which may be used to clean up uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites as well as accidents spills and other emergency releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment potentially responsible parties who can be identified bear the burden of the clean up costs under joint and several liability the fund created by cercla is used to clean up abandoned sites or those where responsibility cannot be established updates and trends updates and trends updates and trends the new us farm bill though not passed as of september 2018 is likely to be more conservative than its 2014 predecessor more robust work requirements before parties can collect state benefits for food and other items will likely be included in this iteration of the farm bill the outcome of us international trade policy as it relates to tariffs will dictate which measures and countermeasures will be enacted on us exports particularly agricultural ones if tariffs continue to become more onerous mitigation techniques such as subsidies may continue to be utilised finally immigration reform may have unintended

by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute after dramatically lowering its growth forecast for the european union eu the european central bank president mario draghi announced that the ecb would keep interest rate rises on hold for at least another year as well as resuming the bond buying operations for the national debt of the members of the eurozone ez the latter was particularly surprising as it marked an abrupt reversal of a policy that was discontinued at the end of last year but the about face points to both the ongoing structural weaknesses inherent in the single currency union as well mounting political and economic challenges to the eu as a whole these are the consequences of a wide ranging and long term neoliberal collection of policies which have produced rising populism of a distinctly neofascist hue growing intra political tension even between traditional allies and a lost generation due to double digit unemployment to cite some of the most egregious examples and of course there is brexit much like banquo s ghost hovering over everything and exacerbating the threat to the european integration project it s easy to understand why the european central bank reversed itself on quantitative easing the surprise was that it thought it could stop in the first place as the sole issuer of the euro the ecb is the only entity that can credibly backstop the national debt of the ez countries eliminate that backstop and the risk of solvency raises its ugly head again and with it the prospect of much higher borrowing costs across the continent and a potential financial crisis but simply buying bonds is insufficient the prevailing austerity bias that governs single currency membership has to be eliminated as well the former addresses the solvency issue the latter the problem of insufficient aggregate demand in the ez the source of anemic growth and high unemployment we therefore need both ecb bond buying coupled with a tolerance for much larger national fiscal deficits longer term the eurozone desperately requires bigger institutional change such as the creation of a mechanism that allows for the mutualization of debt much as alexander hamilton helped to establish for the united states of america when it migrated from a system featuring a weak national authority under the articles of confederation where the 13 colonies were more like 13 individual nation states and congress was a mere arbiter among them to a more robust federal structure replete with a strong centralized system of debt management and taxation in the short term however only the ecb can adequately accommodate this via larger bond purchases minus the conditionality of austerity unfortunately additional fiscal policy stimulus has long been the rock on which european wide policy consensus has foundered a paralysis that has done much to stoke growing populist anti eu sentiment across the continent and debt mutualization is something that berlin in particular has strongly resisted seeing it as yet another attempt to secure backdoor bailouts for what it perceives to be the profligate mediterranean countries of course it s easier to resist such policies at a time when your own economy is booming and close to full employment perhaps germany would be more amenable to a change of policy once the vulnerabilities of its own export dependent growth model are further exposed alternatively germany might come to appreciate the risks it now faces as the ez s largest creditor if debt repudiation was actually on the cards from a country like say italy it s also worth noting that even hamilton s debt mutualization proposals met huge resistance from a number of individual states notably virginia which was the germany of the 13 original colonies in terms of its relative fiscal health economic strength it took the combination of a revolutionary war external threats from the british empire and the possibility of bankruptcy and debt repudiation to create the political conditions necessary to induce acceptance of hamilton s proposals might similarly grave existential political threats combined with the prospect of a serious global recession be enough to change the political calculus in the ez as a whole it s not an optimal way to induce change but sometimes it takes the political economic equivalent of an earthquake or flood to establish substantial foundational reform certainly that seems to have been the case for the eu so far the technical term describing the ecb s bond buying operations is longer term refinancing operations ltro more popularly known as quantitative easing qe this is a policy that involves the central bank buying bonds or other bank assets in exchange for electronic deposits made by the monetary authority into the commercial banking system which in econ speak means crediting bank reserves qe in various forms has long been deployed by a number of key central banks notably the u s federal reserve the bank of japan and the european central bank in theory as a means of reviving demand for credit but in practice simply inciting keynes animal spirits to revive capital markets and thereby promote more robust economic activity in response to that revival the tangible economic impacts benefits of qe have long been debated but as far as the specific european situation goes the ecb s decision to involve itself directly in ongoing purchases of national debt has been crucial in terms of coping with the institutional quirk that lies at the heart of the single currency namely the absence of a supranational united states of europe fiscal authority there is already a degree of centralization in the eu e g the source of origin rules trade agreements a common agricultural policy but its parliament in strasbourg still has comparatively limited fiscal powers by divorcing fiscal and monetary authorities the members of the single currency union hobbled their respective national governments ability to sustain full employment because their ability to spend has been circumscribed by virtue of the fact that they are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency that means that unlike a fully sovereign government such as the united states which has the ability to create unlimited dollars eurozone countries are more like american states or cities which are limited in their ability to spend by taxation and bond revenues more importantly as currency users rather than issuers these countries can go broke much like what happened to the city of detroit some six years ago in that sense they are non sovereign states as the economists yeva nersisyan and l randall wray have outlined this distinction between sovereign and non sovereign applies to all members of the eurozone to germany and france as much as portugal or italy the eurozone members have lost their sovereignty precisely because they cannot create euros without limit to sustain economic growth and are therefore dependent on the markets to provide ongoing borrowing support absent help from the ecb the eurozone therefore is the one place where the bond vigilantes actually do exert real influence the credit spreads i e the differential in borrowing costs that have arisen between german national debt on the one hand and the mediterranean countries on the other reflect the market s collective judgment in regard to the creditworthiness of each individual member of the single currency union the minute that the ecb and the various national central banks particularly the german bundesbank began calling attention to the fiscal unsustainability of certain countries policies notably greece where the country s fiscal sleight of hand for a time masked the true magnitude of its borrowing requirements the solvency issue of the euro moved front and center as greece fessed up to cooking its books markets began to take a less sanguine view of many of the other eurozone countries creditworthiness picking them off one by one greece ireland portugal spain italy and at that stage the central bank had not yet initiated any qe as a result credit spreads began to blow out as the markets quickly intuited that contrary to the stated intentions of the founders of the common currency one national bond was not as good as another the whole european monetary union began to look like nothing more than a giant wall street confected collateralized debt obligation with the lower quality tranches in the bottom tiers infecting the creditworthiness of the entire single currency zone that is until the ecb got directly involved after draghi s famous whatever it takes speech the only problem was that this promise of bond buying was conditionally predicated on each country implementing sound fiscal policies i e they were biased toward austerity to keep the budgets balanced which meant that solvency came at the expense of ongoing anemic economic growth in many of the member states notably greece italy spain and france in terms of stoking growth therefore this process was as effective as drilling a hole in one end of a canoe while bailing out water from the other draghi s commitment worked to the extent that borrowing rates for all of the eurozone countries came tumbling down and the spreads among the various countries began to converge but the austerity conditionality has ensured that growth has remained sub standard in many ez countries particularly in regard to unemployment by the time that the ecb had wound down qe three months ago after four years of substantial bond buying the economic backdrop had recovered somewhat although the aggregate data had been disproportionately inflated by germany s strong export performance in response to improved global economic conditions countries like greece and italy however never really emerged out of the growth doldrums and as draghi noted last week overall economic conditions in the ez are rapidly deteriorating again even in germany where export growth has started to dissipate draghi s reversal on qe has to be seen in the context of a downward revision to gdp growth from 1 7 percent to rise 1 1 percent this year this dire forecast was accompanied by a downward gdp revision in 2020 from 1 7 percent to 1 6 percent perhaps we should be grateful that mr draghi did not wait for the markets to test his intentions when he first announced the end of the bond buying operations last december had the markets called the ecb s bluff and the central bank failed to respond the whole solvency question would have come back with a vengeance a crisis being the likely result still the fact that the ecb still had to reverse itself a mere three months later suggests that the underlying fragilities inherent in the ez are still very extreme the whole structure is beginning to look like a house of cards without the ability to fiat and the political timing couldn t have been worse we are now supposedly in the home stretch as far as the brexit divorce negotiations go the official d day is march 29 but there are still huge parliamentary splits in the uk in regard to the form that brexit will ultimately take or indeed whether it should still take place at all given what is on offer it is therefore becoming increasingly likely that the uk will be forced to apply for an extension of the article 50 period especially given that the enabling legislation has not yet been completed moreover this extension could well be for quite a long time if in the interim the eurozone begins to look like a house on fire it will no doubt provide succor to the hardline brexiters who want to leave the eu as soon as possible deal or no deal by the same token a robust policy response by brussels more bond buying and greater toleration of fiscal expansion across the continent to improve the growth outlook could well shift the policy dynamics in the opposite direction possibly even toward the retention of the status quo in regard to britain s existing relationship with the european union any shift away from the ez s prevailing neoliberal economics would certainly accelerate the ongoing shift of the uk s labour party away from a hard brexit given the history the latter outcome seems less likely but the situation is more fraught than usual which might beget a less ham handed response the eu s most tangible progress toward required solutions have tended to occur when the existential threats facing it are most acute recall that there was adamant opposition to the ecb s bond buying operations when it was first publicly mooted and yet today such practices are firmly entrenched even the german representative on the ecb concurred in a unanimous decision to restart qe earlier it was the french farmers who literally created roadblocks to a common agricultural policy until the lure of additional money swept them aside and today a common defense policy indeed a european army looks to be in the cards even though that was considered a political non starter a few years ago so the halting steps toward increasing federalization are coming even though this two steps forward one step back progress is obscured by temporary opposition which is usually bribed into compliance paradoxically the prevailing austerity heightens the appreciation for the cash allocation from brussels as well as making it more politically palatable for the austerity biased countries to relent when such austerity pushes the ez toward breaking point the point is that the resolve and strength of the engine driving the european project is often underestimated if ever there was a time for the brussels mandarins to change course it s now the odds still favor the eu facing a likely british divorce and there are impending eu elections in may it would be an unhealthy outcome to have those elections taking place in the context of still rancorous negotiations with the uk or an economically destabilizing no deal split along with a backdrop of rapidly declining economic growth which could further fuel the rise of anti eu parties across the continent especially in italy where fascism originally flowered any one of these factors on its own could represent danger taken in aggregate they represent a profound existential threat the hope is that this threat will spur the eu to do the right thing

the report plays into expectations that the boj may lower its assessment for output and exports there was also an upside surprise the tertiary index service sector rose 0 4 in january a 0 3 decline

the end of january europe brexit dominates the focus in europe the withdrawal bill lost by 149 votes yesterday this was as close to the sunday times survey of a 150 vote loss as imaginable some mps want to support a two month delay to prepare to leave with no deal today s vote in parliament is expected to rule out such a course assuming this is indeed the case then tomorrow s vote will be to seek an extension we still see risk that postponing the march 29 leave date may also not secure majority support even if it is not the odds on favorite scenario from the ec s vantage point the uk has only three options it can leave with no deal on march 29 it can ask for an extension which requires a unanimous vote of support among the other eu members and no doubt the uk will have to explain why it wants an extension the length of the extension will also be debated third the uk can revoke article 50 but this seems the most unlikely of the three overshadowed by brexit chancellor of the exchequer hammond is to unveil the spring budget today while debt sales may be projected to rise by a quarter to gbp123 bln there are about gbp100 bln that will mature that would leave the net new

the soft core cpi figures reinforced the fed s wait and see posture patience but expectations for fed policy have not changed consider that at the end of last week the january 2000 fed funds futures

u s trade representative robert lighthizer will meet the house caucus because several lawmakers question parts of the so called new nafta deal that deal called the united states mexico canada agreement usmca will replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement usmca has only very slim chances to make it through both chambers especially in the democrat controlled house that is not dollar positive in the u s new orders for manufactured durable goods in january increased 0 4 percent this increase followed a 1 3 percent december increase excluding transportation new orders decreased 0 1 percent excluding defense new orders increased 0 7 percent transportation equipment up five of the last six months drove the increase up to 1 2 percent the reduced tensions in the u s china trade position should help in the future but it s probably too soon for that to come through in today s numbers however the oil industry in the united states is unlikely to be investing heavily given the oil price with wti at around 57 per barrel six months ago wti was at 75 per barrel the producer price index edged up 0 1 percent in february seasonally adjusted final demand prices fell 0 1 percent in both january and december on an unadjusted basis the final demand index moved up 1 9 percent for the 12 months ended in february this matters because u s labor costs have been rising faster than expected if companies try to pass those cost increases on to consumers then producer price inflation is the first place where that inflation will show up the reality is that profit margins of companies are more likely to bear the brunt of this pressure at least for now in the interminably tedious eu uk divorce process the british media is struggling to find adjectives that outdo one another the uk government is apparently plunged into crisis reality is that nothing has really changed and the search for ever more hysterical headlines is just sensationalism the government s deal was never expected to pass and yesterday it did not pass this doesn t represent the collapse of civilization most of the people who voted in the referendum 2 years ago in march 2017 remain profoundly disinterested in the whole process the uk parliamentary vote on a no deal exit from the european union will doubtless reject that option today the european union can threaten that it wouldn t extend article 50 extension seems to be the inevitable conclusion making the interminable tedious process that bit more interminable the problem with the eu s threat is that it s not especially credible no sensible person wants a no deal exit and if the uk parliament has legally determined that a no deal exit should be avoided then the uk government must avoid it either article 50 is extended or article 50 is cancelled and immediately re imposed unilaterally by the uk that is also not especially desirable article 50 of the treaty on european union teu states that any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements in the meantime the eu has warned that the risk for a disorderly exit has never been higher the bbc reported the british pound remains relatively stable for now at around 1 3150 for investors it s important to keep in mind that a no deal scenario or a hard brexit would likely pressure the british pound given the greater economic uncertainty that this would imply sterling could fall to 1 15 against the dollar and to parity against the euro at the moment around sterling is around 1 16 euro per sterling from the euro area we got industrial production data that compared with december 2018 was up 1 4 percent in january but still showed a decline of 1 1 percent from a year earlier easing from a 4 2 percent decline in december 2018 which was the steepest decline in nine years and beating market expectations of a 2 1 percent fall output continued to contract for capital intermediate and durable consumer goods while a rebound was seen in production of both energy and non durable consumer goods at the moment the euro is slightly higher against the dollar at around 1 13 etienne hans parisis is a bank economist who has advised investors on financial markets and international investments
the perspective atlanta georgia march 13 2019 macroeconomic stability has proved elusive despite improved revenue collection in the first half of fy2019 and the fiscal stance has loosened significantly growth for 2018 is now estimated at 1 2 percent while the forecast for 2019 on current policies has been revised down to 0 4 percent from 4 7 percent revenue reforms have considerable potential to directly expand the resource envelope and facilitate a needed increase in social spending an international monetary fund imf team led by mika saito visited monrovia from february 25 march 8 to conduct discussions for the 2019 article iv consultation with liberia at the conclusion of the mission ms saito issued the following statement liberia s economic situation is challenging and strong policy actions will be required to maintain as favorable an outlook as anticipated at this time last year macroeconomic stability has proved elusive despite improved revenue collection in the first half of fy2019 and the fiscal stance has loosened significantly with accommodative monetary policy meeting fiscal needs the exchange rate depreciated by 26 percent over the year and inflation accelerated to 28 percent at end december this is detrimental to the living standards of the most vulnerable liberians who earn and spend primarily in liberian dollars and threatens the success of the pro poor agenda growth for 2018 is now estimated at 1 2 percent while the forecast for 2019 on current policies has been revised down to 0 4 percent from 4 7 percent discussion with the authorities centered on the policies required to address the current situation and promote strong noninflationary growth over the medium term the mission noted that the commencement of sales of central bank bills supplemented by the introduction of the standing deposit and credit facilities in the interbank market represent major milestones in modernizing the monetary policy framework with the appropriate preconditions firmly in place a timely reduction of the rate of inflation to single digits appears possible of the necessary preconditions the most critical is that the government refrain from borrowing from the central bank the mission recommended that the budget for fiscal year 2020 be based on realistic estimates of the resource envelope giving ministries and agencies a reliable estimate of the actual resources that will be available to them is critical to improving the quality of public services even if this represents less than the amount budgeted in the past without central bank borrowing financing a sufficient level of public service provision will require policies to prioritize and improve the composition of expenditure enhance its efficiency and expand the resource envelope the mission notes that productive spending is being crowded out by a wage bill including discretionary allowances that totals about two thirds of government funded expenditure this is not a new issue it has been a characteristic of the liberian economy for a number of years however as grants and other external assistance decline this is no longer a tenable situation freeing up resources in an equitable manner for pro poor development will likely require effective actions to reduce the share of government resources devoted to this budget item improving the efficiency of government spending will be key policies should aim at improving the monitoring accountability and transparency of spending intensifying actions to improve governance and fight corruption including through rigorous adherence to existing procurement rules would also be effective revenue reforms have considerable potential to directly expand the resource envelope and facilitate a needed increase in social spending the mission notes the recent finalization of the domestic revenue mobilization strategy it recommends that the authorities pursue the envisaged reforms including excise tax tax exemptions and compliance increased uncertainty and volatility in the external environment argues for further measures to safeguarding the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank the mission noted that creation of a well functioning monetary policy framework would reduce the need for foreign exchange intervention acceptance of greater exchange rate flexibility would help preserve reserve stocks and help absorb external shocks in addition reducing the central bank s operational deficit would be vital the investigative reports by the presidential investigative team and by kroll associates point to a need for substantial improvements in operational policies guidelines and compliance we encourage the liberian authorities to take advantage of available support from the international community to make much needed remedial actions in these areas the mission notes the need for significant action to improve the business climate and provide the enabling environment required for private sector led growth removing administrative constraints on imports and prices to boost the level of competition while ensuring quality and safety standards should be prioritized liberia should step up efforts to strengthen governance and anti corruption efforts as envisaged in the government s pro poor agenda as it would create an environment conducive to private sector led inclusive growth the imf team met with president george weah speaker of the house of representatives bhofal chambers minister of finance and development planning samuel tweah governor of the central bank of liberia nathaniel patray minister of commerce and industry professor wilson tarpeh other senior government officials private sector representatives and development partners the team thanks the authorities for their collaboration and fruitful discussions

several latin american countries that in recent years benefited from china s lending spree like other loans china has made in the region those to ecuador are partially payable with shipments of natural resources oil in ecuador s case which china needs to stoke its fast growing economy correa was a close ally of venezuela s socialist anti u s president hugo chavez and saw chinese loans as attractive because the asian giant made no political or ideological demands and the loans were a way of thumbing his nose at uncle sam analysts say but terms of ecuador s 6 5 billion in chinese debt have become onerous with the global decline in the price of oil ecuador s main source of revenue from exports moreover some developments financed by the loans including hydroelectric plants are not producing the revenue that was anticipated advertisement correa also made deals to sell the chinese millions of barrels of oil in advance on favorable terms committing the country to ship 90 of all its exportable crude to the asian giant through 2024 terms of the deals by which he mortgaged to china much of the country s future production of crude its principal source of export dollars remain shrouded in mystery ecuador is just the latest third world borrower to have trouble making payments to china the list includes sri lanka and the maldives in a radio interview thursday from the presidential palace in quito moreno acknowledged that he will travel soon to china to ask the government and banks there to cut ecuador some slack because the previously made commitments are not the most suitable if the country is to go forward we are trying by any means to secure financing advertisement finance minister richard martinez used more stark language last month when he spoke before the national assembly describing ecuador s 6 billlon spending deficit not including 4 billion in debt payments due for 2019 as unsustainable deriving from the implementation of a development model in which the state inevitably spent more money than it had a reference to correa s presidency ecuadorean president lenin moreno speaks to reporters at carondelet palace in quito rodrigo buendia afp getty images vicente albornoz dean of the economics department at the university of the americas in quito said that even if china relaxes loan terms ecuador will still need a bailout loan from the international monetary fund of as much as 10 billion ecuador s finance and energy ministries did not respond to requests for interviews advertisement correa thought he was a genius and he has escaped accountability by giving the problem to someone else albornoz said moreno knew he was inheriting a country in bad shape but wasn t fully aware of the things he has to do to correct the problem jaime carrera director of the watchdog fiscal policy observatory said the imf is sure to set conditions for any bailout including a likely demand that moreno cut at least 10 of the 450 000 strong central government workforce and end all or most of 4 billion in annual fuel subsidies for consumers meeting those preconditions will carry a political cost he said those reductions will bring a lot of people out into the streets to protest carrera said advertisement making matters worse said former energy minister fernando santos is that some of the projects built with chinese loans are overpriced and of poor quality particularly the biggest the 2 8 billion coca codo sinclair dam as is often their practice when making large scale public works loans the chinese made the naming of a chinese company as general contractor a condition of granting the financing there was no bidding for the project which made it vulnerable to overruns and corruption said maria de la paz vela an analyst with the multiplica economics consulting firm in quito the massive project located 90 miles east of quito was inaugurated with much fanfare by correa and chinese president xi jinping in 2016 designed as a 1 500 megawatt facility the dam is operating at half that capacity since the discovery in march by a german inspection firm of serious structural problems that could require hundreds of millions of dollars to repair if they can be repaired at all advertisement a report issued last month by the government controller s office said inspections had turned up 402 large and small cracks in the machine room that houses the dam s eight turbines the report made scathing comments about sinohydro corp the chinese company that built the dam for the project s irresponsible and incomprehensible use of substandard building materials and construction methods including inferior welds part of the structure may have to be demolished and rebuilt the report said the report also said the chinese contractor ignored a stipulation of the construction contract that the dam be built according to rigid standards set by the american society of mechanical engineers the chinese used bad quality steel and fired inspectors who said to change it said ex minister santos advertisement the chinese had a party with us and took advantage said augusto tandazo an energy analyst in quito it was a case of a big country ripping off a small one ecuador is no stranger to financial crises in 1999 several big banks failed and the country defaulted on 98 billion in foreign debt while the debt load is lighter now than in 1999 ecuador finds itself in an acute short term cash squeeze unable or unwilling to stem the flow of red ink by drastically cutting spending the adoption of the u s dollar as the national currency in 2000 brought a measure of stability until the current debt squeeze in addition to chinese debt moreno is also confronting an enormous amount of domestic obligations left by correa he raided the 2 5 billion social security fund to finance his agenda and allowed the government owned petroamazonas oil firm which produces 80 of the country s oil to run up 3 billion in debts to contractors including texas based oil field services firm schlumberger tandazo said advertisement although correa has been made the scapegoat for ecuador s problems economics dean albornoz also blamed moreno for not doing enough to reduce state budgets since he took office in may 2017 government spending which correa nearly tripled over his decade in office is still too high he said has moreno learned anything i m afraid not i don t see any austerity in the government and there should be a lot of it albornoz said the imf is a bank and it expects to be paid but with no austerity plan a huge deficit and public expenditures rising it s going to be difficult for moreno to get a loan correa has his defenders including economist hugo villacres a professor at catholic pontifical university in quito who worked in his administration advertisement when correa came in there was an enormous social debt and paying it down was paramount there had been 20 years without much public investment in education health infrastructure villacres said could he have done it better yes he should have gone after corruption more harshly but he reduced poverty and inequality and we re certainly no better off now than we were when he left office in may 2017 among other latin american countries benefiting from chinese largesse are panama which is using loans to expand the port of colon costa rica for the construction of a new freeway and argentina to upgrade a dilapidated urban rail system said nashira chavez a professor at flacso graduate studies center in quito andres paez a former national assembly member whose family was persecuted for its opposition to correa blamed the former president s authoritarian actions including the establishment of a network of state run media for keeping the nation in the dark about the extent of ecuador s mounting debt advertisement every day over five state owned tv channels 20 radio stations and three newspapers we were told the revolution was going great marvelous paez said but he never explained how much it was all costing special correspondent kraul is based in bogota colombia special correspondent pablo jaramillo viteri in quito contributed to this report

fourth quarter vessel operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 14 2 million a decrease of 1 1 million from 15 3 million in the third quarter of 2018 the decrease was mainly due to the

this press release contains references to terms and financial measures commonly used in the oil and gas industry but that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by international financial reporting standards ifrs in canada and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies such terms and financial measures are referred to as non gaap measures the non gaap measures used in this press release are described below non gaap measures should not be used to make comparisons between companies including cequence total revenue is a non gaap measure that represents production revenue gross of royalties and including realized gain loss on commodity contracts management utilizes this measure to analyze revenue and commodity pricing and its impact on operating performance funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure that represents cash flow from operating activities before adjustments for decommissioning liability expenditures proceeds from the sale of commodity contracts and changes in non cash working capital the company evaluates its performance based on earnings and funds flow from operations the company considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the company s ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth through capital investment and to repay debt the company s calculation of funds flow from operations may not be comparable to that reported by other companies funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the same weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the calculation of income loss per share operating and cash netback are non gaap measures operating netback equals total revenue less royalties operating costs and transportation costs cash netback equals the operating netback less general and administrative expenses and interest expense management utilizes these measures to analyze operating performance net debt is a non gaap measure that is calculated as working capital deficiency excluding commodity contracts plus the principal value of the term loan previously the senior notes which reflects the estimated amount that will be repaid upon maturity cequence uses net debt as it provides an estimate of the company s assets and obligations expected to be settled in cash finding and development f d costs and finding development and acquisition fd a costs have been calculated in accordance with ni 51 101 f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category in boe f d costs includes all current year net capital expenditures excluding property acquisitions and dispositions with associated reserves including changes in future development capital fdc on a proved or proved plus probable basis fd a costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year including both costs and associated reserve additions related to acquisitions net of any dispositions during the year by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category further information on how the company calculates f d and fd a costs is available in the company s annual information form filed on sedar management uses f d costs and fd a costs as a measure to assess the performance of the company s resources required to locate and extract new hydrocarbon reservoirs including the effect of acquisitions and dispositions the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year f d and fd a costs used by cequence may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers recycle ratio is measured by dividing the operating netback by appropriate f d or fd a costs per boe for the year operating netback is calculated using production revenues including realized gains and losses on commodity hedging less royalties transportation and operating expenditures calculated on a per boe equivalent basis reserve replacement ratio measures the amount of reserves added to a company s reserve base during the year relative to the amount of oil and gas produced management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare the company s performance over time oil gas disclosure advisories this press release contains estimates of the net present value of the company s future net revenue from its reserves such amounts do not represent the market value of the company s reserves boes are presented on the basis of one boe for six mcf of natural gas disclosure provided herein in respect of boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead for fiscal 2018 the ratio between the average price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil at cushing and nymex natural gas was approximately 20 1 value ratio the value ratio is obtained using the 2018 wti average price of 65 20 us bbl for crude oil and the 2018 nymex average price of 3 20 us mmbtu for natural gas this value ratio is significantly different from the energy equivalency ratio of 6 1 and using a 6 1 ratio would be misleading as an indication of value the company s estimate that it has 50 net montney locations on its west simonette lands including in the 50 locations are 26 locations included in the glj report and 24 additional wells identified by management to be prospective the company identifies 24 net dunvegan oil wells prospective on its land there are 8 wells identified in the glj report and the remainder are based on internal estimates unbooked locations do not do not have attributed reserves and there is no certainty that if these locations would result in additional oil and gas reserves or production the tsx has

well which completed the 2018 six well drilling program the six five net horizontal wells were completed and fracture stimulated 40 stages per mile during the quarter and placed on production in early 2019 concurrently the company completed construction of a 2 7 kilometer pipeline to connect the 2018 wells which were drilling from the same pad to the company s central production facility the wells were equipped and placed on production during january production production from canada averaged 2 301 boe d during the fourth quarter a 4 92 boe d decrease from the previous quarter due to natural declines and curtailed production in response to low prices and increased differentials late in the quarter production averaged 2 494 boe d in january and 1 758 boe d in february the increased production in january was primarily due to the new wells coming on production during the month which was partially offset by decreased ethane sales since january the main gas processing plant third party for the company s gas production shut down their deep cut ethane extraction plant due to low prices for ethane and the associated pipeline egress issues in alberta the ethane will remain in the sales gas which is sold with a higher energy content it is anticipated that the loss of ethane sales will be generally revenue neutral due to the low prices for ethane the company had been selling 300 boepd of ethane which is now sold as natural gas with a higher energy content in february production was lower due to a two week shut down of the central production facility to replace a burner in the main treater the repair work was further exacerbated by extremely cold weather during the month of february which also slowed the restart of production following the facility repairs production was

environment including disruptions caused by the ongoing political changes and civil unrest occurring in the jurisdictions that the company operates in and may vary accordingly this outlook contains forward looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosure under forward looking statements outlined on the first page of this management s discussion analysis md a 2019 outlook the 2019 production outlook for the company is provided as a range to reflect timing and performance contingencies total corporate production is expected to range between 14 000 and 15 000 boe d for 2019 mid point of 14 500 boe d with a 94 weighting to oil and liquids egypt oil production is expected to range between 11 600 and 12 400 bbls d in 2019 canadian production was expected to range between 2 400 and 2 600 boe d in 2019 which included approximately 300 boe d of ethane production which is currently being sold as natural gas with increased energy content a prolonged shut down of the third party deep cut extraction plant may impact the canadian production boe d guidance for 2019 the third party operated gas processer has shut down their deep cut ethane extraction plant due to low ethane prices and associated pipeline egress issues in alberta the reduction of ethane sales is expected to be generally revenue neutral due to the increased energy content of natural gas sales the canadian production range includes 12 months of production from the 2018 drilling program which was complete and ready for production in january of 2019 funds flow from operations in any given period will be dependent upon the timing of crude oil tanker liftings in egypt and the market price of the crude oil sold because these factors are difficult to accurately predict the company has not provided funds flow from operations guidance for 2019 funds flow from operations and inventory levels in egypt may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of liftings

were produced during the 8 hour test although encouraging test rates are not necessarily indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery in december the company filed a declaration of a commercial discovery to initiate early development discussions with egpc subsequent to year end the company filed an initial development plan for the sgz 6x discovery with egpc in late february subject to government approval of the proposed development plan the company is targeting initial production by q4 2019 concurrently the company has identified potential drilling locations targeting the sgz 6x bahariya pool and commenced the well permitting process in addition the company has initiated a project to merge and reprocess two existing 3d seismic surveys in the 6x area of the concession with the completion of sgz 6x well the company has met the financial commitments for the current exploration phase of the concession the current exploration phase as extended expires may 6

commitments for the first exploration phase of the concession based on the 2018 drilling results the company did not enter the next exploration phase and relinquished the concession effective january 7 2019 canada operations and exploration during the quarter the company drilled and cased three cardium oil wells two gross 1 5 net one mile horizontal wells and a two mile extended reach horizontal well which completed the 2018 six well drilling program the six five net horizontal wells were completed and fracture stimulated 40 stages per mile during the quarter and placed on production in early 2019 concurrently the company completed construction of a 2 7 kilometer pipeline to connect the 2018 wells which were drilling from the same pad to the company s central production facility the wells were equipped and placed on production during january production production from canada averaged 2 301 boe d during the fourth quarter a 4 92 boe d decrease from the previous quarter due to natural declines and curtailed production in response to low prices and increased differentials late in the quarter production averaged 2 494 boe d in january and 1 758 boe d in february the increased production in january was primarily due to the new wells coming on production during the month which was partially offset by decreased ethane sales since january the main gas processing plant third party for the company s gas production shut down their deep cut ethane extraction plant due to low prices for ethane and the associated pipeline egress issues in alberta the ethane will remain in the sales gas which is sold with a higher energy content it is anticipated that the loss of ethane sales will be generally revenue neutral due to the low prices for ethane the company had been selling 300 boepd of ethane which is now sold as natural gas with a higher energy content in february production was lower due to a two week shut down of the central production facility to replace a burner in the main treater the repair work was further exacerbated by extremely cold weather during the month of february which also slowed the restart of production following the facility repairs production was

due to stronger oil prices in 2018 the company s canadian operations incurred 2 1 million lower royalty costs than 2017 the reduction in royalties is primarily due to gas cost allowance gca rebates

to range between 2 400 and 2 600 boe d in 2019 which included approximately 300 boe d of ethane production which is currently being sold as natural gas with increased energy content a prolonged shut down of the third party deep cut extraction plant may impact the canadian production boe d guidance for 2019 the third party operated gas processer has shut down their deep cut ethane extraction plant due to low ethane prices and associated pipeline egress issues in alberta the reduction of ethane sales is expected to be generally revenue neutral due to the increased energy content of natural gas sales the canadian production range includes 12 months of production from the 2018 drilling program which was complete and ready for production in january of 2019 funds flow from operations in any given period will be dependent upon the timing of crude oil tanker liftings in egypt and the market price of the crude oil sold because these factors are difficult to accurately predict the company has not provided funds flow from operations guidance for 2019 funds flow from operations and inventory levels in egypt may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of liftings

forward looking non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable

may be recognized these gaap measures may include the impact of items such as costs related to our multi year cost saving initiative and the tax effect of such items historically the company has excluded these types of items from non gaap financial measures the company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future disclosures of non gaap financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise the decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non gaap adjustments are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur for the same

published wednesday 13 march 2019 print disqus by gary christenson the deviant investor the welfare people and the warfare people control congress appropriations corruption and national policies implications are grim if a nation subsidizes butter it will get more butter the u s and most other western governments subsidize welfare and warfare those expenses inevitably increase and are inescapable like the mathematics of debt the u s federal and state governments created a huge network of government programs giveaways entitlements and public assistance the welfare people have increased the number and cost of those programs every decade giveaways will expand next decade when the u s elects a welfare oriented politician as president she will push for universal basic income medicare for all guaranteed jobs free tuition wealth taxes and more the symbol for the welfare people could be the easter bunny who distributes free goodies the u s warfare people have bombed or invaded many countries and spent trillions since 1945 the symbol for the warfare people could be the b 2 bomber so what welfare and warfare are expensive the u s government can t raise taxes enough to pay for welfare and warfare expenses so the government increases debt it borrows from future generations to pay for current welfare and warfare payoffs giveaways and essential programs it works so don t stop now yes it has worked but at what cost the problem exists because dollars are debt based currency not real money funny fake money is easy to manufacture and borrow the u s government is officially twenty two trillion in debt and has increased debt an average of 8 9 every year since 1913 unfunded liabilities add another 100 200 trillion in debt dollars buy less as mounting debt sucks the life out of those dollars hamburgers sold for fifteen cents in the 1950s and gasoline cost a few cents per gallon the banking cartel and government devalued the dollar and stripped the purchasing power from existing dollars by magically creating new dollars a little inflation hurts no one try selling that nonsense to a housewife buying groceries on a fixed budget she knows better bankers politicians and the political and financial elite enjoy dollar devaluation and the resulting consumer price inflation those who make the rules benefit from ever increasing debt devaluation of the dollar will continue until it can t argentina lopped 13 zeros off their pesos since 1945 thanks to massive inflation but their wealthy are still wealthy neither the peso nor the dollar is a store of value got gold the united states has 130 000 000 workers to pay the national debt of 22 trillion each worker would pay about 170 000 they can t and won t pay those taxes the math of u s debt does not work default on the debt and hyper inflation are the choices the following are clear the u s government can t increase debt 8 9 per year every year forever debt which increases more rapidly than the growth rate of the economy which services that debt creates dire consequences and nasty inflation got silver the u s and most western economies are past the point where tax increases could reduce the debt no one discusses growing out of the debt it can t happen if debt can t grow forever it will hit the wall someday debt growth of 8 9 per year average for 105 years will boost 22 trillion to 500 trillion in 60 years when official national debt has grown to 500 trillion and over 400 trillion dollars have been created to pay for warfare and welfare programs what will a cup of coffee cost will you buy a grande starbucks for 50 or 250 a big mac for 100 or 500 what happens to your cost of living and your taxes the current financial system may not survive ten more years without a debt reset and 50 years seems nearly impossible a debt reset will occur expect trauma because those defaulted debts are someone s assets think detroit or puerto rico but thousands of times larger debt based dollars and paper debts include counter party risk be careful gold and silver have no counter party risk and have been real money for thousands of years governments and central banks can t print gold consider national debt in 1913 was 2 9 billion today it s 22 000 billion an 8 9 compounded increase each year debt continues to grow a mere 27 000 invested in 1776 at 8 9 would have increased to 22 trillion today compound interest is deadly for debtors including welfare and warfare governments expect higher taxes defaults and hyper inflation i q test questions the u s and other countries generated excessive debt will creating more debt solve an excessive debt problem are central banks part of the problem or the solution can the u s government borrow its way to prosperity warfare and welfare are expensive if the u s can t afford their ever increasing costs and corporations and people demand both will congress resolve this dilemma easily and peacefully if the u s can t afford their ever increasing costs and corporations and people demand both will congress resolve this dilemma easily and peacefully gold and silver protect individuals and countries from consumer price inflation is stacking gold and silver a good idea gold and silver are necessary to preserve purchasing power china and russia accumulated huge stockpiles of gold while the u s has squandered its gold will piles of dodgy debt paper or stacks of gold be more valuable in ten years do you own gold and silver as insurance against dollar devaluation by governments and central bankers read holter crash alert 2 read christenson downturns and financial crises the mathematics of debt increasing interest payments and fiscal and monetary nonsense are inescapable the welfare and warfare people will demand larger budgets more debt and higher taxes bombers and bunnies are influential groups they will get what they want more warfare and welfare we have been warned by sixty years of history the sun will rise

mr speaker i am acutely conscious of the fact that the house has other pressing matters on its mind today and to avoid making this statement any longer than necessary i am laying a wms which contains additional announcements and provides further details of those that i will make mr speaker last night s vote leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy and our most urgent task in this house is to lift that uncertainty but the economy itself is remarkably robust it has grown for nine consecutive years with the longest unbroken quarterly growth run of any g7 economy and is forecast to continue growing in each of the next five years an economy that has created over 3 5 million net new jobs that has seen female participation in the workforce increase to record levels and that is now delivering the fastest rate of wage growth in over a decade an economy that has defied expectations and will provide the solid foundation that britain needs to seize the opportunities that the future offers and thanks to the difficult decisions we have taken in the last nine years and the hard work of the british people i can also report today on public finances that continue to improve so that provided we do reach a deal to leave the european union with an orderly transition this country for the first time in a decade will have genuine and sustainable choices about its future today s obr report marks another step on britain s road out of austerity and i d like to thank robert chote and his team for their work despite the slowing world economy the obr expect britain to continue to grow in every year of the forecast at 1 2 this year with both the imf and the oecd forecasting the uk to grow faster than germany then 1 4 in 2020 as forecast at the budget and 1 6 in each of the final three years cumulative growth over the five years now slightly higher than the budget forecast meanwhile britain s remarkable jobs story is set to continue by 2023 the obr expect to see 600 000 more new jobs in our economy and despite the constant attempts from the opposition front bench to talk down our remarkable achievement on jobs the fact mr speaker is this last year 96 of new jobs were full time with the obr revising up wage growth to 3 or higher in every year and with inflation now around the target throughout the forecast period that means real wage growth in every year of the forecast a growing economy a thriving labour market inflation on target mr speaker a solid foundation on which to build britain s future and there s good news on the public finances too borrowing this year will be just 1 1 of gdp 3 billion lower than forecast at the autumn budget looking forward borrowing will fall from 29 3 billion in 2019 20 then 21 2 billion 17 6 billion 14 4 billion and finally 13 5 billion in 2023 24 its lowest level in 22 years we remain on track to meet both our fiscal targets early with the cyclically adjusted deficit at 1 3 next year falling to just 0 5 by 2023 24 and with headroom against our fiscal mandate in 20 21 increasing from 15 4 billion at the autumn budget to 26 6 billion today less borrowing means less debt now lower in every year than forecast at the budget falling to 82 2 of gdp next year then 79 74 9 74 and finally 73 in 2023 24 our national debt falling sustainably for the first time in a generation since 2010 we have been steering the country on a journey of recovery back then the most important task was to get borrowing down to manageable levels but when i became chancellor in 2016 i recognised that with the progress we had already made as well as getting britain s debt down our continued success as a nation would depend on investing in our future supporting our vital public services and keeping taxes low to attract talent and investment i called it a balanced approach and it is delivering with the highest sustained levels of public capital investment in 40 years cuts in income taxes for more than 30 million people in three weeks time and debt on a sustained downward path for the first time in a generation i have made over 150 billion of new spending commitments since 2016 and at the budget i announced that the long but necessary squeeze on current public spending would come to an end at the upcoming spending review setting out an indicative 5 year path of 1 2 per annum real terms increases in day to day spending on public services compared to real terms cuts of 3 per annum announced at sr 2010 and 1 3 cuts at sr 2015 we have made our biggest choice on public spending putting the nhs first in line as the british public would expect with my rhf the prime minister s announcement of 34 billion of additional funding per year by the end of the period the single largest cash commitment ever made by a peacetime british government to support our long term plan for the nhs delivering mr speaker improved cancer and mental health care a transformation of gp services more doctors more nurses and better outcomes for patients now we need to address wider departmental spending for the next review period so i can confirm today that assuming a brexit deal is agreed over the next few weeks and the uncertainty that is hanging over our economy is lifted i intend to launch a full three year spending review before the summer recess to be concluded alongside an autumn budget it will set departmental budgets beyond the nhs to reflect the public s priorities between areas like social care local government schools police defence and the environment and it will maximize value for taxpayers money through a renewed focus on delivering high quality outcomes and if we leave the eu with a deal and an orderly transition to a future economic partnership we will see a deal dividend an economic boost from recovery in business confidence and investment and a fiscal boost from a reduction in the minimum necessary level of fiscal headroom once the risk of a no deal exit is removed giving us as a nation real choices as we use the spending review to decide how much of this deal dividend we can prudently release and how we would share it between increased spending on public services capital investment in britain s future prosperity and keeping taxes low while always continuing to keep our debt falling real terms increases in public spending record investment in britain s future more jobs than ever before higher wages and lower taxes meaning increased take home pay and for the first time in a generation our debt going down that mr speaker is what i mean by an end to austerity but mr speaker the progress we have made will be at risk if we cannot secure a smooth and orderly exit from the eu and a transition to a new partnership that protects the complex trading relationships businesses have built up over 45 years and on which so many british jobs depend i hoped we would do that last night but i am confident that we as a house will do it over the coming weeks leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption in the short and medium term and a smaller less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal higher unemployment lower wages higher prices in the shops that is not what the british people voted for in june 2016 which is why all of us have a solemn duty in the days and weeks ahead to put aside our differences and seek a compromise on which this house can agree in the national interest but government also has a duty to plan for every reasonably foreseeable contingency and we have done so first we have plans in place to minimise disruption to our financial system and the bank of england judges that it is resilient to any likely no deal shock second we have worked across whitehall to put in place mitigations at our border although we cannot regulate how the eu will operate its border in a no deal exit third we have published today our temporary uk no deal tariff schedule carefully balancing the needs of producers and consumers in the context of the pressures the no deal economy would face and fourth the treasury and the bank of england together have all the tools of fiscal and monetary policy available to us including the fiscal headroom i have held in reserve but i need to be straight with the house a no deal brexit would deliver a significant short to medium term reduction in the productive capacity of the british economy and because our economy is operating at or near full capacity any fiscal and monetary response would have to be carefully calibrated not to simply cause inflation compounding the effect of any movement in the exchange rate on the price of goods in our shops and while fiscal and monetary intervention might help to smooth our path to a post brexit economy both could only be temporary and neither would allow us to avoid the effects of a relatively smaller economy nor the pain of restructuring so the idea that there is some simple readily available fix that can be deployed to avoid the consequences of a no deal brexit is i am afraid just wrong but mr speaker i m confident that we re going to do a deal and when we do the british people will fully expect us to fire up our economic plan to seize the opportunities as confidence in our economy returns but it isn t just the spectre of uncertainty that we need to overcome if we are to restore confidence and unlock a brighter future so our task is to demonstrate to the british people that working with business through the mechanism of a well regulated market economy our plan will deliver a brighter future for them a plan which makes the most of the opportunities ahead as we make our own way independent from but in continuing partnership with the european union a plan to embrace the technologies of the future and equip british workers to use them to back the enterprise and ambition of british business to support our world leading entrepreneurs creators and innovators inventors and discoverers to build on the uk s fundamental strengths and competitive advantages so that we can slay once and for all the twin demons of low productivity and low wages and build an economy that works for everyone mr speaker the only sustainable path to higher wages and rising living standards is to boost productivity and to do that we are investing in infrastructure skills technology and housing under our plan for britain s future with 37 billion in the national productivity investment fund the largest ever investment in england s strategic roads the biggest rail investment programme since victorian times and a strategy for delivering a nationwide full fibre network by 2033 at sr19 we will set multi year capital budgets following a zero based review protecting our record levels of capital spending while ensuring that investment is focussed to deliver the greatest impact on productivity and our investment strategy is benefitting the whole of the uk i can announce today up to 260 million for the innovative borderlands growth deal covering the border regions of england and scotland on top of the 100 million hif funding already announced for carlisle negotiations are progressing on future deals for mid wales and derry londonderry and i reiterate today this government s commitment to the northern powerhouse rail project and look forward to considering tfn s business case ahead of the spending review we will publish the updated national infrastructure strategy alongside the spending review and i am publishing today a consultation on our approach to supporting private infrastructure investment once we leave the european investment bank but raising our productivity isn t just about investing in physical capital it s also about investing in people the augar review will be published shortly and will represent an important contribution to our overall plan for post 18 education the government will respond later in the year we are committed to returning technical and vocational skills to the heart of our educational system with the new t level system on track to deliver the first three routes in 2020 the first phase of the national retraining scheme starting this summer and the apprenticeship programme rolling out 3 million new high quality apprenticeships and to help small businesses take on more apprentices i can announce that i am bringing forward the 700 million package of reforms i announced at budget to the start of the new financial year in april the productivity agenda is above all about increasing the wages of the lowest paid and the pay of a full timer on national minimum wage has risen by 2 750 a year since 2016 we ve confirmed the low pay commission s remit for the national living wage to reach 60 of median earnings by 2020 but later this year we will need to set a new remit beyond 2020 we want to be ambitious driving productivity across the income distribution with the ultimate objective of ending low pay in the uk but we also want to take care to protect employment opportunities for lower paid workers so we have asked professor arin dube a world leading expert in the field to undertake a review of the international evidence on the employment and productivity effects of minimum wage rates this study will support the extensive discussions that we will be having with employer organisations trades unions and the lpc itself over the coming months starting with a roundtable which i will chair next month mr speaker alongside our commitment to giving british workers the skills they need is a commitment to maintaining the openness of our economy to talent from around the world as we leave the eu free movement of people will end and we will take back control of our borders my rhf the home secretary has set out a framework for a future immigration system in the immigration white paper focussed on attracting those with the skills we need in the uk economy no matter where they come from we have committed to consulting with business to ensure that the new system supports the needs of our economy and as we do so i can announce that from june we will begin to abolish the need for paper landing cards at uk points of entry and we will allow citizens of the usa australia new zealand canada japan singapore and south korea to start using e gates at our airports and eurostar terminals alongside the eea nationals who can already use them mr speaker our ambition is to be able to go further in due course a signal to the world of our commitment to global britain another key pillar of our plan is backing britain to remain at the forefront of the technology revolution that is transforming our economy and to support that ambition from this autumn we will completely exempt phd level roles from the visa caps since 2016 we have launched our modern industrial strategy and committed an additional 7 billion to science and innovation clear progress towards our target of total r d spending reaching 2 4 of the economy but technology does not stand still and neither can we so to maintain the uk s technological edge we will invest 79 million in archer2 a new supercomputer to be hosted at edinburgh university i am told that it s up to five times faster than the current generation capable of a staggering ten thousand trillion calculations per second and i am told mr speaker that with the right algorithms it might even be able to come up with a solution to the backstop i am allocating 45 million of npif funding to the european bioinformatics institute ensuring britain s continued lead in genomics research i will guarantee our commitment to the uk s funding for the jet nuclear fusion reactor whatever happens with brexit and invest 81 million in a new extreme photonics centre in oxfordshire to develop new types of lasers literally the cutting edge of technology mr speaker the digital economy presents enormous opportunities but enormous challenges as well i have already responded to concerns about unfairness in the tax system with a new digital services tax so that digital platform companies pay their fair share but we also need to adapt our regulatory environment to ensure competition works for consumers in the digital market place as it does in the real market place i asked professor jason furman barack obama s former chief economist to review competition in the digital market place and i welcome his report published today he sets out far reaching recommendations including new powers for consumers and an overhaul of competition regulation updating our regulatory model for the digital age and as a first step towards implementing reforms i am asking the competition and markets authority to undertake a market study of the digital advertising market as soon as possible mr speaker the uk will remain a great place to do digital business but it will be a place where successful global tech giants pay their fair share where competition policy works in consumers interests and where the public are protected from online harms under this government britain will lead the world in delivering a digital economy that works for everyone mr speaker a well regulated market economy is the best indeed the only way to deliver a brighter future for our country our challenge is to demonstrate to the next generation that our market economy can fulfil their aspirations and speak to their values so before i finish i want to talk about two subjects dear to them housing and the environment last year housing delivery exceeded 220 000 additional homes the highest level in all but one of the last 31 years mr speaker our ambitious plan to restore the dream of home ownership to millions of younger people is already delivering planning reform to release land in areas where the pressure is greatest a five year 44 billion housing programme to help raise annual housing supply to 300 000 by the mid 2020s the help to buy equity loan scheme abolition of stamp duty for first time buyers which has so far helped 240 000 people onto the property ladder and restored the proportion of first time buyers to above 50 for the first time in a generation and today i can announce a new 3 billion affordable homes guarantee scheme to support delivery of around 30 000 affordable homes the launch next month of the 1 billion enable build sme guarantee fund that i announced at budget and 717 million from the housing infrastructure fund to unlock up to 37 000 new homes on sites in west london cheshire didcot and cambridge the latter two being at opposite ends of the oxford cambridge arc for which i am publishing a new vision statement today mr speaker as with the challenge of adapting to the digital age so with the challenge of shaping the carbon neutral economy of the future we must apply the creativity of the marketplace to deliver solutions to one of the most complex problems of our time climate change and build sustainability into the heart of our economic model the uk is already leading the world reducing the carbon intensity of our economy faster than any other g20 country with ambitious and legally binding targets for the future today i can announce our next steps first we will publish a call for evidence on whether all passenger carriers should be required to offer genuinely additional carbon offsets so that customers who want zero carbon travel have that option and can be confident about additionality second we will help small businesses cut their carbon emissions and their energy bills publishing today a call for evidence on the business energy efficiency scheme that i announced at the budget third we will publish proposals to require an increased proportion of green gas in the grid advancing decarbonisation of our mains gas supply and finally we will introduce a future homes standard mandating the end of fossil fuel heating systems in all new houses from 2025 mr speaker delivering lower carbon and lower fuel bills too but mr speaker climate change is not our only environmental challenge we are already consulting on new tax and regulatory measures to tackle the scourge of plastic waste defacing our countryside and choking our oceans now for the first time in 60 million years the number of species worldwide is in sustained mass decline the uk s 1 500 species of pollinators deliver an estimated 680 million annual value to our economy so there is an economic as well as an environmental case for protecting the diversity of the natural world so following consultation the government will use the forthcoming environment bill to mandate biodiversity net gain for development in england ensuring that the delivery of much needed infrastructure and housing is not at the expense of vital biodiversity but this is a global problem mr speaker so later this year the uk government will launch a comprehensive global review of the link between biodiversity and economic growth to be led by professor sir partha dasgupta emeritus professor of economics at cambridge we in this house mr speaker should be proud that the uk with its overseas territories has already declared more than 3m square kilometres of marine protected area and today i can announce our intention to designate a further 445 000 square kilometers of ocean around ascension island as marine protected area taking action today on our pledge to be the first in history to leave our environment in a better condition than we found it mr speaker before i conclude i have three further short announcements to make first in response to rising concern by headteachers that some girls are missing school attendance due to inability to afford sanitary products i have decided to fund the provision of free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges in england from the next school year i congratulate those honourable members who have campaigned on this issue on all sides of this house and my rhf the education secretary will announce further details in due course second i announced a year ago that we would take definitive action to tackle the scourge of late payments for our small businesses a full response to last year s call for evidence will be published shortly but i can announce today that as a first step we will require company audit committees to review payment practices and report on them in their annual accounts my rhf the business secretary will announce further details in due course and i congratulate the fsb in particular on its tireless campaign on this issue third mr speaker the recent surge in knife crime represents a personal tragedy for the scores of families of victims and i know i can speak for the whole house when i offer my deepest sympathies to them we must and we will stamp out this menace police funding is due to rise by up to 970 million from april many police crime commissioners have already committed to using this extra funding to recruit and train additional police officers but that takes time and action is needed now so the prime minister and i have decided exceptionally to make available immediately to police forces in england and wales an additional 100 million over the course of the next year ring fenced to pay for additional overtime targeted specifically on knife crime and for new violent crime reduction units to deliver a wider cross agency response to this epidemic ahead of the spending review my rhf the home secretary will work with the police to consider how best to prioritise resources going forward including newly funded manpower to ensure a lasting solution to the problem mr speaker to be frank last night s events mean we are not where i hoped we would be today our economy is fundamentally robust but the uncertainty i hoped we would lift last night still hangs over it we cannot allow that to continue it is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world tonight we have a choice we can remove the threat of an imminent no deal exit hanging over our economy tomorrow we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this house for a deal we can collectively support to exit the eu in an orderly way to a future relationship that will allow britain to flourish protecting jobs and businesses we have huge opportunities ahead of us our capital is the world s financial centre our universities are global powerhouses of discovery and innovation our businesses are at the cutting edge of the tech revolution and we have shown that we are not shy as a nation of

sign up for our caribbean life email newsletter to get news updates and local insights delivered straight to your inbox after discrediting state owned enterprises privatization advocates successfully pushed a broad reform agenda under the rubric of privatization from the 1980s with the support of the washington based international financial institutions kuala lumpur malaysia march 12 2019 ips privatization has been central to the neo liberal counter revolution from the 1970s against government economic interventions associated with roosevelt and keynes as well as post colonial state led economic development many developing countries were forced to accept privatization policies as a condition for credit or loan support from the world bank and other international financial institutions especially after the fiscal and debt crises of the early 1980s other countries voluntarily embraced privatization often on the pretext of fiscal and debt constraints in their efforts to mimic new anglo american criteria of economic progress demonizing soes globally inflation was attributed to excessive government intervention public sector expansion and state owned enterprise soe inefficiency it was claimed with uneven and dubious evidence that soes were inherently likely to be inefficient corrupt subject to abuse and so on in the 1970s the motives of many involved in the preceding public sector expansion enabled by high commodity prices and earnings as well as low real interest rates due to easy credit with the need to recycle petro dollars invest revenues from petroleum exports were developmental and noble regardless of their original rationale or intent many soes become problematic and often inefficient yet privatization is not and has never been a universal panacea for the myriad problems faced by soes only more pragmatic and appropriate approaches recognizing their origins roles functioning impacts and problems can realistically expect to address and overcome the burdens they have come to impose on many developing economies various meanings privatization usually refers to a change of ownership from public to private hands over recent decades the term has been used more loosely for example it may only involve minority private ownership after the corporatization of an soe and the sale of a minority share of its stock or even a majority share with control remaining in state hands by various means such as the use of a golden share it sometimes also refers to contracting out services previously undertaken solely by the government the definition may include cases where private enterprises are awarded licenses to participate in activities previously reserved for the public sector strictly speaking however privatization involves the transfer of at least a majority share of and a controlling interest in a public enterprise or soe and its assets or an entity such as a government department a statutory body or a government company previously controlled and typically at least majority owned by the government either directly or indirectly mainstreaming privatization following the oil price shocks of the mid and late 1970s inflation spread through much of the world us president jimmy carter appointed paul volcker as chairman of the us federal reserve in 1980 the us fed sharply raised interest rates to stem inflation which precipitated the fiscal and debt crises of the early 1980s in many parts of the world especially in latin america africa and eastern europe the unexpected sovereign debt crises forced many countries to seek emergency financial support from the international monetary fund imf and the world bank wb both headquartered in washington dc the imf provided emergency credit facilities requiring price stabilization programmes to bring down inflation typically blamed on deficit financing due to macroeconomic populism generally the wb worked closely to provide medium and long term credit to these governments on condition that they adopted structural adjustment programmes saps the saps generally prescribed economic globalization especially of international trade and finance national or domestic deregulation and privatization since then these international financial institutions have been more powerful in relation to developing countries than ever before soon privatization became a standard requirement of saps thus many governments of developing countries were forced to privatize by the saps loan conditions many other governments voluntarily adopted such policies which became standard pillars of the emerging washington consensus associated with the wb the imf and the us policy consensus of the 1980s privatization in developing countries was preceded by the political counter revolution associated with the rise and election of margaret thatcher as the prime minister of the united kingdom and ronald reagan as the president of the united states of america jomo kwame sundaram a former economics professor was united nations assistant secretary general for economic development and received the wassily leontief prize for advancing the frontiers of economic thought

gaap to non gaap measures president and chief executive officer timothy s duncan commented 2018 was a transformative year for the company as we combined the best aspects of two companies following our merger with stone energy the benefits of the combination have shown results immediately as we are a stronger free cash flow positive company with ample liquidity and a significant inventory of drilling locations in both the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico our strategy of executing asset management and drilling projects around existing infrastructure in the us gulf of mexico complements our high impact exploration and development projects in offshore mexico in the last twelve months we have seen our proved developed reserves increase 20 as compared to the pro forma reserves at december 31 2017 we have also added three small bolt on transactions at a low entry cost including the gunflint acquisition in january of 2019 we have increased our liquidity position and continued to improve our already robust leverage metrics we have also re affirmed the potential of our globally recognized zama discovery through our ongoing appraisal program our average daily production in 2018 on a pro forma basis was 52 4 mboe d which was on the high end of our pro forma guidance range of 49 0 53 0 mboe d allowing us to generate 585 million of pro forma adjusted ebitda for the full year 2018 inclusive of hedges and a pro forma capital program of 452 million inclusive of plugging and abandoning activities p a although the merger with stone required us to spend more capital in 2018 on p a and non recurring repairs and maintenance than we normally would have in 2019 those costs are expected to go down materially in the us gulf of mexico we executed a series of deepwater subsea tie back projects in 2018 and early 2019 namely the mt providence well which was connected to our pompano facility and the tornado 3 and boris 3 wells that will flow back to the helix producer 1 hp 1 in our operated phoenix complex once the wells are completed the hp 1 dry dock project in the first quarter of 2019 was flawlessly executed by the talos team and our partner helix energy solutions and we expect the production in the phoenix complex to be restarted in the coming days soon thereafter we expect to bring the impactful tornado 3 and boris 3 wells online which will put talos in a position to grow production year over year while continuing to generate free cash flow in the current price environment for 2019 in shallow water our asset management and drilling activities have allowed assets such as ewing bank 305 306 to achieve production levels not seen in the last 15 years we also continue to be active and to execute on our business development and commercial activities in addition to the aforementioned bolt on acquisitions we have acquired the antrim stranded discovery from exxonmobil and have entered into partnerships to drill two deepwater projects in 2019 the bulleit and orlov prospects in mexico on the zama project our operations execution has been outstanding as part of the ongoing appraisal program we confirmed the oil water contact per our geological model and have encountered more sand than expected in the first down dip location we are excited about the impact this discovery will have in the mexican economy and to talos shareholders also in offshore mexico we will start to execute on the inventory we acquired as part of the cross assignment of interest between block 2 and block 31 which includes the low risk but high impact olmeca project on block 31 in conclusion we are very happy with our 2018 results but we are already looking forward to 2019 and beyond we will continue to relentlessly execute on our operations and strategy of responsibly growing production at an appropriate pace that allows for the continued generation of positive free cash flow while diligently pursuing additional business development opportunities that fit our asset footprint and core competencies we believe this is only the beginning of the talos journey recent developments and operations update drilling and exploration activities deepwater helix producer 1 dry dock the hp 1 departed the shipyard on march 7 2019 after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the phoenix complex to re start on or about march 20 2019 resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the phoenix complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the phoenix complex was a known expected event after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the complex to re start on or about resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the complex was a known expected event the tornado 3 well was drilled in december 2018 and is scheduled to begin completions operations in late march with an expected duration of 21 days the well is anticipated to commence production by early second quarter 2019 with an expected gross production rate between 10 0 mboe d 15

signed a participation agreement with a subsidiary of enven corporation to drill the green canyon 21 bulleit prospect talos will be the operator and has an initial working interest of 66 7 in the lease bulleit is an amplitude supported pliocene prospect with similar seismic attributes to the analogous sand section in talos s green canyon 18 field which has produced approximately 39 mmboe to date talos expects to spud the well in the second quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the talos owned and operated green canyon 18 gc 18 facility approximately 10 miles away talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that bulleit has the potential to deliver initial production between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis orlov prospect talos has signed a participation agreement to engage in the drilling of the green canyon 200 orlov prospect fieldwood energy will be the operator and talos has a

approximately 27 mmboe to date talos expects the well to spud near the end of the first quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the fieldwood operated green canyon 158 bullwinkle facility talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that orlov has the potential to deliver between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis mexico block 7 zama appraisal program as previously announced the zama 2 appraisal penetration was successfully and safely completed approximately 28 days ahead of schedule and 25 below projected costs the well confirmed a contiguous zama upper miocene sandstone interval thicker than the zama 1 discovery well and slightly thicker than the pre drill estimates for the zama 2 well with high quality rock properties analogous to upper miocene sands in the us gulf of mexico the zama 2 penetration also reached the oil water contact slightly deeper than the anticipated depth and consistent with our geophysical models preliminary pressure data indicates that the reservoir area around the zama 2 appraisal well is connected to the zama 1 discovery well and talos expects the zama 2 vertical sidetrack and the zama 3 wells will provide additional information about the reservoir connectivity and consistency the next step of the appraisal program is currently underway with an up dip vertical penetration in the zama reservoir from the main bore hole of the zama 2 well called the zama 2 st which has been cored and a drill stem test will be performed in the coming weeks the second appraisal well zama 3 will be drilled to the south of the original discovery well and will help delineate the reservoir continuity and quality in the southern part of the field and will be cored to better understand the reservoir geology block 2 and block 31 exploration program talos and its partners expect to drill two exploration wells in block 2 and two delineation wells in block 31 in 2019 in block 2 the well to test the acan prospect is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2019 in block 31 the olmeca 1 well is expected to be drilled in the second half of 2019 the olmeca complex has been significantly de risked by the xaxamani 1 well drilled by pemex in 2003 the 2019 drilling campaign will be to appraise the same geological structure initially tested by pemex and if successful a final investment decision to develop these assets could be reached in 2020 business development activities acquisition of the antrim discovery from exxonmobil on january 23 2019 talos and exxonmobil exxon executed an acquisition agreement through which talos acquired 100 interest in the antrim project in green canyon block 364 gc 364 exxon drilled an exploratory well in gc 364 in november 2017 that encountered hydrocarbons in a sub salt miocene reservoir and subsequently divested of the discovery well and the gc 364 lease to talos for further appraisal and a possible development talos plans to drill an additional well to further appraise the discovered resource the company is still developing a detailed timeline for the appraisal and development plan over the next few years with significant time ahead of the june 2025 lease expiration if the appraisal is successful talos is currently considering a tie back to the talos owned and operated gc 18 facility acquired from whistler in 2018 in addition to a nominal upfront cash consideration payment by talos exxon will receive an overriding royalty interest in the lease as well as a future cash payment upon the earlier of 30 days following the completion of drilling operations on the first well or by the end of the third quarter of 2020 gunflint acquisition on january 11 2019 talos acquired an approximate 9

renowned economist shen jianguang shares his predictions for the chinese economy in 2019 a new year is a time for fresh starts and new beginnings at least that is what policymakers in beijing will be hoping the second half of 2018 produced an avalanche of negative headlines on the economy as a domestic deleveraging drive and the intensifying trade war with the united states slowed growth and undermined confidence will these headwinds continue battering the chinese economy this year or will beijing be able to engineer a recovery there are few people better placed to answer this question than shen jianguang currently chief economist at jd digits the leading data and technology firm spun off from e commerce giant jd com shen is one of china s most respected economic analysts his career has included stints at the european central bank international monetary fund and oecd as well as china international capital corporation and mizuho securities in this interview shen explains that analysts are right to be concerned about the health of china s economy but that many are not paying attention to the greatest risk of all how would you describe the overall state of the economy in early 2019 i think the chinese economy is facing serious challenges in 2018 there was an external shock which was the china united states trade war domestically the deleveraging policy resulted in overtightening in the financial system on top of that there was also a severe antipollution campaign which has created challenges for many small and medium sized companies which of these factors has had the greatest impact on the economy the trade war or the domestic policies primarily it has been the domestic factors that have weighed on the economy despite the trade war if you look at the hard data chinese exports to the united states have increased faster in 2018 than in the previous year so the impact of the trade war has been more psychological than anything else of course 2019 will probably be more challenging than 2018 because a lot of companies have been afraid of the impact of the trade war and have tried to avoid the 25 tariffs and have been frontloading their products for the us market this will have an impact on firms in 2019 even if the 25 tariffs do not go ahead on the other hand domestic factors such as the deleveraging and the shutdown of polluting companies have had a much larger impact on business sentiment and the overall economy profit levels in the private sector have dropped significantly and confidence weakened in the third quarter i am working for jd digits which is associated with the e commerce firm jd com so i see a lot of big data on consumption looking at this data it is clear that consumption has weakened since the third quarter if the us were to raise tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 as it has threatened to do what impact would that have on the economy i think the impact would be profoundly serious and i suspect that is the reason behind the change in beijing s stance toward trying to reach an agreement with the us i did a study on how the performance of chinese exporters had been affected by the 25 us tariffs on 50 billion of goods and i saw a sharp decline in the growth rate of their business with the us i think that is the reason why the chinese government has tried everything to avoid that happening but i think the trump administration also understands that these tariffs will also have a significant impact on us consumers in some sectors that would be affected such as furniture china accounts for around 50 of us imports as you mentioned possibly the most important factor influencing the economy in 2018 was beijing s deleveraging drive how did this policy come about and how has it impacted the economy the deleveraging drive was primarily focused on shadow banking in china shadow banking is a huge sector estimates vary but most put the size of the market at around rmb 100 trillion 14 5 trillion the bank wealth management products alone are worth around rmb 30 trillion the deleveraging drive led to a sharp contraction in the shadow banking sector and that dealt a serious shock to private firms especially small and medium sized businesses as they heavily relied on lending from shadow banking channels deleveraging also resulted in a sharp decline in the stock market which had a further impact on many private companies that had mortgaged their shares those companies were forced to sell their shareholdings causing a chain reaction on stock prices the main impact of the crackdown on shadow banking was felt by smes but consumers also felt the effects due to the decline in the peer to peer lending industry what role did the peer to peer p2p lending industry play in the economy consumers mainly used p2p products as a place to store their savings online p2p companies generally offered much higher interest rates than banks so consumers often put their savings there to earn more interest normally p2p companies also act as facilitators by lending to consumers but in china some p2p companies instead used the money they raised to lend to the corporate sector then when the government tightened liquidity conditions this caused a wave of bankruptcies among those p2p firms nearly 2 000 p2p companies went bankrupt or closed down a lot of consumers lost their savings and this had an impact on consumption as well that is one of the main reasons why the economy is so weak right now what will happen with regard to the deleveraging drive in 2019 i think the deleveraging campaign has already ended yi gang governor of the people s bank of china announced in october that the country s debt levels have stabilized and the chinese government has made no mention of more deleveraging in recent statements instead they have introduced cuts to banks reserve requirement ratios rrr and reduced the seven day repo rates we also know that overall interest rates have been declining so in a way monetary easing has started already the government also moved to cut personal income tax rates in october and has pledged to introduce more tax cuts in 2019 policies should be very accommodative but this is unlikely to be enough to revive growth in the short term because it will take time for these policies to work through the economy how far do you expect beijing to go in terms of introducing stimulus measures to boost growth in 2019 stimulus measures may improve things a bit but my main worry for 2019 is not deleveraging or the trade war but a liquidity trap just as happened to japan in the 1990s the bank of japan at that time had accommodative policies and even undertook some quantitative easing qe but businesses still struggled to borrow and banks were reluctant to lend so i think this could be a risk for china in 2019 beijing has introduced several measures designed to boost lending to the private sector what more does the government need to do to avoid a liquidity trap i think the impact of the current policies will be limited the key is not monetary policy but furthering structural reform for example whether the government can really ensure equal treatment for state owned enterprises soes and private companies the banks are always willing to lend to soes so rather than just urge banks to lend more to the private sector the government should treat soes and private firms equally this is what pboc government yi gang meant when referring to competitive neutrality the us has also been pushing china to introduce structural reforms removing special treatment for soes how far will beijing be willing to go in this regard the chinese leader recently gave a speech at an event celebrating the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up era judging from that speech i am more optimistic regarding the opening up side than the reform side the government already expressed willingness to open the financial sector more to foreign institutions regarding reforms such as soe and land reforms i saw few signs from that speech that large moves in these areas are imminent there have been quite a lot of negative news stories about china s economy in recent months are there any positive trends that are going underreported first of all i expect that the growth rate will slow down in 2019 but i believe that even a 6 growth rate is good enough even if it goes down to 5 so what that would still be among the highest in the world in the world s second largest economy i think pursuing a high growth rate would be dangerous i think there are two positive signs going into 2019 the first is that the trade war with the united states will probably be resolved i believe that the negotiations will bear fruit and the two sides will reach an agreement i don t think the extra 25 tariffs will be introduced that would remove a lot of uncertainty from chinese exporters secondly the introduction of more accommodative policies will mitigate a lot of pain in the economy you mentioned that consumption slowed during the second half of 2018 what has been driving this slowdown firstly there has been a general slowdown in the economy which has resulted in a slowdown in income growth secondly there is the wealth effect the decline in stock prices and stagnation in the housing market do you expect consumption to continue to drag in 2019 i think the overall trend is downward there has been quite a fast decline in the growth rate in september the growth rate of retail sales was 9 2 but by november it had fallen to 8 1 reviving the economy will take at least six months or two quarters the government has already started this shift toward accommodative policies there has been a slowdown in property sales in many cities what developments can we expect in the real estate market in 2019 the policy appears still to be not to allow property prices to fall further i think it is also quite clear that the chinese government has concluded that there is a huge bubble in the property market that s why they have this policy of not allowing prices to decreasing any more but i think the pain in the market will continue i don t see a recovery next year it will probably remain stagnant what will be main focus for china s policymakers this year i think the number one issue will be reaching an agreement with

gaap to non gaap measures president and chief executive officer timothy s duncan commented 2018 was a transformative year for the company as we combined the best aspects of two companies following our merger with stone energy the benefits of the combination have shown results immediately as we are a stronger free cash flow positive company with ample liquidity and a significant inventory of drilling locations in both the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico our strategy of executing asset management and drilling projects around existing infrastructure in the us gulf of mexico complements our high impact exploration and development projects in offshore mexico in the last twelve months we have seen our proved developed reserves increase 20 as compared to the pro forma reserves at december 31 2017 we have also added three small bolt on transactions at a low entry cost including the gunflint acquisition in january of 2019 we have increased our liquidity position and continued to improve our already robust leverage metrics we have also re affirmed the potential of our globally recognized zama discovery through our ongoing appraisal program our average daily production in 2018 on a pro forma basis was 52 4 mboe d which was on the high end of our pro forma guidance range of 49 0 53 0 mboe d allowing us to generate 585 million of pro forma adjusted ebitda for the full year 2018 inclusive of hedges and a pro forma capital program of 452 million inclusive of plugging and abandoning activities p a although the merger with stone required us to spend more capital in 2018 on p a and non recurring repairs and maintenance than we normally would have in 2019 those costs are expected to go down materially in the us gulf of mexico we executed a series of deepwater subsea tie back projects in 2018 and early 2019 namely the mt providence well which was connected to our pompano facility and the tornado 3 and boris 3 wells that will flow back to the helix producer 1 hp 1 in our operated phoenix complex once the wells are completed the hp 1 dry dock project in the first quarter of 2019 was flawlessly executed by the talos team and our partner helix energy solutions and we expect the production in the phoenix complex to be restarted in the coming days soon thereafter we expect to bring the impactful tornado 3 and boris 3 wells online which will put talos in a position to grow production year over year while continuing to generate free cash flow in the current price environment for 2019 in shallow water our asset management and drilling activities have allowed assets such as ewing bank 305 306 to achieve production levels not seen in the last 15 years we also continue to be active and to execute on our business development and commercial activities in addition to the aforementioned bolt on acquisitions we have acquired the antrim stranded discovery from exxonmobil and have entered into partnerships to drill two deepwater projects in 2019 the bulleit and orlov prospects in mexico on the zama project our operations execution has been outstanding as part of the ongoing appraisal program we confirmed the oil water contact per our geological model and have encountered more sand than expected in the first down dip location we are excited about the impact this discovery will have in the mexican economy and to talos shareholders also in offshore mexico we will start to execute on the inventory we acquired as part of the cross assignment of interest between block 2 and block 31 which includes the low risk but high impact olmeca project on block 31 in conclusion we are very happy with our 2018 results but we are already looking forward to 2019 and beyond we will continue to relentlessly execute on our operations and strategy of responsibly growing production at an appropriate pace that allows for the continued generation of positive free cash flow while diligently pursuing additional business development opportunities that fit our asset footprint and core competencies we believe this is only the beginning of the talos journey recent developments and operations update drilling and exploration activities deepwater helix producer 1 dry dock the hp 1 departed the shipyard on march 7 2019 after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the phoenix complex to re start on or about march 20 2019 resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the phoenix complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the phoenix complex was a known expected event after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the complex to re start on or about resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the complex was a known expected event the tornado 3 well was drilled in december 2018 and is scheduled to begin completions operations in late march with an expected duration of 21 days the well is anticipated to commence production by early second quarter 2019 with an expected gross production rate between 10 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d or 5 0 mboe d 7 5 mboe d net to talos after royalties talos is the operator and owns a 65 working interest with kosmos energy owning the remaining 35 working interest the boris 3 well was spud in january 2019 and was drilled to a total depth of approximately 15 000 feet and logged approximately 75 feet gross and 56 feet net of true vertical pay 360 feet up dip of 27 mmboe of historical production in the b 4 sand boris 3 is scheduled to begin completion operations in mid april with an expected duration of 21 days and is expected to initiate production in the second quarter of 2019 talos expects boris 3 to have initial production between 3 0 5 0 mboe d gross or 2 8 4 6 mboe d net to talos after royalties talos is the operator and owns 100 working interest in all boris wells and was drilled to a total depth of approximately 15 000 feet and logged approximately 75 feet gross and 56 feet net of true vertical pay 360 feet up dip of 27 mmboe of historical production in the b 4 sand boris 3 is scheduled to begin completion operations in mid april with an expected duration of 21 days and is expected to initiate production in the second quarter of 2019 talos expects boris 3 to have initial production between 3 0 5 0 mboe d gross or 2 8 4 6 mboe d net to talos after royalties talos is the operator and owns 100 working interest in all boris wells bulleit prospect talos has signed a participation agreement with a subsidiary of enven corporation to drill the green canyon 21 bulleit prospect talos will be the operator and has an initial working interest of 66 7 in the lease bulleit is an amplitude supported pliocene prospect with similar seismic attributes to the analogous sand section in talos s green canyon 18 field which has produced approximately 39 mmboe to date talos expects to spud the well in the second quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the talos owned and operated green canyon 18 gc 18 facility approximately 10 miles away talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that bulleit has the potential to deliver initial production between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis orlov prospect talos has signed a participation agreement to engage in the drilling of the green canyon 200 orlov prospect fieldwood energy will be the operator and talos has a working interest of 30 in the prospect orlov is an amplitude supported miocene prospect with similar geophysical and structural attributes to the talos operated boris field which has produced approximately 27 mmboe to date talos expects the well to spud near the end of the first quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the fieldwood operated green canyon 158 bullwinkle facility talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that orlov has the potential to deliver between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis mexico block 7 zama appraisal program as previously announced the zama 2 appraisal penetration was successfully and safely completed approximately 28 days ahead of schedule and 25 below projected costs the well confirmed a contiguous zama upper miocene sandstone interval thicker than the zama 1 discovery well and slightly thicker than the pre drill estimates for the zama 2 well with high quality rock properties analogous to upper miocene sands in the us gulf of mexico the zama 2 penetration also reached the oil water contact slightly deeper than the anticipated depth and consistent with our geophysical models preliminary pressure data indicates that the reservoir area around the zama 2 appraisal well is connected to the zama 1 discovery well and talos expects the zama 2 vertical sidetrack and the zama 3 wells will provide additional information about the reservoir connectivity and consistency the next step of the appraisal program is currently underway with an up dip vertical penetration in the zama reservoir from the main bore hole of the zama 2 well called the zama 2 st which has been cored and a drill stem test will be performed in the coming weeks the second appraisal well zama 3 will be drilled to the south of the original discovery well and will help delineate the reservoir continuity and quality in the southern part of the field and will be cored to better understand the reservoir geology block 2 and block 31 exploration program talos and its partners expect to drill two exploration wells in block 2 and two delineation wells in block 31 in 2019 in block 2 the well to test the acan prospect is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2019 in block 31 the olmeca 1 well is expected to be drilled in the second half of 2019 the olmeca complex has been significantly de risked by the xaxamani 1 well drilled by pemex in 2003 the 2019 drilling campaign will be to appraise the same geological structure initially tested by pemex and if successful a final investment decision to develop these assets could be reached in 2020 business development activities acquisition of the antrim discovery from exxonmobil on january 23 2019 talos and exxonmobil exxon executed an acquisition agreement through which talos acquired 100 interest in the antrim project in green canyon block 364 gc 364 exxon drilled an exploratory well in gc 364 in november 2017 that encountered hydrocarbons in a sub salt miocene reservoir and subsequently divested of the discovery well and the gc 364 lease to talos for further appraisal and a possible development talos plans to drill an additional well to further appraise the discovered resource the company is still developing a detailed timeline for the appraisal and development plan over the next few years with significant time ahead of the june 2025 lease expiration if the appraisal is successful talos is currently considering a tie back to the talos owned and operated gc 18 facility acquired from whistler in 2018 in addition to a nominal upfront cash consideration payment by talos exxon will receive an overriding royalty interest in the lease as well as a future cash payment upon the earlier of 30 days following the completion of drilling operations on the first well or by the end of the third quarter of 2020 gunflint acquisition on january 11 2019 talos acquired an approximate 9

pv 10 is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date before deducting future income taxes discounted at 10 percent we believe that the presentation of pv 10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties further investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties pv 10 however is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows our pv 10 measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves the following table provides a reconciliation of pv 10 of our proved reserves to the

gaap to non gaap measures president and chief executive officer timothy s duncan commented 2018 was a transformative year for the company as we combined the best aspects of two companies following our merger with stone energy the benefits of the combination have shown results immediately as we are a stronger free cash flow positive company with ample liquidity and a significant inventory of drilling locations in both the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico our strategy of executing asset management and drilling projects around existing infrastructure in the us gulf of mexico complements our high impact exploration and development projects in offshore mexico in the last twelve months we have seen our proved developed reserves increase 20 as compared to the pro forma reserves at december 31 2017 we have also added three small bolt on transactions at a low entry cost including the gunflint acquisition in january of 2019 we have increased our liquidity position and continued to improve our already robust leverage metrics we have also re affirmed the potential of our globally recognized zama discovery through our ongoing appraisal program our average daily production in 2018 on a pro forma basis was 52 4 mboe d which was on the high end of our pro forma guidance range of 49 0 53 0 mboe d allowing us to generate 585 million of pro forma adjusted ebitda for the full year 2018 inclusive of hedges and a pro forma capital program of 452 million inclusive of plugging and abandoning activities p a although the merger with stone required us to spend more capital in 2018 on p a and non recurring repairs and maintenance than we normally would have in 2019 those costs are expected to go down materially in the us gulf of mexico we executed a series of deepwater subsea tie back projects in 2018 and early 2019 namely the mt providence well which was connected to our pompano facility and the tornado 3 and boris 3 wells that will flow back to the helix producer 1 hp 1 in our operated phoenix complex once the wells are completed the hp 1 dry dock project in the first quarter of 2019 was flawlessly executed by the talos team and our partner helix energy solutions and we expect the production in the phoenix complex to be restarted in the coming days soon thereafter we expect to bring the impactful tornado 3 and boris 3 wells online which will put talos in a position to grow production year over year while continuing to generate free cash flow in the current price environment for 2019 in shallow water our asset management and drilling activities have allowed assets such as ewing bank 305 306 to achieve production levels not seen in the last 15 years we also continue to be active and to execute on our business development and commercial activities in addition to the aforementioned bolt on acquisitions we have acquired the antrim stranded discovery from exxonmobil and have entered into partnerships to drill two deepwater projects in 2019 the bulleit and orlov prospects in mexico on the zama project our operations execution has been outstanding as part of the ongoing appraisal program we confirmed the oil water contact per our geological model and have encountered more sand than expected in the first down dip location we are excited about the impact this discovery will have in the mexican economy and to talos shareholders also in offshore mexico we will start to execute on the inventory we acquired as part of the cross assignment of interest between block 2 and block 31 which includes the low risk but high impact olmeca project on block 31 in conclusion we are very happy with our 2018 results but we are already looking forward to 2019 and beyond we will continue to relentlessly execute on our operations and strategy of responsibly growing production at an appropriate pace that allows for the continued generation of positive free cash flow while diligently pursuing additional business development opportunities that fit our asset footprint and core competencies we believe this is only the beginning of the talos journey recent developments and operations update drilling and exploration activities deepwater helix producer 1 dry dock the hp 1 departed the shipyard on march 7 2019 after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the phoenix complex to re start on or about march 20 2019 resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the phoenix complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the phoenix complex was a known expected event after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the complex to re start on or about resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the complex was a known expected event the tornado 3 well was drilled in december 2018 and is scheduled to begin completions operations in late march with an expected duration of 21 days the well is anticipated to commence production by early second quarter 2019 with an expected gross production rate between 10 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d or 5 0 mboe d 7 5 mboe d net to talos after royalties talos is the operator and owns a 65 working interest with kosmos energy owning the remaining 35 working interest the boris 3 well was spud in january 2019 and was drilled to a total depth of approximately 15 000 feet and logged approximately 75 feet gross and 56 feet net of true vertical pay 360 feet up dip of 27 mmboe of historical production in the b 4 sand boris 3 is scheduled to begin completion operations in mid april with an expected duration of 21 days and is expected to initiate production in the second quarter of 2019

signed a participation agreement with a subsidiary of enven corporation to drill the green canyon 21 bulleit prospect talos will be the operator and has an initial working interest of 66 7 in the lease bulleit is an amplitude supported pliocene prospect with similar seismic attributes to the analogous sand section in talos s green canyon 18 field which has produced approximately 39 mmboe to date talos expects to spud the well in the second quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the talos owned and operated green canyon 18 gc 18 facility approximately 10 miles away talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that bulleit has the potential to deliver initial production between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis orlov prospect talos has signed a participation agreement to engage in the drilling of the green canyon 200 orlov prospect fieldwood energy will be the operator and talos has a working interest of 30 in the prospect orlov is an amplitude supported miocene prospect with similar geophysical and structural attributes to the talos operated boris field which has produced approximately 27 mmboe to date talos expects the well to spud near the end of the first quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the fieldwood operated green canyon 158 bullwinkle facility talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that orlov has the potential to deliver between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis mexico block 7 zama appraisal program as previously announced the zama 2 appraisal penetration was successfully and safely completed approximately 28 days ahead of schedule and 25 below projected costs the well confirmed a contiguous zama upper miocene sandstone interval thicker than the zama 1 discovery well and slightly thicker than the pre drill estimates for the zama 2 well with high quality rock properties analogous to upper miocene sands in the us gulf of mexico the zama 2 penetration also reached the oil water contact slightly deeper than the anticipated depth and consistent with our geophysical models preliminary pressure data indicates that the reservoir area around the zama 2 appraisal well is connected to the zama 1 discovery well and talos expects the zama 2 vertical sidetrack and the zama 3 wells will provide additional information about the reservoir connectivity and consistency the next step of the appraisal program is currently underway with an up dip vertical penetration in the zama reservoir from the main bore hole of the zama 2 well called the zama 2 st which has been cored and a drill stem test will be performed in the coming weeks the second appraisal well zama 3 will be drilled to the south of the original discovery well and will help delineate the reservoir continuity and quality in the southern part of the field and will be cored to better understand the reservoir geology block 2 and block 31 exploration program talos and its partners expect to drill two exploration wells in block 2 and two delineation wells in block 31 in 2019 in block 2 the well to test the acan prospect is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2019 in block 31 the olmeca 1 well is expected to be drilled in the second half of 2019 the olmeca complex has been significantly de risked by the xaxamani 1 well drilled by pemex in 2003 the 2019 drilling campaign will be to appraise the same geological structure initially tested by pemex and if successful a final investment decision to develop these assets could be reached in 2020 business development activities acquisition of the antrim discovery from exxonmobil on january 23 2019 talos and exxonmobil exxon executed an acquisition agreement through which talos acquired 100 interest in the antrim project in green canyon block 364 gc 364 exxon drilled an exploratory well in gc 364 in november 2017 that encountered hydrocarbons in a sub salt miocene reservoir and subsequently divested of the discovery well and the gc 364 lease to talos for further appraisal and a possible development talos plans to drill an additional well to further appraise the discovered resource the company is still developing a detailed timeline for the appraisal and development plan over the next few years with significant time ahead of the june 2025 lease expiration if the appraisal is successful talos is currently considering a tie back to the talos owned and operated gc 18 facility acquired from whistler in 2018 in addition to a nominal upfront cash consideration payment by talos exxon will receive an overriding royalty interest in the lease as well as a future cash payment upon the earlier of 30 days following the completion of drilling operations on the first well or by the end of the third quarter of 2020 gunflint acquisition on january 11 2019 talos acquired an approximate 9

discounted future net cash flows which is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure pv 10 is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre tax basis pv 10 is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date before deducting future income taxes discounted at 10 percent we believe that the presentation of pv 10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties further investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment

gaap to non gaap measures president and chief executive officer timothy s duncan commented 2018 was a transformative year for the company as we combined the best aspects of two companies following our merger with stone energy the benefits of the combination have shown results immediately as we are a stronger free cash flow positive company with ample liquidity and a significant inventory of drilling locations in both the us gulf of mexico and offshore mexico our strategy of executing asset management and drilling projects around existing infrastructure in the us gulf of mexico complements our high impact exploration and development projects in offshore mexico in the last twelve months we have seen our proved developed reserves increase 20 as compared to the pro forma reserves at december 31 2017 we have also added three small bolt on transactions at a low entry cost including the gunflint acquisition in january of 2019 we have increased our liquidity position and continued to improve our already robust leverage metrics we have also re affirmed the potential of our globally recognized zama discovery through our ongoing appraisal program our average daily production in 2018 on a pro forma basis was 52 4 mboe d which was on the high end of our pro forma guidance range of 49 0 53 0 mboe d allowing us to generate 585 million of pro forma adjusted ebitda for the full year 2018 inclusive of hedges and a pro forma capital program of 452 million inclusive of plugging and abandoning activities p a although the merger with stone required us to spend more capital in 2018 on p a and non recurring repairs and maintenance than we normally would have in 2019 those costs are expected to go down materially in the us gulf of mexico we executed a series of deepwater subsea tie back projects in 2018 and early 2019 namely the mt providence well which was connected to our pompano facility and the tornado 3 and boris 3 wells that will flow back to the helix producer 1 hp 1 in our operated phoenix complex once the wells are completed the hp 1 dry dock project in the first quarter of 2019 was flawlessly executed by the talos team and our partner helix energy solutions and we expect the production in the phoenix complex to be restarted in the coming days soon thereafter we expect to bring the impactful tornado 3 and boris 3 wells online which will put talos in a position to grow production year over year while continuing to generate free cash flow in the current price environment for 2019 in shallow water our asset management and drilling activities have allowed assets such as ewing bank 305 306 to achieve production levels not seen in the last 15 years we also continue to be active and to execute on our business development and commercial activities in addition to the aforementioned bolt on acquisitions we have acquired the antrim stranded discovery from exxonmobil and have entered into partnerships to drill two deepwater projects in 2019 the bulleit and orlov prospects in mexico on the zama project our operations execution has been outstanding as part of the ongoing appraisal program we confirmed the oil water contact per our geological model and have encountered more sand than expected in the first down dip location we are excited about the impact this discovery will have in the mexican economy and to talos shareholders also in offshore mexico we will start to execute on the inventory we acquired as part of the cross assignment of interest between block 2 and block 31 which includes the low risk but high impact olmeca project on block 31 in conclusion we are very happy with our 2018 results but we are already looking forward to 2019 and beyond we will continue to relentlessly execute on our operations and strategy of responsibly growing production at an appropriate pace that allows for the continued generation of positive free cash flow while diligently pursuing additional business development opportunities that fit our asset footprint and core competencies we believe this is only the beginning of the talos journey recent developments and operations update drilling and exploration activities deepwater helix producer 1 dry dock the hp 1 departed the shipyard on march 7 2019 after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the phoenix complex to re start on or about march 20 2019 resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the phoenix complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the phoenix complex was a known expected event after a period of sea trials talos expects production from the complex to re start on or about resulting in a total shut in period of 56 days the production impact of the shut in in the complex in the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be between 9 0 13 0 mboe d whereas the annualized impact for full year 2019 production is estimated to be between 2 0 3 0 mboe d this impact is already accounted for in our annual guidance as the shut in in the complex was a known expected event the tornado 3 well was drilled in december 2018 and is scheduled to begin completions operations in late march with an expected duration of 21 days the well is anticipated to commence production by early second quarter 2019 with an expected gross production rate between 10 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d or 5 0 mboe d 7 5 mboe d net to talos after royalties talos is the operator and owns a 65 working interest with kosmos energy owning the remaining 35 working interest the boris 3 well was spud in january 2019 and was drilled to a total depth of approximately 15 000 feet and logged approximately 75 feet gross and 56 feet net of true vertical pay 360 feet up dip of 27 mmboe of historical production in the b 4 sand boris 3 is scheduled to begin completion operations in mid april with an expected duration of 21 days and is expected to initiate production in the second quarter of 2019

signed a participation agreement with a subsidiary of enven corporation to drill the green canyon 21 bulleit prospect talos will be the operator and has an initial working interest of 66 7 in the lease bulleit is an amplitude supported pliocene prospect with similar seismic attributes to the analogous sand section in talos s green canyon 18 field which has produced approximately 39 mmboe to date talos expects to spud the well in the second quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the talos owned and operated green canyon 18 gc 18 facility approximately 10 miles away talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that bulleit has the potential to deliver initial production between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis orlov prospect talos has signed a participation agreement to engage in the drilling of the green canyon 200 orlov prospect fieldwood energy will be the operator and talos has a working interest of 30 in the prospect orlov is an amplitude supported miocene prospect with similar geophysical and structural attributes to the talos operated boris field which has produced approximately 27 mmboe to date talos expects the well to spud near the end of the first quarter of 2019 if successful the well would be completed and tied back to the fieldwood operated green canyon 158 bullwinkle facility talos anticipates first production within 12 18 months from spud date and estimates that orlov has the potential to deliver between 8 0 mboe d 15 0 mboe d gross on an unrisked basis mexico block 7 zama appraisal program as previously announced the zama 2 appraisal penetration was successfully and safely completed approximately 28 days ahead of schedule and 25 below projected costs the well confirmed a contiguous zama upper miocene sandstone interval thicker than the zama 1 discovery well and slightly thicker than the pre drill estimates for the zama 2 well with high quality rock properties analogous to upper miocene sands in the us gulf of mexico the zama 2 penetration also reached the oil water contact slightly deeper than the anticipated depth and consistent with our geophysical models preliminary pressure data indicates that the reservoir area around the zama 2 appraisal well is connected to the zama 1 discovery well and talos expects the zama 2 vertical sidetrack and the zama 3 wells will provide additional information about the reservoir connectivity and consistency the next step of the appraisal program is currently underway with an up dip vertical penetration in the zama reservoir from the main bore hole of the zama 2 well called the zama 2 st which has been cored and a drill stem test will be performed in the coming weeks the second appraisal well zama 3 will be drilled to the south of the original discovery well and will help delineate the reservoir continuity and quality in the southern part of the field and will be cored to better understand the reservoir geology block 2 and block 31 exploration program talos and its partners expect to drill two exploration wells in block 2 and two delineation wells in block 31 in 2019 in block 2 the well to test the acan prospect is expected to spud in the second quarter of 2019 in block 31 the olmeca 1 well is expected to be drilled in the second half of 2019 the olmeca complex has been significantly de risked by the xaxamani 1 well drilled by pemex in 2003 the 2019 drilling campaign will be to appraise the same geological structure initially tested by pemex and if successful a final investment decision to develop these assets could be reached in 2020 business development activities acquisition of the antrim discovery from exxonmobil on january 23 2019 talos and exxonmobil exxon executed an acquisition agreement through which talos acquired 100 interest in the antrim project in green canyon block 364 gc 364 exxon drilled an exploratory well in gc 364 in november 2017 that encountered hydrocarbons in a sub salt miocene reservoir and subsequently divested of the discovery well and the gc 364 lease to talos for further appraisal and a possible development talos plans to drill an additional well to further appraise the discovered resource the company is still developing a detailed timeline for the appraisal and development plan over the next few years with significant time ahead of the june 2025 lease expiration if the appraisal is successful talos is currently considering a tie back to the talos owned and operated gc 18 facility acquired from whistler in 2018 in addition to a nominal upfront cash consideration payment by talos exxon will receive an overriding royalty interest in the lease as well as a future cash payment upon the earlier of 30 days following the completion of drilling operations on the first well or by the end of the third quarter of 2020 gunflint acquisition on january 11 2019 talos acquired an approximate 9

pv 10 is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date before deducting future income taxes discounted at 10 percent we believe that the presentation of pv 10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties further investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties pv 10 however is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows our pv 10 measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves the following table provides a reconciliation of pv 10 of our proved reserves to the

such a party would contribute to the formation of a global demos a pluralist evolving political community of world citizens exercising political rights in a globalized public sphere shared problems require shared action the world economy and deepening global risks bind us together but we lack the collective global agency required to address them a sustainable global future will be impossible without a fundamental shift from the dominant national mythos to a global worldview and the concomitant creation of institutions with transformative political agency a world political party would be well suited to bring about such a shift although such a party will not materialize overnight it can emerge from the chrysalis of activism and experimentation already forming on the world stage the transnational democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 is a compelling experiment in this vein providing useful lessons for a world political party proper although the challenges to forming a transformative world party are profound the risks of inaction are grave and the rewards of success momentous party time we now understand how small our planet has become the local and global have become profoundly intertwined as our daily activities depend on the workings of the world economy common risks like ecological crises and weapons of mass destruction tie all our fates together despite such interconnectedness people s everyday experiences still differ greatly for example consider the contrasts between a day in the life of a high school teacher in finland a textile worker in china a ceo of a multinational corporation in brazil and a janitor in kenya a case study in lateral and vertical diversity their lives possibilities are interwoven and shaped by the global economy but in sharply divergent ways shared problems require shared action but to achieve collective agency on the global level disparate individuals must learn to see themselves and their daily lives as fundamentally connected to one another through common global structures processes and challenges such collective learning has the potential to politicize the world economy and the institutions that govern it rather than being treated as immutable these institutions can and must become the subject of political contestation both radically reforming existing institutions and building new ones must be on the agenda seeing the world system as malleable goes hand in hand with the quest for globalized political agency for advancing transformative visions of another world the roots of the contemporary quest go back to the formation of transnational political associations in the nineteenth century with the burgeoning peace and labour movements a century later in the 1960s and 1970s new movements for gender and racial equality nuclear disarmament and environmental justice sparked global organizing and activism in the 1980s economic globalization became an era defining issue then as the walls of the cold war came tumbling down and the internet eroded barriers to communication the concept of global civil society took hold to this day civil society carries the banner of transformative hope expressed through pursuit of peace justice democracy economic well being and ecological sustainability the growing organization and influence of global civil society can be seen in the human rights movement for example an international criminal court was first proposed in 1872 in response to the atrocities of the franco prussian war however the ngo coalition for an international criminal court icc which featured prominent human rights organizations was not founded until 1995 by the time the rome statute was adopted in july 1998 more than 800 organizations had joined the campaign in the early 2000s the number was more than one thousand the ultimate creation of the icc though noteworthy was an achievement tempered by the nonparticipation of china russia and the us among others and by accusations especially by african states that the court has been guilty of applying double standards in another arena civil society became a prominent bulwark against corporate driven globalization challenging the washington consensus and its policy agenda of trade liberalization deregulation privatization and fiscal austerity counter summits mass demonstrations and targeted campaigns resisted the power asymmetries injustices and environmental impacts of the corporate driven world economy global media made the protests of this alter globalization movement visible to people around the world the turn of the century saw the creation of a self consciously political expression of global civil society in the form of the world social forum wsf inaugurated in june 2001 with an international meeting of 12 000 activists in porto alegre brazil in the years that followed such global meetings grew larger and regional meetings were spawned providing a rolling series of vital platforms for interchange and networking among diverse civil society actors however the wsf has suffered from an internal contradiction between its promise to facilitate the transition to a better world and its central organizing principle of simply providing an open space political agency requires transformative capacity which a mere open space for discourse lacks because the wsf has remained hesitant to move into the realm of action interest has waned leaving the wsf s future fragile and uncertain without an overarching framework fostering solidarity shared vision and synergistic action civil society remains fragmented across a plethora of organizations issues and places those who grasp the character and peril of planetary interconnectedness understand the need for new transnational agents and institutions that can tackle global ecological economic and security challenges the times call for the creation of a world political party wpp an open ethico political association in pursuit of a broad program of societal reorganization on a global scale a wpp offers the most promise for fostering political coherence in civil society for many reasons a detailed blueprint for a wpp is neither advisable nor possible yet we can explore the broad contours of a diverse democratic global political formation any process for advancing new institutional arrangements to be legitimate needs to be responsive to all significantly affected actors and thus robustly democratic theory and practice must align transformative practice itself must thus embrace adaptive learning seek democratic consensus and have the capacity for collective decision making meeting these desiderata takes us far beyond open space venues like the wsf and single issue civil society arenas skepticism about the feasibility of a world political party is understandable especially in light of the discontent with political parties in national contexts across the world major parties have become post democratic as private money rules in politics and power is increasingly concentrated in a narrow elite 1 often the anti elite backlash has been nationalist xenophobic and authoritarian many countries especially in eastern europe latin america asia and africa are sliding towards full scale authoritarianism 2 a viable wpp must be able to respond to the moral and political criticism of existing national parties while cultivating a democratic ethos within global civil society and exercising effective political agency such broad based political capability presupposes the emergence of public consciousness rooted in shared elements of a wider and deeper worldview this evolution in turn fosters the willingness to engage in collective processes to build trust and commitment a world party cannot be created overnight but rather can emerge out of today s activism and experimentation in the context of intensifying global crises one instructive experiment is the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 diem25 s successes and failures provide critical lessons for forging organs of collective agency beyond one continent the shape of a new formation the earliest analogues for a new world party are the socialist internationals of the nineteenth and early twentieth century marx and engels s declaration of proletarians of all countries unite helped inspire the international workingmen s association or first international in the years before world war i socialist and labour parties joined together in the second international then after the russian revolution the soviet union formed the third international or comintern as a vehicle for controlling communist parties worldwide in parallel organizations such as the industrial workers of the world saw themselves as part of a global organizing project captured in the iww s vision of the obu one big union the reformist postwar socialist international a descendent of the second international still exists but its constituent social democratic parties lack the sense of solidarity and collective agency of their predecessors the top down character of an organization like the comintern would certainly meet strong opposition in a contemporary civil society culture skeptical of hierarchy recognition of equality is part and parcel of human collective learning the prolific english writer h g wells presaged a better way exploring the idea of a wpp in essays and novels with the 1928 the open conspiracy his most daring effort 3 rather than a centrally organized party wells s open conspiracy comprised a mass movement united by a humanistic faith and understanding of the world the diverse set of actors in this movement party could he argued collectively forge a rational and democratic world republic in the late 1990s and early 2000s amid lively discussions about the meaning and future of the alter globalization movement michael hardt and antonio negri developed the idea of a multitude a complex network of a plurality of actors in part inspired by the experiences of the alter globalization movements in part a modern substitute for the marxist working class this concept bears some resemblance to wells s open conspiracy indeed wells too used the term multitude like wells hardt and negri developed these ideas in response to the global problem of war arguing that the war on terror waged against a largely unspecified enemy served to justify and reinforce great power domination however the global governance reforms hardt and negri espouse are quite modest with a global currency transaction tax the most far reaching proposal 4 the war on terror in 2001 and the opposition to it proved to be a turning point sidelining the alter globalization movement another turning point was the global financial crisis of 2008 9 which increased the socioeconomic insecurity and anxiety of people everywhere 5 in the years since wage stagnation unemployment growth and skyrocketing inequality have undermined social stability while the concentration of capital has eroded democratic institutions enabling a moneyed elite to rig economic and political systems this inequality and instability in turn have fanned the flames of resurgent nationalist populism a far sighted response to the contemporary crisis would be to build a world political party such a party would contribute to the formation of a global demos best seen as a pluralist evolving political community of world citizens exercising political rights in a globalized public sphere a wpp would welcome a range of different ideological agendas concerning how common global institutions might best be organized the party would constitute a transnational public sphere where the sufficiently like minded i e members of the party could freely debate issues and make collective decisions the raison d être of the party lies in advancing new institutional forms for organizing the planetary public realm a nascent world party would spawn nodes at different levels and contexts each attuned to salient issues at its level within an overarching global perspective and strategy the various chapters would share a core program while maintaining their autonomy adopting additional planks into their platform as appropriate provided that they resonate with the overall agenda within this complex transformative agency balance would be sought between pluralism and unity cultivating a sense of mutuality trust and sensitivity among diverse participants is key to developing a viable global political community and public sphere collective learning and cosmopolitanism although ancient greek city states had cliques and parties of opinion the contemporary understanding of political parties is rather recent until early european modernity the metaphor of a body politic dominated the political imagination in this view a conflict or contradiction in one organism or body is not considered healthy organized political parties emerged only when this metaphor was replaced by the more individualistic idea of the social contract today as a result of effectual collective learning processes rules are no longer treated as external to individual actors and thus sacred or unassailable but rather as the product of free mutual agreement of individuals endowed with autonomous consciousness this form of collective discourse first emerged in some ancient small city states typically among free males but was repressed by large scale military agrarian empires the demand for equality re emerged in a more radical form in complex large scale society with modern political revolutions in the context of modernity new ideas such as human rights and the rule of law became part of social reality notably the trial of louis xvi marked a break with the mythological view of the monarchy s power and the ascent of the understanding of citizens as autonomous actors with the right to revise prevailing rules and laws for the girondists the king no longer embodied the law but rather was subject to it just like any other citizen all citizens are equally bound by the law 6 the historical process of collective learning points towards cosmopolitan moral sentiments in higher stages of reasoning individuals gain an understanding that morality and ethico political principles must have validity and application apart from both the authority of the groups or persons holding these principles and the individual s own identification with particular groups or institutions such is the moral foundation of world citizenship of course the movement toward cosmopolitanism is hardly inevitable and not all social learning is progressive past lessons can be forgotten and change can be regressive undermining future learning economic uncertainty can amplify existential insecurity and anxiety triggering regressive learning religion and nationalism can provide channels for diverting resentment and angst originating in socioeconomic conditions asymmetric power relations can undermine the learning process as well by steering public consciousness towards perspectives that serve particular identities interests or elites pushing back against such tendencies a central aim of a wpp would be to nurture positive learning that creates a public more receptive to pluralist cosmopolitanism this requires strategies for shaping the economic and social conditions that support individual and collective learning and improving the skills and knowledge required for effective participation in the learning process educating the public about global affairs is essential for developing a collective democratic culture and deeper engagement in the global public realm much of our thinking is unconscious which further complicates learning processes thinking is based on prototypes framings and metaphors that are seldom explicit this background is the source of common sense views of how we connect and interact and what our expectations are of one another and outsiders underlying normative ideas and images generate manifold stories about who we are where we come from and where we are heading a problem for a global political party is that compared to the rich poetics of national myths and narratives cosmopolitan prototypes metaphors framings and stories remain rather thin a promising way to counter parochial ideologies is to situate the contemporary problematique within a macro view of cosmological biological and social evolution this big history approach both expands our understanding of where we are and visions of where we want to go a sweeping narrative can motivate transformative and progressive politics in the twenty first century 7 the point of departure of big history is that our common human capacities have emerged from the evolution of life itself an emergent layer of cosmological unfolding a sweeping framework puts into context and underscores the import of the anthropocene the new geological age defined by the human impact on the whole earth big history encourages narratives and values with a sense of global belonging the earth as our common home in the cosmos this broad panorama suggests a new slogan think cosmically act globally diem25 a seed crystal can we see rumblings of a wpp today perhaps future historians will look back to many precursors now in play one promising contemporary initiative is the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 established in early 2016 in the aftermath of the euro crisis diem25 has assumed many of the characteristics of a wpp as such it offers an invaluable testbed for cultivating transnational ethical and political consciousness deploying new technologies to enable widespread participation overcoming legal obstacles to a supranational political party and transcending identity political fragmentation following the 2015 defeat of the greek left wing party syriza in its struggle against the troika the international monetary fund european central bank and eu commission greek minister of finance yanis varoufakis resigned subsequent political meetings in france and germany convinced him of the need to band together regardless of nationality and transcend the divide between debtor and creditor countries the solution was clear a new pan european political movement to prevent a descent into a post modern 1930s 8 to advance this aim diem25 s strategy is to convene a constitutional assembly that would reflect a genuine european democracy it intends to have a draft constitution prepared by 2025 that if adopted would replace all existing european treaties beyond this process the movement strives to overcome austerity and harmful competition in europe with concrete policy proposals including the dedication of 500 billion euros per year to green investment and industrial conversion a european anti poverty plan a universal basic income financed by a public percentage of companies profits and a common and humane migration policy 9 rather than adhering to a single political ideology diem25 is resolutely pluralistic aiming to attract a broad spectrum of progressives whether leftists social democrats greens or liberals participants are united in their dissatisfaction with europe s economic and political establishment and in their advocacy for a government by the people of europe in contrast to the authoritarian nationalistic populisms on the rise throughout europe diem25 exemplifies a form of democratic transnational populism its concept of we is a pan european demos that transcends national identity diem25 s inclusionary transnationalism manifests in the common front it is building for political activism but the movement enacts transnationalism in another sense its commitment to helping the most vulnerable people in the global political economy especially refugees 10 as stated in its manifesto diem25 aspires to an open europe that is alive to ideas people and inspiration from all over the world recognizing fences and borders as signs of weakness spreading insecurity in the name of security 11 the movement thus offers a clear alternative to fortress europe not surprisingly given diem25 s expansive political philosophy its participants are not exclusively european joining many well known european intellectuals are visible international figures such as julian assange and noam chomsky the members of the coordinating collective that organizes and integrates diem25 s actions have wide international experience including in the peace movement the icc campaign occupy and the world social forum diem25 has some 100 000 members mostly in europe but from other continents as well along with eight national collectives and a hundred ad hoc collectives around the world although more a movement than a political party for now it will be presenting a list for the 2019 european parliament elections dubbing the effort the european spring this first progressive transnational list ever includes both candidates directly chosen by diem25 and candidates nominated by diem25 to appear on the slates of conventional parties this selection process as with all diem25 s work relies on modern it technology to facilitate discussion among dispersed members in parallel with in person meetings and events across europe in spite of such mobilization diem25 has yet to become a high profile actor in european politics its membership and budget remain small compared to those of the major national political parties and the mainstream media largely ignores its activities and positions even after years of decline germany s christian democratic union for instance commands a budget of tens of millions of euros per year while diem25 s is less than a half million given its limited resources diem25 s near term electoral success will likely be modest at best nevertheless as it evolves and grows it could become a model or beyond a seed germinating future world political parties where we are while we live longer and value life more highly than ever the world as a whole faces decades of unprecedented problems the global economic crisis of 2008 2009 and the subsequent euro crisis are only one indication of how the fates of different countries and regions have become more and more intertwined the conditions of everyday activities of all people are directly or indirectly affected by how the world economy works or does not work the next global crisis will have far reaching consequences the challenge then how to reach the teacher textile worker and janitor to name a few with the vision and message to convey how a wpp can serve their needs and interests perhaps the most serious immediate threat concerns the danger of global war and especially nuclear war both the escalation of the conflict between russia and the west and the confrontations in the south china sea show that questions of global political economy and security have still not been answered on a sustainable footing similarly climate change is a key part of a new geological era the anthropocene in which human action is transforming the composition and processes of the biosphere the expansion of human society has led among other things to the mass destruction of habitats species and whole ecosystems this devolution continues at an accelerating pace carrying threats to global civilization the concept of world risk society helps situate our task 12 the current epoch in this conceptualization is the second phase of modernization in which actors and movements begin to respond to the problems generated by the consequences of the first phase the primary feature of this new phase is the emergence of a common world with no outside and no exit societal risks demand that we acknowledge the real dangers and threats we confront at the same time these risks contain a collective condition and power that creates new ethical political and technological opportunities for shaping futures to sustain us and new modernities to dream by as humankind is thrilled by scientific discoveries of new planets with the possibility of extraterrestrial life we become increasingly aware of the peril our technological civilization poses for the future of life right here on earth human curiosity about our place in the cosmos and the awareness of the great ethical political choices before us demand a new phase of collective learning and promotion of practices and institutions matched to our common challenge our ability to secure a sustainable global future depends on a fundamental shift from the currently dominant national mythos to a global imaginary the mechanisms and processes of collective learning through institutional change differ from those of individual growth collective learning and institutional change require politically capable transformative actors practical and political problems can be overcome by building better common institutions the world political party envisaged in this essay embraces this grand task 13 as wells proclaimed almost a century ago way ahead of his time the alternative before man now is either magnificence of spirit and magnificence of achievement or disaster the choice could not be clearer today the future we want is one that removes constraints on human well being and enables human flourishing navigating history towards collective self determination on this planet and one day perhaps beyond it will take bold transformative practice in our troubled world the need for global transformative agency is greater than ever the future is not yet settled and the path there depends on the choices we make our expectations become a feedback loop in the making of the future pessimists argue that a series of limited scale crises or wars or a full global catastrophe must erupt before a significant force can coalesce for rational peaceful and democratic transformations of global governance however likely that view we cannot stand passively by until crises explode before working for social transformation if and when a window of opportunity opens the capacity for such action must already have been established the time has come then to devote our efforts to building a world party as an overarching organizational expression of global citizens power heikki patomäki is

an increase of 39 compared to 34 5 million in the prior year comparative quarter and for the year ended 2018 was 161 7 million compared to 125 4 million in the prior year an increase of 29 adjusted ebitda margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26 8 compared to 26 2 in the prior year quarter and for the year ended 2018 was 26 3 compared to 25 2 in the prior year improvements in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin were driven by revenue growth higher hydrovac utilization and improved labour efficiency badger realized record revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 178 6 million 35 higher compared to 132 1 million for the same period in 2017 record revenues were driven by revenue growth in the u s of 40 with revenue of us 105 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 while revenue in canada of 38 9 million was 8 higher than the prior year comparative quarter average hydrovac rates for the fourth quarter were consistent to modestly higher across both the u s and canadian markets compared to the same period in 2017 badger s investment in sales and marketing continues to contribute to the ongoing growth in revenue particularly within the u s operations where the opportunity for further market penetration in both new and existing markets exists as a result of hydrovac being an underutilized component of the excavation value chain in many parts of the u s revenue growth particularly in the u s operations was attributable to increased demand for hydrovac services from both new and existing customers due in part to the continued growth in the adoption of hydrovac technology combined with revenues related to emergency response work as a result of hurricane michael and the california wildfires fourth quarter revenue related to emergency response work was approximately 20 0 million the impact of which was partially offset by a fourth quarter bad debt provision of 5 3 million the majority of which relates to a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by a large utility customer for work performed related to the california wildfires rpt for the fourth quarter was 37 837 or 19 higher compared to 31 921 for the same period in 2017 and for the year ended 2018 was 34 347 or 13 higher compared to 30 266 in the prior year badger successfully increased rpt for both the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 while at the same time adding a net 14 hydrovacs in the quarter and a net 112 hydrovacs for the year the improvements in rpt were driven by a combination of revenue growth including the impact of emergency response work and improved fleet utilization badger s operational scale and its importance in driving fleet utilization was evident in badger s fourth quarter revenues and rpt with both financial measures benefiting from badger s operating scale badger s extensive operating scale provided the ability to respond to significant customer demand related to emergency response activities as noted above badger had 1 221 hydrovacs in operation at december 31 2018 compared to 1 109 as at december 31 2017 badger continues to actively manage direct operating costs in particular direct labour resulting in an improvement in badger s gross profit margin to 31 5 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 31 1 in the prior year comparative quarter direct operating costs as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter were 68 5 compared to 68 9 in the prior year quarter in addition to improved labour efficiency margins also benefited from modestly higher average pricing due to the ongoing implementation of strategic pricing initiatives the impacts of which more than offset higher bad debts badger continues to focus on ensuring services rates are reflective of both the total value proposition badger s services provide and local market conditions the improvement in gross profit margin is a testament to the focus of badger s operations team on managing direct operating costs and selling prices as initially announced in the second quarter of 2018 badger has initiated a process to upgrade and standardize its legacy information technology systems into a single enterprise resource planning erp system the common business platform during the fourth quarter activities related to the common business platform were primarily focused on business process redesign and the related configuration and integration into the erp platform the

share per month or 0 57 per common share annualized from the current rate of 0 045 per common share per month or 0 54 per common share annualized badger continues to maintain a strong balance sheet as at december 31 2018 there were no amounts drawn on its syndicated revolving credit facility providing the flexibility to facilitate ongoing growth in the business badger s total debt less cash and cash equivalents was 54 0 million at december 31 2018 with a corresponding total debt less cash and cash equivalents to compliance ebitda ratio of 0 4x 2019 financial outlook based on existing and forecasted activity levels badger anticipates that its 2019 adjusted ebitda will be in the range of 170 to 190 million with a hydrovac build of between 190 to 220 units and retirements of 40 to 60 units which is consistent with the 2019 financial outlook provided in the third quarter of 2018 continued growth in badger s end use markets and geographic areas has resulted in an increase in revenue and improved fleet utilization as evidenced by improved financial results and a higher realized rpt in 2018 badger anticipates continued growth in revenues in 2019 with gross profit margin for 2019 to be similar to 2018 rpt for 2019 is anticipated to be modestly lower than in 2018 particularly in the u s operations as 22 5 million of emergency response work completed during the third and fourth quarter of 2018 resulted in an increase to badger s 2018 rpt emergency response work related to natural disasters is not possible to predict and may not recur in 2019 badger s 2019 financial outlook assumes that badger will continue to realize ongoing growth in the use of hydrovac for non destructive excavation as a result of continued customer adoption particularly in its u s markets badger expects to see improvements in revenue as a result of the scale of its extensive branch network combined with the ongoing benefits of sales and marketing related activities the overall macro economic environment in both the u s and canada is anticipated to be supportive of ongoing infrastructure and construction activity levels for 2019 oil and gas activity levels are anticipated to be consistent with 2018 levels within badger s u s operations but weaker in canada in 2019 compared to 2018 badger continues to see organic growth opportunities in the majority of its markets although the ability to capture these opportunities may be partially limited by the availability of trained operators as the market for labour particularly in certain oil and gas focused regions continues to be challenging badger s 2018 adjusted ebitda of 161 7 million was modestly higher than the 2018 financial outlook provided in the third quarter of 2018 of 150 to 160 million the improvement compared to the previously provided financial outlook was due to stronger than anticipated customer activity levels throughout the fourth quarter due in part to the impact of emergency response work related to hurricane michael and the california wildfires during 2018 badger placed 191 new hydrovacs into service while retiring 79 units both of which were consistent with the outlook previously provided by badger badger remains focused on generating profitable long term sustainable growth to drive total shareholder returns in that light during 2017 and 2018 substantial progress was made towards meeting the strategic milestones that were established in late 2016 significant progress has been made in meeting the objectives to i double the u s business from fiscal 2016 levels over a period of 3 to 5 years ii grow adjusted ebitda by a minimum of 15 per year iii target adjusted ebitda margins of 28 to 29 and iv drive fleet utilization and revenue per truck per month above 30 000 although the adjusted ebitda margin for 2018 of 26 3 was below the longer term objective of 28 to 29 it was a 110 basis point increase over 2017 badger remains focused on business improvement activities to drive further margin improvements over the next several years badger s record financial performance in 2018 is a testament to the strength of badger s unique business model conference call to discuss 2018

from period to period based upon a variety of factors including but not limited to the timing and amount of investments new leases repayments and asset sales capital raised use of leverage changes in

appraisal a number of the properties were valued using the special assumption that such properties would be purchased through a tax efficient special purpose vehicle and is therefore subject to lower purchaser transaction expenses if one or more assumptions are incorrect the value may be materially lower than the appraised value endnotes 1 the external third party valuation was prepared by cushman wakefield llp in accordance with the current u k and global edition of the royal institution of chartered surveyors rics valuation professional standards the red book on the basis of fair value which is widely recognized within europe as the leading professional standards for independent valuation professionals each property is classified as an investment and has been valued on the basis of fair value adopted by the international accounting standards board this is the equivalent to the red book definition of market value the red book defines market value as the estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm s length transaction after proper marketing where the parties had each acted

islamic finance products in mauritius are not regulated any differently from conventional instruments and existing legislation and regulations apply the mauritius approach has been to ensure a level

country the fund was well accepted by the muslim community it was designed specifically for muslims with the prime intention of avoiding riba it did not require any marketing strategy to convince the muslim depositors the number of investors grew exponentially during the first year which was reflected by an increasing amount of total deposits up to 70 million mauritius rupees the fund was mainly invested in properties and assets for trade the business transactions went smoothly until the depositors started claiming back their money the problem started when the organisation was unable to repay its short term investment and respond to investors demand for early withdrawals the funds were mobilised in properties and assets that could not be retrieved on demand the local authority had to intervene for an investigation prior to the regulatory changes other initiatives to offer shariah compliant products included microfinancing by al barakah multi purpose co operative society limited and ethical investment such as the authorized long term ethical equity fund against the backdrop of global drivers of islamic finance and the sanctions imposed after the 11 september 2001 attacks the government responded to seize opportunities from the growing world of islamic finance and the petro dollar islamic wealth in august 2007 a steering committee including among others the two main regulatory institutions the bom and the financial services commission started working on the subject this led to the first of many legislative measures introduced by parliament the banking act 2004 was amended in 2007 to include islamic banking business in the banks services the mauritius government recognises that given the nature and structure of islamic financial products they tend to attract more tax than their counterparts the overall policy approach was to align the tax treatment of islamic contracts with the treatment of conventional financing contracts for a level playing field in line with this policy the finance bill 2009 included several changes and waived the imposition of double stamp duties in islamic transactions involving real estate and moveable property in the same year the bom became a full member of the islamic financial services board ifsb while the financial services commission opted for associate membership the country is therefore the second non islamic country after singapore to join the ifsb in 2011 the bom made another leap to join the international islamic liquidity management corporation in the same year the mauritius revenue authority issued a statement of practice for murabahah to avoid double value added taxes vat the most unanticipated change in the law was the amendment of the public debt management act 2008 section 3 a of the act stipulates the minister may enter into such agreement sell purchase or otherwise acquire any immovable property or any right therein lease movable or immovable property and generally engage in such transactions and perform such activities as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of issuing sovereign sukuks in mauritius it may be concluded that the most appropriate sukuk structure in the above clause to be issued is the sukuk al ijarah meanwhile new actors products and services started to emerge in the market in 2008 the british american investment launched its islamic life insurance takaful and mauritius leasing ltd offered ijarah within its line of products and services in 2009 hsbc bank mauritius which solely operates as an offshore bank launched an islamic window under the worldwide hsbc amanah brand in may 2009 in 2011 century banking corporation a joint venture between british american investment a locally based company and domasol a malta based company began its operations as the first islamic investment bank in march 2011 while the wealth management unit of the domestic hongkong and shanghai banking corporation ltd started to distribute the shariah global equity fund in the local market hsbc 2012 the islamic window hsbc amanah ceased operation in june 2012 to further drive the islamic finance industry in mauritius the bom hosted the 11th islamic financial services summit in may 2014 in the same month habib bank ltd announced its islamic window operation alongside its existing banking business although every licensed bank is deemed to offer islamic banking services through window operation the bom revised habib bank ltd s banking licence which provides a note for islamic window legislation what is the main legislation relevant to islamic banking capital markets and insurance since 2007 there has been a series of changes in the laws of mauritius and initiatives to promote the island as an international financial centre with islamic financial products in the wake of the amendments brought to the banking act 2004 for the introduction of islamic finance in mauritius in june 2008 the bom published the guideline for institutions conducting islamic banking business the guideline the guideline which is applicable to both fully fledged islamic banks and window operations sets out the broad parameters within which islamic banking business is to be conducted in mauritius there is no specific islamic legislation addressing islamic capital markets and takaful which are subject to general finance laws in particular the securities act 2005 insurance act 2005 the captive insurance act 2015 and relevant rules and regulations enacted under the said laws islamic finance transactions are subject to the same tax treatment that applies to their corresponding conventional instruments certain changes have been made to the laws for example the registration duty act and stamp duty act now waive the levy of multiple payments of duties on financing movable and immovable assets under the islamic finance mode the income tax act equates interests with effective return of islamic financing arrangements amendments to the laws have also removed restrictions on purchase and sale of immovable property and on investment in undertakings or joint ventures insofar as accounting standards and financial reporting are concerned the islamic finance institutions are required to take cognisance of the set of standards issued by the accounting and auditing organisation for islamic financial institutions concerning risk management the bank of mauritius requires that appropriate risk management processes be put in place and that the investment strategy of the islamic finance institution gives due consideration to the risk profile of the financial instrument transparency and disclosure of material information are further principles that the islamic financial institution must abide by supervision principal authorities which are the principal authorities charged with the oversight of banking capital markets and insurance products the banking sector is regulated by the bom whereas capital markets global business companies offshore and insurance sectors are regulated by the financial services commission fsc as an attempt to make the island more competitive and a friendly financial sector the banking act 2004 was amended whereby investment banking business will not fall under the category of banks anymore but will instead be regulated solely by the fsc guidance identify any notable guidance policy statements or regulations issued by the regulators or other authorities specifically relevant to islamic finance at present only the bom has issued specific guidelines in respect of islamic finance in the form of the guideline and the mauritius revenue authority issued a statement of practice for murabahah to avoid vat islamic banks are allowed to adopt the aaoiif accounting standards central authority is there a central authority responsible for ensuring that transactions or products are shariah compliant are ifis required to set up shariah supervisory boards may third parties related parties or fund sponsors provide supervisory board services or must the board be internal as per the guideline it was initially allowed as an interim measure for all islamic banking institutions ibis to have a common shariah advisory board sab of at least three members the set up of the common sab was under the responsibility of the mauritius bankers association which was not formally established an ibi has also the alternative to appoint a shariah adviser with experience in shariah advisory practice the guideline is silent on parties who are eligible to provide sab services to the ibi as long as they meet the eligibility criteria and receive the prior approval of the bom the two islamic financial institutions century banking corporation ltd and habib bank ltd have opted for shariah advisers up until now there has been no central authority responsible for ensuring that transactions or products are shariah compliant in mauritius although the guideline provides for an honorary shariah adviser the bom does not intend to undertake any ex ante review of the financial products to be offered by an ibi for the conformity of these products with shariah principles as laid down by article 19 of the guideline board approval do members of an institution s shariah supervisory board require regulatory approval are there any other requirements for supervisory board members the appointment of members of an sab or a shariah adviser is subject to approval of the bom the guideline also provides that if the appointment of an sab or a shariah adviser has been approved by another regulator abroad the bank of mauritius may choose to abide by this approval the eligibility criteria for appointment as a member of an sab or a shariah adviser is an individual with proven experience or knowledge in the delivery of shariah rulings and issuing scholarly opinions on matters of islamic law he or she may be a local or foreign scholar of the highest integrity honesty and ethical reliability each member is also required to pass the fit and proper person test prescribed in section 3 2 of the guideline on fit and proper person criteria issued by the bom authorisation what are the requirements for islamic banks to be authorised to carry out business in your jurisdiction under the banking act 2004 it is an offence for a person to engage in banking business or islamic banking business in mauritius without a banking licence issued by the central bank the requirements for islamic banks to carry out business are the same as any conventional banks except that islamic banks will comply with the guideline and guiding notes related to islamic banking businesses foreign involvement may foreign institutions offer islamic banking and capital markets services in your jurisdiction under what conditions by default any foreign institution holding a banking licence is entitled to provide islamic banking however it is mandatory that such activities are done through a window operation completely segregated from the conventional activities the minimum capital requirement of 400 million mauritius rupees will apply in aggregate to the bank and its islamic window a foreign institution may also apply for a fully fledged islamic banking licence where the minimum capital requirement is applicable and it shall only carry out islamic banking business for offers in the capital markets any foreign institutions may offer after having the approval from the fsc takaful and retakaful operators what are the requirements for takaful and retakaful operators to gain admission to do business in your jurisdiction the fsc governs the regulatory and supervisory regime for the non bank financial services and global business sector in mauritius the fsc established in 2001 is mandated under the financial services act 2007 and has as enabling legislation the securities act 2005 the insurance act 2005 the private pension schemes act 2012 and the captive insurance act 2015 to license regulate monitor and supervise the conduct of business activities in these sectors the insurance act 2005 provides that no person or corporation shall carry on or hold himself herself or itself out as carrying on insurance business of any category or class in or from within mauritius except under the authority of a licence issued by the fsc under section 11 in respect of that category or class of insurance business article 7 1 of the insurance act 2005 effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance which would include takaful and retakaful is therefore a regulated activity which is governed by the insurance act 2005 the licensing requirements for takaful and retakaful operators in mauritius would be the same as those that apply to conventional insurance and reinsurance companies under the insurance act 2005 foreign operators how can foreign takaful operators become admitted can foreign takaful or retakaful operators carry out business in your jurisdiction as non admitted insurers is fronting a possibility a foreign insurance operator can only be admitted in mauritius either as a branch or as a registered legal entity such as a subsidiary subject to the relevant licence obtained under the insurance act 2005 concerning the minimum capital requirement this will depend on the type of insurance business for long term insurance business it is the higher of a stress test requirement determined in accordance with guidelines issued by the fsc to ensure that the long term insurer remains solvent or the higher of an amount of 25 million mauritius rupees or an amount representing 13 weeks operating expenses for general insurance business the minimum capital requirement is the sum of capital required for balance sheet assets capital required for investment above concentration limit capital required for policy liabilities capital required for catastrophes and capital required for reinsurance ceded as calculated under the insurance solvency rules disclosure and reporting are there any specific disclosure or reporting requirements for takaful sukuk and islamic funds there are no specific disclosures or reporting requirements pertaining to takaful sukuk and islamic funds all will be similar to their non islamic counterparts sanctions and remedies what are the sanctions and remedies available when products have been falsely marketed as shariah compliant there are no specific sanctions that may be imposed in respect of a falsely marketed shariah product penalties may be levied against an ibi if it has been in non compliance of banking regulations and guidelines however the resulting reputational risk is much greater if regulators issue a public notice confirming such misrepresentations further investors are always entitled to sue under civil law for such misrepresentation in extreme cases licences may be revoked in the event of serious breach to the banking licence conditions jurisdiction in disputes which courts tribunals or other bodies have jurisdiction to hear islamic finance disputes there are no courts tribunals or other bodies having the jurisdiction to hear islamic finance disputes the courts of law of mauritius are the only recourse in the case of a dispute the courts in mauritius will give effect to any arbitration clause chosen by the parties and the parties can have recourse to the privy council in england which is the ultimate court of appeal contracting concepts accommodation of concepts mudarabah profit sharing partnership separating responsibility for capital investment and management the entry into a mudarabah arrangement is acceptable for a mauritius entity or person as it would be treated as akin to a partnership arrangement wherein the investor rab al mal contributes the capital and the recipient mudarib provides professional or managerial expertise to carry out the venture to earn a profit that is shared between the rab al mal and the mudarib in accordance with an agreed ratio the mudarabah agreement akin to a partnership would be governed by the mauritian civil code title 9 the company and the association murabahah cost plus profit agreement murabahah transactions can generally be implemented under mauritian law there is no restriction for islamic banks on the use of this islamic financial instrument in the mauritian jurisdiction following double taxation issues relating to murabahah transactions the mauritius revenue authority published a statement of standard practice sp5 10 in april 2010 this practice note addresses several issues namely the clear definition of murabahah as being a financing facility and the profit margin being equivocal to the interest element under conventional finance this new legislation has the effect of treating the profit as interest payable during the period of the loan and hence qualifying for a vat exemption the murabahah transaction is discharged of the vat obligation owing to its similarity to a financial transaction as per sp 5 10 3 the bank can demand collateral in accordance with article 28 3 of the banking act 2004 which stipulates that any transaction with any related party involving credit has to be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral required as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons however this may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unusual features musharakah profit sharing joint venture partnership agreement it is permissible for a mauritius entity or person to enter into a musha rakah arrangement as it is akin to a joint venture or partnership arrangement however care should be taken to determine whether the musharakah arrangement could fall within the broad definition of collective investment scheme under the securities act 2005 to the extent that the musharakah arrangement is considered a collective investment scheme the ifi requires authorisation from the fsc under part viii article 97 of the securities act 2005 a collective investment scheme authorised under the securities act 2005 shall pay income tax on its chargeable income at the rate specified in part ii of the first schedule of the act ijarah lease to own agreement ijarah generally refers to an operating lease banks in mauritius are not allowed to carry out operating leases in accordance with article 30 3a of the banking act 2004 ifis can only carry out finance leases which are equivalent to ijarah munthahiyah bi tamlik lease ending in ownership the law on leasing is incorporated in the mauritian civil code after article 1831 title 8 bis entitled of leasing and financial rentals a clear distinction is drawn between leasing which by essence includes an option to buy and financial leasing where such an option does not exist provisions on leasing regulate the leasing of movable and immovable property leasing can be resorted to in respect of immovable property only for operations leasing commercial property provisions on financial leasing regulate the lease of movable property intended for professional use only wadiah safekeeping agreement article 93 of the banking act 2004 lays the foundation for deposit insurance schemes which serves the purpose of providing insurance against partial or complete loss of deposits in a bank with the view of contributing to the stability of the mauritian financial system and minimising exposure to loss deposit insurance schemes guarantee depositors and depositors do not take any risk in cases where their deposits are insured the concept of risk is minimised if not eliminated completely with deposit insurance schemes depending on the type of deposits covered and the ceiling of coverage returns are positively correlated with risk and as risk is quite low with guaranteed deposits such accounts are rewarded with relatively low returns the general obligation of good faith exists under the mauritian civil code articles 16 and 17 16 everyone is required to exercise their rights and perform their duties under the requirements of good faith 17 no person shall have the right to harm others or to harm out of proportion to the benefit they may withdraw products securities structuring sukuk islamic securities have sukuk or other islamic securities been structured and issued in your jurisdiction to comply with islamic principles such as the prohibition of interest at present there are no sukuk listed on the mauritius stock exchange or issued for the domestic market in mauritius the requirements in relation to listings of sukuk on the official listing and development enterprise of mauritius are governed by listing rules issued by the mauritius stock exchange which are similar to a bond chapter 8 part b specialist debt securities of the listing rules caters for qualified investors whereas chapters 6 and 9 of the listing rules provide the necessary conditions for the listing of debt securities for subscription by the general public to take advantage of certain tax efficiencies the mauritius global market is an ideal location for setting up a special purpose vehicle spv as the user in a sukuk transaction an spv can be set up in mauritius as a company holding a global business licence gbl or as a trust a gbl holder is a tax resident in mauritius who can enjoy the full advantages of the double taxation treaties signed by mauritius a recent example 2012 of an spv from the local jurisdiction is the islamic medium note sukuk murabahah programme of up to 5 billion malaysian ringgit based on the shariah principle of the murabahah via tawarruq arrangement furthermore the mauritius budget 2016 has also provided a five year tax holiday to asset and fund managers with a mini mum capital base of us 100 million which offers great prospects for international shariah funds legal position what is the legal position of sukuk holders in an insolvency or a restructuring are sukuk instruments viewed as equity or debt instruments have there been any court decisions or legislation declaring whether sukuk holders are deemed to own the underlying assets sukuk has various structures which will be subject to variations in their classifications for insolvency tax and regulatory purposes however typically sukuk are structured to have the same economic effect as conventional bonds explaining the islamic bond appellation in the market and are treated as such for international financial reporting standards ifrs purposes in an insolvency involving the issuer sukuk holders are in a similar position to that of their conventional counterparts in that sukuk holders would have a debt claim against the issuer for the outstanding face amount of their respective certificates the treatment of sukuk as equity or debt instruments is dependent upon their structure and the risks and rewards of the sukuk in particular whether the sukuk are asset based or asset backed could affect this analysis it is often the case that from the originator s perspective the sukuk are shown as a financial liability on its balance sheet because it retains control over the issuer entity from the sukuk holder s perspective the holding would need to be classified into certain categories such as an instrument held to maturity or a loan and receivable legislation now provides that where certain conditions are satisfied the return paid to sukuk holders is tax deductible by the issuer consistent with the treatment afforded to conventional bondholders there have been no court decisions nor has there been legislation declaring whether sukuk holders are deemed to own the underlying assets insurance takaful islamic insurance are there any conventional cooperative or mutual insurance vehicles that are or could be adapted to be shariah compliant there are no conventional cooperative or mutual insurance vehicles that could be adapted to be shariah compliant takaful insurance may be implemented for conglomerates that also have an insurance company within their group for instance some muslim conglomerates have the potential to provide takaful to their group but owing to lack of expertise have not pursued such a route which lines of insurance are currently covered in the takaful market is takaful typically ceded to conventional reinsurers or is retakaful common in practice takaful has not represented a meaningful portion of the market since its launch in 2008 by a life insurer the response of the market was not positive and the life insurer has not implemented measures to promote such a product reinsurance typically applies to policies exceeding a particular amount however it is fair to say that reinsurance is not applicable for such amounts miscellaneous regulatory obstacles what are the principal regulatory obstacles facing the islamic finance industry in your jurisdiction there are no substantial regulatory hurdles for the islamic finance industry in mauritius however the following restrictions are worth noting the civil code of mauritius provides that the selling of beneficial ownership is restricted except under the trust company other shortcomings have been noticed particularly in the new legislation concerning leasing and financial leasing which comprises certain provisions that are incompatible with the concept of ijarah such as those in refer ence to ownership of the asset by the lessor major maintenance of asset and termination of contract in the case of partial or total loss another hurdle for islamic banks is the restriction in the non citizens property restriction act a non citizen who wishes to hold purchase or otherwise acquire a property requires the prior approval of the minister responsible for the subject of internal affairs in writing who may authorise him or her to purchase acquire or hold the property subject to such terms and conditions as the minister may impose such a law is not clear and may represent an obstacle and a barrier for islamic banks whose shareholding may be composed of non citizens of mauritius for its normal business operations shariah law in what circumstances may shariah law become the governing law for a contract or a dispute have there been any recent notable cases on jurisdictional issues the applicability of shariah or the conflict of shariah and local law relevant to the finance sector shariah law is not applied in mauritius and mauritius law does not recognise shariah as a system of law capable of governing a contract on the basis that mauritius law does not provide for the choice or application of a system of law other than a system of national law this is based on the convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations 1980 the rome convention which requires that a governing law of an agreement must belong to a country however in the case of disagreements the mauritian court will take into consideration the clauses of the commercial agreements entered into for islamic finance transactions which will be in compliance with shariah and mauritius laws there is no legal case or dispute that has occurred in mauritius in this respect parties may still elect to have a dispute resolution in relation to a contract determined and resolved in accordance with shariah principles by submitting to arbitration under section 46 of the arbitration act 1996 arbitral tribunals are obliged to decide disputes with reference to either the national law chosen by the parties or any other agreed considerations including shariah considerations institutional takeover are there any special considerations for the takeover of an islamic financial institution outside the requirements of the general merger control regime mauritius has no special rules governing the takeover of an ifi other notable features are there any notable features of the islamic finance regime and markets for islamic finance products in your jurisdiction not covered above not applicable

in a recent washington post op ed lawrence summers one of the most deliberative and experienced economists in america issued dire warnings on the risks associated with modern monetary theory a new school of economic thought it proposes that in an era of low interest rates central banks could finance increased government spending by increasing money supply to stimulate economic growth or protect against a recession the warnings were directed at the extreme or asymptotic conditions of the theory but while it was a valid idea the article disappointed by not expanding on why when or how the theory could be practicable or useful mosads of course stretched out abused and misused modern monetary theory is silly and will lead to both increased inflation and currency depreciation but this is like saying alcohol will destroy mankind without realizing that used in moderation and only by responsible people it might have beneficial and enjoyable effects also directly comparing it to supply side economics can be confusing the former deals with central bank monetary policy while the latter associated with the still unproven laffer curve theory wherein tax cuts would pay for themselves by promoting growth deals with fiscal policy two totally different kinds of policies that could each be economically beneficial when pursued in moderation but damaging when misused the legacy of supply side economics is easy to see repeatedly overused tax cuts produced larger budget deficits which accumulated over the past 20 years to unsustainable levels the u s public debt is now more than 22 trillion galloping at a faster growth rate than that of the gdp just recently the bureau of economic analysis came out with its first cut gdp growth numbers after unprecedented tax cuts of more than 2 trillion the economy grew at 2 9 percent in 2018 while producing another budget deficit approaching 1 trillion by comparison the u s economy had also grown by the same 2 9 percent in 2015 but with a deficit about half as large and without tax cuts taking the national debt to unwelcome heights when will economists and politicians admit that george h w bush was right when he called misguided over reliance on tax cuts voodoo economics it seems reasonable therefore that before we consider which monetary theory to embrace we should first extricate ourselves from what has been a demonstrably misguided mindset of fiscal policy without falling in the mental traps of right wing vs left wing classifications as for monetary policy without dwelling on the merits of modern versus classic monetary theories the time has also come to reduce the reliance on the federal reserve to sustain america s prosperity the latter results from other forms of proactive policies focused on productivity gains by boosting the value and reach of a nation s human capital versus the shuffling of interest rates or money supply laissez faire economics is a lazy man s sport not the champion s approach to global competitiveness the good news is that none of this is unknown to the federal reserve it would be surprising if former chairpersons alan greenspan ben bernanke janet yellen or current fed chairman jerome powell thinks otherwise if the fed thinks we can finance increased infrastructure or public works spending i e constructive accretive investments through increased money supply without sacrificing the value of the dollar or inviting a spike in inflation they may be more accommodating but they will have to fit in a grander bolder vision articulated by congress that should form the basis to revise the fed s new mandate what will that revised monetary policy be called then it doesn t matter as long as it is done in tandem with prudent fiscal policies both pushing in the same direction versus one sabotaging the other simply put the days of burdening the fed with supply side economics i e fiscal follies are over the question is what will we have instead in a decelerating economy where thoughtful policy leadership has never been more critical since the 1950s moris simson is a fellow of the ic² institute at the university of texas at austin and a member of the american college of corporate directors he is the president of wavenet consulting which specializes in the strategic guidance of high technology companies in the computer and networking industries

from the us generalized system of preferences gsp for developing countries having already erected trade barriers against turkey last year the us will now revoke the preferential treatment afforded to certain turkish and indian imports under the program according to the us trade representative india has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on united states

quarter that of china and less than one twentieth that of the us and that is a vast improvement on previous decades when india like most developing countries was abjectly poor with an extremely low literacy rate abysmal infrastructure and a weak health system in 1960 the country s per capita gdp was a mere 304 after india s independence in 1947 its first government under prime minister jawaharlal nehru made economic development a top priority and based its policies on the belief that indian producers could not possibly compete with those in advanced economies accordingly india prohibited imports of goods that could be produced domestically and imposed high tariffs and quantitative restrictions on many other imports it wasn t alone during the decades after world war ii most other developing countries including china and turkey did the same while also establishing or expanding significantly the role of state owned enterprises soes and limiting or prohibiting that of private companies yet by the 1990s china india turkey and many other developing countries had all experienced decades of disappointing growth with trade protectionism having clearly impaired their competitiveness and overall economic performance they removed almost all of their quantitative restrictions and began lowering tariffs substantially at the same time many countries moved to more realistic exchange rates adopted policies to control inflation and relaxed or eliminated controls on private enterprises while reducing the role of soes in their economies the results ranged from good to spectacular for example in the three decades following south korea s adoption of an outward oriented trade strategy in the early 1960s real inflation adjusted wages there rose sevenfold the south koreans had moved to a realistic exchange rate allowed exporters to import intermediate inputs duty and license free lowered tariffs and kept inflation under control likewise china s growth started accelerating soon after it introduced market friendly economic reforms in the early 1980s as did india s following its reforms in the early 1990s lastly turkey despite being an oil importer experienced the highest growth rate in the world in the late 1980s following its removal of protectionist policies earlier that decade in all of these cases the lesson was learned open trade accompanied by appropriate domestic policies is good for growth there are a number of reasons for this whereas competition and the opportunity to learn from others make domestic producers more efficient and innovative high protectionist trade barriers can result in sclerotic monopolies moreover world markets enable economies of scale in production and provide exporters with the precise amount and type of inputs they need and precisely when they need them at the lowest price all told countries that have pursued greater economic openness have enjoyed improved nutritional health and educational outcomes as well as higher productivity and incomes and those that have not namely russia north korea and some countries in africa have fared poorly for an outward oriented strategy to be successful politicians must refrain from overregulating the economy and private economic activities should take place on a level playing field if a large country like china intervenes in ways that affect the world market such as by subsidizing steel production a multilateral response is the best policy in an interconnected global economy all countries must work together the trump administration disagrees but its complaints about unfair tariffs elsewhere are hard to take seriously given that the us is raising its own trade barriers if history is any guide the current us approach to trade will result in deteriorating us economic performance because it implies that yesterday s industries will be coddled while the industries of tomorrow will be starved of investment the great irony is that if china india and other developing countries continue to remove protectionist barriers and create a level playing field they will grow stronger and more competitive vis à vis the us as a democracy with a rapidly growing economy india should be a natural friend for america not least in its efforts to contain china the trump administration s decision to pick on the country thus makes no sense indeed behind all of trump s trade moves is a perverse bargain the us is essentially threatening to harm its own economy unless other countries abolish their protectionist policies and become more competitive but if the goal is to protect us producers from foreign competition the administration should be doing exactly the opposite encouraging developing economies to increase their reliance on inefficient soes protecting against foreign competition and allowing political interference in the economy that together with higher investment in basic research education and infrastructure would ensure america s global economic primacy for decades to come anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund is senior

company s ability to generate cash before extraordinary and non cash accounting transactions recognized in the financial statements in addition ebitda is useful to analyze and compare profitability between companies and industries because it eliminates the effects of financing and accounting policy decisions the most comparable ifrs measure to ebitda is net income loss in addition adjusted operating cash flow is used by investors to compare cash flows from operating activities without the effects of certain volatile items that can positively or negatively affect changes in working capital and are viewed as not directly related to a company s operating performance the most comparable ifrs measure to adjusted operating cash flow is cash flow used in operations refer to etrion s

accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or u s gaap within the meaning of the applicable securities and exchange commission or sec rules nre believes these metrics can be a useful measure of its performance which is further defined below cash available for distribution we believe that cad provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance we also believe that cad is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance such as transaction costs depreciation and amortization equity based compensation gain on sales net asset impairment and non recurring bad debt expense we adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance for instance these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments which are expenses related to specific transactions management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes cad as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders the definition of cad may be adjusted from time to time for our reporting purposes in our discretion acting through our audit committee or otherwise cad may fluctuate from period to period based upon a variety of factors including but not limited to the timing and amount of investments new leases repayments and asset sales capital raised use of leverage changes in the expected yield of investments and the overall conditions in commercial real estate and the economy generally we calculate cad by subtracting from or adding to net income loss attributable to common stockholders noncontrolling interests and the following items depreciation and amortization items including straight line rental income or expense excluding amortization of rent free periods amortization of above below market leases amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of discount on financings and other and equity based compensation other gain loss net excluding any

currency gains losses related to sales goodwill impairment following the sale of operating real estate and other intangible assets the incentive fee relating to the amended and restated management agreement and one time events pursuant to changes in u s gaap and certain other non recurring items these items if applicable include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures cad should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss attributable to common stockholders determined in accordance with u s gaap as an indicator of operating performance in addition our methodology for

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s retail sales rose modestly in january after a december drop that was even larger than originally estimated but the recovery was not seen strong enough to alter the course of a u s economy that was losing momentum in early 2019 the report from the commerce department on monday was welcome news for the economy after a raft of weak december data as well as a sharp moderation in the pace of job growth in february still january s increase in retail sales recouped only a fraction of december s plunge leaving expectations for a slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter intact sales managed only a tepid reversal in january from december s deep freeze said douglas porter chief economist at bmo capital markets in toronto while we expect some further comeback in the next couple months the big story is that the economy s big engine is cooling retail sales rose 0 2 percent as increased purchases of building materials and more discretionary spending offset the biggest decline in motor vehicle sales in five years data for december was revised to show sales tumbling 1 6 percent instead of decreasing 1 2 percent as previously reported the drop in december was the biggest since september 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales to be unchanged in january sales in january increased 2 3 percent from a year ago the january retail sales report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 february s retail sales report which was scheduled for publication on thursday will be released on april 1 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 1 percent in january after a downwardly revised 2 3 percent plunge in december the largest drop since 2000 these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product story continues they were previously reported to have decreased 1 7 percent in december consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity coming on the heels of a deterioration in the trade deficit in december and weak construction spending the downward revision to the core retail sales suggested gross domestic product growth slowed more than the government initially estimated in the fourth quarter the government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2 6 percent annualized rate in the october december quarter after expanding at a brisk 3 4 percent in the third quarter economists now expect gdp growth will be lowered to a 2 1 percent pace when the government publishes its revision later this month fading fiscal stimulus the weaker december core retail sales also set consumer spending on a weaker growth path in the first three months of the year leading the atlanta federal reserve to cut its january march quarter gdp growth forecast by three tenths of percentage point to a 0 2 percent rate goldman sachs lowered its first quarter growth estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 0 5 percent rate consumer spending which increased at a 2 8 percent rate in the fourth quarter is seen rising modestly in the first three months of the year as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades in addition 2018 tax refunds have on average been smaller than in the previous years but spending remains supported by strong wage growth and higher consumer confidence the government reported on friday annual wage growth increased 3 4 percent in february the biggest gain since april 2009 from 3 1 percent in january slowing economic growth supports the federal reserve s patient approach toward further interest rate hikes this year fed chairman jerome powell reiterated the u s central bank s stance on sunday in a wide ranging interview with cbs s 60 minutes news show powell said the fed did not feel any hurry to change the level of interest rates again weak first quarter gdp will be another factor that keeps the fed patient at the march meeting and beyond said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street rose after five straight sessions of declines but a sharp drop in boeing co shares after a second deadly crash of one of its planes in just five months capped gains on the blue chip dow in january online and mail order retail sales increased 2 6 percent the biggest gain since december 2017 sales at building material stores increased 3 3 percent the most since september 2017 but receipts at auto dealerships tumbled 2 4 percent in january the largest drop since january 2014 after gaining 0 3 percent in the prior month receipts at service stations fell 2 0 percent reflecting cheaper gasoline prices there were also declines in sales at clothing and furniture stores as well as electronics and appliance shops discretionary spending rose in january with sales at restaurants and bars advancing 0 7 percent and purchases at hobby musical instrument and book stores jumping 4 8 percent the largest increase since january 2013 sales at food and beverage stores gained by the most since april 2016 reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci

get free access to the sa pro archive click here to find out more â by logan cannon biwen wu and yifei zhang summary our projections indicate the 10 year treasury yield is unlikely to rise in 2019 we recommend selling 10 year treasury put options to exploit this interest rate environment our projection is based on future inflation expectations the fed s monetary policy and economic conditions these factors are important because they directly impact the 10 year treasury yield increases in inflation are directly correlated with yield because increased inflation raises investors expectations of compensation similarly the fed funds rate indirectly influences the 10 year yield since an increase in the fed funds rate increases all rates in the economy lastly weak economic conditions drive down the 10 year yield if investors have a pessimistic outlook on economic growth demand for bonds increases this raises the price of bonds and decreases the yield investment explanation selling put options is a lesser understood investment strategy but is not complicated buying put options on treasuries typically acts as insurance against rising interest rates this can be helpful for hedging interest rate risk when rates are expected to go up our recommendation is to do the opposite as we project interest rates will remain relatively unchanged in place of buying put options you sell put options and collect the premium paid by the purchaser this strategy works best when yields are stagnant or decreasing because you continue to collect the premium as long as prices do not fall below the strike price bond prices and yields move in inverse directions so if the yield does not increase thus driving down bond price the premium can be collected if yields were expected to decrease significantly a long position in bonds would better take advantage of the increasing bond price the graph below depicts the investment strategy with three separate strike prices as long as rates do not increase the premium can continue to be collected the second chart from cme group shows that put prices have continued to climb since october 2018 this indicates selling a put option would have allowed the investor to collect a premium throughout that period data courtesy of cmegroup chart courtesy of cme group inflation we project that inflation will hold at its current level there are several offsetting factors that should ultimately result in little change to inflation economic volatility in the financial markets and international relations lowered investors expectations about economic conditions the real estate industry most staple commodities and the retail sector are impacted by volatility in the stock market and global commerce many large companies in the u s reported declining revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 this reflects a decline in purchases which further results in a decrease in inflation however recent tax cuts and economic growth would seem to support an increase in inflation the dovish statement from the federal reserve ended the expectation for constrictive monetary policy and drove up asset prices in the market additionally increased wages and an increase in rising real income provided space for an increase in inflation that would not be limited by wage pressure lastly the treasury department sells debt in exchange for cash that it uses to finance government operations a large deficit caused the government to increase borrowing last year after the 1 5 trillion tax cut and an agreement to increase government spending by 300 billion over the next two years this should stop further increases in inflation considering all of these offsetting factors we project inflation will stay at its current level the fed has targeted an inflation rate of two percent to maintain economic growth and prices as the exhibit of the pce index shows below the inflation rate fluctuates around 2 in the past few decades and we expect to hold at this level in the near future pce index 1960 2018 chart courtesy of federal reserve st louis pce index november 2017 november 2018 chart courtesy of federal reserve st louis economic factors the u s economy achieved stronger growth than expected in 2018 but economists believe this growth is due to short term stimulus measures we project u s economic growth will slow significantly in 2019 as the impact from government stimulus measures declines uncertainty of monetary and fiscal policies continues and the u s experiences negative impacts from trade frictions large scale tax cuts have been introduced for more than a year and its boosting impact on the economy has gradually weakened at the same time its stimulating effect on corporate investment has not met expectations most companies are more likely to repurchase their shares after tax cuts rather than make large scale fixed asset investments on the other hand as the u s government s fiscal situation deteriorates the degree of stimulus to the economy through fiscal policy is decreasing projects from congress show tax cuts in the next decade will increase the federal government s fiscal deficit by 1 46 trillion former u s treasury secretary lawrence summers believes the increase in fiscal deficit will limit the government s investments in infrastructure human resources and technology and will not help economic growth in the united states the slowdown in u s and global economic growth means u s treasury yields will not raise further second it is generally believed that investors demand for 10 year u s debt reflects their demand for low risk or safe assets the fluctuation in rates of return also depends on investor s appetite for risk we can use the chicago board options exchange volatility index vix index to reflect investor risk preference in the u s market the relationship between the vix index and the rate of return is approximately as follows vix raises â uneasiness raises â demand for safe haven u s debt increases â u s bond prices rise â u s bond yields fall in december 2018 the vix suddenly increased to around 25 then fell back to 15 in january 2019 and has remained relatively stable until now at the same time the u s china trade war should have a temporary resolution by spring under these conditions we believe that investors risk preferences will not change substantially in other words investors demand for u s treasury bonds will not drop significantly so the 10 year yield will hold at its current level finally since november 2018 the 10 year yield fell more than 60 basis points in 2 months analysts changed their forecast for rising yields due to deteriorating data lackluster investor sentiment and tighter financial conditions this has drawn questions over the ability of central banks to normalize monetary policy without causing an economic downturn this is why we recommend selling put options relationship between yield curve and vix chart courtesy of iron horse capital fed funds rate after the january fomc meeting the federal reserve signaled it will not raise interest rates in the near future the fed chairman would not specifically address a decrease in the fed rate so we can assume it will hold steady for the foreseeable future this is a very strong indicator that the yield on the 10 year treasury note will not raise a steady yield curve means bond prices will remain largely unchanged bond prices and yields move in opposite directions functionally the fed impacts interest rates in two ways by changing the federal funds rate and by increasing or decreasing the size of the federal reserve bank s balance sheet an increase to the federal funds rate increases all interest rates and the yield on all treasuries including the 10 year while changing the size of the balance sheet impacts the supply of money and helps boost the economy in general the fed uses both methods to enact monetary policy based on economic performance in times of economic downturn the fed attempts to keep rates low to encourage economic growth whereas the fed will increase rates and decrease the balance sheet when the economy is performing well the fed does this to carry out one of its mandates to keep prices stable the fed announcing it will not raise interest rates signals there is some uncertainty in the market and that yields on 10 year treasuries will not increase further the fed s january statement that they will be flexible in reducing the balance sheet implies there will be less upward pressure on long term rates as the supply of money will remain relatively high the fomc announcement to not increase rates was expected given the current economic climate there is uncertainty in the market and investors are worried about another recession our investment strategy exploits the current interest rates by betting against an increase in rates while accounting for the possibility that rates go down the strategy earns money from the fed not raising rates and not reducing the balance sheet

by greg hunter usawatchdog com march 13 2019 money manager peter schiff says even though there is record debt everywhere the fed thinks the economy is fine schiff explains the actual amount of money the government is borrowing is much larger than what they pretend they are borrowing with the official budget i think the national debt was up around 1 5 trillion in 2018 it s probably going to be even greater in 2019 we have the biggest annual trade deficit ever in 2018 we re going to beat that record in 2019 so we have the twin deficits going off the charts none of that worries fed head jay powell we have record corporate debt record individual debt record student debt auto debt credit card debt and none of that concerns powell we have record debt for state governments and municipalities we have underfunded pensions in both the public and private sector we also have interest rates rising they have risen quite a bit from a few years ago and all of that is an added cost on an over leveraged economy the reason the fed did this about face the reason they are now patient and the reason they stopped raising interest rates is all about the united states it s all about the enormous debt we have the fed inflated a bubble where you had all this debt it s impossible to normalize interest rates in this scenario so they came up with an excuse to stop but what the markets still don t realize is it is not enough the fed is ultimately going to go back to 0 the fed is not going to shrink its balance sheet they are going to blow it up bigger than it was before they started to shrink it there is no way to stop the recession and no way to stop the bear market they are going to have to go back to the qe but i don t think the fed is going to succeed in blowing a bigger bubble schiff goes on to say i think when they start to try to reflate the assets in stocks real estate and in bonds they are just going to prick the dollar bubble and that s when we have a real crisis the dollar is going to collapse and america s days of living beyond its means is going to come to an end on gold schiff says i think this is the calm before the storm people don t really perceive it maybe it s like the wile e coyote who has just run off a cliff and he just hasn t looked down yet he doesn t realize where he s standing gold shorts are going to lose an incredible amount of money that s probably one of the most foolish things you can do there are a lot of great things out there to short gold is the last thing you should be shorting for central banks gold is the safest reserve asset it s the only asset that is not somebody else s liability i think the world is going back to gold 5 000 10 000 per ounce who knows how high it s going to go there is no real ceiling on the price of gold because there is no floor to the value of the dollar and other fiat currency gold is going to skyrocket and silver schiff says look at last time silver went up to 50 per ounce from 3 to 4 an ounce in 2000 2001 gold went to 1 900 per ounce but silver went to 50 per ounce it was a much bigger percentage gain if i am right about gold going to 5 000 to 10 000 per ounce i am sure the percentage gain in silver will be even bigger join greg hunter as he goes one on one with money manager peter schiff founder of euro pacific capital and schiff gold

one of the market s biggest winners during the past couple of months has been mercadolibre nasdaq meli often called the amazon amzn of central and south america the online retailer has seen its shares nearly double from its 52 week low seen back in december 2018 as the chart below shows the stock broke 500 on wednesday but perhaps it s time for investors to sell into this massive rally source yahoo finance the first thing that concerns me is that the company just announced a large share offering of which the 1 billion portion priced at 480 per share this will help provide funds for future growth but it dilutes investors a little bit and there s a secondary portion to it some will argue that if the company is selling shares at 480 investors shouldn t be buying more than 500 another curious item was a curious set of analyst notes out this week research firm btig reiterated its buy rating on the stock on tuesday but had a price target of 450 on the name that makes no sense because the analyst was telling you to buy a stock that was expected to drop however the analyst then came out on wednesday and raised the target to 535 now the buy rating makes sense but it s a strange set of events the second worry i have is with regard to the company s second largest market argentina as you can see in the chart below the us dollar has basically doubled against that country s currency over the past year argentina is mercadolibre s second largest market representing more than a quarter of the company s revenues last year the more the dollar rallies the worse the company s reported results will be when translated into us dollars the dollar also is up a bit against the brazilian real over the past year which further hurts the situation with the us economy doing fairly well now emerging market currencies could weaken even more source cnbc com the other item that worries me is valuation mercadolibre is currently trading at roughly 8 4 times expected 2020 sales and more than 195 times next year s earnings since the company is often compared to amazon the us giant currently goes for about 2 6 times next year s sales and 42 8 times expected eps yes currently mercadolibre is projected for higher revenue growth but you are paying tremendously for that growth amazon also just started direct sales of merchandise in brazil in january so competition is going to soar in 2019 for mercadolibre since this year started analysts have raised this year s revenue estimate on meli from 1 99 billion to 2 06 billion which means expected growth of 43 that could be tough to achieve with amazon making its big push along with the dollar s strength at the same time the average eps estimate has gone from 0 50 to 0 30 when more revenues mean significantly less profits that means a hit to margins eps estimates may come down another tick in the coming weeks thanks to the secondary offering diluting investors which lowers eps with shares of mercadolibre nearly doubling in the past couple of months i think it s time for investors to pump the brakes a bit the company just sold stock below where shares currently trade and why was an analyst reiterating a buy rating with a 450 target that was then raised a day later with the argentine peso weakening against the dollar 2019 results will be pressured and amazon has started its big move into brazil with a lofty valuation those buying a bit above 500 might not have the best returns moving forward

this article is more than 5 years old getty food processing can be a volatile business changes in commodity prices diseases natural disasters and trade disputes can all disrupt operations as a result solid companies in this industry can face years of poor profitability this poultry producer has been one of my top stock picks going back to august of 2015 since that original call the stock has outperformed up 62 vs 27 for the s p 500 however 2018 was a nightmare year for the company and stock declining profitability led to my rating system downgrading the stock to unattractive all signs point to 2019 being a bounce back year though which is why i am reiterating sanderson farms safm as a long idea despite its rating can t keep safm down for long the company s profits were squeezed from both ends in 2018 feed costs increased up 1 from 2017 while the average sales price of its chicken products decreased by 9 due to the influence of feed costs on chicken production it s rare to see the two prices move in opposite directions 2018 was only the second year in the past decade where chicken prices fell while feed costs rose the impact of these rising costs and falling revenues combined with startup costs for a new production facility and the impact of two hurricanes on existing facilities caused safm s after tax operating profit nopat margins to fall from 8 in 2017 to 1 in 2018 as a result return on invested capital roic fell from 21 to 2 and economic earnings turned negative however as figure 1 shows these downturns never last long prior to 2018 economic earnings had grown by 15 compounded annually for a decade and 24 compounded annually dating back to 1998 figure 1 safm economic earnings growth since 1998 new constructs llc in addition economic earnings have spent two consecutive years below the trendline only once in the past 20 years that period was 2011 2012 when a series of global supply shocks led to the cost of grain feed rising nearly 40 shocks on either the supply or demand side have been the cause of previous down periods as well economic losses in 2008 were also the result of global supply shocks spiking grain prices in 2006 it was a combination of overproduction and the fear of avian flu hurting export markets that hurt sales prices in 2018 trade was the primary culprit china had already banned imports of u s chicken in 2015 due to avian flu concerns but u s pork and beef producers have long relied on china as a major export market when tariffs hurt pork and beef exports it led to oversupply in the u s that pushed prices down for all meats including chicken even as grain prices rose why a rebound looks likely both the rise in feed prices and the decline in chicken prices appear poised to reverse course in 2019 in the q4 2018 earnings call ceo joe sanderson told analysts we expect flat to lower cost during fiscal 2019 he added that if the company had locked in its grain costs for 2019 on the futures market their total grain cost would be 8 1 million 1 lower than 2018 but that the company believed prices would go even lower on the chicken price side the u s department of agriculture expects a 1 2 increase in retail poultry prices in 2019 safm should also benefit from lower sg a and higher production in 2019 the company incurred 13 million 6 of sg a in costs in 2018 related to work on its new production facility in tyler texas without those startup costs the company projects sg a to drop from 222 million in 2018 to 213 4 in 2019 the tyler facility should begin production in february and help the company grow production by 3 in 2019 taken altogether safm should earn a significantly higher gross margin in 2019 while increasing its sales volume and significantly decreasing sg a as a of revenue these factors should lead to a significant rebound in roic and economic earnings economic earnings drive valuation of course these factors only matter to investors if roic and economic earnings actually drive the stock price there s a great deal of evidence that shows roic and economic earnings drive valuations throughout the broader market and figure 2 shows that this relationship holds true for safm in 15 out of the past 20 years the stock price has moved in the same direction as economic earnings figure 2 safm economic earnings and stock price since 1998 new constructs llc the stock has already bounced back up 27 in 2019 which indicates that the market sees economic earnings bouncing back this year despite this increase the stock still has significant upside as i ll show later on consistent production and demand growth the long term uptrend in safm s economic earnings comes from its consistent production growth as figure 3 shows safm has increased its production by 9 compounded annually from 1997 to 2018 the company increased its pounds processed in all but one year during that span figure 3 safm production growth since 1997 new constructs llc sources company presentation volatile commodity prices mean that year to year profits will always be variable in this industry but there s no reason to believe that the long term growth trajectory will change superior capital turns provide competitive advantage chicken production in the u s is a highly concentrated industry the four largest producers tyson tsn pilgrim s pride ppc safm and private company perdue account for over 50 of production of this big 4 group safm stands out for the size of the chickens it produces its birds have an average live weight of 8 pounds compared to 6 pounds for the other producers the company writes in its 10 k that it decided in 1997 to focus on medium and large sized birds for the retail and foodservice industries rather than the smaller birds that are sold to fast food restaurants by focusing on larger birds safm s processing plants are more efficient than its competitors in 2017 its processing plants produced an average of 7 5 million pounds of ready to cook chicken per facility per week compared to 5 5 million for tsn 5 9 million for ppc and 5 7 million for perdue this superior efficiency also shows up in average invested capital turns the amount of revenue the company generates per dollar invested in the business figure 4 shows that even though capital turns have been in decline for all the major producers recently safm retains an edge over ppc and tsn figure 4 capital turns for big 3 chicken producers since 2014 new constructs llc safm s focus on big birds for the food service industry might make it more susceptible to the types of price shocks we saw in 2018 a large food service provider such as sysco syy can shift towards serving more beef and pork when those meats become cheaper whereas a fast food company like chick fil a can t exactly start serving burgers to compensate for this greater volatility safm has a much more stable balance sheet than its peers the company s only debt is 31 million 1 of market cap in off balance sheet debt from operating leases in contrast both tsn and ppc have long term debt equivalent to 50 of their market cap safm s clean balance sheet allows it to withstand volatile price swings while enjoying superior capital efficiency over the long term bear case shift away from chicken to red meat is permanent to believe that safm s and the entire chicken industry long term track record of growth will come to an end you need to believe that the demand for chicken will grow at a slower rate or even decline in the future that is as discussed above what happened in 2018 as competition from cheaper beef and pork decreased demand for chicken however it s hard to argue that 2018 was anything but a blip when one analyzes the long term trend in consumption for chicken vs beef and pork figure 5 shows that u s per capita chicken consumption has more than tripled since 1960 while consumption of beef and pork has declined by 19 figure 5 u s per capita consumption of chicken beef and pork since 1960 new constructs llc sources usda global demand for chicken continues to grow too as more and more people in developing countries join the middle class it s clear the trade war has caused temporary issues for chicken producers it s possible that prices haven t fully adjusted and safm s profitability could rebound slower than it has in the past even if the rebound is slower than usual it will only a blip in the long term trend of growing chicken demand on the other hand if the u s can come to agreements with china and mexico chicken prices could rebound much more rapidly than expected and safm could regain access to export markets that were previously closed undervalued compared to peers numerous case studies show that getting roic right is an important part of making smart investments ernst young published a white paper that proves the material superiority of my firm s forensic accounting research and measure of roic the technology that enables this research is featured by harvard business school since annual roic can be so volatile i used three year average roic to compare safm to its peers per figure 6 three year average roic explains 69 of the difference in valuation for the 20 companies listed as peers in safm s proxy statement figure 6 3 year average roic explains 69 of valuation for safm peers new constructs llc at its current valuation the market expects safm s long term roic to decline from its three year average of 13 to 7 safm has earned an average roic of 12 dating back to 1998 so it seems unlikely that such a significant long term decline will take place if safm were to trade at parity with its peers the stock would be worth 210 share today a 67 upside from the current stock price cheap valuation create potential upside due to its low profitability in 2018 safm looks expensive based on annual metrics it has a p e of 45 and a price to economic book value pebv of 5 7 both well above the s p 500 average however if i use three year average nopat 166 million instead of 2018 nopat 29 million the stock all of a sudden looks much cheaper pebv falls to 0 9 which means that the market expects nopat to permanently decline by 10 from its three year average for a company with safm s long term profit growth history this expectation seems overly pessimistic if safm can get back to its long term average roic of 12 and grow revenue by 4 5 compounded annually half its growth rate over the past 20 years over the next decade the stock is worth 184 share today a 46 upside from the current stock price see the math behind this dynamic dcf scenario safm has significant upside even if you believe its growth is going to slow down significantly going forward what noise traders miss with safm in general markets aren t good at identifying quality balance sheet management i e capital allocation that creates value instead due to the proliferation of noise traders markets are great at amplifying volatility and therefore risk in popular momentum stocks while high quality unconflicted comprehensive fundamental research is overlooked here s a quick summary for what noise traders miss when analyzing safm long term track record of growth despite fluctuations in profitability simple p e or earnings growth screens will exclude safm superior capital efficiency compared to peers reduced sg a expense and increased production from new tyler facility will lead to an even bigger rebound in profits than the rest of the industry trade resolution earnings surprise could provide upside the biggest catalyst to push safm shares up would be an end to the trade war with china especially if it included an end to the chinese ban on imported u s poultry absent a trade agreement earnings surprises could provide upside for safm despite the positive trends noted above consensus estimates have revenue growing by less than 2 in 2019 and gaap eps falling from 2 70 in 2018 to just 0 49 in 2019 however analysts have a poor track record of forecasting earnings consensus analyst estimates have been off by more than 0 10 share in each of the past 11 quarters on the revenue side analysts have been off by an average of 16 million 2 each quarter over the past two years with such low forecasts safm should be well set up for earnings beats that will drive shares higher share repurchases plus dividends offer 4 yield safm has increased its dividend in 8 out of the past 10 years the company s quarterly dividend has grown from 0 20 share in 2014 to 0 32 in 2018 or 12 compounded annually the stock currently offers a 1 dividend yield on top of its quarterly dividend safm has paid a special dividend of up to 1 share in highly profitable years in the past in 2018 when the stock dropped over 40 from its peak safm decided that buybacks would be a more effective form of capital return than a special dividend and the board authorized the repurchase of up to 2 million shares 9 of shares outstanding this buyback authorization suggests that the company views its shares as undervalued as safm had not bought back shares in either of the prior two years the company bought back 884 thousand shares in 2018 this proved to be a good investment as safm s current stock price of 123 share is 21 above the 101 share average they paid in total safm spent 83 million on buybacks in 2018 3 of market cap combined the buybacks and dividend offer a 4 yield although that could go much higher if the company buys back shares at a higher rate or offers a special dividend next year executive compensation could be improved safm s executive compensation plan which includes base salary annual cash incentives and long term equity awards focuses on earnings per share and return on equity roe roe is a flawed metric but its flaws aren t especially significant when it comes to safm roe s two biggest issues are that it can be influenced by leverage and accounting loopholes safm as noted above has almost no leverage and it consistently ranks among the companies for which i have to make the fewest adjustments i still believe that safm would be better served using roic but for now roe does an adequate job of measuring the company s profitability insider trading and short interest trends there is little insight to be gained from recent insider trading trends as they have been minimal over the past 12 months 51 thousand shares have been purchased and 111 thousand shares have been sold for a net sale of 60 thousand shares these sales represent less than 1 of shares outstanding short interest trends are more insightful there are currently 3 5 million shares sold short which equates to 16 of shares outstanding and 7 days to cover short interest has fallen 46 over the past year down from 6 5 million shares sold short and 10 days to cover a large percentage of shorts covered as the stock dropped over the past year but there are a number of shorts that could still be squeezed with the recent recovery in the stock price

forces of globalisation in my remarks this evening i will argue that the eu is more needed than ever for its more than 500 million citizens but we need to work harder to ensure that young adults many of whom face highly uncertain employment prospects can reap the full benefits of a united europe achieving a more cohesive and stronger europe requires everyone including young people to speak up and get involved in debates i therefore strongly welcome initiatives such as european generation here at bocconi that provide a platform for discussion and critical thinking on eu policies you are the ones who will chart the path that decides where the currents of history will take europe next i am here tonight for this reason i will start by presenting a few facts that highlight some of the challenges facing young people today and what they could mean for cohesion in europe i will then present proposals for solutions that can help shape our discussion on what europe can do for you poorer than their parents since the beginning of the 20th century every generation has enjoyed higher living standards than the one before you can see this for italy on my first slide which shows the evolution of real gdp per capita a crude proxy for prosperity going back to what is called the greatest generation part of which grew up during the great depression the chart shows how income levels for each generation have evolved from the age of 20 onwards clearly living standards have been increasing dramatically for every generation this is not specific to europe but as this coincided with deeper european integration in the second half of the 20th century rising living standards have contributed to the appeal of europe and its widespread support the chart also suggests however that your generation the millennials is at risk of breaking with this trend more granular data make this point even clearer you can see this on my next slide around the globe growth in total income that is available to a millennial household for spending or saving fell considerably behind national averages from the 1980s up to 2010 in italy disposable incomes of young adults increased by nearly 20 less than the national average from 1986 to 2010 older generations by contrast have seen their relative incomes rise more worryingly since 2009 real incomes of young households that is after accounting for the increase in consumer prices have fallen or have barely increased in the majority of euro area countries you can see this on my next slide in other words the millennials could become the first generation not to enjoy higher incomes than previous generations in some countries the young have also suffered a steeper decline in net total wealth in recent years poorer than their parents this was the conclusion of a 2016 report by the mckinsey global institute for europe stagnating or falling incomes are not only an economic concern confusion about the causes and effects of these developments may also affect support for the eu and its institutions and start a doom loop where mistrust against institutions would hamper their ability to act decisively to improve economic outcomes surveys confirm that younger generations who are growing up in an increasingly divisive political landscape and who are disgruntled by deteriorating social conditions are more sceptical of the eu the truth of course is that stagnating or falling incomes are the result of a wide range of factors most of which are unrelated to eu or euro area membership take unemployment which has a particularly negative effect on household income for obvious reasons the deep recession after the financial and euro area debt crises and the slow recovery thereafter have undoubtedly been a major factor in stagnant household wage growth across generations policies that stimulate consumption and investment have therefore been crucial in combating the cyclical effects of the crisis monetary policy has played an important role here we have taken decisive and far reaching action to stimulate the economy and to stop the fall in prices and wages these policies have been highly effective since mid 2013 ten million people have found work in the euro area as a result the unemployment rate fell from around 12 in early 2014 to 7 8 in january this year the lowest level in ten years you can see this on the left hand side of my next slide wages too are growing at their fastest pace in many years thanks in large part to the effects of monetary policy you can see this on the right hand side but even so youth unemployment remains twice as high as the total unemployment rate you can see this on the left hand side even before the crisis nearly one in five people aged 15 to 24 was unemployed in countries strongly affected by the crisis youth unemployment remains intolerable with rates above 30 in italy and spain and near 40 in the case of greece strikingly much of the fall in youth unemployment during the recovery reflected a shrinking young labour force rather than strong employment growth you can see this on my next slide this suggests that the sources of falling or stagnating household incomes of younger generations may be much more structural in nature three such structural factors are worth pointing out the first relates to demographic changes our societies are ageing the shrinking young labour force primarily reflects a fall in the percentage of the total population accounted for by young people the second factor relates to the impact of new technologies digitisation and robotisation are transforming our societies demand for high skilled workers is accelerating and young people are responding by seeking higher education thereby leaving the labour force i will come back to this in a minute but it is telling that people who have completed tertiary education have accounted for more than 80 of total employment growth in the current recovery up from 60 pre crisis and in the low skilled sector and increasingly also the medium skilled sector wages are increasingly being held back by technological progress and globalisation the third structural factor that has contributed to flat or falling real household incomes of younger generations relates to national labour market institutions trade unions for example have gradually been losing significance over the past two decades or so more so atypical forms of employment have hit the younger generation particularly hard in 2000 for example the share of young people working part time was below 18 it increased to more than 33 last year and more than one in four of those currently working part time do so involuntarily also young workers today are twice as likely to be in temporary work as older workers a gap that has widened since the early 2000s and the share of young temporary workers in the euro area is also considerably larger than in other advanced economies you can see this on my next slide in the euro area more than 50 of those aged 15 to 24 have temporary contracts compared with less than 10 in the united states the upshot of these three factors is that using the eu as a scapegoat for economic malaise is far too easy and often wrong being part of the eu the single market and the single currency is a strength which contributes to creating jobs and offering young people opportunities to grow and develop under the erasmus programme for example 9 million young people have been able to study train and gain professional experience outside their home countries more generally research shows that eu membership boosts per capita incomes on average by approximately 10 in the first ten years after joining the eu but all of this is to no avail if people don t see it that way the implications for europe are therefore clear and they can be summarised in two points the first is that if we want your generation to embrace the eu it has to provide tangible benefits that you can clearly associate with it in other words it needs to build on output legitimacy the eu needs to make a more visible contribution to sharing the fruits of economic growth more broadly across generations the second is that europe needs to pay more attention to those left behind to those who need support in the face of a rapidly changing labour market let me address these two points in turn richer than their parents improving the quality of education two broad measures are needed if the eu is to deliver on the first point and make the european pie grow larger for younger generations improve the quality of education and promote future technologies significant progress has already been made in the field of education the proportion of young people aged 15 to 24 in education rose by almost 5 percentage points between 2008 and 2017 reaching 57 but quantity is not quality if young europeans are to compete in a rapidly changing labour market they must excel in basic skills yet many countries still have high proportions of underachievers in mathematics reading and scientific literacy in all three disciplines one in five pupils is a low achiever a lack of basic skills reduces a young person s chances of succeeding in the labour market and thereby also risks cementing prevailing inequalities of opportunity since the 1990s social mobility has slowed across the oecd meaning that those in lower income groups have less chance of moving up the ladder as a result according to the oecd it would take five generations for children from low income italian families to attain the level of mean earnings despite this public expenditure on education has been declining in recent years for the eu as a whole it fell from 4 9 of gdp in 2014 to 4 7 in 2016 the latest year for which data are available here in italy spending on education amounts to just 3 9 of gdp compared with 6 9 in denmark just 10 of total public expenditure is directed towards education in the eu we can do better we need to step up our joint efforts to improve the quality of education in europe few member states have fiscal space allowing them to spend more but all of them have the opportunity to spend better many have been recommended by the commission to increase investment in education they need to follow up on these recommendations maximising employment opportunities education however important is only one ingredient in enabling younger generations to thrive in the future the second is to maximise employment opportunities europe should become a leader rather than a follower in the fourth industrial revolution which is evolving at breakneck speed but today european tech companies are lagging behind those in silicon valley or china data suggest that in the united states many more people are employed in high tech sectors than in the eu yet it is frustrating to see the eu s spending on research and development r d stagnate at around 2 of gdp for the past 20 years or so you can see this on my next slide research shows that this shortfall in r d intensity is not so much of a problem in industries where eu firms are well established it is more of an issue in industries where eu firms are underrepresented the eu has most of its r d in medium tech sectors which have on average lower r d intensity rates in other words we lack the sort of creative destruction which would help europe move into new higher technology sectors take low carbon industries as an example research shows that no eu firm has a competitive advantage in battery or photovoltaic technology although these sectors are likely to be key drivers of future growth a lack of entrepreneurship has a direct impact on productivity and pay high tech sectors are high productivity sectors that pay higher wages a recent study by the us bureau of labor statistics showed that the wage premium in us high tech sectors is on average about 100 that is a person is likely to earn twice as much in a high tech industry as they would in other industries the eu has the ability to steer its course of action we need to strengthen europe s capacity to innovate by mobilising public and private investment to support digitalisation in leading industries reforms that facilitate the reallocation of capital and labour will be instrumental both within borders and across borders the capital market union is a case in point and we can make sure that progress in digital technologies goes hand in hand with high data protection standards fight against poverty the role of the eu my second point is that a changing labour market implies that as always there will be winners and losers the benefits will not be shared equally the social implications of high unemployment for young people are already concerning as the young have suffered disproportionately from unemployment in the aftermath of the crisis their risk of poverty has risen significantly you can see this on my next slide today young people are the cohort most likely to be poor even in absolute terms poorer than their parents turns out to be something of an understatement then the rising risk of youth poverty also reflects the design of existing welfare systems which remain tailored to traditional labour markets for example their larger share of temporary contracts makes the young more vulnerable to economic downturns than older workers at the same time the eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits remain largely based on factors that disproportionately benefit older workers such as the duration of employment this risks leaving young people without access to social security benefits you can see this clearly on my last slide there is a significant gap across generations when it comes to recipients of unemployment benefits in the eu let me give two examples of how the eu can help first eu policies to eliminate corporate tax avoidance can help protect national welfare systems that are being threatened by falling tax revenues second more direct eu funds could be made available for the fight against poverty the eu s youth guarantee for example has been a true success each year since 2014 more than 3 5 million young people have taken up an offer of employment continued education a traineeship or an apprenticeship we can build on this success conclusion let me conclude many young europeans entered the job market during one of the worst recessions in living memory many have seen their real incomes stagnate or fall not all young people have been affected in the same way of course but high youth unemployment and deteriorating economic conditions more generally are something that concern us all not least because they affect social cohesion and could threaten to undermine the european project what we collectively make out of this experience will shape the future of europe it will determine whether the eu has succeeded in creating what its founding fathers had in mind a genuine european identity destined to leave the legacy of war and atrocities behind to achieve this action is needed at national and at eu level we need structural and fiscal policies to set the conditions for balanced and sustainable growth in sunny days alongside with our monetary policy and in rainy days we need a robust and accountable crisis management framework that avoids the devastating output and employment losses experienced after the financial and euro area crises we need to promote and attract private investment so that european companies can become leaders rather than followers in the fourth industrial revolution and we need to make sure that young students receive the education they require to successfully compete in the global digital labour market and to ensure that young workers across the eu are adequately protected in a more demanding labour market this is what europe should do for you to help you fulfil your projects and your dreams the rest is in your hands thank you
it tells us his priorities extend tax cuts for the rich cut social programs and trust in magic by catherine rampell the washington post fair enough president trump s heartless and whackadoodle budget released on monday will never actually become law even when his party had unified control of government he couldn t get capitol hill to take major portions of his budget terribly seriously still a president s budget plan is a statement of his priorities and based on this latest statement trump s priorities continue to be redistributing wealth ever upward from poor to rich and selling the public more fantasies and lies federal deficits have widened immensely under trump s leadership this is striking not only because he promised fiscal responsibility at one time even pledging to eliminate the national debt within eight years but also because it s a historical anomaly deficits usually narrow when the economy is good and we re not engaged in a major war trump s own policies are to blame for this aberration specifically the 2017 tax law which gave two thirds of its benefits to the top income quintile last year added 1 9 trillion to deficits over the coming decade a grand bargain spending bill last year that increased funding for both defense and nondefense programs here the democrats deserve a share of the blame also spilled plenty of red ink trump s plan for addressing these issues extend the plutocratic tax cuts currently slated to partially expire in 2025 which would add 1 trillion to deficits double down on defense spending increases and money for his border wall then balance the budget on the backs of the nation s most vulnerable the president s 2020 budget proposal would slash government spending pretty much across the board on entitlements and other nondefense spending that includes programs such as food stamps low income housing assistance and social security disability insurance among the biggest spending categories on the chopping block is health care even though most americans want government to do more to improve access to affordable care not less despite campaign promises to the contrary trump s plan would slash hundred of billions of dollars from medicare over the next decade his budget also endorses enactment of the final and arguably worst affordable care act repeal bill that failed to make it out of the senate in 2017 known as cassidy graham this would lead to sharp cuts to medicaid and the subsidies for insurance purchased on the individual market exchanges the administration would also mandate that all states impose work requirements on medicaid a policy that has been disastrous in the first state to attempt it arkansas last year it resulted in more than 18 000 people getting kicked off benefit rolls with no evidence that it actually promoted work altogether the budget would make poverty deeper and more widespread increase the ranks of the uninsured exacerbate inequality and racial disparities and shrink opportunities for those trying to get ahead said robert greenstein president of the center on budget and policy priorities the trump administration says such tough choices will lead to a balanced budget which it claims it would achieve by 2034 but even that is untrue in fact the only way you end up with anything approximating balanced budgets even with some of these draconian cuts is by making delusional predictions about economic growth or put another way lying to the american people buried in the new budget is a table with the administration s forecasts for the economy according to the white house we should expect gross domestic product growth of about 3 percent as far as the eye can see unfortunately every independent forecaster or scorekeeper including the congressional budget office federal reserve international monetary fund and legions of private sector analysts says otherwise they all predicted that the u s economy would experience a short term burst of growth from trump s fiscal stimulus in 2018 and possibly for a year or so after eventually alas the sugar high will wear off and we ll return to our longer term trend of about 1 8 to 2 percent annual growth if the track record of recent forecasts is any guide even those estimates may be too optimistic in any case it s no accident that the white house s predictions are so far outside the consensus trump needs to promise magical levels of growth to get his math to work as i ve said before a good rule of thumb is that the more economic growth a politician promises the worse his or her economic proposals probably are now you could argue that the big lessons of this budget that trump cares little about the little guy and appears generally unconstrained by reality are things we already knew still every now and then it is useful to see the president lay it all out so clearly catherine rampell s email address is crampell washpost com follow her on twitter crampell
rc earnings call for the period ending december 31 2018 ready capital corp rc 0 11 q4 2018 earnings conference call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants see all our earnings call transcripts prepared remarks operator greetings and welcome to the ready capital corporation fourth quarter and year end 2018 earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode a brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host mr rick herbst chief financial officer thank you you may begin frederick c herbst chief financial officer thank you operator and good morning and thanks to those of you on the call for joining us this morning some of our comments today will be forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws such statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect therefore you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them we refer you to our sec filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition during the call we will discuss our non gaap measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company s operating performance these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure is available in our fourth quarter 2018 earnings release and our supplemental information by now everyone should have access to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings release and that supplemental information both can be found in the investors section of the ready capital website i will now turn it over to tom capasse our ceo thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer thanks rick good morning i d like to take a brief moment to discuss the status of ready capital s pending merger with owens realty mortgage a publicly listed and established specialty finance reit that focuses on originating small balance commercial real estate loans very similar to our own transitional loan business we believe this transaction will benefit our shareholders by increasing both our equity base and well with minimal dilution further because we are not taking on significant staff expenses our operating expense ratio should be reduced ready capital will hold a special stockholders meeting on thursday march 21st and with a positive shareholder vote we expect to complete the merger by the end of the quarter as i just described the benefit to shareholders of both companies are numerous and we encourage shareholder participation in the proxy vote the fourth quarter marked ready capital s second anniversary as a public company before i comment on our quarterly financial results i d like to highlight some of the company s accomplishments over the last two years first we have originated or acquired 3 billion in small to medium balance commercial and mortgage loans quarterly investment activity has more than doubled since our first quarter as a public company second our annualized return on equity and dividend yield since becoming a public company remains at the top of our peer group third we ve improved financial leverage raising 345 million in corporate debt and securitizing 2 9 billion in small balance commercial loans across all our product lines finally our total shareholder return has been 42 since becoming public reflective of the continued execution of our business plan now i ll turn to fourth quarter financial results first gaap earnings for the quarter were 0 30 per common share and 0 34 per share on a core basis the earnings this quarter were adversely affected by negative marks on our interest rate swap positions used to hedge a record high inventory of fixed rate products prior to securitization the sudden decline in treasury yield at year end resulted in an after tax reduction in gaap and core earnings of 0 12 per share absent this loss core earnings for the quarter would have been 0 46 per share rick will discuss the non recurring nature of this in more detail in a few minutes secondly our origination and acquisition activity remains robust in the fourth quarter we originated 400 million of small balance commercial or sbc and small business administration or sba loans this is a 16 increase over the third quarter and in line with the company s record highs in the second quarter with an all time record highs in sba and transitional loan origination volumes our investment activity remains strong in the quarter with 350 million of sbc loans originated or acquired as of yesterday evening we expect total first quarter volume to be solid given the current money pipeline of 365 million in originations and 165 million in pending acquisitions some of which will close this month we do note that freddie mac volumes have experienced reductions due to increased market competition in the multi family lending space combined with our decision to maintain a disciplined approach to credit risk that said we are actively pursuing to increase freddie mac volume and diversify our product mix separately the government shutdown and a cautious small business sentiment reduced overall new sba 7 a loan approval in the first quarter we ve seen a correlated reduction in quarter over quarter origination volume but remain encouraged by our performance compared to the overall market total sba approvals are down 18 to 7 3 billion for the first four months of the government s fiscal year compared to a 29 increase for us over that period due to our continued focus on higher balance real estate secured loans finally we remain active in the securitized debt markets in the fourth quarter we closed a 263 million legacy asset commercial mortgage backed securities transaction comprising loans sourced from our acquisition strategy in january we completed our fifth fixed rate product securitization which at 400 million was double the size of previous deals we re also getting ready to launch a 300 million transitional loan collateralized loan obligation subject to market conditions let me now recap ready capital s 2018 performance for the year our gaap and core earnings were 1 84 and a 1 76 per common share respectively resulting in a dividend coverage ratio of 110 on a core earnings basis this represents the return on equity of 10 8 and a core roe of 10 3 both exceeding our stated roe target of 10 total sbc originations equaled 1 2 billion with an additional 455 million in asset acquisition total investments in 2018 of over 1 6 billion represented 50 growth over the previous year furthermore our adjusted book value remained fairly steady throughout the year growing 0 22 to 16 91 per share as we had minimal mark to market risk on our asset as compared to others in our space now i d like to make a few observations on the strength of the small balance commercial property market strong sbc space demand is reflected in record low fourth quarter vacancies of 3 to 5 and record annual rent increases of 5 to 10 across sbc sectors the combination of limited space and tight labor market is causing small businesses to reduce occupancy demand as a result year to date third quarter sbc prices slowed to 4 versus 6 last year although they have finally reached the 2007 peak three years behind large balance commercial real estate market industrywide sbc originations decreased 5 through the third quarter but at a 160 billion will likely mark the sixth consecutive year of over 200 billion the takeaway remains that among risk assets small balance commercial senior lending will be a safe haven late in this credit cycle now before i turn over the call over to rick i want to personally state how happy i am that andrew ahlborn will be assuming the cfo role effective june 1 andrew represents a great example of the depth of our team and has been a key finance executive working closely with rick and our company for nearly nine years i congratulate andrew on his well earned promotion he has joined us here today also i d want to i d like to congratulate rick on his retirement rick has been instrumental in helping to create a profitable sustainable business model at ready capital and as he transition to retirement he leaves us in strong financial shape and well positioned for future success rick we wish you all the best in retirement frederick c herbst chief financial officer thank you tom before i get into the results i d like to express my gratitude and appreciation for my time here at ready capital after a decade here and before that as cfo of two other public companies i must admit i am looking forward to the next stage of my life that said i will miss my role and everyone here and i am confident of the company s tremendous future success under the guidance of tom andrew and the rest of the team before hitting the highlights on some of the slides included in the supplemental information deck i d like to discuss a few of the income statement items this quarter tom mentioned the decline in gaap and core eps was due to outsized mark to market losses on our interest rate swap positions taken in anticipation of the large 400 million securitization tom mentioned we have always hedged the interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate lending and securitization program however we did not use hedge accounting for these hedges now that we have the track record sufficient to qualify starting in the fourth quarter we are utilizing hedge accounting and will do so going forward the mark to market loss on hedges entered into prior to the fourth quarter net of tax totaled 3 9 million for the quarter and is included in the net unrealized gain line item in our financial statements the unrealized losses associated with the fourth quarter contracts are accumulated in other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a yield adjustment to the fixed rate securitization closed in january 1 5 million of these unrealized derivative losses will be covered in january as treasury rates rose by the time the securitization closed going forward we intend to use hedge accounting for these derivatives and we should not see dramatic unrealized gains or losses related to them in the future slide 3 and 4 depicts summary highlights for the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as for the full year 2018 although unrealized losses negatively impacted our results in the fourth quarter we remain encouraged by both the financial performance and the investment activity of the company small balance commercial originations of approximately 400 million in the fourth quarter equaled the record high we set back in the second quarter slide 5 shows the component of the company s return on equity we have updated the presentation to break out the effects of corporate leverage on roe we believe the new presentation enhances the usefulness and period over period comparability of the operating segments the decline in the leverage yield was due to a reduction in income from the residential mortgage bank segment related to mark to market loss on the residential msrs and also a seasonal decline in origination volumes as well as a decline in the small balance commercial originations segment due to reduced gains on freddie mac loan sales these declines were offset by increased sba loan sale a reduction in various operating expenses and a reduction in the provision for income taxes related to those derivative and msr losses slide 6 summarizes our loan originations over the previous five quarters and we are pleased with the growth in both our sba and transitional loan segments our conventional business also experienced a strong quarter only surpassed by the record volume set in the third quarter of 2018 freddie mac loan origination volumes remained flat quarter over quarter due to competitive pressures from other products in the marketplace during the quarter we hired three new loan officers as we remain cautiously optimistic that volumes will return to previous levels despite increased market competition slide 8 summarizes the sbc originations segment strong originations with fixed rate and transitional loans resulted in a 13 growth in balance sheet loans the largest increase we ve had to date a decline in the gross levered yield was attributable to lower gains from freddie mac loan sales as well as some spread compression in our fixed lending business up to the january securitization delinquencies remain low although up a bit from last quarter of the 100 basis point increase in the 30 plus day delinquent loan category three quarters of them have either paid in full or returned to current status at the end of the year slide 9 covers the activities of our sba segment gross levered yields remained strong at 31 driven by a 57 increase in loan sales and rising interest income due to increases in the prime rate an increase in delinquencies is related to the acquired cit portfolio based on the low loan to value ratios and our successful workout history we do not anticipate any significant credit losses in this portfolio slide 10 shows summary information of the acquired portfolio this segment continues to provide stable double digit levered yield further supported by variable gains from our joint venture investments the performance of the portfolio remains strong and we will continue to add to the portfolio as opportunities and capital permit the percentage of match funded fixed rate loans increased dramatically due to the securitization of these loans in the quarter slide 11 summarizes our residential mortgage business volumes declined in the quarter due to expected seasonality and continued pricing competition in our third party origination business our servicing portfolio now exceeds 7 5 billion and we believe serves as a natural hedge to loan origination volumes in a rising rate environment operating expenses dropped 900 000 quarter over quarter which is reflective of efforts to right size the business to anticipated volumes slide 12 is an update to the summary of the securitizations we ve done within ready capital and this schedule includes the 263 million legacy sbc securitization that we closed in november delinquencies of our originated product remains virtually nonexistent slide 13 provides information about the interest rate sensitivity of our portfolio the chart on the left side shows that 26 of our portfolio is fixed rate loans not matched with fixed rate debt the completion of the fixed rate securitization in january reduced this number dramatically as you can see on the chart to the right of the slide rising interest rates have a positive impact on our net interest income the numbers here reflect the impact of rising rates on net interest margin based on our portfolio as of the quarter end and does not include the positive valuation adjustment of the servicing portfolio or any potential impact on the loan origination the chart has been updated to reflect the use of hedge accounting on a go forward basis the next few slides are similar to those presented in previous quarters and reflect the diversity of our loan pools and composition of our capital structure and various liquidity sources now i ll turn it over to tom for some final thoughts before we take questions thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer thanks rick we believe ready capital s differentiated focus on the small balance commercial space has and should continue to provide relative resiliency against the potential late cycle price correction in commercial real estate assets with the owens merger closing we will have accomplished another goal of generating non dilutive capital to fund budgeted origination and acquisition volume through 2020 looking ahead we will continue to explore new lending product to leverage our origination network including alternative agency program small business products and expansion into europe we are excited about 2019 and beyond and are looking forward to building this company and value for our stakeholders so with that operator i ll now open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much in terms of the market volatility that played out in the fourth quarter particularly december did you see any pickup in portfolio loan sales or potential situations in the bridge loan space with borrower not qualifying for an extension not able to get a refi and mortgage reits or debt funds trying to sell certain loans thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer not really because it was more that was more of a kind of risk off environment that occurred at the end of starting in august and culminating on christmas eve that was really more of a main wall street to main street we haven t seen any related impact in either the banks on the secondary acquisition side or the bridge market now again our focus is our average bridge loan is only 8 million i mean the industry is probably more like 25 million to 50 million and the larger guys in the hunt literally hundreds of millions so we are hearing that some of those projects are starting to become big you re starting to see a lot of froth in terms of underwriting projects a year ago that are not meeting their business plans and are now having running out of interest reserves and having potential defaulter workout situations but in our markets we haven t seen any of that intense competition and as a result our credits remain strong jade rahmani kbw analyst and if there was a pickup in the rate of delinquency or default in the 20 million or so loan size range is that an area that you might look to play in given your track record and history length of experience doing loan workouts thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yes we re always that s our core business plan rain or shine if we see a situation you know just stepping back a second there s a 100 commercial mortgage alerts last quarter so there is a 152 bridge lenders i d say about 40 of them are start ups that really don t have a lot of experience as our team would or some of the large are obviously public reits and you re going to you re definitely going to see a number of maturity defaults in these because again the fact that they bankrolled unseasoned sponsors with cuspy ph projects so yes we would look to our acquisitions team is always on the prowl with the brokers to purchase these projects from the funds at a discount jade rahmani kbw analyst and in terms of the skill set again and value of the platform are you interested in building a special servicing type of operation and can you remind us whether ready cap is a rated special servicer thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer ready cap is currently not a rated special servicer what we do is our model utilizes a technology from the external manager called waterfall controlled asset management wamcam ph it s a system we ve built over literally over a decade that enables us to plug into our servicers and monitor the underlying credit looking at noi updated the asrs and we anything that s non that becomes delinquent or on watch list we assign a team within the external manager to manage that we look at net present values we update the values on a monthly basis so what we do is we own the msr we farm out the servicing to a large low cost servicer to do the pni collections but we once a loan goes delinquent we manage that delinquent loan with our own internal staff that has experience having bought about 5 billion of small balance commercial non performing loans since the recession so it s a low cost model which enables us to control all of the special servicing and at the same time enables us to do something called champion challenger to pivot from one servicer to another based on their operational metrics jade rahmani kbw analyst turning to investment activity can you give any ranges by segment of what you expect for the first quarter and 2019 for originations across the various products frederick c herbst chief financial officer yeah jade i can give you some color given that we re halfway through the about a month ph of the quarter the conventional fixed rate products will be probably slightly under where it was in the fourth quarter but still a pretty strong quarter the transitional loan business is going well that should be pretty close to where we were on the fourth quarter and our acquisitions are up over where we were in the fourth quarter so in total the total capital deployed is around 400 million i think it ll be a reasonable estimate obviously it s hard to tell in the next couple of weeks what s going to close in the pipeline but should be in that range where we do see a little bit of a down trend is in the freddie mac business that looks like it will fall short of where we were in the fourth quarter and we ve seen more pricing pressures from fannie and others and we are i think we ve talked about in the past we are looking this year to expand our agency product line and then on the sba side there was a little bit of a dip with the government shutdown and the slowdown in the authorizations and a little bit of the or the market slowing down a little bit but our pipeline is very strong there so we think we ll make that up over the rest of the year but i would think our originations are not going to hit we had a record fourth quarter i think they re going to be more in line with where we were in the previous couple of quarters on the sba side jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ben zucker with btig please proceed with your question ben zucker btig analyst thanks for taking my questions and congratulations rick on your retirement it s been fun working with you frederick c herbst chief financial officer thank you ben you too ben zucker btig analyst you mentioned the january fixed rate securitization and it was roughly 400 million and definitely your biggest ever by a wide margin i m wondering did you guys receive any increased efficiencies from that larger transaction size that might show up in lower fees being amortized frederick c herbst chief financial officer we certainly the cost the cost obviously it s kind of almost a fixed cost so as a percentage of the outstanding deal it was much lower than typical the advance rates were pretty much on par with what we ve seen in the high 80s on previous deals ben zucker btig analyst that s helpful and do you think going forward like this is a move and a change in strategy to maybe to target bigger securitizations but maybe less frequently and improve on the expense efficiencies frederick c herbst chief financial officer yeah i think so it all depends on where the volumes come in for that product and they ve been pretty strong here in the last quarter or two but yeah ideally we d like to do them maybe north of the 300 million range i should point out but the way that with the hedge loss that we had obviously as the rate movement toward the end of the year but also we had such a huge inventory because it was such a large securitization so we the notional amounts of the hedges were more than they typically were we did recapture that 1 5 million of that loss in january we closed out the hedge business as well due to interest rate swap contracts on those loans so we were able to recoup some of that the loss that we realized in the fourth quarter ben zucker btig analyst that s great to hear and i think that s important for the market to hear as well so thanks rick tom i m wondering is there any product or part of your business that you re most excited about right now and i m trying to get a feel for where we might see the orm capital allocated it looks like you have a pretty healthy pipeline kind of across the business generally so is it just going to feel like kind of even distribution or what are you thinking right now thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer i d say the definitely in terms of incremental capital beyond the regular way originations you ve seen over the trailing four quarters the incremental capital will probably be utilized to focus on both wholesale channels in our existing businesses so for example in the sba business we re looking at doing secondary conduit buying loans from community banks and also doing non owner sorry conventional non sba owner occupied loans which we have a track record of securitizing we just did a 263 million legacy deal that s the wholesale channels within the origination business and that s managed by the businesses operating businesses there the other side which is which we re excited about is it brings up the opportunity for us to spend more money on acquisitions there s still a lot of these secondary portfolios out there both scratch and dent small balance deals which the or the so called extended for tenant deals that now the regulators are forcing banks to reserve again and secondly there are performing multi family for example portfolios where banks are hitting these caps the regulators put a cap of 300 i think it s 300 of tier 1 capital and if you have a certain growth rate then you have it impacts your camel ratings so we re seeing a lot of interest from banks in terms of buying those on a flow basis so we re yes we re going to be focused both on those three those two things and the third thing is we are looking at businesses and portfolios through our london team that have roes equal to or greater than what we re doing here in the us both on the transitional lending side as well as the stabilized core the stabilized property lending those are the three areas we re looking to deploy capital beyond just the existing pipeline ben zucker btig analyst that s really helpful and then if i could sneak in a follow up since you led me there you re talking about expanding into europe and you mentioned the london team and some of your peers speak very highly of this european market so is there any kind of build out or investment required for you to start showing this international capability or do you kind of have the pieces in place already thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer pieces in place we ve got a at present the external manager waterfall had an office for three years in london led by one of our partners and they have a team of about a dozen in london and we have a team of about five in dublin and they have they re buying npls in various jurisdictions in europe so they have all the infrastructure and the same technology we do here for due diligence appraisals so if we did something there we would probably pick on ph one of our ready cap staff to work with the existing external manager to manage that business there but you know they re established and again we focus on small balance asset small balance property is not the not competing with the large p e funds with 100 million plus transactions we re still focused again on that small to middle market where we think there is greater less competition and greater returns ben zucker btig analyst great thanks for taking my questions everyone operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tim hayes with b riley fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes b riley fbr analyst hey good morning everyone my first question just on the operating expense reductions were those predominantly at gmfs and how should we think about opex trending over the course of the year is there more wood to chop there and where do you see the company adding more resources frederick c herbst chief financial officer the opex was down this quarter fortunately part of it was volume related you know just things that relate to origination volumes it wasn t so much gmfs gmfs on the if you re referring to the slide on section on page 5 that s it was up in the top line there we did have the opportunity to clean up over the course of the year you we may have to close various things and then drew them up as we get little more clarity toward the end of the year i would think going forward once we close the merger we re not really adding any opex to speak off very nominal opex but we have a capital base of 40 higher or so so that expense ratio should be down around the 8 level so we re making some investments in technology that will ultimately result in some cost savings but until you get the technology implemented sometimes it doesn t hit right away tim hayes b riley fbr analyst okay so there were no i mean i know you had talked about in the past acquiring a fannie licensing getting into some other agency products and obviously the sbc business ramping just wondering if you re thinking about adding more headcount over the course of the year around any of those verticals frederick c herbst chief financial officer nominally we are hiring new loan officers and loan origination staff we think we have capacity within our current infrastructure to handle additional volume from where we are today if the volume goes up higher which we hope it will we will use it to hire some support staff to support that volume but it shouldn t be dramatic tim hayes b riley fbr analyst understood and then what is your view of the mortgage banking landscape and for gmfs with the fed seemingly getting more dovish and lower expectations for higher rates at this point do you see refi s potentially coming back or do you expect more volatility and if it s the latter do you see opportunities to add around this segment inorganically thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yeah remember that the refi s are going to be what is it 30 of the total frederick c herbst chief financial officer 20 thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer 20 to 30 down from at 70 in 2016 our business historically gmfs has managed that risk through via approach a focus on purchase through homebuilders direct ads regarding them radio ads and internet ads regarding focus on home purchase so i think they re well positioned to if you will hunker down and there have been some opex cuts in the fourth quarter and ongoing this quarter so they ve right sized their operating expense ratio and but they continue to see opportunities to buy teams rather than buy companies these are bolt ons they are local market some of the top loan officers believe let s say another you know another the lender that s more focused on refi but they were top producer focused on the purchase market so the short version is i think well they re not we re not looking to do any large acquisitions we re looking to find teams and do maybe some market expansion like texas et cetera but yes we expect them to have given the fact that they re they have a 7 5 billion msr portfolio and it provides a very in relation to their production which is about 2 billion a year it s a very good balanced business with about 60 purchase so we so yes long winded way of saying i think they ll continue to do their job as they have for over a decade and plug out a low double digit roe with a lot less volatility than a lot of their competitors that are more refi focused tim hayes b riley fbr analyst okay appreciate the comments there and then my final question just around owens have they made any progress divesting of assets over the past several months and do you still anticipate the reo portfolio largely being divested over the next 1 5 to 2 years upon the merger closing frederick c herbst chief financial officer yes to both they have disposed of a handful of properties relatively smaller ones they do have one very large property the ski resort out in tahoe and they ve sold a couple of the condo units there but there are other larger projects there as well we do anticipate that they will all be disposed of over the next 18 months and we ll be the smaller properties will go fairly steadily we think over that period and then the larger property will obviously be chunkier tim hayes b riley fbr analyst got it ok thanks for taking my questions thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott valentin from compass point please proceed with your question scott valentin compass point analyst good morning everyone thanks for taking my question rick congratulations on the retirement and appreciate all the time you spent over the years working with me really enjoyed it so best of luck there frederick c herbst chief financial officer thank you scott valentin compass point analyst and then just on the when you think about leverage and asset growth obviously the owens deal is a key part of that story going forward on page 16 your leverage right now i think is 3 7 times on a consolidated basis and then you re at 2 1 on a recourse i mean is that are those levels were you re comfortable running and then with owens coming onboard leverage will level step down because of the capital is that the way to think about it and that provides capacity to keep growing the balance sheet frederick c herbst chief financial officer yes the leverage will step down immediately overtime it will grow back up closing on these levels as we relever that balance sheet we re acquiring it on really no leverage at all and we want to lever that back up to get the returns so i think over time we ll get back up to the we ve always on the recourse side tried to keep it around 2 to 1 as the max on the total leverage while it will go down immediately after the merger closes as we do more and more securitizations that will ramp back up as well so wouldn t surprise me over the next year to year and a half we d get back up to these levels as we deploy that capital scott valentin compass point analyst okay and then in terms of the conventional sbc origination i know you guys mentioned a lot more transitional versus conventional was that a conscious effort on your part or that s just where the market led you in terms of pricing frederick c herbst chief financial officer it s more where more where the market is just the average size of the loans on the transitional business which is you know we almost did twice as much in the fourth quarter of transitional versus conventional and that will be something similar to that in the first quarter the overall size you can if we re doing an average of 8 million but sometimes we ll do 10 million 15 million and 20 million loans those dollars can be put to work much more quickly than on an average basis on the conventional side of a couple of million dollars thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer first one is market driven as well we re seeing a lot more transaction volume in the sub the sub 20 million property value in terms of sponsors buying properties and rehabilitating into them just seeing a lot more market demand as well we re just seeing when you go upstream you re seeing more of a pull back in transaction volume scott valentin compass point analyst okay all right and then on credit quality on page 12 you guys list 30 day delinquencies by securitization the rcmf 2018 fl2 it showed a pretty big 2 1 30 day delinquency number just wondering if there s anything one time in there or there is a couple of large credits i know you mentioned 75 delinquencies have since paid off or become current is that true for that securitization i guess frederick c herbst chief financial officer in that loan i have to look back let me just see if i have it here little quick here okay i don t have it in front of me let me take a look and i can come back to you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann please proceed with your question christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst rick congratulations wish you well and andrew welcome frederick c herbst chief financial officer thank you christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst on owens is the expectations for 1 eps accretion in 2019 still hold frederick c herbst chief financial officer i think what we said is the dilution will be less than 1 multiple speakers and it will be accretive over the subsequent four quarters it will be accretive i don t know that we specified the accretion so i christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that was on book value as i recall i was just asking about eps especially okay great and then also the origination excuse me the pipeline for the sbcs this quarter or in the fourth quarter seems to be materially higher than it was in the third quarter are you seeing that sort of translate to deal so far in the year because i know you ve comment on this earlier i just wasn t quite sure if i got it frederick c herbst chief financial officer we re definitely seeing on the fixed rate side the pipeline has picked up and we ve seen this in the past when freddie falls off a little bit the conventional product becomes a little bit more competitive in terms of rates as freddie s rates go up a little bit so we are seeing a pickup on the fixed rate side and the bridge because of a larger loan size the bridge pipeline kind of fluctuates up and down because a couple of loans can really move those numbers pretty significantly so yes we are seeing that and we anticipate that for our forward originations again the freddie is off a little bit on the pipeline and the loan closings the impact of that just so everybody is clear freddie because it s more of a gain on sale business that has an immediate impact to the bottom line results whereas the other businesses which have picked up they will have an impact on the longer term results which we re building into our portfolio at very accretive yields and spreads but on day one we don t see the p l pickup that we might see on freddie christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst great follow up question your asset sensitivity seems to have increased quarter over quarter is that such just transitory thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yes that was due to the securitization that we re building up inventory fixed rate inventory as of december 31st that got cleared out in january so that number goes way down it goes down around 10 post securitization and inaudible in fixed rate loans but its impact was a big reduction christopher nolan ladenburg thalmann analyst great thanks for taking my questions thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of crispin love with sandler o neill please proceed with your question crispin love sandler o neill analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question the loan acquisitions looked a little bit light during the quarter something at about 9 million and can you explain a little bit what drove the lower loan acquisition during the quarter and then kind of what you re seeing in the first quarter rick i heard your comment earlier about that you expect it would be higher but i m wondering it should be more in line with previous quarters that loan acquisition number frederick c herbst chief financial officer i think it s going to come in around somewhere between a figure around 60 million might be plus or minus 10 million one way or the other we have a couple of deals in the pipeline that may or may not close by the end of quarter so it s not 140 million that we did a couple of quarters ago but it s more in line with the historic average fourth quarter was low really just due to timing on a couple of deals and our originations were pretty strong we always it depends where our liquidity is and where the originations are we can dedicate excess capital to the acquisitions we always deploy or allocate our capital first to originations and then to the extent we have excess liquidity we can really turn the dial up or down on the acquisitions we always have a pipeline of those and we re always able to pull the trigger on those if we have capital so it really just depends on where we are in the situation liquidity wise crispin love sandler o neill analyst okay and then just one on the sba gain on sale margin i saw it came out at about 9 1 in the fourth quarter how does that how is that comparing to what you re seeing in the first quarter right now frederick c herbst chief financial officer it s actually rebounded a little bit kind of in the mid 9 so far 9 5 historically that s been around 11 so we re hoping it will stabilize around 9 5 to 10 just to remind you or others any premiums over 10 need to be split 50 50 with the sba so that s not to the extent that goes over time it s not a dollar to dollar impact to us it s 50 of that so the impact is not as dramatic as you might otherwise think and also the mix of our loans we and the new group of originators out on the west coast they do a little bit slightly different product and that they might be little bit lower interest rate loans given the type of assets they lend against and those have a little bit of a different a lower premium just given again just given where the coupon is so on a weighted average that could bring down the our premiums on a given quarter but the premiums out in the market have rebounded a bit from where it were crispin love sandler o neill analyst okay great thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on your retirement rick frederick c herbst chief financial officer okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of raj patel with fcm please proceed with your question raj patel farallon capital management l l c analyst thanks rick i d like to add my congratulations as well thanks for the effort over the last number of years really appreciate it frederick c herbst chief financial officer thank you raj raj patel farallon capital management l l c analyst my question i think is a bit of a tack on to the owen s questions so you talked about the tahoe resort being left what if you can just update us on what the rest of the portfolio that you expect to acquire at the end of the month look like and is it earning or is it liquid securities just what does that look like and how quickly can you ramp that up on based on roa basis frederick c herbst chief financial officer they had about 60 loans for about 100 million or 1 100 million all relatively short duration i think the average maturity date is around nine months now sometimes they get extended but relatively short and a fair amount of loans have paid off even since we announced the acquisition so we think that will continue so for the most part those loans will repay over the next 12 months or so and again some will get extended but the vast majority should pay off and those are unlevered at the moment we are going to put them on our warehouse line immediately to get some leverage then redeploy that capital and then on the assets it s really other than the large asset in tahoe it s a bunch of not a bunch but maybe a dozen or so smaller properties orm puts out a report it s a little dated but i think the last one they did was maybe in september that details all of their reo and they have disposed of a few of those properties since but it s they re really pretty much one off transactions that should get disposed of here over the normal course of business here over the next year raj patel farallon capital management l l c analyst if you get your hands on the book and quickly lever up the 100 million and then that starts flowing off naturally anyway from the last question will we see some sbc acquisitions that step up since that seems to be something you can do at any time to get that money to work faster frederick c herbst chief financial officer yes absent any dramatic upswing in the pipeline well pipeline is strong but absent some or some really large bridge loans coming in yes that would be the plan to deploy that acquisitions thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yes staff i d say the trick staff the external manager is part of their budget for 2019 have specifically been directed to focus on and working with inaudible et cetera to source in bank m a context some of these acquisition opportunity whereas we hadn t been doing that as aggressively in the prior two years given the focus on origination so we hope to ramp that up and deploy that to get the nim accretion from the orm addition to book capital in a relatively short period raj patel farallon capital management l l c analyst and then my last question i think tom you mentioned london or europe i m a little rusty on the reit rules how would that impact the structure and taxes et cetera the trs stuff thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer no this would be just acquiring portfolios outside of the trs and i ll refer to rick but there is no specific european frederick c herbst chief financial officer you know this were a lot it s the same rules as long as they re backed by real estate there is no prohibition against foreign lending raj patel farallon capital management l l c analyst got it great thank you very much again rick good luck to you frederick c herbst chief financial officer thanks very much operator thank you we have reached the we ve reached the end of our question and answer session i d like to turn the call back over to mr capasse for any closing remarks frederick c herbst chief financial officer just before i turn it over to tom i want to answer the previous question on the delinquency on the floating deal there was one loan that went into 30 day delinquency it s a property they have in california where the project is it was a rehab project that is still a little bit behind schedule in getting the approvals because it s a historical building we don t anticipate any losses we re at ltv of around 70 on our loans so that the collateral and those asset s value so we think we re money good ph on that loan but it is was 30 day delinquent as of december 31 tom over to you thomas edward capasse chairman and chief executive officer yes first i d like to congratulate rick herbst for his contribution to the company and welcome andrew who i worked with for almost a decade we think he has rick has left us in a strong financial position and with the orm merger we believe that was a smart way to raise non dilutive capital and we look to deploy that and improve our maintain our targeted returns so with that i appreciate everybody s time and look forward to the next call operator thank you this concludes today s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day duration 49 minutes call

so far my new format has been well received and i appreciate those who have contributed constructive feedback i recently decided to add another chart and table that gives insight into the value of the taxable account on the last day of each month i believe that the addition of this should help readers better understand the changes that take place in the account and also how additional funds have increased the dividend payments the current payments represent a mix between dividend increases and investing additional capital because i do not automatically reinvest dividends significant events i like to start by taking account of any significant events that may have impacted the value of john and jane s portfolio during the month of february on the news front there were few events that were actually worth noting in the month of february that had any sort of impact on our investment goals or strategy if anything the biggest story is the deteriorating situation in venezuela but this has very little impact on the economy because they are already so far removed from any normal trade activities the us economy is a mixed bag at this point in time as we only added 20 000 jobs in february which was well below the expected gain of 180 000 jobs but it is important to remember that this follows a blowout january where the economy added 304 000 new jobs the slight uptick in wages has contributed to a small increase in consumer prices during the month of february the federal reserve chairman jerome powell has made clear that the fed has turned more dovish as the us central bank adopts a wait and see approach in regard to monetary policy analysts currently estimate that we will see additional rate hikes in 2019 compared with the four rate hikes experienced in 2018 in my opinion i credit the dovish fed as the main catalyst for real estate investment trusts reits strong performance these companies rely on debt for their growth and a more dovish policy allows them to take advantage of lower interest rates for a longer period of time data by ycharts all of these factors have led to relatively stable prices in february and the only expected catalyst is a finalization of the trade agreement with china client background john and jane are two real people who asked me to help manage their retirement portfolios it is important to understand that i am not a financial advisor and merely provide guidance for my clients account based on a friendship that goes back several years i call them my clients for simplicity sake but i do not charge them for what i do the only request i made to them was that they allow me to anonymously write about them so that i can potentially help others who are wanting to achieve the same thing john retired in january of 2018 and is collecting social security along with other benefits while jane is still working with aspirations of retiring in the next two years john and jane have done an excellent job heading into retirement because they currently have no debt or mandatory monthly obligations other than what is expected such as property taxes water etc john and jane have adopted my philosophy of focusing on cash flow from investments instead of drawing out large sums of money by selling shares of currently held investments in a nutshell what john and jane want is a portfolio of stocks that will provide a steady stream of growing dividend income that will supplement their income during retirement although it will be necessary for john and jane to sell shares from their traditional ira the goal of the taxable and roth ira is that they will never need to sell any shares unless they want to because the income generated will prevent them from needing to sell shares as a means of funding their retirement here are some important characteristics to keep in mind about the taxable portfolio capital appreciation is the least important characteristic of this portfolio this doesn t mean we don t care about it because all investors do to some degree but it does mean that we are less concerned about the day to day fluctuations of stock prices since the goal is to never sell although i make occasional changes by eliminating or adding positions a focus on capital appreciation doesn t mean a lot when it comes to the gameplan in the past year i have typically focused on stocks that paid a qualified dividend because they qualify for the lower long term capital gains tax rate vs ordinary dividends which are taxed as ordinary income this has become less important now that 2018 was john s first year of retirement changes in the tax brackets also support this approach because the ranges have been expanded and include basically all of their income in the 22 bracket fixed income i have chosen to separate the fixed income figures from the rest of the portfolio in order to avoid confusion which allows those reading to gain a better understanding of how john and jane s taxable portfolio is generating interest and dividend income certificates of deposit cds are the primary recipient of these funds because we are looking for zero volatility and fdic insured product typically i invest only in short term cds 1 to 3 months because the increase 20 bps in yield isn t enough to justify a year long cd in my mind it should also be noted that a number of companies where we live are offering better cd specials than what can be found on charles schwab schw at the moment we recently shifted everything from the schwab value advantage money fund swvxx because their slightly higher yield does not justify the higher fees associated with the account thanks to the reader who brought this to my attention although i liked the next day access to these funds there hasn t been much of a reason for the need of the additional capital because nearly everything looks overvalued source consistent dividend investor llc due to the short term nature of these funds i will not be projecting future income because there is too much volatility to get a reasonable grasp of what cd mix and rates will do at the time these expire the following colors were used to represent the following details green dividend received confirmed actual dollar amount red security has been sold or has expired and no longer exists in total interest from fixed income provided john and jane with an additional 295 07 in the month of february dividend and distribution increases a number of companies from the taxable portfolio paid an increased dividend during the month of february including epr properties epr mesabi trust msb realty income o phillips 66 partners psxp simon property group spg westlake chemical partners wlkp epr properties epr has been producing some great results and the improvement in their stock price reflects it 2018 guidance moves to 5 30 5 50 share which gives the stock a payout ratio between 82 and 85 epr operates in such a unique reit segment that we feel confident in its ability to generate consistent funds from operations especially as its book of business diversifies away from movie theaters source fastgraphs epr epr s dividend was increased from 36 share per month to 375 share per month this represents an increase of 4 and a new full year payout of 4 50 share compared with the previous 4 32 share this results in a current yield of 6 08 based on a share price of 74 07 mesabi trust msb is unique in the sense that it is the only variable dividend paying stock in john and jane s taxable portfolio because the dividend is based on the volume of iron ore shipped from the peter mitchell iron mine i believe it is most appropriate to compare the quarterly dividend to get a better idea of how the dividend has grown year over year february 2018 saw the quarterly dividend increase to 1 18 share which was up from 14 share in 2017 over the course of the last year msb has continued to see strong volumes which propelled the dividend in february 2019 to 1 39 share which is the highest quarterly payment amount i could find going back all the way to 1990 using the fy 2018 dividend payments msb s stock is currently offering a yield of 9 88 data

the december sell off which is why we are exiting select positions in the retirement portfolios and holding cash for the time being data by ycharts february income tracker 2018 vs 2019 february 2019 saw income increased by 25 7 over the previous year and was partially due to the additional funds invested throughout the year and dividend increases none of the following images take into consideration the income generated by the fixed income holdings source consistent dividend investor llc here is a graphical illustration of the dividends received on a monthly basis source consistent dividend investor llc based on the current knowledge i have regarding dividend payments and share count the following table is a basic prediction of the income we expect the taxable portfolio to generate in 2019 compared with the actual results from 2018 source consistent dividend investor llc as a new feature going forward i also want to include account balances to help readers understand how the size of the portfolio has changed over time by showing when additional funds were added to the account i hope it will help explain certain changes in income etc please note that this includes the fixed income holdings in the total account balance to wrap up february s assessment i always like to include a gain loss for each position in the taxable portfolio because it is important to consider that some positions will be the gain and others at a loss if you plan to have your own dividend growth portfolio you will need to learn to live with this volatility because even the highest quality portfolio will be subject to some degree value fluctuation source consistent dividend investor llc values are fairly comparable to what they were at the end of january total dividend income expected for the year has increased after i updated the income generated in the month of february at the time i published the january 2019 article here the account was positive 7 570 01 compared with a value of 8 316 63 on march 10 2019 conclusion as expected we have seen a handful of companies increase their dividends in the first two months of 2019 but dividend growth appears to be slowing compared with many of the increases in 2018 when i create a forecast for dividend growth i assume a minimum of 3 a midpoint of 5 and an exceeds goal of 7 based on the increases seen in 2019 i expect that we will see something closer to the midpoint of 5 if we include the fixed income holdings in john and jane s taxable portfolio it results in a total income of 1 850 27 in the month of february

tunisia s state phosphate firm cpg pays abdel basset klifhi a salary of 280 dh1 028 a month even though he spends most days in his favourite cafe in the southern town of metlaoui he is one of 21 000 people taken on by the companie des phosphates de gafsa cpg since tunisia s autocrat president zine el abidine ben ali was toppled in 2011 since then the economy has been in crisis and cpg has lost its spot as the country s top exporter unemployment inflation and deficits have shot up and the value of the dinar currency has plummeted loans from the international monetary fund have kept the government afloat cpg s hiring spree brought its total workforce to about 30 000 and aimed to reduce the number of unemployed to stop protests destabilising the transition to democracy thousands more are still jobless however and some block roads to cpg daily to demand work others on the payroll want pay rises and frequently go on strike phosphate production has halved since 2011 and cpg s losses have accumulated as the wage bill grew employees point to other inefficiencies at the company cpg s declining fortunes have highlighted the government s failure to reform the bloated state companies that dominate the economy and have put tunisia on a collision course with international donors they have also deprived the government of crucial export revenues needed to turn the economy around and create real jobs to end the daily protests and unrest which largely target cpg i get 850 dinars 279 62 a month without doing any work said former protestor and cpg employee abdul basset the company spends about 70 million a year of its 180 million annual budget on salaries industry and energy minister slim feriani told reuters his ministry oversees cpg the hirings that took place after the revolution years were aimed at buying social peace but increased the suffering of the company he said we are aware that they are not doing anything he said the company has lost almost 1 billion a year since 2011 because of disruption caused by the protests it has only had 4 500 production days out of a possible 14 000 at its five mines since 2011 according to company documents seen by reuters this could have prevented us from borrowing from the imf said feriani phospates accounted for about 10 percent of tunisia s exports before 2011 when olive oil replaced it as the top export in 2018 phosphate had shrunk to about 4 percent tunisia agreed a 2 6 billion loan with the imf in 2016 so far four instalments worth 1 4 billion have been paid but each one was delayed because reforms fell behind the agreed programme public sector salaries and reform of public companies were among the sticking points with the imf analysts expect a new confrontation with the lender after the government raised salaries at public companies including cpg state airline tunisair and state energy firm steg in november an imf spokeswoman said it was in a continuous dialogue with the authorities on the policies in the next loan review but declined to say when it would take place the imf supports the tunisian authorities economic program to reduce macroeconomic imbalances including by strengthening external competitiveness reducing inflation and lowering debt and to improve job creating growth prospects through structural reforms she said cpg s phosphate production fell from a record 8 2 million tons in 2010 to about 3 million tons in 2018 official data showed in contrast nearby morocco raised output to 30 million tons last year from 13 million in 2010 a stable social climate allowed it to develop the industry including the use of a phosphate pipeline tunisia is no longer on the global phosphate production radar mr feriani said until 2011 tunisia was one of the world s top 5 producers but now stands in 11th place far behind the leaders china the united states morocco russia and jordan cpg said it could raise production by between 5 and 6 million tons this year but only if the protests stop in 2017 president beji caid essebsi ordered the army to guard phosphate sites but has not dispersed the protests fearing a backlash some staff in the company say cpg has also lost money through other inefficiencies at cpg s headquarters employees showed a reuters team dusty unused train carriages purchased four years ago to ship phosphate to the coast they have not been used because of a technical problem at the railway track near the production sites said cpg production director rafaa ben nassib a cpg employee told reuters that the company sometimes ordered replacement pieces for parts that were not broken nassib said this was wrong and unfair mr feriani said there was no proof we are constantly receiving petitions about corruption suspicions but there is no proof of that yet we are seeking to strengthen corporate governance said mr feriani union officials and mining town residents say cpg also pays too much to transport phosphate to coastal plants where it is turned into fertilizer it costs 3 a ton to ship phosphate by train but the track is often blocked so cpg then uses truckers who charge up to 10 a ton cpg officials say mr feriani said he wants to upgrade the railways and eventually follow morocco s example and ship phosphate by pipeline the government has set aside 90 million for 20 new trains but this may not be enough analyst moez joudi said the government must spend significant sums to repair the railways and develop transport rather than dumping the company with imaginary jobs
is it back to the drawing board for the continent well it s certainly all eyes to the east at the moment as china s economic growth has slowed its lower demand has flowed through to weaken two of its large suppliers japan and europe both make their way in the world by producing things much of which they sell to china so they are more sensitive to less demand from the asian powerhouse we are happy with the long term outlook for china although we expect a few wobbles along the way as it moves from being a giant factory nation to a more services and tech led economy and one driven increasingly by household spending essentially as it transforms from an industrial to a developed market economy in the space of only a few decades however for us the real weaknesses are the second links on the chain europe and japan both flirted with recession at the turn of 2019 as china s economy hiccupped but it s only europe that makes us nervous japan should be able to shrug off the recent drop in trade we believe it s closer to china than europe is and therefore sends a larger proportion of its exports to the middle kingdom however we think its politicians while not perfect are doing the right things to try to improve the country its labour market and its economy important reforms to japanese businesses over the past few years have made them leaner more profitable and generally better able to roll with the punches also we think the nation will keep benefiting from the growing chinese middle classes who are increasingly travelling to the island on holidays different story in europe europe on the other hand looks exceptionally fragile to us and not just short term fragile but fundamentally broken in a back to the drawing board kind of way if europe goes down for a moderate to deep recession at the same time as china slows noticeably and the us federal reserve plods on with tightening monetary policy would that be enough to tip the whole world into recession is that why the fed conducted such a screeching u turn this year slashing its rate hikes to a standstill and all but calling time on running down the trillions of dollars worth of bonds and mortgage backed securities racked up during quantitative easing historically the fed has had scant regard for the rest of the world when setting monetary policy in the 1970s president nixon s envoy to europe said the dollar was our currency and your problem after severing the currency s gold standard in the 90s with inflation running at a fairly muted 2 75 per cent the fed hiked rates so aggressively it sent emerging market currencies into a tailspin contributing to the asian financial crisis but the scales may have shifted if america is more susceptible to recessions overseas perhaps the fed is taking account of what is happening beyond us borders whether this is the case or not the fed has unequivocally put the brakes on its rate tightening agenda this is good for capital markets as lower than expected interest rates mean upcoming cashflows are worth more today it should also release some of the upward pressure that was brought to bear on us sovereign bond yields last year this reversal in the fortunes of bond markets led us to buy both gilts and us treasuries at roughly eight to 10 year maturities we re cautiously optimistic for the year ahead but are aware volatility has picked up noticeably as well we expected this and feel market prices are likely to continue jerking around violently having a few more safe haven bonds in our portfolios should help to offset some of these movements a bit more of the ishares physical gold etc should hopefully offer similar protection people get carried away don t let these safe haven purchases get you thinking that we re expecting the worst in fact when markets took a tumble late last year and in early january we were steadily rebalancing our equity positions we sold our put contracts which had protected us from some of the falls and we spread the lump of cash between equities and cash to us investors are sliding between absolute panic and eager optimism too quickly and on too little information we don t mind a jot though as it gives us lots of opportunities to trim positions at higher prices and buy things we like at lower prices we ve been sticking assiduously to companies with strong balance sheets high returns on assets and a true edge on their competitors these businesses are in no way immune to a recession if one comes they are nigh on impossible to predict but we believe they should fare best david coombs is rathbone multi asset portfolio funds manager

hlavní strana english pages václav klaus eu is not europe václav klaus eu is not europe english pages 13 3 2019 many thanks for the invitation and for the opportunity to address this very distinguished audience my thanks go especially to otmar issing the president of the center for financial studies who asked me to deliver this year s cfs presidential lecture thank you it is a great honour for me when i looked at the list of the past speakers in this series i was not at all sure if someone like me who spent the last thirty years in the political arena actually deserves it even though i have been all that time an active professor of finance at the prague school of economics even though i continued teaching and writing economic texts even during my presidential era i am fully aware of the fact that my engagement in politics didn t allow me to be fully involved in the academic activity and to follow the events in the economic science on every day basis nevertheless i believe in the general validity of the law of diminishing marginal returns even as regards the returns of the new contributions to the economic science i am therefore convinced that the old proven pillars of economics are still there and that most of the new sometimes very promising highly appraised allegedly revolutionary ideas in the economic theory don t look so great as they pretend to be as a side remark i should say that i am not that often in frankfurt in this bastion of banking in this very modern and flourishing city the wealth of the city is not surprising the high purchasing power of the bankers who work here and spend their huge incomes in this city is no doubt the main reason behind its prosperity we are here at the gathering of economists or of people from the economic financial and banking community but i will not confine my talk to the narrow field of economics the topic of my today s speech is not strictly an economic one in addition to it we the economists should admit that the economic discourse ceased to be the main and the most relevant issue of the current highly controversial and ideologically divided era whether we like it or not the people in our countries don t pay that much attention to us this is partly because the people reflect their relative very high level of affluence and partly because the era of charismatic exponent of freedom and of free markets is over in the communist era travel to the west was almost impossible for someone like me in czechoslovakia and as a result it was not until january 1990 that i was allowed to come here for the first time it was two months after the fall of communism in my country and i was a newly appointed minister of finance in the first non communist government i was invited by karl otto pöhl to have lunch with the board of the bundesbank it gave me a fascinating opportunity to discuss the challenges of the post communist transition in central and eastern europe as well as the economic aspects of the forthcoming german unification wiedervereinigung with this highly distinguished group of people i remember our very close views as regards the topic of the day which was the search for the appropriate exchange rate between the two german currencies in case of unification as some of you remember the german politicians of that era didn t listen sufficiently to what the economists had to say they chose the exchange rate which was neither in conformity with reality nor with the majority view of german economists the politicians were as it is often the case wrong i am however not sure that the economists used all their arguments and presented them in a strongly enough way let me say that i allowed myself to explicitly warn the german politicians and economists already in january 1990 that the german unification shouldn t be done as a substitute for the fundamental systemic transformation of the east german society and economy based on my strong belief in the economic theory i was convinced already at that time that unification without transformation would be very costly and for many east germans extremely frustrating i can use many convincing arguments in this respect but let me remind you that the annual fiscal transfers from the west to the east of germany in the 1990s reached on the average the level of the czech gdp at that time in some years were higher many times i found out that not even many german economists are aware of the magnitude of these transfers as i said my first visit to frankfurt took place still in the velvet revolution era i dare say that some of us in the ex communist countries were prepared for what happened we spent decades in the irrational and oppressive communist economic and political system but we tried to use this time at least partly efficiently some of us instead of only criticising the reality spent these years studying contemporary economics and especially the literature in the field of comparative economic systems we also learned a lot by living in such an irrational and inefficient system we were frustrated by seeing the tragic consequences of the absence of the autonomy of economic thinking and economic decision making in our part of the world the politics dictated the topics and principally predetermined the answers to all kinds of economic questions and issues due to it one of our first tasks after the fall of communism was to get rid of the dominance of politics and to establish the autonomy of economic decision making only in such a situation it is possible to think clearly and without understatements the political compromises are of course necessary but only ex post not ex ante the thinking has to be done without compromises this idea should be repeated again and again because this problem has become relevant in the current era again these days in the brave new world of the european union and of political correctness even more in my country we were aware of the relevance of this idea since the very beginning and succeeded in making a radical change in this respect very soon we see now however that we have been losing this favourable state of affairs once again i would like to be very explicit by stressing that i don t have in mind the former communist countries in central and eastern europe only or mostly but the whole western europe and america this time the politicization of economic life has not been organized by the communist apparatchiks or by the emissaries from moscow it has arisen from inside it is a home made problem these shifts have been relatively silently slowly and incrementally growing inside the contemporary western society during the last decades especially after the fall of communism the threat of communism blocked the emergence the expansion and the dissemination of such views and ideas the change has come from the west itself this time it has not been imported neither officially imported nor illegally smuggled from the east now it is different now it hasn t been accidental we live in the era of a new authoritarianism of illiberal elites of neomarxists of the frankfurter schule of so called experts of bureaucrats of international organizations of it protagonists and lobbyists of loud and noisy exponents of political ngos as a result of it we are the witnesses of an important institutional change of a shift in power from elected representatives to permanent functionaries from local councils to central bureaucracies from legislators to executives from national parliaments to brussels and strasbourg from the citizen to the state the form and substance of political discourse have changed substantially as a result let me once again mention the name of otmar issing one of the most distinguished german economists and bankers whom i have been privileged to repeatedly meet on many occasions at different places of the world in the last thirty years we sometimes held and expressed similar views on various economic issues but not to undermine his reputation in the politically correct world of current germany i want to say very loudly that he has always been much more pro european and much more pro establishment than myself in spite of that the title of my today s speech eu is not europe was suggested by him i only accepted it but i did it with a great pleasure because the title has a meaning it sends a very clear message to all those who see these two terms as perfect substitutes it is a message to the european political elites to the uncritical admirers of the eu in politics media and academia as well as to the eu huge and permanently growing nomenclature all of them behave as if these two terms were identical they are wrong but i understand why they have a vested interest in pretending the eu and europe are identical they want to be the owners of europe they want to be recognized as the authentic heirs of all european historic events and achievements they believe they have a right to authoritatively interpret current events and to decide whether they are european or un or anti european for them the eu is the personification of europe this is of course untenable all democrats should oppose this way of thinking europe is a historically evolved cultural and civilizational entity with more or less widely accepted geographical borders whereas the eu is a man made construct which has its well defined beginning and will have undoubtedly its glorious or not so glorious end the only superficial attention to the european issues leads to the underestimation of the fact that the eu is not a constant structure it is a moving and variable entity every eu summit redefines its substance some of them only marginally some fundamentally the changes go however all in one direction the well known ratchet effect functions in this field as well as in many others every treaty or summit takes europe closer to a centralised european state this is not surprising because the main goal of the european political elites and their fellow travellers is the dislocation of national sovereignty and the overcoming of the state these people consider the sovereign nation state as an obsolete historical anachronism which should be defeated last decades were characterized by the consequences of two such fundamental systemic and institutional restructurings both the maastricht treaty and the lisbon treaty brought about significant changes in the eu originally ec arrangements i have to say quite resolutely that i see it as a very negative development we were not yet members of the eu in the moment of the maastricht treaty and had no voice in european debates then we couldn t express our disapproval or disagreement however as it is well known i was the last president of all eu member states who under tremendous pressure both at home and abroad capitulated and signed the lisbon treaty i remember that even otmar issing wrote several years ago that the maastricht treaty was the triumph of political ambitions over economic reservations this is also my position but i stress the political reservations as well both of these treaties neither of which was fully democratically approved and implemented were in my opinion historic mistakes they transformed the original concept of integration into something else into unification they pushed the heterogeneous community of sovereign european states into a union of subordinated regions and provinces länder in german terminology they substantially augmented the power of the bureaucratic central agency in brussels they supressed democracy and turned it into a post democracy misleadingly called liberal democracy i agree with john laughland that these treaties created a mechanism which allows governments to pass laws for which they would prefer not to argue in public safely away from the glare of democratic scrutiny and parliamentary opposition by unifying by means of averaging important economic parameters currency exchange rates interests rates all kinds of obligatory non economic standards etc these two treaties turned some regions of the eu into the position of winners some into losers the level of these parameters was advantageous for some parts of europe only especially for the north of the continent they proved to be detrimental for the european south instead of facilitating the mutually advantageous cooperation of european countries these economic realities not respecting unification measures created deep disparities inside europe these disparities asked for the unwanted and unplanned emergence of a transfer union which exists without authentic solidarity and is based on a non voluntary redistribution another unification measure the liquidation of internal borders inside europe was supposed to facilitate the movements of the europeans inside europe and to create a new european man homo europeus it had an important side effect it led to the mass migration of non europeans who mostly didn t come to europe as future europeans or as a labour force who don t intend to be assimilated and who don t want to accept european culture religion values habits ways of life i can continue in the same spirit and extend the briefly stated arguments but i know that we are in an economic institution and should pay more attention to the economic aspects of these processes the eu in its doctrine which i call europeism builds its policy on the very debatable non traditional ideas and doctrines and presents them as undisputable truths to oppose them is considered politically incorrect i will briefly touch upon some of them 1 one of the most important and most detrimental aprioristic prejudices which have been aggressively pushed forward in the eu is the almost religious belief that the environmental imperatives should be put before any economic considerations it is not relevant that these ideas never succeeded in winning elections they are presented as eternal truths this way of thinking has a long tradition especially here in germany but the decisive breaking point was the formation of the club of rome fifty years ago and its aggressive denial of long established fundamental pillars of the economic theory and of the economic way of thinking i will mention just as examples without analysing them the main pillars which have been undermined the concept of the non exhaustibility of economic resources the understanding of the role of prices in any rational decision making the role of economic incentives in human behaviour the proper dealing with externalities the seeing of the environmental protection as a luxury good etc all of them deserve to be discussed in detail and especially they deserve to be returned to their fundamental place in political and economic discourse where they belong 2 not less important and not less detrimental is the almost religious belief in the global warming or climate change doctrine and the economic consequences of that belief this doctrine represents the victory of the non economic thinking by underestimating the information hidden in politically unmanipulated prices and the decisive impact of the long term growth of income and of technical progress on the outcomes of economic decision making this doctrine set us back two centuries to the old malthusian fallacies the arbitrarily chosen size of the discount rate in climatology both implicitly in the climatologists thinking and explicitly in the climatological modelling denies the role of time and of opportunity costs as the economists see them by using a low discount rate the exponents of these doctrines harm current generations by claiming to fight for future generations they pursue only their own political agendas the war against oil coal and cars impoverishes millions of people in spite of the fact that there is no measurable effect of human production of carbon dioxide on global temperature all of that are however topics for serious lectures 3 by claiming that we live in a knowledge economy in an information economy in an it world the eu apostles misinterpret the true sources of economic growth and development they disregard the adam smith s theory of the causes of the wealth of nations and they deny the fundamental contribution of the genuine creative behaviour of the free unregulated and unmanipulated people to the economic performance by adoring the role of formal education and especially of mass high education they underestimate the role of the quality of the economic system and as a side effect produce the unemployable army of holders of university degrees in useless disciplines or produce formally overeducated workers it reminds me of the way of thinking and the rhetoric of the leonid brezhnev s era 4 by believing that it is possible to have a common currency in a non optimal currency area the eu political elites contribute to the evident economic decline of europe and to the slow economic growth of the eurozone countries in the last decades the recent 20th anniversary of the euro was not used as a basis for a serious debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the european common currency this is inexcusable because the already 20 years long experience gives us sufficient data one conclusion is clear the single currency in europe needs either an explicit or an implicit transfer union the explicit transfer union is not politically feasible for many of us also undesirable but the euro hasn t yet collapsed because of the existence of an implicit transfer union in the form of the ecb s target balances this union was very innovatively described by the first presidential lecture speaker hans werner sinn in many of his writings it is now well known that within the current european monetary system the governments can finance themselves via the european central bank they cannot of course directly print euros but can issue their own government bonds which can be bought by the ecb this is also a transfer union 5 my last remark relates to the still existing belief in the idealistic hypothesis of the so called great moderation in the doctrine about the possibility to avoid economic fluctuations by clever technocratically not politically oriented macroeconomic policies this idea rather surprisingly survived the undisputable reality of the 2008 2009 crisis the students of schumpeter should always remind us of the significance of the process of creative destruction thanks to schumpeter we know that there is no growth without the previous destruction of obsolete equipment machines businesses the whole industries we witness it currently in the czech republic the lowest rate of unemployment in europe is not just a victory it reveals the rigidity of our economy conclusion the never ending struggle for free economy and society i didn t come here to start a revolution i am nevertheless convinced that europe needs to be liberated to be liberated again the ingenuity of free people should be made possible to bring fruits we need a change wir brauchen eine wende the dictate of the status quo is very powerful it may sound too ambitious but we shouldn t capitulate to the intellectual trends of the time i know that it takes political courage to admit that the eventual change will be slow and painful i know that it is easier to say that in a position of a retired politician whose oversensitivity stems from his life in communism and who sharply sees the signs of the coming dangers in a position of someone who knows that the growing politicization of economic life increases rent seeking and creates low growth equilibrium in a position of someone who is afraid of the consequences of the end of the malignant quantitative easing but the change has to be done

equal to 160 3 million up by 8 9 compared to the corresponding period of 2017 147 1 million the exchange rate effect was negative and equal to 3 4 related to the depreciation of the us dollar concentrated in the first months of 2018 despite the penalizing exchange rate effect the groups recorded a double digit organic growth 12 3 driven by the restarting of the investments in the security and defense sectors as well as by the higher sales in the vacuum pumps business and both in the nitinol for medical applications segment and in that of the smas for industrial applications mainly luxury goods and automotive by including within the group s revenues also the revenues of the joint ventures1 the total revenues of the group were equal to 172 2 million up by 7 compared to 161

severance costs related to the reduction in the number of staff at the parent company 2 7 million subsequent to the downsizing of the group perimeter after the sale of the gas purification business please also note the write off of 3 1 million related to the impairment test on the advanced packaging operating sector that entailed the complete cancellation of the goodwill deriving from the acquisition of saes coated films s p a equal to 2 4 million as well as the write off of other tangible and intangible assets for a total of 0 7 million this devaluation was linked to the strategic transition still under way in the offer from traditional metallized products which have become increasingly commodity goods and exposed to the asian competition to most innovative lacquered products with higher margins and able to compete in the advanced sector of sustainable packaging net of these extraordinary costs the operating income would have been equal to 20 8 million 13 of consolidated

that ebitda is an important parameter for measuring the group s performance and therefore it is presented as an alternative indicator since its calculation is not regulated by applicable accounting

strategic projects and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2019 after that we ll open the call for the question and answer session now i will turn the call over to linda linda k massman president chief executive officer and director thank you robin hello everyone and thanks for joining us today let me start with an overview of 2018 our results were largely driven by the strength and execution of our pulp and paperboard business strong demand which led to record production and shipments and hard work of our dedicated and innovative teams for the year we generated 1 7 billion in revenues flat versus 2017 and 177 million of adjusted ebitda down 7 from 2017 from a macro perspective clearwater paper operates in an incredibly dynamic environment that is undergoing tremendous change and as we ve said over the past months 2018 was a challenging year for the tissue side of the business and the overall industry however we made progress on the strategic priorities we established for 2018 some of our key accomplishments include implementing a regional operating model in our consumer products business which is beginning to produce results by taking millions of miles off the road and reducing external warehousing costs while we are in the early stages the team is making great progress in improving cpd margins second we accelerated the start up of our new converting lines in shelby north carolina which has also contributed to taking additional miles off the road and reducing transportation costs third we completed the sale of recycled tissue mill in ladysmith wisconsin which allows us to focus on our strategy of producing premium and ultra quality tissue for the retail market and fourth we continued to work on realizing the full benefits of our continuous pulp digester at our lewiston mill while we anticipate some headwinds to continue in 2019 which we ll discuss later on the call we believe our strategic investments and the improvements in our operations position us for future growth in a rapidly evolving market regarding our tissue business as you saw from our release we took a 195 million non cash impairment charge involving the write off of goodwill related to our acquisition of cellu tissue in 2010 this impairment charge is a result of an annual evaluation that took into account our projections of lowering price for certain tissue products lower converted case sales volumes a higher mix of parent roll sales and increased transportation and pulp costs that will continue for several quarters however we remain optimistic about the longer term fundamentals for the tissue business and the growing trend of consumer preference for private label brands it is important to note that the goodwill write off is a non cash charge and does not impact our current financial flexibility or the ability of our assets to generate future positive cash flows looking ahead to 2019 we are focused on the following to drive strong financial performance these areas include starting up the new paper machine at our shelby plant to fulfill customer contracts manufacturing quality products and optimizing the network to deliver on our operating expectations second maintaining the 10 million of run rate benefits related to the continuous digester and finalizing a solution for the catalyst and third continue focusing on generating cash flow and to begin paying down bank debt in the second half of the year i will provide further details on each of these initiatives later in today s prepared remarks now i ll turn the call over to john to discuss our financial results john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you linda let me start with a couple of high level comments on the full year 2018 and then get into specific comments about on q4 2018 was a challenging macro environment and we were adversely impacted by a competitive private label tissue market and significant commodity and transportation cost inflation in 2018 we saw 28 million of tissue price and mix erosion versus 2017 and 40 million of commodity and transportation cost inflation versus 2017 we were able to overcome a significant portion of those headwinds through cost reduction programs and productivity gains the lack of a major outage in 2018 and achieving higher selling prices in both businesses in the second half of the year during the year we delivered 177 million of adjusted ebitda which is 13 million lower than 2017 due to the price mix erosion and cost inflation previously mentioned cash flow from operations remained strong at 169 million approximately 10 of net sales before i turn to q4 i d like to preface my comments by stating that throughout the rest of my remarks i will be distinguishing between gaap and non gaap or adjusted results the reconciliation from gaap to adjusted results is provided in the press release and supplemental slides posted on our website for the full year the ebitda adjustments netted to 178 million of pre tax expense largely due to the 195 million non cash impairment charge due to of goodwill and 8 million in reorganization related expenses all partially offset by a 24 million gain on the sale of ladysmith mill and a 2 million mark to market benefit associated with directors cash settled common stock units in the fourth quarter of 2018 the ebitda adjustments netted to 195 million of pre tax expense largely due to the goodwill impairment charge now to the results q4 net sales were 429 million up 53 basis points from the third quarter and above the high end of our outlook range of down 100 to 300 basis points this was largely due to higher prices for both paperboard and tissue offset by lower tissue shipments from the sale of the ladysmith mill and lower seasonal demand fourth quarter adjusted gross margin of 10 9 was down 95 basis points from q3 primarily due to planned recovery boiler water washes at both the idaho and arkansas mills higher volumes of purchased pulp due to previously discussed pulping process disruption at the idaho mill and higher natural gas prices due to a regionalized pipeline disruption that impacted the idaho mill adjusted sg a expense was 26 million in the fourth quarter which is flat versus q3 but down 4 million from q4 2017 reflecting a 16 million annual run rate benefit from our sg a cost reduction efforts corporate spending in the fourth quarter was 12 million of total sg a expense and flat with q3 adjusted operating income of 20 million or 4 8 margin came in above the midpoint of our fourth quarter outlook of 4 to 5 5 and was down from 5 8 in q3 adjusted operating margin was impacted by the same factors as gross margin as a result of all of that adjusted ebitda came in at 45 million or 10 6 of net sales which is at the high end of our outlook of 40 million to 46 million net interest expense of 7 million was flat with q3 turning to taxes on an adjusted basis our q4 effective tax rate was 37 9 which is above our outlook of 31 plus or minus a couple of points due to the tax impact of performance stock grants that did not vest that compares to a 39 5 tax benefit in the third quarter which included a 10 million tax benefit associated with an alternative energy production tax credit recorded in the quarter due to accelerated tax depreciation related to our capital projects we did not pay federal cash taxes in 2018 and do not expect to pay federal cash income taxes in 2019 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net earnings came in at 7 million or 0 44 per diluted share that compares to adjusted net earnings of 22 million or 1 35 per diluted share in the third quarter as the q3 tax provision was a net 6 million benefit non cash expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 included a 195 million goodwill write off 26 million of depreciation and amortization 2 million of net non cash pension and retiree medical expense and approximately 500 000 in equity based compensation expense now i will discuss the segment results consumer products net sales were 213 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 up 52 basis points versus the third quarter due to the implementation of previously announced price increases and a richer mix which was partially offset by the sale of ladysmith and seasonally lower demand consumer products generated 1 million of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter reversing the operating loss trend in the prior two quarters operating margin continues to improve with the implementation of operating model changes that reduced freight external warehousing costs and headcount to offset the weakened market conditions in retail tissue q4 consumer products adjusted ebitda margin of 60 million or 7 4 of net sales was up from 13 million or 6 3 in the third quarter turning to the pulp and paperboard division pulp and paperboard generated record high net sales of 216 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 53 basis points versus the third quarter average sales price per prime ph ton was flat to q3 as higher pricing from our previously announced price increases was offset by weaker mix pulp and paperboard s q4 adjusted operating income was 32 million or 14 7 of net sales compared to 38 million or 17 9 of net sales in the third quarter primarily due to weaker mix the recovery boiler water washes higher natural gas prices and the need to purchase higher amounts of external pulp now turning to the balance sheet balance sheet capital expenditures were 85 million in the fourth quarter and 338 million for the full year fourth quarter cash capital expenditures were 122 million and was 296 million in 2018 for 2019 we expect our balance sheet capital expenditures to total 80 million and we expect cash capital expenditures to be 130 million to 140 million we anticipate total capex for the shelby project to be approximately 420 million or 30 million higher than we estimated last quarter as the project is coming to a close our focus has been to make necessary investments to hold the timeline as best we could to meet our customers commitments these investments have allowed us to overcome recurring challenges similar to those we identified last quarter including weather related issues higher building material costs and a very tight construction labor market we had 1 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolver at the end of the quarter and 21 million of other short term debt long term debt outstanding at the end of q4 remain unchanged at 675 million the secured leverage ratio for covenant purpose was 0 99 times last 12 months adjusted ebitda versus a covenant of 2 times we expect total net debt to peak in late q1 early q2 timeframe depending on the timing of cash flows and begin decreasing thereafter short term debt outstanding as reported at the end at year end was impacted by certain supply chain financing transactions our supply chain financing programs allow vendors to be paid by financial intermediaries on trade payables earlier than the due date of the applicable invoices in cases where we reimburse those vendors for fees that may incur in connection with the supply chain financing program those invoices are classified as short term debt rather than trade payables there was 21 million of vendor invoices classified as short term debt at december 31 2018 primarily related to the accounting for that program and the appropriate classification of trade payables and short term debt on our balance sheet we expect to report material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 in our upcoming annual report on form 10 k there have been no material misstatements identified and previously filed financial statements as a result of the material weaknesses and we do not expect them to affect the timely filing of our 10 k remediation of those material weaknesses is expected to be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2019 moving on to capital allocation since completing the shelby project and then paying down the revolver is our top priority therefore we did not repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter approximately 30 million remains under the current stock repurchase authorization turning to liquidity we ended the fourth quarter with 22 million of unrestricted cash and we had 120 192 million available under the revolver during the fourth quarter we generated 48 million of cash from operating activities or a 11 1 of net sales that concludes my remarks and i will now turn the call back to linda linda k massman president chief executive officer and director thank you john let me now share more details regarding our strategic projects discuss the market environment and what we expect for our business segments finally i will conclude with our outlook for the first quarter and for the full year 2019 i ll start with our shelby expansion plan which is nearing completion and is scheduled to start producing paper in q2 we expect the total cost to complete this expansion will run approximately 420 million which is 80 million higher than the original estimate this is also an increase of 30 million versus what we had estimated as of q3 as john mentioned we experienced some of the same issues identified during the third quarter such as difficult weather conditions and higher cost of labor materials and construction also engineering became more specific as it relates to the equipment as we move through the last year of the project in addition we implemented new leadership at the plan to ensure that our strategy remains on track to meet our customer commitments and service our current customer volumes in fact all of the 2019 production from the new machine capacity is committed to existing customers our decision to take a more conservative approach and commission the paper machine in stages to ensure a smooth ramp up of production is what led to a slightly later start up before i move on i d like to thank the team for their hard work and dedication throughout this challenging process as expected the accelerated start up of the converting lines and regional warehouse continues to drive savings in transportation and external warehouse costs which ultimately contribute to the improved operating earnings trend in our consumer business we expect the new paper machine to be running at full capacity within 12 months all of the 2019 production volume has been earmarked to fill existing customer orders we expect initial ramp up costs in line with typical start up turning to the continuous pulp digester project in lewiston idaho the new digester is running well and our goal for 2019 is to maintain the 10 million annual run rate benefit achieved in 2018 we also continue to make progress in resolving the challenges with the associated polysulfide reactor currently we are evaluating and determining the appropriate catalyst to be tailored to our process and equipment specifications once we have received and installed the catalyst we ll then optimize the pulp making process to work toward achieving the remaining 20 million of cost benefits as a result we expect to realize the initial incremental benefits sometime in 2020 and last the most important we will continue our focus on generating operating cash flow to reduce debt levels turning to our view of the market environment for each of our businesses and starting with the north american tissue market our consumer products business continues to bring us a mix of opportunities and challenges while the competitive environment intensified as new capacity came online in 2018 the data suggests the consumer s acceptance and preference for private branded products continue to grow for 2018 the iri panel data estimated the us tissue market in dollar terms grew by 2 2 year over year driven by healthy growth in private brands which is up 9 3 versus a year ago this compares to national brands that were down 60 basis points over the same period as a result private brand tissue market share for 2018 was approximately 30 of the total retail tissue market up from 28 a year ago and 26 in 2015 the positive trend in private brands is reflected in the five year cagr of 3 6 for private brands versus negative 0 8 for national brands underlying the growth in private brands is a 12 7 five year cagr for ultra quality private brand products compared to 20 basis points for national brands in the premium quality category private brands experienced a 2 8 cagr over the last five year period compared to a negative 2 for the brands private brand share of total tissue products sold through the club mass and supercenters have continued to grow over the last five years while the grocery channel has stabilized and showed modest growth in 2018 by comparison the dollar and drug channels have experienced a decline over the same period in e commerce which is still relatively modest at less than 0 5 billion ph private brands grew to 24 2 of total tissue products sold over the internet in 2018 versus 15 5 in 2017 based on iri data clearwater paper s 2018 share of the total tissue market was 4 5 and our share of the private label portion of that market was 15 1 down from 2017 largely due to ultra quality capacity constraints we have been challenged by balancing our fixed ultra quality capacity with growth in our existing customer base and the addition of new customers so we are glad our new ultra capacity in shelby will come online shortly looking to 2019 risi estimates that the us tissue market will grow approximately 1 in line with long term trends and we believe the private label should continue to gain share the most current risi forecast for net new tissue capacity from 2019 through 2021 is 444 000 tons which is a decline of 55 000 tons from risi s forecast at the end of q3 due to recently announced mill closures over the next three years risi scheduled capacity additions forecast 231 000 tons coming online in 2019 a 136 000 tons in 2020 and 77 000 tons in 2021 assuming all of that capacity comes online as scheduled plus net imports of approximately 557 000 tons and using risi estimates for demand in north america the demand in north american capacity ratio in 2021 is forecasted to be approximately 97 turning to north american paperboard risi s outlook for 2019 is for a balanced market with operating rates averaging 96 for the year risi forecast demand for sbs to grow 4 5 in 2019 following growth of 2 2 in 2018 risi s forecast suggests that the incremental industry capacity is likely to be absorbed by a 2 7 forecasted uptick in domestic food service and liquid packaging approximately 7 growth in exports and a 2 decrease in imports 2019 prices published by risi are still forecasting certain grades of sbs to improve approximately 5 in 2019 consistent with healthy operating rates and the relative strength in the cuk and crb segments as for cuk garnering a price premium to sbs it is difficult to predict whether this trend will continue so far we are seeing seasonal backlog normal for this time of year for example if customers were to substitute in a less expensive substrates such as sbs for a cuk this could serve to tighten up the sbs market in terms of our capital allocation priorities in 2019 we expect our capital will be devoted to completion of the new tissue machine at our shelby facility with any excess cash being used to pay down debt now to our first quarter of 2019 outlook compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 we expect consolidated net sales to be down 1 to 2 sequentially primarily due to higher converted case shipments and improved mix in our consumer business offset by lower seasonal paperboard shipments consolidated adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 3 to 4 5 based on higher input cost for natural gas resulting from a disruption to one of the pipeline servicing our lewiston mill that has resulted in an unprecedented surge in natural gas prices in the quarter and an adjusted tax rate of 25 we expect this to result in adjusted ebitda in the range of 37 million to 43 million and adjusted net earnings per fully diluted share in the range of 0 16 to 0 40 we believe our first quarter outlook represents a pretty good baseline of our business for the remainder of 2019 except for the following items we expect natural gas prices to return to more normal levels starting in the second quarter through the fourth quarter which should reduce costs by 4 million to 5 million per quarter going forward and our planned major maintenance outages are scheduled for q3 in lewiston with an estimated cost of approximately 18 million and for q4 in cypress bend with an estimated cost of around 7 million as we look at clearwater paper in 2019 there are a number of variables whose final outcome will impact our financial performance those include our ability to produce the right quality products to meet customer demand input costs particularly pulp on the tissue side as well as natural gas and wood fiber on the paperboard side our ability to pass through cost inflation in ppd it s the outcome of our planned major maintenance outages in q3 and q4 the new domestic paperboard capacity coming online and foreign exchange rates and their impact on paperboard exports and imports and in cpd the effect of new entrants to the north american tissue market and channel shifts within retail tissue in conclusion 2019 will be a transitional year as we make necessary investments managed through ongoing headwinds and ramp production at shelby while current market conditions in our consumer business continue to be challenging near term we are encouraged that industry fundamentals in both the tissue and paperboard businesses bode well for the long term in closing i d like to thank our employees who are at the heart of clearwater paper for their commitment to always making our operation safer and more efficient while keeping a sharp focus on the needs of our customers i also want to thank our customers who make us better every day and for the support of our shareholders with that we ll now take your questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of chip dillon with vertical research your line is now open salvador tiano vertical research partners analyst hi guys this is salvador tiano sitting for chip how are you linda k massman president chief executive officer and director hi john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer okay how are you salvador tiano vertical research partners analyst i m good so a couple of questions i just look for lazy things which are on the how should we think a little bit about tissue i think last quarter there was you re maintaining high levels of parent roll tissue shipments in order offsetting essentially the kroger loss volumes and also this quarter a decline and i m wondering what does this mean as we go forward is this the q4 kind of the right mix to think about for the remaining of the year first of all and secondly the non retail pricing came up significantly and i wonder why that is is it because of lower again parent roll versus away from home shipments or what else drove that john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so the reduction in parent roll shipments was largely due to the fact that we sold ladysmith late in the third quarter and that was pretty much all parent roll shipments coming out of that facility salvador tiano vertical research partners analyst and with regard to the pricing non retail going up john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah and that just it s a function of not having the ladysmith in the mix because that was a it was recycled paper so we don t have as high as pricing on that salvador tiano vertical research partners analyst okay great and then a little bit to clarify on shelby you mentioned that the firstly on the start up you mentioned it is little bit delayed versus original expectations you mentioned now q2 when we think first of all q2 are we talking april 1 or we are talking june and secondly how are you now that you know essentially you re almost in the finish line but it seems the project was is not going to deliver an attractive return to the contrary given all the stress it puts on the equity value of the company i m not really sure it s added a lot of value how is the company thinking about how is the feedback process internally about making these decisions and making sure they are corrected and in the future large projects are taken a little bit with less risk making sure that you don t see the same issues that you saw right now where the leverage was really high you had to amend your covenants many times what is being done internally to make sure you re not going to see that again linda k massman president chief executive officer and director yeah so let s start with your first question regarding shelby and the start up and whether or not we can give more specificity other than just q2 i would say this time we re just saying we re going to start the tissue machine in q2 the slight difference from what we originally expected and the slight difference just being somewhat semantics on how we re starting up the machine we re really taking a very thorough and thoughtful approach to methodically commissioning all of the systems and ensuring that they work well together before we begin up the machine the capacity and the production coming out of the new investment in shelby is critical to our long term strategy to be able to meet our customer commitments as i talked about on the market trends we re seeing strong demand in the ultra category and this is also where we are capacity constrained so shelby will give us that extra capacity to be able to meet those customer commitments and as we indicated we already have customer contracts to meet our 2019 production so we feel so good about the ability to take care of what our customers are looking for from us and the investment in shelby you asked about the project and some of the extra spending and some of the surprises we ve had along the way i think anytime you re looking at a multi year project in an environment that is as dynamic as the tissue industry and one that has gone undergone so much change over the past few years it s always difficult to predict at the beginning of that kind of a project what kind of conditions you re going to be faced with going forward but your thoughts about how do we manage risk and how do we look at this going forward i would tell you we take that very seriously at a management level and at a board level with regard to making large capital investments in how we look at the risk how we ll manage through it our team has been actively engaged in trying to mitigate these cost increases that we ve seen as it relates to the economic conditions in which we re investing a lot of capital and a lot of these being cost of labor costs of construction material things that are somewhat difficult to avoid to keep a project on track and on time but i will tell you like any major project we will go back we will look at what could we have done better what could we have done differently and that will absolutely be taken into consideration to make us better going forward salvador tiano vertical research partners analyst great thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of roger spitz with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you and good afternoon john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer hi roger roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey i wanted to discuss a little further some of the reporting control weaknesses do you expect any impact on sales and ebitda and what were some of the key issues that you identified from this john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah we don t expect any impact on sales or ebitda it s a balance sheet reclassification within current liabilities i d refer back to my commentary that is associated with the supply chain financing and we ended up making a payment to a vendor and that shouldn t have happened and so the controls over that program in particular and over or call it judgmental complex accounting issues in general is where we need to take up those controls roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and you impaired cellu tissue for a variety of reasons you pointed to tissue pricing freight and other general market environment forces why wouldn t those adverse impacts cause you to impair the legacy clearwater paper assets or is there something about cellu tissue that was different than legacy clearwater obviously legacy clearwater was more ultra toilet ph tissue and cellu tissue was down toward the dollar but it sounds like these were sort of general market issues john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer they were general market issues impaired goodwill first and once that happened from a cash flow standpoint we had enough to support the remaining assets within the cpd division roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and lastly and i can take this offline and it just came up on ebt the transcript but you mentioned that there is balance sheet capex of 80 million which i guess i m taking that to mean that s what you re showing your cash flow statement and then you said there is cash capital expenditures of 130 million to 140 million which is the capex or what s the difference between those two numbers i m unfamiliar with that technical difficulty john d hertz senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah actually it s the opposite 130 million and 140 million is what it will show up on the cash flow statement but using accrual base accounting would actually hit property plant equipment on the balance sheet is the 80 million roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst oh you re referring to the pp e in the balance sheet okay got it all right thank you very much thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the clearwater paper fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018

the us recolonization of latin america and the war on venezuela by james petras al jazeerah ccun march 13 2019 venezuelan president nicolas maduro and wife cilia flores among supporters the western hemisphere is our region said michael pompei us secretary of state introduction not since the us pronounced the monroe doctrine proclaiming its imperial supremacy over latin america nearly 200 years ago has a white house regime so openly affirmed its mission to recolonize latin america the second decade of the 21st century has witnessed in word and deed the most thorough and successful us recolonization of latin america and its active and overt role as colonial sepoys of an imperial power in this paper we will examine the process of recolonization and the strategy tactics and goals which are the driving forces of colony building we will conclude by discussing the durability stability and washington s capacity to retain ownership of the hemisphere a brief history of 20 th century colonization and decolonization us colonization of latin america was based on direct us military economic cultural and political interventions with special emphasis on central america north america mexico and the caribbean washington resorted to military invasions to impose favorite trade and investment advantages and appointed and trained local military forces to uphold colonial rule and to ensure submission to us regional and global supremacy the us challenged rival european colonial powers in particular england and germany and eventually reduced them to marginal status through military and economic pressure and threats the recolonization process suffered severe setbacks in some regions and nations with the onset of the great depression which undermined the us military and economic presence and facilitated the rise of powerful nationalist regimes and movements in particular in argentina brazil chile nicaragua and cuba the process of decolonization led to and included the nationalization of us oil fields sugar and mining sectors a shift in foreign policy toward relatively greater independence and labor laws which increased workers rights and leftwing unionization the us victory in world war ii and its economic supremacy led washington to re assert its colonial rule in the western hemisphere the latin american regimes lined up with washington in the cold and hot wars backing the us wars against china korea vietnam and the confrontation against the ussr and eastern europe for washington working through its colonized dictatorial regimes invaded every sector of the economy especially agro minerals it proceeded to dominate markets and sought to impose colonized trade unions run by the imperial centered afl cio by the early 1960 s a wave of popular nationalist and socialist social movements challenged the colonial order led by the cuban revolution and accompanied by nationalist governments throughout the continent including argentina bolivia venezuela peru ecuador and the dominican republic us multi national manufacturing firms were forced to engage in joint ventures or were nationalized as were oil mineral and energy sectors nationalists proceeded to substitute local products for imports as a development strategy a process of decolonization was underway the us reacted by launching a war to recolonize latin america by through military coups invasions and rigged elections latin america once more lined up with the us in support of its economic boycott of cuba and the repression of nationalist governments the us reversed nationalist policies and denationalized their economies under the direction of us controlled so called international financial organizations like the international monetary fund imf world bank wb inter american development bank the recolonization process advanced throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s under the auspices of newly imposed military regimes and the new neo liberal free market doctrine once again recolonization led to highly polarized societies in which the domestic colonized elites were a distinct minority moreover the colonial economic doctrine allowed the us banks and investors to plunder the latin countries impose out of control debt burdens de industrialization of the economies severe increases in unemployment and a precipitous decline in living standards by the early years of the 21st century deepening colonization led to an economic crisis and the resurgence of mass movements and new waves of nationalist popular movements which sought to reverse at least in part the colonial relationship and structures colonial debts were renegotiated or written off a few foreign firms were nationalized taxes were increased on agro exporters increases in public welfare spending reduced poverty public investment increased salaries and wages a process of de colonization advanced aided by a boom in commodity pieces twenty first century decolonization was partial and affected only a limited sector of the economy it mainly increased popular consumption rather than structural changes in property and financial power de colonization co existed with colonial power elites the major significant changes took place with regard to regional policies decolonizing elites established regional alliance which excluded or minimized the us presence regional power shifted to argentina and brazil in mercosur venezuela in central america and the caribbean ecuador and bolivia in the andean region but as history has demonstrated imperial power can suffer reverses and lose collaborators but while the us retains its military and economic levers of power it can and will use all the instruments of power to recolonize the region in a step by step approach incorporating regions in its quest for hemisphere supremacy the recolonization of latin america brazil argentina and the lima pact against venezuela as the first decade of the 21st century unfolded numerous latin american governments and movements began the process of decolonization displacing us client regimes taking the lead in regional organizations diversifying their markets and trading partners nevertheless the leaders and parties were incapable and unwilling to break with local elites tied to the us colonization project vulnerable to downward movements in commodity prices composed of heterogeneous political alliances and unable to create or deepen anti colonial culture the us moved to reconstruct its colonial project the us struck first at the weakest link of the decolonization process the us backed coups in honduras and paraguay then washington turned to converting the judiciary and congress as stepping stones for launching a political attack on the strategic regimes in argentina and brazil and turning secondary regimes in ecuador chile peru and el salvador into the us orbit as the recolonization process advanced the us regained its dominance in regional and international organizations the colonized regimes privatized their economies and washington secured regimes willing to assume onerous debts previously repudiated the us advances in recolonization looked toward targeting the oil rich dynamic and formidable anti colonial government in venezuela venezuela was targeted for several strategic reasons first venezuela under president chavez opposed us regional and global colonial ambitions secondly caracas provided financial resources to bolster and promote anti colonial regimes throughout latin america especially in the caribbean and central america thirdly venezuela invested in and implemented a profound and comprehensive state social agenda building schools and hospitals with free education and health care subsidized food and housing socialist democratic venezuela contrasted with the us abysmal dismantling of the welfare state among the reconstructed colonial states fourthly venezuela s national control over natural resources especially oil was a strategic target in the washington imperial agenda while the us successfully reduced or eliminated venezuela s allies in the rest of latin america its repeated efforts to subdue venezuela failed an abortive coup was defeated as was a referendum to impeach president chavez us boycotts and the bankrolling of elections failed to oust the venezuelan government washington was unable to pressure and secure the backing of the mass of the population or the military coup techniques successful in imposing colonial regimes elsewhere failed the us turned to a multi prong continent wide covert and overt military political economic and cultural war the white house appointed juan guaido a virtual unknown as interim president guaido was elected to congress with 25 of the vote in his home district washington spent millions of dollars in promoting guaido and funding ngos and self styled human rights organization to slander the venezuelan government and launch violent attacks on the security forces the white house rounded up its recolonized regimes in the region to recognize guaido as the legitimate president washington recruited several leading european union countries especially the uk france and germany to isolate venezuela the us sought to penetrate and subvert the venezuelan populace via so called humanitarian aid refusing to work through the red cross and other independent organizations the white house fixed the weekend of feb 23 24 as the moment to oust president maduro it was a total unmitigated failure putting the lie to all of washington s fabrications the us claimed the armed forces would defect and join with the us funded opposition only a hundred or so out of 260 000 did so the military remained loyal to the venezuelan people the government and the constitution despite bribes and promises washington claimed the people in venezuela would launch an insurrection and hundreds of thousands would cross the border apart from a few dozen street thugs tossing molotov cocktails there was no uprising and less than a few hundred tried to cross the border tons of us aid remained in the colombian warehouses the brazilian border patrol sent the us funded protestors packing for blocking free passage across the frontier even us provocateurs who incinerated two trucks carrying aid were exposed the vehicles in flames remained on the colombian side of the border us sponsored boycotts of venezuelan oil exports partially succeed because washington illegaly seized venezuelan export revenues the recolonized lima group passed hostile resolutions and re anointed trump s president guaido but few voters in the region took their pronouncements serious conclusion what are the colonized states expected to serve why has the white house failed to recolonize venezuela as it did in the rest of latin america the recolonized states in latin america serve to open their markets to us investors on easy terms with low taxes and social and labor costs and political and economic stability based on repression of popular class and national struggles colonized regimes are expected to support us boycotts coups and invasions and to supply military troops as ordered colonized regimes take the us side in international conflicts and negotiations in regional organizations they vote with the us and meet debt payments on time and in full the recolonized nations ensure favorable results for washington by manipulating elections and judicial decisions and by excluding anti colonial candidates and officials and arresting political activists the colonized regimes anticipate the needs and demands of washington and introduce resolutions on their behalf in regional organizations in the case of venezuela they promote and organize regional bloc like the lima group to promote us led intervention as washington proceeds to destabilize venezuela the colonized allies recycle us mass media propaganda and offer sanctuaries for opposition defectors and refugees in sum the recolonized elites facilitate domestic plunder and overseas conquests venezuela success in resisting and defeating the us drive for reconquest is the result of nationalist and socialist leaders who re allocate private wealth and re distribute public expenditures to the workers peasants and the unemployed under president chavez venezuela recruited and promoted military and security forces loyal to the constitutional order and in line with a popular socio economic and anti colonial agenda venezuela ensured that elections and judicial appointments were free and in line with the politics of the majority the venezuelans ensured that military advisers were independent of us military missions and aid agencies which plot coups and are disloyal to the nationalist state venezuelan social democracy its social advances and the massive reduction of poverty and inequality contributed to reinforcing commitments to endogenous cultural values and national sovereignty despite the us accumulation of colonial vassals throughout latin america and europe venezuela has consolidated mass support despite washington s capture of the global mass media it has not influenced popular opinion on a world scale despite us threats of a military option it lacks global support in the face of prolonged and large scale resistance washington hesitates in addition the latin americans colonized states face domestic social and economic crises and political resistance europe confronts a regional break up washington is riven by partisan divisions and a constitutional crisis the failure of the imperialist ultra s in washington to defeat venezuela can set in motion a new wave of decolonization struggles which can force the us to look inward and downward in order to decolonize its own electorate share

first published by iss today africa s history is laced with decades of colonial exploitation which together with developmental assistance programmes such as the international monetary fund s structural adjustment initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s has had debilitating consequences fast forward to the early 2000s and china s strategic interests in africa become more pronounced the asian superpower is in search of resources like oil gas and metals to meet its energy imports and construction demand and to sustain its manufacturing industry more recently china has branched into non resource investments like building infrastructure through the road and belt initiative african leaders have embraced economic engagement with china which is perceived as a welcome alternative to the continent s long standing euro american ties that often came with demanding conditions africa s relationship with china has offered significant benefits particularly in bridging the continent s infrastructure deficit owing to the no conditionality policy many african countries have turned to china as the partner of choice however the relationship is increasingly showing some characteristics evident during colonialism raising questions about the true cost of the benefits africa is getting from china only as recently as 2015 did china start visibly focusing on the commercial and viability aspects of their investments the africa china cost benefit conundrum partly lies in the terms for collateral on loans china has effectively mastered the intricacies of long term collateralisation of assets and resources it takes the form of a barter system in return for investment capital and infrastructure some countries grant china resource concessions allow it to take an ownership stake in the infrastructure projects or secure loans against their natural resources and assets as collateral the number of african countries indebted to china and subsequently handing over their assets or resources are in no short supply zambia angola the democratic republic of the congo drc mozambique ethiopia sudan kenya and djibouti are just some in zambia reports indicate that china is already in control of the country s broadcasting company and the state is preparing to offer its national electricity company to china as security against a loan china has proposed taking over the kenneth kaunda airport in lusaka if zambia cannot meet its loan repayment commitments the extent of zambia s debt is unclear and without exact figures public conversation has been fuelled by fear china also has direct equity interests in copper coal and manganese reserves similarly madagascar pledged a huge portion of its land as collateral for loans in the drc in return for the 9 billion loan to upgrade road and rail systems that connect routes to extractive industries china gained rights to extract up to 10 million tons of copper and 420 000 tons of cobalt over 15 years in djibouti by the end of 2016 82 of external debt was owed to china and the country handed over control of its port which sits in a strategic location that acts as a main access point for american french italian and japanese bases in the country china might get a 99 year lease with a 70 stake the lamu port in kenya could also be under threat kenya is expected to default on its loan repayment terms and be forced to hand over the adjoining towns and the biggest port in east africa to china for 99 years china could also take over some of the country s mineral assets if kenya defaults on payments for the acclaimed standard gauge railway from mombasa to nairobi most of the projects undertaken by china are capital intensive ventures like ports railway lines roads and even airports rarely does it invest in more basic amenities like sanitation programmes china then reclaims and runs the assets for profit when countries default the loans are big and the terms leave sub saharan africa with little revenue of their own from commodity production while increasing their debt levels multilateral organisations like the african development bank the world bank and last resort lenders like the imf generally give loans at lower than market rates however the china africa research initiative which tracks chinese financing indicates that the sources of loans range from china s ministry of commerce to policy banks like the export import bank of china private commercial banks and state owned enterprises some of these loans have terms comparable to the normal commercial market rates the world bank classifies 18 sub saharan countries as being in high risk of debt distress ie having debt gdp ratio above 50 currently 20 of africa s external debt is owed to china making it the largest single creditor nation china has established a clear footprint in sub saharan africa and continues to make inroads among countries with relatively weak governance structures and a lack of transparency and accountability there is nothing inherently wrong about africa engaging with china every country acts in their best interests china has just become more efficient in exploiting the continent than the west every country should do its due diligence when entering into a loan agreement with any entity the feasibility of projects needs to be assessed and the best possible terms for loans negotiated states must ensure funds are used efficiently and for the projects they were intended if a loan cannot guarantee return on investment it is probably not wise to take it in the first place it is on this score that africa s political leaders are failing the continent by allowing the continued plunder of its assets and resources dm stellah kwasi is a researcher african futures and innovation iss pretoria

brexit all scenarios remain on the table riksbank bye bye hikes stocks mixed as markets await trade and brexit clarity oil us trims crude output forecast for first time in 6 months gold rising on tame inflation and trade deal uncertainty brexit following yesterday s crushing rejection of prime minister may s divorce deal parliament will vote on whether they will have a hard exit or allow themselves

29th the eu believes may s second defeat raises the risk of a no deal brexit if parliament s votes go as planned it will be up to the eu and all 27 members to approve an extension this is the biggest

throughout brexit and many are amazed she has last this long there is no high certainty on how we will see the uk eventually agree on a divorce deal but it may have to involve her offering to step down the risk of second referendum is growing and brexiteers do not want risk losing brexit after an extension is voted on one scenario could see the uk agreeing on a deal in the coming months that is accompanied with may s resignation everyone wants brexit clarity but a lengthy delay could see a second referendum that would take almost a couple of months to set up the british pound was the best

members that production cuts will be extended to year end is still the main catalyst for keeping west texas intermediate crude above the 57 00 level ahead of today s eia crude inventory report which is expected to deliver a build of 2 6 million barrels the weekly api reading saw inventories decline by 2 6 million barrels if today s eia reading shows inventories decline that would be the second decline in three weeks the longer we see crude unable to break above the february highs the more impatient we could see bullish bets become gold benign inflation in the us was the spark plug needed to get gold back above the 1 300 an ounce level the precious metal struggled for gains over the past couple weeks as optimism was high that we were going to see a trade deal delivered with a mid march meeting between presidents trump and xi financial markets are still pricing in a trade deal but it appears the timeline is being pushed back towards april
by modern diplomacy by tridivesh singh maini there has been a growing scepticism with regard to the belt and road initiative bri project in many quarters due to the lack of transparency with regards to terms and conditions as well as the economic implications for countries which are part of the project a report published by the center for global development cgd washington in april 2018 flagged 8 countries including pakistan maldives laos and djibouti where the level of debts are unsustainable apart from red flag raised by a number of researchers the removal of pro china leadership in countries like malaysia maldives and sri lanka has also resulted in the problems of the bri project and china s economic dealings which are clearly skewed in favour of beijing with other countries drawing more attention the most vocal critic of china s economic links has been by malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad during a visit to china in august 2018 mahathir not known to mince his words while alluding to china s trade relations with poorer countries could lead to a new version of colonialism mahathir later on denied that his statement was targeted at china or the bri the fact is that the malaysian prime minister did scrap projects estimated at well over 20 billion usd which includes a rail project east coast link as well as two gas pipelines top officials in the trump administration including us vice president mike pence have also been critical of the bri project for a variety of reasons the major criticism from us policy makers has been the economic unsustainability of the project as well as the point that the project is skewed in favour of china italy to join bri as the debate carries on with regard to the bri no body can ignore the fact that italy the world s 8th largest economy is likely to become the only g7 country to join the bri during chinese president xi jinping s visit to italy later this month march 22 24 a memorandum of understanding mou and could be signed senior officials in the government have been cautious and have emphasised on the fact that the mou would be non binding commenting on the status of the mou undersecretary in italy s economic development ministry michele geraci stated it is possible that it will be concluded in time for visit geraci a sinophile who has spent a fair amount of time in china is said to be driving the ruling coalition s policy the five star movement m5s and right leaning lega joined hands to form a government in june 2018 towards china italian pm giueseppe conte while addressing a seminar in genoa made the point that while joining bri would open new opportunities and horizons for italy rome was likely to be cautious and would not do anything in haste current state of italy china relations if one were to look at the state of china italy bilateral relations china italy bilateral trade reached nearly 50 billion usd in 2017 china is italy s largest trading partner in asia it would be pertinent to point out that ties between both countries are not restricted to the economic sphere there has also been a rise in chinese tourists visiting italy over 1 5 million annually even in the sphere of education linkages between both countries are rising as of 2017 there were over 6 000 students italian students in china and nearly 20 000 chinese students in italy the current government has given immense attention to china and there have been 3 high level visits ever since the ruling coalition took over the reigns last june senior officials who visited include italy s finance minister giovanni tria geraci and deputy prime minister luigi di maio who also holds the charge of economic development minister the italian pm is also likely to attend the second belt and road forum to be held in beijing in april 2019 the clear objective of becoming part of bri according to senior officials is to get access for its goods and to also leverage its geo political location within europe during his visit to china in september 2018 the italian deputy pm had spoken in favour of italy joining the project the deputy pm who had gone to attend the 17th western china international fair had made the point that italy was identifying the possible avenues for participation in the project and that the g7 country could benefit immensely if it successfully harnessed it s own economic and geographical strengths in 2018 the inaugural meeting of italy s china task force was held in rome this is headed by michele geraci the key objectives of this task force are to give an impetus to bilateral economic cooperation to give a boost to chinese investments in italy giving a push to italian exports to china cooperation in research and development and also to explore how italian companies could seek financing under the bri initiative italy has also been seeking to expand cooperation with china in africa the argument is that african growth will help in putting a check on immigration to italy interestingly former pm paolo gentiloni had urged eu and us to invest more in africa and to counter china s growing influence scepticism with regard to italy china economic relations while the government has unequivocally spoken out in favour of this decision many argue that italy will need to develop it s own infrastructure especially the rail system if it needs to benefit significantly from bri given italy s current fiscal situation too much investment into infrastructure seems highly unlikely with china having invested in piraeus greece it is important that the venice port becomes more competitive this will require not just economic investments but strategic thinking there are those who also argue that the current italian government has given too much attention to beijing at the cost of relations with other countries the china policy it is argued will also have an adverse impact on eu s common china policy unlike other western countries italy has not given a very strong reaction on the huawei controversy italian deputy prime minister was quick to state that we are in no way tilting the geopolitical axis italian pm also made it clear that while italy will join the bri it will ensure that this benefits both and that eu norms and values are not forgotten it is argued that by reaching out to euro skeptics in eu beijing is trying to create divisions within the bloc countries like hungary and greece which are being increasingly dependent upon china have taken a different stance from other eu countries on issues such as the south china sea and human rights violations the eu has been critical of the bri it has even come up with its own version of bri in september 2018 eu s strategy for connecting europe and asia senior eu officials including high representative vice president federica mogherini made it clear that eu s strategy was to enhance connect between europe and asia and to ensure it was beneficial for both the project would also take into account financial and environmental sustainability us reaction to italy joining bri us also took note of italy joining bri as expected the us was critical of italy s decision to join the bri a white house national security council spokesperson garrett marquis in a media interview stated we view bri as a made by china for china initiative as mentioned earlier senior members of the trump administration too have flagged the shortcomings of the bri project and how the dependence of certain countries in asia and africa is rising conclusion it is important for countries within the eu as well as other countries sceptical of the bri to adopt a more pragmatic stance towards italy s decision one must also keep in mind the fact that while speaking about signing an mou with china it has left room for manouevre it is also important for countries vary of increasing chinese influence to themselves stand up for liberal values and greater economic integration one of the reasons for beijing s increasing economic clout is increasing the inward looking economic policies being adopted by a number of countries not just the us at the january 2017 world economic forum wef chinese president xi jinping had warned against the increasing scepticism with regard to globalisation said the chinese president some people blame economic globalization for the chaos in our world economic globalization was once viewed as the treasure cave found by ali baba in the arabian nights but now it has become the pandora s box very few leaders have spoken up on this issue forcefully enough similarly if the us has flagged problems of the bri it should be willing to invest in an alternative narrative so far even if one were to look about the narrative of a free and fair indo pacific washington has not made significant financial commitment in july 2018 the trump administration did make a commitment of 113 million usd for areas like energy digital economy and infrastructure while it is believed that the us idfc international development finance corporation created through build better utilisation of investment leading to development act may be able to give the much required boost to some important connectivity projects but it s total budget estimated at 60 billion usd pales in comparison to china s budget the only country which has attempted to put up a cohesive alternative to bri is japan s partnership for quality infrastructure pqi japan along with asian development bank will be providing over 100 billion usd 50 billion from japan and 50 billion from adb for infrastructure in asia japan s economic presence in africa is also steadily rising though it is assisting africa in a number of other areas like health education through tokyo international conference on african development ticad which is co hosted by the government of japan the world bank united nations development programme undp the african union commission and the united nations while it is true that globalization may not be perfect and some scholars went overboard but there is also no denying the point that populist policies which have favoured economic isolationism may have helped in achieving political successes but their limitations are beginning to show in the economic sphere it is for this reason that even leaders like mahathir who are critical of chinese projects have stated that if he were to chose between china and an unpredictable us he would choose the latter italy on its part must be cautious and should astutely balance its own interests and not allow beijing to have a free run differences with the eu should not lead to italy and other countries becoming excessively dependent upon china there is no denying the fact that italy s acceptance of the bri has important implications which go well beyond eu about the author tridivesh singh maini is a new delhi based policy analyst associated with the jindal school of international affairs op jindal

the idea that the us is anxiously poring over every twist and turn of brexit so that negotiations can be started on an exclusive trade deal is fiction the us administration is more interested in weakening the eu as it drives towards the trump ideals of economic nationalism bilateral trade deals and maga make america great again a euphemism for protectionism dismantling regulations and lowering standards the us wants two of the biggest industry groups pharmaceuticals and agriculture who are powerful lobbyists on capitol hill to be let loose in the uk progressive americans think the british have taken leave of their senses republicans but not many have some sympathy for the mess their sister conservative party has got itself into but most americans are oblivious to the brexit

this is a tale of two countries one desperate to court favour with america at any cost and another which is marginally interested in a trade deal but on their terms trumps commerce secretary says brexit is a god given opportunity to take trade from uk picture al drago getty the uk isn t listening to what wilbur ross commerce secretary in trump s cabinet woody johnson us ambassador to britain and president trump are saying it is ignoring history and refusing to accept that america has moved on too much trust has been invested in international trade secretary liam fox who is out of his depth and remains the most worrying ideologue in theresa may s cabinet hard line brexiteers seem willing to pay any price to see the us and uk closer together regardless of the consequences the market must win fox was even quoted as saying he doesn t like politics getting in the way of economics so why are we so obsessed about looking to the us for a trade lifeline history helps winston churchill in his famous sinews of peace speech in missouri in 1946 used the phrase the special relationship and argued for an even closer one but that was 73 years ago and things have changed the strength of this uk us relationship was reinterpreted by obama obama suggested america had many special relationships and britain should be seen in that context the hard message of not even being first amongst equals now we have a president who doesn t believe in relationships only deals and partnerships of convenience all designed to make america great again confirming the extent of his delusional nostalgia fox said in november last year that the relationship between the uk and us had been special for many years but brexit has given us a once in a generation opportunity to raise it to a new level there is no evidence to support this amid talk of an anglosphere and a new special relationship the us ambassador could only say the us is ready to get to work britain has learned nothing from history a speech by former us secretary of state dean acheson in november 1962 still rings true great britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role the attempt to play a separate power role that is a role apart from europe a role based on a special relationship with the united states a role based on being head of a commonwealth which has no political structure or unity or strength this role is about played out he said acheson was right about britain then and now the lure of greatness is diminishing britain trump like fox thinks a country should be run as a company the cabinet is the board of directors and trump has even made it a bit of a family firm his cabinet is packed out with billionaires and millionaires doing his bidding up to their eyes in incompetence or corruption or both and having little respect for the nuances of governing or the sensitivities of the governed advertisement hide ad advertisement hide ad wilbur ross is the perfect fit for this approach he was recently declared the winner of a new york times competition to find the worst of the worst in trump s cabinet the idea of trump johnson ross and fox handling the future of a us uk trade deal is scary to say the least our trade secretary must take a much wider and more informed view of the realities of being dependent on the us seismic problems now facing the us are a reminder of the massive debt and deficit crisis now being created by trump and the republicans the us has just posted a record trade deficit of 891 billion a record breaking national debt figure of 22 trillion and a budget deficit up 77 per cent on the previous year of 310 billion largely caused by massive 1 5 trillion tax reductions any benefits from a trade deal with the uk will be one way they say the devil is in the detail in view of the stance adopted by the trump administration any trade deal will have to be forensically examined this will be difficult bearing in mind the fact that the uk government does not have the capacity skills or experience to do this as brussels has shouldered this responsibility for decades billionaire investor ross is the one to watch he has described brexit as a god given opportunity to take trade from the uk ross has also attacked burdensome and unnecessary eu labelling requirements and argued for the uk to allow car manufacturers to self certify that vehicles meet safety standards he wants the uk to drop any forms of regulatory alignment with the eu and has hinted there will be no deal with the us if this doesn t happen fox is desperate for a deal but ross sees it as a minor issue a potentially dangerous position for the uk to be in finally there is the madness of trump his unpredictability the chaos of the white house and his fantasy deal making the treatment of canada and mexico over the north american free trade agreement the abandoning of the trans pacific partnership his trade war with china the arbitrary imposition of steel tariffs scrapping the iran nuclear deal and removing the us from the paris agreement on climate change all speak volumes about why you wouldn t want to trust trump

introduction and summary turkey has experienced other mass in migrations in the past century including the arrival of 350 000 greek muslims in the immediate aftermath of the 1923 population exchange agreement with greece 3 and 340 000 ethnic turks expelled by bulgaria in 1989 4 overall between 1923 the year turkey was founded and 1990 at least 1 4 million people immigrated to turkey primarily from the balkans but also from the caucasus and central asia 5 but the influx of syrians is different in its size and nature from these previous population influxes these earlier immigrations involved groups who were either ethnic turks themselves or in the case of many arrivals from the balkans the black sea and central asia non turkish sunni muslims open to assimilation into turkish society after a generation these immigrants were absorbed into the turkish melting pot and largely integrated into turkish society 6 the arrival of 4 million syrian refugees is changing turkish society and will continue to do so for at least a generation 1 the process of turkish syrian mutual adaptation is only the latest chapter of transformation in a society that has undergone significant internal and external migrations in past decades in 1980 a clear majority of turks lived in rural areas today turkey s population is three quarters urban syrian refugees are reinforcing this trend with some 96 percent of them residing in urban or semiurban areas 2 while most turks hope all the syrians will eventually return to syria that prospect looks unrealistic sizable numbers of syrians are indeed likely to remain the issue of their remaining is politically explosive in turkey and the turkish government has been hesitant to acknowledge publicly that it foresees the long term integration of the refugees into turkish society in fact bowing to public sentiment turkish leaders often proclaim that all syrians will ultimately return to syria and they are likely to express this sentiment repeatedly as march 31 nationwide local elections approach yet whether by default or by design the government seems to have begun gradually implementing a policy of integration suggesting that regardless of their public declarations turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan and other key leaders realize that many syrians are in turkey to stay ultimately turkish society may view integration as necessary for social harmony and recognize that if integration is to be successful it must be pursued as early and thoroughly as possible turkey s future stability may depend on such decisions turkish identity has a clear ethnic and religious coloration however this is sufficiently blended with the concept of citizenship that most sunni muslims who are willing to do so can easily assume unfettered turkish identity over time 7 the great exception has been the turkish kurds while they are overwhelmingly sunni muslims and hold turkish citizenship many probably most resist assuming turkishness as their primary identity in large part this is because they have a clear ethnic identity as kurds a distinctive language a geographical area of concentration within turkey and most important a sense of common destiny they also have a sizable population in turkey which strengthens their ability to resist turkification psychologically and politically like kurds syrian arabs are sunni muslims but are ethnically linguistically and arguably culturally distinctive from turks should they remain in turkey in significant numbers like kurds they will probably feel less pressure to integrate than have other smaller sunni muslim groups over the years background in sum by its national law turkey is obliged to admit non europeans who fit the geneva definition of a refugee but it accords them fewer rights than those inherent in full fledged refugee status since it does not apply the 1951 geneva convention to them in any case a commitment based on national law rather than international obligation is inherently easier to change and therefore less binding in 2016 turkey amended the lfip to facilitate deportations of temporary protection individuals associated with terrorism 34 in principle this seems to accord with article 32 of the geneva convention which allows for expulsion of refugees for reasons of national security or public order following due process 35 it appears turkey did in some cases accord due process but certainly not in all 36 another potentially important difference is that under article 11 of the tpr turkey reserves the right to terminate the temporary protection regime collectively or under article 12 individually thus theoretically it seems turkey could send the syrians back to syria at any time notwithstanding its pledge of nonrefoulement and in many individual cases it has done just that ankara formalized its temporary protection regime with article 91 of its lfip passed in april 2013 and its temporary protection regulation tpr issued in october 2014 31 the tpr includes a right to health and education for those under protection just as geneva does for refugees there are some differences however under the tpr syrians need turkish government granted permits in order to work legally in the country as discussed elsewhere in this paper 32 as applied this system drives most syrian workers into the underground economy and leaves them open to exploitation in contrast article 24 of the 1951 geneva convention guarantees refugees a right to work that is essentially equivalent to that of the host country s citizens 33 as part of the october 2011 temporary protection regime ankara pledged that it would welcome all people crossing the syrian border to seek safety in turkey that it would provide for their humanitarian needs and that it would not force any such people to return against their will 30 this last point a bow to the well known geneva principle of nonrefoulement turkey largely honored these pledges until it became overwhelmed by the large number of syrians and by a breakdown in security in the middle of the decade at first turkish officials were careful to refer to the refugees from syria strictly as guests lest they inadvertently suggest that the syrians were refugees with geneva convention rights in october 2011 however the turkish government announced that it would consider them as people under temporary protection and the use of the term guests came to be used less in both formal and informal discourse 28 with turkey having begun to establish its own structure for managing the syrians turkish officials began to use the terms refugees and guests interchangeably apparently now less concerned that their use of refugee would be confused with geneva protections 29 turkish media also generally refers to the syrians as refugees the geneva convention which sets out refugees rights and obligations initially applied only to pre 1951 refugees not to future refugees moreover signatories were given the option of applying it to all refugees or only to european refugees turkey opted for the latter thus establishing a geographic limitation the 1967 additional protocol relating to the status of refugees removed these temporal and geographic restrictions but it grandfathered the right of 1951 signatories such as turkey that had chosen the europe only option to continue to adhere to that geographic limitation 27 in this report the term refugee will be used generically to refer to syrians who crossed the border from syria seeking safety in turkey it should be noted however that turkey does not consider any of them refugees in the legal sense as defined in the 1951 geneva convention relating to the status of refugees 26 indeed of the 6 4 million syrians who have fled their country since april 2011 nearly two thirds or 64 percent are residing in turkey remarkably some 15 percent of syria s pre syrian civil war residents now live in turkey 25 according to the united nation s refugee agency the u n high commissioner for refugees unhcr as of february 7 2019 there were a total of 3 644 342 registered syrian refugees in turkey 22 in addition there are likely hundreds of thousands of unregistered syrian refugees in turkey probably amounting to more than 4 million in total 23 these refugees have since spread well beyond the border regions and now reside in all of turkey s 81 provinces 24 at least in part because of the restrictive new measures registered syrian refugee arrivals appear to have ebbed in recent years 20 the annual increase in the registered syrian refugee population arrivals plus births minus deaths and departures declined to 352 000 in 2016 while that number spiked to 569 000 in 2017 it dipped to 198 000 in 2018 the smallest increase since 2012 in 2018 the majority of newly registered syrian refugees were clearly newborns not arrivals from across the increasingly impermeable border 21 in 2016 there were also more frequent reports of turkey closing its syrian border entirely and of turkish border guards shooting at would be refugees to prevent them from crossing such reports continue to this day 18 according to human rights watch as of january 2018 nearly 1 7 million syrian displaced people were residing in makeshift camps on the syrian side of the syrian turkish border 19 turkey took other steps as well in 2016 in order to limit the number of refugees and gain control over the composition of the refugee flow it ended its visa free policy for syrians arriving by air and sea and it began building a security barrier along its syrian border 16 it also amended its 2013 law on foreigners and international protection lfip to allow deportation of those deemed to be associated with terrorism or otherwise constituting a threat to public order 17 turkey made occasional efforts to bring its border and the refugee flow under closer control sporadic border closings occurred as early as 2012 for example however it was not until a series of deadly terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016 which claimed hundreds of turkish and tourist lives 14 that the government began serious efforts to limit the refugee flow prior to 2016 the turkish government had occasionally closed its border but generally allowed would be refugees to enter at all points along the border that changed starting in 2016 turkey began consistently to tighten and frequently close its border leaving countless syrians on the other side in makeshift camps clamoring for entry as one element of this tightening it began to require that syrians entering turkey by land do so only through official border posts to enable border guards to screen more effectively for security threats those who failed to comply with this requirement would be at risk of entering the country illegally under turkey s new policies and thus liable for return to syria 15 turkish leaders initially thought the refugee flow would be limited and temporary by the end of 2011 turkey was hosting just 8 000 registered syrian refugees and several thousand had returned home after the situation in syria briefly appeared to stabilize 10 in mid 2012 however a collapse of ceasefire efforts and surge in fighting triggered a torrent of refugee arrivals that would continue for nearly four years 11 in august 2012 turkey said it could take no more than a total of 100 000 syrians yet by october the number of refugees had surpassed that once unthinkable mark 12 the number of newly registered syrian refugees in turkey which includes arrivals plus births in each respective year was roughly 140 000 in 2012 412 000 in 2013 1 062 000 in 2014 and 881 000 in 2015 13 by then it was abundantly clear that the flow was neither limited nor temporary the syrian refugee crisis in turkey is as old as the syrian civil war the first group of 252 syrian refugees arrived in turkey in april 2011 just weeks after syrian president bashar al assad s response to anti regime demonstrations throughout syria turned violent at that time syrians could enter turkey without a visa 8 and ankara soon announced it would pursue an open door policy for the refugees 9 in effect any syrian who made it to turkey through any means would be welcome finally in october 2011 the turkish government announced that the refugees would be given temporary protection status return to syria unlikely according to turkish officials all of the returns have been voluntary although some have resulted from the turkish government s urging refugees to visit their syrian homes during religious holidays with some as envisioned by the turkish government deciding to stay 47 some turkish municipalities also organize and pay for buses to take syrian refugees on a voluntary basis it is always said to the syrian border or into the part of northern syria occupied by turkey 48 a unhcr spokesperson in turkey said that the agency is not encouraging refugees to return since doing so is not fully safe 49 in october 2018 president erdoğan claimed that since 2016 up to 320 000 syrians had already resettled from turkey into areas of northwestern syria occupied by turkey and pro turkish militias 45 many experts are skeptical of erdoğan s claim 46 however even if it is fully accurate it would reduce the syrian population in turkey by less than 10 percent leaving more than 3 million syrians in turkey the integration challenge when president erdoğan raised the prospect of granting syrian refugees turkish citizenship in july 2016 53 public pushback was strong 54 opposition parties objected convinced that erdoğan saw the refugees as a potential source of future political support but even many of the president s own supporters opposed the idea overwhelmingly turks just wanted the refugees to return home erdoğan got the electorate s message and now frequently insists that all the refugees eventually will return home however he did not drop the citizenship idea entirely instead his government has focused on providing citizenship in limited numbers for syrians with educational business or professional qualifications of value to turkish society in late 2016 there were even reports that turkey was refusing to grant exit visas to highly educated syrians who had received resettlement visas from the united states or germany 55 according to turkish interior minister soylu 76 443 syrians some 36 000 adults and their children had received turkish citizenship by early january 2019 and the process of naturalization of skilled syrians continues if slowly 56 erdoğan s stance on citizenship president erdoğan has been inconsistent on the issue of citizenship for syrian and other refugees 57 erdoğan s july 2016 call for citizenship seemed to apply to all the syrian refugees but in january 2017 he specified that he wanted citizenship following careful vetting by the ministry of interior for those syrian refugees with skills that would benefit turkey highly qualified people engineers lawyers doctors let s make use of that talent he said instead of letting them work illegally here and there let s give them a chance to work as citizens like the children of this nation 58 this approach more or less describes current policy on february 3 2018 erdoğan spoke of building permanent housing for syrian refugees on both sides of the turkish syrian border 59 five days later in his monthly meeting with local officials he asserted the refugees implying all would return home using that goal as a justification for the war in afrin 60 in may 2018 just seven weeks before presidential and parliamentary elections he surprisingly seemed to suggest once more that citizenship would be a good idea for all refugees in turkey so that they would no longer work in the underground economy in late june 2018 virtually on election eve he made a thunderous speech in gaziantep again pledging that all the refugees would return 61 the decision to grant citizenship in limited numbers however does not begin to resolve the fundamental questions about the future disposition of syrian refugees in turkey first turkey must determine whether to acknowledge that the vast majority of syrians will likely remain in turkey and if so it must consider how to integrate them into wider turkish society given the size of the syrian refugee community its lack of obvious alternatives to turkey and the potential consequences for turkey of ignoring the problem efforts at integration appear to be turkey s only logical solution failure to integrate the syrians could create new divisions in turkish society as well as deepen pre existing economic religious and ethnic divisions granting citizenship in its current limited scope and pace would likely have little impact on the problem but there can be meaningful steps toward integration that do not involve mass conferral of citizenship given the unpopularity of the refugees and the opposition s demands that the syrians return home the very word integration is toxic in public discourse the turkish government generally uses the euphemism harmonization 62 when alluding to steps promoting integration few turkish officials want to acknowledge that a large scale return of refugees to syria is unlikely or that the realistic alternatives are either integration or the development of a permanently disaffected underclass fewer still want to consider much less promote the notion that integration may ultimately entail wide scale citizenship as noted erdoğan has publicly broached the subject but not in a sustained manner see text box erdoğan s stance on citizenship without fanfare however the turkish government has indeed taken steps toward integration it has begun phasing out so called temporary education centers tecs in which the language of instruction is arabic and instead is moving syrian students into the turkish public school system the refugee camps are also being drawn down with less than 4 percent of syrian refugees now living in camps 63 the vast majority of syrians today are doing their best to get by in turkish towns and cities sometimes with assistance from turkish and international organizations some 1 5 million syrian refugees receive monthly allowances funded by the european union and passed through the turkish government 64 meanwhile a little publicized 2018 study by turkey s ombudsman signaled turkish semiofficial awareness that the syrian presence is likely permanent the study projected that the syrian population in turkey would likely surpass 4 million to 5 million within 10 years and asserted that it is necessary to produce policies based on permanence 65 the ombudsman is not a government spokesman formally he is autonomous yet he was elected by president erdoğan s governing justice and development party akp in parliament and is himself a member of the ruling party moreover the report carries introductions by erdoğan and other senior elected officials while those introductions do not explicitly endorse the contents of the report their presence implies something close to an official endorsement while allowing the government plausible deniability as such the report probably represents the closest the government has come to acknowledging institutionally that much of the syrian population is in turkey to stay 66 evolution of negative attitudes turkey s initial dutiful welcome of the syrian refugees fed a perception abroad that the turkish public initially supported its government s open door policy with the public s attitude souring only in more recent times one author describes the evolution of turkish attitudes as initial compassion which developed into xenophobia 67 likening the more recent turkish attitude to that of a host toward a guest overstaying his her visit 68 indeed there was a small group mainly within the akp labeled compassionate islamists in one center for american progress cap study69 that strongly supported the open door policy and remain favorable toward the refugees to this day in reality however a clear majority of turks were unhappy with the arrival of syrian refugees almost from the beginning while president erdoğan welcomed the syrians as guests and siblings most turks chafed at their presence 70 a september 2012 metropoll survey found that 52 percent of turks initially disagreed with the decision to allow the syrians into the country and 66 percent said additional refugees should be turned away 71 at that point there were only about 80 000 syrian refugees in turkey mostly in camps far from major turkish cities by contrast there are now 50 times more spread across all 81 provinces 72 perhaps unsurprisingly these negative attitudes have only intensified terrorism associated with the syrian civil war reinforced and deepened public unhappiness regarding the refugees the may 2013 bombing of reyhanlı on turkey s southern border which left 53 dead and dozens wounded may have been an early turning point reyhanlı just 3 miles from syria had a significant refugee presence 73 the source of the bombing was not clear the turkish government arrested several turks with alleged ties to syrian intelligence 74 but for most turks the important fact was that the attack was clearly linked to the syrian war illustrating that turkey s support for the syrian opposition and welcoming of refugees could have deadly consequences inside turkey around the time of the reyhanlı bombing large numbers of syrians were also beginning to move from the camps near the border into urban centers across the country this brought large numbers of refugees face to face with turks for the first time and these encounters seemed only to increase turkish resentment in 2014 significant anti refugee protests broke out in the turkish cities of gaziantep hatay urfa and kahramanmaraş all of which hosted significant numbers of syrians 75 according to scholars bezen balamir coşkun and selin yıldız nielsen tensions were fed by the view that syrians contributed to low wages and dire working conditions drastic increases in rent prices and an increase in petty crime in urban areas where the asylum seekers had settled intensively 76 most of these complaints especially those related to economic conditions have persisted over the years following the reyhanlı bombing and a spate of other terror attacks in 2015 and 2016 turks increasingly began to associate refugees with violence not necessarily because refugees themselves were perpetrators but because the refugee flow seemingly demonstrated that turkey had lost control of its southern border allowing the ill intentioned to enter with the genuinely needy after the reyhanlı bombing protestors had denounced jihadists who seemingly could go back and forth across the border at will 77 in january 2016 an islamic state affiliated syrian refugee legally registered in turkey staged a suicide bombing in istanbul s blue mosque tourist district killing 10 tourists and wounding more than a dozen others 78 not long thereafter turkey began to take stern measures to tighten border control as discussed earlier by opening its borders to refugees turkey acted both morally and in accordance with its national and international undertakings the turkish public begrudgingly accepted this policy but without embracing it confident in the correctness of its approach the government never undertook a serious effort to build public support for its policy the issue was never discussed in parliament the government did not try to convince opposition political parties to endorse its refugee response and no meaningful informational campaign was undertaken to combat public misperceptions about the refugees this failure of the government to engage through formal or informal means likely contributed to negative public attitudes that continue to mount to this day 79 only in january 2019 did the ruling akp likely motivated by concern over the march 2019 local elections belatedly announce that it plans to distribute brochures explaining misconceptions about state policies toward the refugees 80 attitudes harden as it stands the largest obstacle to an overt program of integration is the turkish public s perception of the refugees in a september 2018 poll 83 percent of turks said they view syrian refugees negatively while only 17 percent said they viewed them positively voters for all five major parties subscribed to negative views to only slightly varying degrees those backing erdoğan s akp and the kurdish rights focused peoples democracy party hdp were only slightly less negative than supporters of the secularist opposition republican people s party chp the ethnic turkish nationalists of the nationalist movement party mhp and the similarly nationalist i̇yi good party 81 this same poll echoed a november 2017 cap commissioned survey in which 79 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the syrian refugees making them among the least popular groups in turkey 82 meanwhile a 2017 public opinion survey gauging turks views toward syrian refugees found lazy rude dowdy filthy and untrustable dangerous among the adjectives topping the list several percentage points ahead of positive attributes 83 in the september 2018 survey when asked what most upsets them about the refugees turkish respondents no 1 complaint at 28 percent was rising unemployment among turks which they blamed on the syrians begging came in second at 18 percent followed by nonpayment of taxes at 16 percent rising terrorism and security problems at 13 percent and lower wages at 8 percent only 7 percent said nothing upsets me 84 those categories do not begin to reflect the raw emotions many turks express about the refugees in cap sponsored focus groups in late 2017 supporters of all parties voiced complaints such as i feel like a stranger in my own country i never hear turkish on the street anymore they receive more than we do just for coming here he takes from his own people and gives to the syrians first we let them in and now they wage war against us 85 focus group participants repeatedly complained that young syrian men were relaxing in turkey rather than fighting for justice in their homeland as one respondent said young syrians go to the beach while their relatives fight a war in syria if there were a war in my country i would join and not think twice about it as is often the case in refugee situations negative host country perceptions may have little to no relationship to facts but nevertheless are deeply held 86 according to a may 2018 cap commissioned poll nearly 80 percent of turks want the syrians to return to syria 87 broken into categories one third said the turkish government should send back the refugees no matter what while 45 percent said the government should return the refugees only to safe zones set up by turkey on the syrian side of the border meanwhile a paltry 9 percent thought the syrians should become citizens of turkey and pay taxes and only 13 percent backed the status quo advocating for the refugees to continue to be treated as guests but not allowed citizenship asked in another recent poll about their government s overall policy on syrian refugees 72 percent of turks disapproved including 56 percent of akp voters just a year earlier another poll reported a somewhat lower level of disapproval 62 percent of turks overall and 45 percent of akp voters 88 the trend is clear with the public s increasingly negative perception of refugee policy and of the syrian refugees themselves the turkish government probably deserves credit for having advanced integration or harmonization in the government s preferred term to the extent that it has integration by stealth many experts have urged turkey to adopt a clear and comprehensive policy of integration proposing for example a right for refugees to live and work anywhere in the country without the need for work permits a strengthened mandate for municipalities which are closer to the needs of their respective refugee communities educational remediation opportunities and vocational training for the hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees who missed out on schooling entirely in the early years of the crisis and a public education campaign directed toward turkish citizens to combat misperceptions about refugees 89 these are all good ideas that take into account the political reality that many syrian refugees are likely to remain in turkey and must be integrated for the sake of turkey s social harmony while recognizing that blanket naturalization is not in the cards for the foreseeable future even as turkish politicians pledge to voters that all the syrians will return home the turkish government seems to be tentatively pursuing measures that foster coexistence between turks and syrians and begin to integrate the refugees into turkish society indeed the government s actions suggest that turkish leaders are preparing for significant numbers of syrians to remain in turkey indefinitely as the ombudsman report suggests will happen as previously mentioned the refugee camps are being phased out and syrian students are being integrated into turkish public schools meanwhile syrians are being integrated increasingly into the turkish economy these steps may be deliberate signaling the government s recognition that a sizable number of refugees and their descendants will remain in turkey and that therefore integration is the best long term policy on the other hand the government simply may view these measures as the best of bad alternatives available at the moment less costly or more efficient than striving to keep the turkish and syrian communities fully separate if the former is true it could be considered integration by stealth a low key approach made necessary because integration runs counter to the thrust of most public statements coming from turkish leaders this would not reflect a full blown policy of integration since there is much more that can be done to integrate the syrian community as noted above but it may be all the integration that the political traffic will bear for now in any case by closing refugee camps and encouraging refugees to live in turkish society by opening the economy to the refugees however haltingly and by educating the refugees as turks the government has inarguably taken important steps in the direction of integration closing the camps at first turkey attempted to accommodate all the refugees in camps or temporary shelter centers tscs as they are officially called until early 2013 virtually all of the then less than 200 000 registered refugees lived in these centers in 2013 however the flow of refugees overwhelmed the tscs and by early 2014 only a slight majority of the refugees were housed in the camps by the end of that year little more than 20 percent were living in tscs with the remainder residing in urban and near urban areas 90 since that time the percentage of refugees in camps has steadily dwindled by february 2019 there were only 142 000 syrian refugees less than 4 percent of all registered syrian refugees in tscs 91 furthermore between early 2016 and the end of 2018 the number of camps had decreased by half from 26 to 13 based in eight provinces clustered near the syrian border 92 the camps were established and run by turkey with the u n high commissioner for refugees in a support role and in consultation with unhcr turkey decides when to close them the turkish government s objective in closing them according to a unhcr official is to facilitate integration sic of refugees residing in camps to the host communities with a view to self reliance and social cohesion and also to mitigate the consequences of long term residence in camps to refugees the official said that the unhcr supports this approach 93 when camps are closed families are given the option to move to another camp or settle outside the camps in turkish urban areas most choose the latter to those who settle outside the camps the unhcr provides a one time payout depending on family size generally around 10 000 turkish lira or about 1 85094 to cover their short term basic needs including transportation rent and household expenses 95 syrians cope economically and a few thrive the move to close the camps was heavily influenced by the experiences of the 96 percent of refugees living outside the camps all over turkey economically syrians have managed surprisingly well outside the camps if not without many difficulties and overall have contributed to the turkish economy precise statistics are hard to come by according to a study by the economic research foundation of turkey tepav a think tank affiliated with turkey s national chamber of commerce the union of chambers and commodity exchanges of turkey there are 2 2 million working age syrian refugees roughly 1 million of these are employed in the informal economy thus lacking worker protections and avoiding turkish taxes a near negligible 32 000 just 1 5 percent of the total syrian refugee workforce hold work permits and work in the formal economy according to the turkish interior minister 96 these figures suggest that a slight majority of the syrians are either unemployed or not in the market such as housewives and students 97 according to the same tepav report there are some 10 000 wholly or partly syrian refugee owned businesses registered in turkey employing roughly 44 000 syrians as well as thousands of turks since the average syrian refugee household comprises six people syrian wholly and partly owned enterprises likely sustain more than 250 000 syrian refugees 98 there are also several thousand unregistered syrian businesses 99 as of mid 2017 syrian refugees had invested 334 million into the then more than 6 000 syrian owned registered companies in turkey 100 most syrian businesses are small with average annual revenue of 463 000 seventy four percent of the syrian owned companies have less than 10 employees 24 percent have 10 to 50 employees and just 2 percent have 50 to 250 employees 101 still each year since 2013 syrians have started more companies in turkey than any other foreign group 102 the question of syrian employment is among the most sensitive in turkey today there is a widespread perception in turkish society that syrian refugees undermine employment prospects for turkish workers 71 percent of turks believe this according to a late 2017 poll 103 as discussed earlier in this report turks leading complaint about the syrian refugees is that they have contributed to rising turkish unemployment some turkish leaders and experts dispute that conclusion insisting that syrians mainly perform jobs that turks would not do anyway 104 yet there is sufficient evidence to conclude that turkish workers at the lower end of the scale construction textile and seasonal agricultural workers are indeed disadvantaged as syrian workers are generally more than willing to work in these sectors on an underground basis meaning longer hours and less pay than turkish workers would accept 105 as one study puts it the already disadvantaged sectors of the turkish labor market such as women youth and the less educated are the ones most hurt by competition from syrians 106 in 2016 the turkish government announced a work permit system to tackle the syrian employment problem but the program is not popular and as noted only about 32 000 syrians have received work permits to date syrians face a number of obstacles and disincentives when applying for work permits first to acquire a work permit they must work in the province in which they are registered as under temporary protection 107 since registration is required within 10 days of arrival in turkey however this province is usually the one where the refugee entered turkey 108 therefore refugees are disproportionately registered in the provinces bordering syria while the jobs tend to be elsewhere in big cities in western turkey such as istanbul izmir and bursa these destinations are naturally where many of the refugees go and work regardless of registration but they do so as part of the underground economy furthermore a syrian refugee can receive a work permit only with the backing of a prospective employer and after having been registered as under temporary protection for at least six months 109 there are frequently delays in issuance of permits and the cost of a work permit is not negligible for most syrians 250 turkish lira or about 47 recently reduced from 600 turkish lira another consideration for permit applicants is that a job in the formal economy usually spells the end of direct assistance under the emergency social safety net essn program which the european union funds and the turkish red crescent administers 110 see text box some key sources of funding for syrian refugees prospective turkish employers also face obstacles and disincentives to hiring syrians syrian work permit holders are subject to the same minimum wage and maximum hours requirements as turkish workers and thus are generally less attractive to turkish employers many prospective turkish employers are interested in syrian workers precisely because they will work below minimum wage and for longer hours than legally allowed in short because they can be exploited there are countless stories of defenseless syrian workers suffering exploitation without recourse at the hands of ruthless turkish employers 111 there are plenty of expenses and red tape for would be employers of syrian refugees with work permits they must make social security payments and be able to prove that at least 90 percent of their company s employees are turkish this quota requirement can be waived only if employers can demonstrate to the government that over a four week period prior to application for a work permit they searched for but failed to find any available qualified turks in the relevant province to fill the position 112 for the prospect of immediate employment most syrians are willing to eschew the protections and other benefits afforded by a work permit and the formal economy in that regard it should be noted that they have plenty of company in turkey where an estimated 35 percent of the turkish economy occurs underground beyond the reach of government regulations and tax assessment 113 education leads way on integration the turkish educational system is essential to the integration of the syrians into turkish society in its most remarkably pro integration decision to date the turkish government seems to have made a decision to use this system to the fullest soon all syrian students will attend turkish public schools from the beginning turkey welcomed the refugees into turkish schools but few attended initially in september 2014 turkey opened or in some cases recognized already informally existing temporary education centers tec which taught a modified syrian curriculum in arabic as of august 2017 there were 404 tecs 114 the tecs however were established on the premise that the refugees would soon return to syria over time presumably as the turkish government came to accept that the syrians would likely remain the government made the momentous decision to transfer and integrate the syrians into the turkish state educational system this decision seems explicable only as an attempt to facilitate syrian integration into turkish society in 2017 using designated funding from the european union the turkish government began providing cash assistance to encourage refugee families to send their children to government schools through a program known as conditional cash transfer for education ccte 115 see text box some key sources of funding for syrian refugees also in 2017 the government began phasing out the tecs with a goal to close them completely within three years 116 turkish efforts to educate refugees have had some meaningful success particularly in the basic realm of increased school attendance in the 2014 15 school year the first year of organized schooling for refugees 190 000 syrians attended the tecs while only 40 000 were in the turkish school system together these 230 000 students constituted only 30 percent of school age syrians with the other 70 percent not attending school at all however by the 2017 18 school year 63 percent of the 976 000 school age syrians were in school including 100 percent of primary school age or grades one through four syrians 117 and for the first time a majority of those in school were attending turkish public schools rather than tecs with 351 000 in the former and 268 000 in the latter 118 meanwhile tec students began taking 15 hours of turkish per week in preparation for the move to turkish schools 119 despite this progress it is an immense challenge to incorporate the syrians into turkish public schools in the planned three year time frame much less to do so in a manner that will provide a good education according to scholar murat erdoğan turkey would need 1 200 new schools to accommodate all the syrians not to mention hundreds of additional teachers adding to the challenge is the fact that the syrian school age population is increasing every year by some 140 000 in the past two years alone 120 also whereas turkish students are legally required to complete 12 years of schooling school attendance for syrians is voluntary further complicating the mission to integrate syrians into turkish society via the educational system reportedly the turkish government is considering a plan to withhold monthly essn support allowances 120 turkish lira or about 22 per family member from syrian families whose children do not attend school this would be a separate measure beyond the withholding of the ccte monetary inducement specifically tied to school attendance 121 some turks support integrating syrians into turkish schools it is surprising that the heavy infusion of syrian refugees into turkish public schools has not created a stronger education specific backlash from the turkish public collectively they seem to take a slightly softer line in this area of refugee life perhaps because turks want syrians to overcome the turkish language barrier and rely less on arabic or perhaps because many turks are resigned to the syrians enduring presence and fear that lacking turkish education they may become a permanent and threatening underclass in turkish society according to a 2017 poll 33 percent of turks say the syrians education should only be in turkish matching the government s declared policy conversely 26 percent say they should be given no education at all presumably reflecting fear that education equals permanence 122 whatever the challenges the decision to discontinue the tecs and absorb the syrians into turkish schools seems to be an acknowledgement that the syrian presence in turkey likely will be permanent moreover by acculturating syrian students it will tend to reinforce that permanence the implications of this decision for the long term integration of syrians into turkish society are potentially immensely positive

by tyler durden zerohedge com wed 03 13 2019 if us debt is at 22 trillion and interest rates can barely rise above 2 60 why can t the us have 222 trillion in debt that in a nutshell is the generic mmt argument which claims that the us government should dispense with a central bank altogether and resort to helicopter money to reflate the economy a strategy that is especially popular among socialist politicians as it affords them a carte blanche to spend virtually unlimited funds obtained from the sale of debt of course this only works until it doesn t and it usually stops once faith in the reserve currency starts buckling but while that has yet to happen as the tbac pointed out two months ago it has not prevented a cohort of financial icons and pundits from opining on the intellectual inconsistencies of mmt and the latest to do so just hours after we presented the scathing criticism of convoy investments howard wang was none other than jeff gundlach who during his tuesday webcast highway to hell slammed mmt as a crackpot theory and slammed the people who have phds in economics and are actually buying the complete nonsense of mmt which is used to justify a massive socialist program lashing out at the economists who embrace mmt who claim that just because the us borrows in its own currency it can print dollars to cover its obligations and can t go broke just like the weimar republic venezuela and zimbabwe gundlach exclaimed that the problem with that is it s a completely fallacious argument adding that mmt could lead to a significant boycott of long term bonds this argument is ridiculous he said it sounds good for a first grader what happens when the economy turns down as bloomberg notes by lashing out at mmt gundlach joins an array of financiers and economists including jerome powell and larry fink who have slammed at the theory that despite being around for over a century it was known as chartalism around the time it was put to use during the weimar hyperinflation got little attention until a band of socialist democrats including alexandria ocasio cortez were elected however more than just a crackpot theory gundlach echoed convoy investment s fears that that mmt which is just the political cover for helicopter money may end up being more than just a theory if the u s falls into a recession next year that means anybody other than an incumbent president would win which kind of means that we re headed toward this experiment of modern monetary theory he said although some have argued that donald trump is in fact the most mmt president the us has had yet considering the massive surge in the us budget deficit observed during a period of economic expansion and which has led some to ask what will happen to the us deficit when the next recession strikes meanwhile speaking of america s unsustainable debt trajectory the basis for gundlach s latest presentation title highway to hell the doubleline founder blamed president donald trump for the shocking growth in the u s debt burden highlighting the incredible increase in corporate and government debt with federal deficits only poised to grow gundlach s presentation took place just weeks after the treasury department said total u s federal debt hit a fresh record above 22 trillion this is something that is getting more and more attention and i think it has to gundlach said noting that it s really shocking that the president ran on the promise of eliminating the national debt and here it is at 22 trillion and going higher by about 1 5 trillion a year in a growing economy gundlach also observed that the budget deficit could hit 11 of gdp in the next downturn and predicted that he would take the over suggesting that 13 percent is more likely pointing out that as rates creep higher the us interest as percentage of gdp is projected to explode higher the rest here

2018 results as well as other announcements after our remarks we will open the call to questions 2018 proved to be a noble year for bridgepoint first and foremost about a year ago we announced our plans to separate bridgepoint from its academic institutions and become an education technology services company recently we completed the transfer of programs from university of the rockies into ashford university and as i will discuss in a moment we are moving forward with our preparations for the separation of ashford university from bridgepoint and the subsequent conversion of ashford university into a non profit institution in addition we gained traction on a number of fronts during the year first we saw over a 700 basis point improvement in the decline in new enrollments in 2018 year over year second ashford s cohort retention continued to improve as we saw 20 basis point increase year over year third we successfully implemented an enhanced marketing strategy that is generating a higher quality and more efficient mixture of prospective students while reducing total admissions advisory and marketing costs by 4 year over year fourth we further expanded our education partnerships as of december 31st our corporate partners included 117 fortune 500 companies which spanned multiple industries such as healthcare communications technology and financial services within our corporate partners approximately one fourth of their student employees are enrolled in master s degree programs at ashford the employer sponsorship by these global companies is a testament to the strength and quality of the programs offered through ashford and lastly we introduced a number of additional program offerings which have continued to build on ashford s reputation and strength we are incredibly proud of the education students have received through ashford our work over the last decade has built a strong higher education institution which has a differentiated approach to the online market and produced over 120 000 alumni in fact according to the 2018 national survey of student engagement college student report or nsse ashford provides an academic challenge that ranks with the top 10 of four year colleges in the us that participated in the nsee survey denoting the rigor that students have at the institution participating institutions include bachelor s degree granting colleges and universities representing a broad diversity with respect to institution type public or private control size and region with that let me quickly run through our fourth quarter 2018 results for the fourth quarter of 2018 we reported revenue of 94 7 million a net loss of 13 4 million and a resulting diluted loss per share of 0 49 excluding the fourth quarter restructuring and impairment charges of 4 million as well as the separation transaction costs of 3 2 million our non gaap diluted lost per share was 0 23 these results were lower than anticipated due to lower revenue caused by higher ftg scholarships due to a higher mix of ftg students and more courses being taken by these students as well as lower average weekly enrollment year over year as expected new enrollment for the fourth quarter of 2018 was down as a percentage by low single digits when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 at the start of 2019 we bolstered our leadership in our advisory group which we believe will support an improvement in new enrollment going forward despite the decline in new enrollments during the fourth quarter versus prior year we continue to see improvements in the overall quality and efficiency of our leads while at the same time our total admissions advisory and marketing costs decreased 10 year over year in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the quarter approximately 88 of new enrollments came from homegrown sources which was up 83 in the fourth quarter of prior year this growth in the homegrown channel was driven by improvements in organic traffic as well as with our education partnerships with corporate employers at the same time retention continued to improve as of december 31 2018 ashford s cohort retention rate was 58 9 as compared to 58 7 for the same period in the prior year additionally as i mentioned we continue to derive growth in our education partnership programs as well as with our graduate student population who both retain at a higher rate as of december 31 2018 the enrollment in the education partnership program represented just over 21 of the total enrollments which is an increase from the approximately 14 of total enrollment as of one year ago new enrollments in the education partnership programs represented approximately 24 of new enrollment for the year these innovative programs are positive examples of the benefits of partnering with employers we can provide a quality debt free education to these students and employers can develop retain and grow the skills of their employees as we look to 2019 establishing a strong foundation for an independent self sustaining non profit ashford to flourish over the long term is a priority for us we have maintained our focus on improving new enrollment and student retention through innovative intervention strategies designed to ensure student preparedness raise academic quality and improve student outcomes as a result as we move through the year we anticipate new enrollment to improve sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2018 with a return to year over year new enrollment growth starting in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout 2019 changing gears i d like to discuss the future of bridgepoint and ashford in early february we announced the receipt by a au nfp a non profit california public benefit corporation of the irs determination of non profit status this determination is one of the steps needed in the process of separating after ashford university from bridgepoint education and converting ashford university to an independent self governed institution as you saw in our announcement last thursday wasc deferred any action on the change of control application filed by ashford university to convert the university to a non profit institution

updates as we move forward together in addition to the strategic acquisition we have been expanding our capabilities organically over the past 12 months we have made significant investments to greatly expand our core technology tools to serve ashford and positioned the business to serve new schools these investments have included expansion efforts in the following three platforms talent our single sign on mobile app that provides learners and faculty access to their student portal and learning management system waypoint our outcome based direct assessment tool that supports faculty in their

analytics to improve the likelihood of learning success we have also made and are continuing to make investments in key talent in the last three months alone we have made several key hires including first greg finkelstein our new chief operating officer greg will further bolster our transformation to a technology data and services leader in the higher education marketplace his operational acumen combined with over two decades of higher education consulting and technology experience will elevate our efforts to deliver innovative solutions to our partners in addition as i mentioned we expect his new leadership over the advisory team to drive the sequential improvement in new enrollment in the first quarter of 2019 as well as the return of growth for the remainder of 2019 second john semel our new chief strategy officer john s experience developing strategies to drive growth for organizations in the education industry along with his investments and acquisition expertise will be integral in meeting our strategic objectives as you can see we are embarking on a transition to a high growth technology company initially we anticipate our core business revenue growth will be low single digit expanding to mid single digit growth over a three year period our announcement today of fullstack academy is a great example of how we anticipate inorganic growth will help us achieve our overall vision and bring us one step closer toward our long term growth profile with the addition of fullstack academy we expect our revenue growth to expand to high single digits over the next two to three years longer term as we execute on our strategy and pursue aggressive growth through meaningful internal investments and m a we expect to achieve double digit revenue growth we will however be disciplined in our pursuit of growth our investments both organic and inorganic will be viewed through the lens of our strategic imperatives that i outlined the platform s potential of any investment and the halo effect of introducing new assets and offerings into our educational technology ecosystem clearly there is a lot of activity at the company we are incredibly excited about what lies ahead we have a strong and growing team in place to execute and together we are optimistic about the value creation opportunity for all of our stakeholders now i will turn the call over to kevin royal to review our financial and operating results kevin royal executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you andrew before i begin let me briefly touch on the restatement we announced last week as previously announced the audit committee and the board of directors of the company concluded that our previously issued unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended september 30 2018 should no longer be relied upon because of errors we determined that the process used for recording revenue for the full tuition grant program portion of our student contracts and the related judgments and estimates were not designed with sufficient precision as a result we identified errors relating to revenue bad debt expense accounts receivable and deferred revenue which resulted in the overstatement of revenue and expenses for the restated periods we restated our 10 q for the period ended september 30 2018 on form 10 q a which we filed earlier today this restatement resulted in a decrease to our net income for the three and nine month period ended september 30 2018 in the amount of 2 6 million and 5 8 million respectively now let me provide some key financial and operating information for the quarter and year ended december 31 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue was 94 7 million compared to 105 1 million for the same period in 2017 the decrease is primarily due to higher ftg scholarships due to a higher mix of ftg students and more courses being taken by these students as well as lower average weekly enrollment year over year as of december 2018 total student enrollment was 38 153 compared to 40 730 as of december 31 2017 as andrew mentioned we continue to see growth in our education partnership programs which has resulted in improvements in our cash revenues from title iv sources during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 ashford university derived 78 6 80 8 and 81 2 of its cash revenue revenues from title iv program funds respectively this improvement is the result of the success of our educational partnerships in full tuition grant programs a trend which we would expect to continue in 2019 and beyond for the fourth quarter of 2018 instructional costs and services were 51 6 million or 54 5 of revenue compared to 54 9 million or 52 2 of revenue for the comparable prior year period the increase in the fourth quarter as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to relative increases in labor and it costs partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense bad debt expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 3 5 million or 3 7 of revenue compared to 7 3 million or 6 9 of revenue for the comparable prior period admissions advisory and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 38 8 million or 40 9 of revenue compared to 43 3 million or 41 2 of revenue for the comparable period these costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to lower advertising spend and lower headcount general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 14 million or 14 7 of revenue compared to 10 4 million or 9 9 of revenue for the comparable period the increase in dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by additional costs associated with the separation of ashford as well as higher administrative labor costs and consulting fees we recorded 4 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to a slight reversal of expense of 0 7 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year additionally there were no legal settlements in the fourth quarter of the current year as compared to 1 8 million of legal settlement expenses in the fourth quarter prior year net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 13 4 million or a loss of 0 49 per diluted share compared with net loss of 5 1 million or a loss of 0 18 per diluted share for the same period in 2017 the non gaap net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 6 2 million or a loss of 0 23 per diluted share compared to a non gaap net loss of 3 9 million or a loss of 0 14 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 regarding the full year results revenue for the full year ended december 31 2018 was 443 4 million compared with revenue of 475 1 million for the year ended december 31 2017 similar to the quarter the decrease is primarily due to lower average weekly enrollment year over year and a higher mix of full tuition and students net income for the year ended december 31 2018 was 4 6 million or diluted income per share of 0 17 compared with net income of 9 1 million or diluted income per share 0 28 for the year ended december 31 2017 non gaap net income for the year ended december 31 2018 was 13 million or non gaap diluted income per share of 0 47 compared with non gaap net income of 17 8 million or non gaap diluted income per share of 0 55 for the year ended december 31 2017 income tax benefit for the full year ended december 31 2018 was 7 6 million which primarily relates to discrete tax benefits the company used 7 6 million of cash in operating activities during the 12 months ended december 31 2018 by comparison the company used 4 1 million of cash in operating activities during the same period in 2017 capital expenditures for the 12 months ended december 31 2018 were 2 6 million as compared to 3 4 million in the comparable period last year as of december 31 2018 the company had combined cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments of 192 7 million as compared to 207 6 million as of december 31 2017 for 2019 as andrew mentioned we anticipate new enrollment to improve sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2018 with a return to year over year enrollment growth starting in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout 2019 from a profitability standpoint excluding the impact of our acquisition of fullstack academy we expect bridgepoint s ebitda margin to be positive in 2019 in the low single digit range due to our investments in technology talent and other costs associated with the repositioning of the business that andrew discussed during his comments we are projecting that fullstack will be dilutive to ebitda in 2019 in the range of 3 million to 5 million lastly let me briefly review the transaction details for fullstack academy as we announced earlier today we have agreed to acquire fullstack academy the total consideration for the transaction is anticipated to be 17 5 million in cash and up to 4 75 million shares of common stock with 2 5 million issued at closing and the remainder to be issued in the future upon the satisfaction of certain performance milestones the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions now i will turn the call back over to andrew for his closing comments andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president thank you kevin 2019 marks the beginning of a transformation for both bridgepoint and ashford while we position bridgepoint for its transition to an education technology services company we remain focused on ensuring ashford university has a strong foundation to support its long term sustainability and success we have a clear strategy in place to be a best in class education technology services company that will leverage our core strengths while applying our technologies and capabilities to priority market needs including recruitment retention and the learner experience in addition our acquisition of fullstack academy establishes a leadership position for us in an attractive and growing space while at the same time providing a springboard to expand our skills to employment offering and other high demand verticals we believe through the execution of our strategic priorities and continued investments we will create long term growth and meaningful value for all our stakeholders at this time i ll ask our operator to open up the phone lines for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of alex paris from barrington your line is open chris howe barrington analyst this is chris howe sitting in for alex good afternoon everyone andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president hi chris kevin royal executive vice president and chief financial officer hello chris howe barrington analyst hi i had some questions here first off fullstack you mentioned some of the financial expectations moving into 2019 i guess for a long term picture of this program of this acquisition how should we think about the different synergies that you could extract out of it as it applies to your corporate partnerships and has that been modeled in to your future outlook andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president yeah chris thanks for the question excellent questions so the short answer is no we haven t modeled in the potential synergies that we would bring to fullstack you re absolutely correct our corporate partnerships would be a prime example of that but that is not modeled into their business plan currently we expect that throughout this year and into the future years that as we work together fullstack will take advantage selectively at leveraging some of those synergies from bridgepoint and using those to enhance their connections to universities and employers chris howe barrington analyst okay that s helpful and then staying on the topic of corporate partnerships or i guess shifting to that topic you mentioned the continued strength that you re seeing within the ftg program however it does impact average revenue per student as we look at the mix toward your expectations for 2019 how should we expect this to grow as a percentage of the total mix and what s in your guidance for the ftg programs in 2019 kevin royal executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we re currently planning when we look at 2019 from a financial standpoint related to the full tuition grant program is that we ended the year at 22 of total enrollment being part of our corporate partnership program and we would expect that to grow into the 27 28 range during 2019 chris howe barrington analyst and one more question before i hop back in the queue how would you characterize new programs for 2019 as far as any color you can share on that and how much of a contributor that will be new programs that have yet to be announced or should we expect the portfolio of programs to remain consistent or constant throughout the year and in terms of enrollment growth between existing and new programs how should we think about the mix there looking forward andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president yeah great question so in terms of new programs in 19 i d say there s about a handful of new programs that have yet to be implemented by ashford if you think about new enrollment growth in 19 for ashford most some of that s going to be driven by the new programs that were introduced in 18 and i think at our last earnings call chris we said that those contributed back then to about 3 of our overall total enrollments so i would say going forward as those programs accelerate through 19 they re going to probably be in the high single digits low double digits by the end of the year chris howe barrington analyst great thank you for taking my questions andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter appert from piper jaffray your line is open kevin estok piper jaffray analyst hi guys this is kevin estok in for peter appert andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president hi kevin kevin estok piper jaffray analyst my first question hi so i guess i was wondering if you guys could offer any incremental detail on fullstack s past operating performance for the acquisition andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president well i mean i guess let me just start by saying we re really excited by what they do at fullstack just their whole orientation the difference that they re making the societal difference they re making in terms of helping people to learn these very high tech skills and fill literally millions of jobs that are out there unfilled right now so we re just generally very excited about the team there and the founders and the job that they ve done i would say that their performance has been really strong they ve done a fantastic job and i think the most important part of their performance that we were looking at was really the outcomes and how were they doing in terms of student outcomes and by any measurement they re really one of the top rated bootcamps that s in the country today kevin estok piper jaffray analyst okay thank you very much and then my second question i think you may have given some guidance on student enrollment growth in for 19 and a few of the out years so could you just repeat that guidance andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president yeah sure so we said that new enrollment would improve sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first that we expect new enrollment growth to return in the second third and fourth quarters of the year and that we should be positive overall in new enrollment for the full year kevin estok piper jaffray analyst okay thank you very much andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i will now turn the call over to andrew clark for any closing remarks andrew s clark founder chief executive officer and president thank you we d like to thank all of today s callers

africa s history is laced with decades of colonial exploitation which together with developmental assistance programmes such as the international monetary fund s structural adjustment initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s has had debilitating consequences fast forward to the early 2000s and china s strategic interests in africa become more pronounced the asian superpower is in search of resources like oil gas and metals to meet its energy imports and construction demand and to sustain its manufacturing industry more recently china has branched into non resource investments like building infrastructure through the road and belt initiative african leaders have embraced economic engagement with china which is perceived as a welcome alternative to the continent s long standing euro american ties that often came with demanding conditions africa s relationship with china has offered significant benefits particularly in bridging the continent s infrastructure deficit owing to the no conditionality policy many african countries have turned to china as the partner of choice however the relationship is increasingly showing some characteristics evident during colonialism raising questions about the true cost of the benefits africa is getting from china only as recently as 2015 did china start visibly focusing on the commercial and viability aspects of their investments china s relationship with africa is increasingly showing characteristics evident during colonialism the africa china cost benefit conundrum partly lies in the terms for collateral on loans china has effectively mastered the intricacies of long term collateralisation of assets and resources it takes the form of a barter system in return for investment capital and infrastructure some countries grant china resource concessions allow it to take an ownership stake in the infrastructure projects or secure loans against their natural resources and assets as collateral the number of african countries indebted to china and subsequently handing over their assets or resources are in no short supply zambia angola the democratic republic of the congo drc mozambique ethiopia sudan kenya and djibouti are just some in zambia reports indicate that china is already in control of the country s broadcasting company and the state is preparing to offer its national electricity company to china as security against a loan china has proposed taking over the kenneth kaunda airport in lusaka if zambia cannot meet its loan repayment commitments the extent of zambia s debt is unclear and without exact figures public conversation has been fuelled by fear china also has direct equity interests in copper coal and manganese reserves similarly madagascar pledged a huge portion of its land as collateral for loans in the drc in return for the us 9 billion loan to upgrade road and rail systems that connect routes to extractive industries china gained rights to extract up to 10 million tons of copper and 420 000 tons of cobalt over 15 years in djibouti by the end of 2016 82 of external debt was owed to china and the country handed over control of its port which sits in a strategic location that acts as a main access point for american french italian and japanese bases in the country china might get a 99 year lease with a 70 stake china has mastered the intricacies of long term collateralisation of assets and resources the lamu port in kenya could also be under threat kenya is expected to default on its loan repayment terms and be forced to hand over the adjoining towns and the biggest port in east africa to china for 99 years china could also take over some of the country s mineral assets if kenya defaults on payments for the acclaimed standard gauge railway from mombasa to nairobi most of the projects undertaken by china are capital intensive ventures like ports railway lines roads and even airports rarely does it invest in more basic amenities like sanitation programmes china then reclaims and runs the assets for profit when countries default the loans are big and the terms leave sub saharan africa with little revenue of their own from commodity production while increasing their debt levels multilateral organisations like the african development bank the world bank and last resort lenders like the imf generally give loans at lower than market rates however the china africa research initiative which tracks chinese financing indicates that the sources of loans range from china s ministry of commerce to policy banks like the export import bank of china private commercial banks and state owned enterprises some of these loans have terms comparable to the normal commercial market rates the world bank classifies 18 sub saharan countries as being in high risk of debt distress i e having debt gdp ratio above 50 currently 20 of africa s external debt is owed to china making it the largest single creditor nation china has established a clear footprint in sub saharan africa and continues to make inroads among countries with relatively weak governance structures and a lack of transparency and accountability there is nothing inherently wrong about africa engaging with china every country acts in their best interests china has just become more efficient in exploiting the continent than the west every country should do its due diligence when entering into a loan agreement with any entity the feasibility of projects needs to be assessed and the best possible terms for loans negotiated states must ensure funds are used efficiently and for the projects they were intended if a loan cannot guarantee return on investment it is probably not wise to take it in the first place it is on this score that africa s political leaders are failing the continent by allowing the continued plunder of its assets and resources written by stellah kwasi researcher african futures and innovation iss pretoria republished with

we didn t know it at the time but 10 years ago this week things started looking up on march 9 2009 the s p 500 closed at 676 53 the lowest point it hit over the course of the great recession today the index stands at around 2750 although the implosion of the subprime real estate market is most frequently cited as the catalyst for the recession that historic downturn actually was the result of a perfect storm of economic occurrences said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america you had a bust in an asset bubble an inverted yield curve and an oil price spike he told nbc news on top of that a sudden unavailability of liquidity froze banking activities and precipitated a global financial crisis the federal reserve responded with the extraordinary steps of dropping the benchmark interest rate to 0 percent and embarking on quantitative easing programs that would eventually grow its balance sheet to 4 5 trillion both steps were radical ones calculated to pour money into the economy and jump start lending in addition to monetary policy congress passed a number of stimulus programs aimed at helping people dealing with foreclosures and job losses the first step in all this was arresting the decline with government programs that tried to take the position of the lender of last resort and basically trying to step in when private capital was too fearful said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute there s kind of an inherent tendency for economies to recover said bruce mccain chief investment strategist for key private bank but the economy of late 2008 needed an extra push to get that momentum going at the early stage the monetary backstopping the federal reserve provided during the crisis was crucial it s less clear that the stimulus they ve provided since then has been effective for the economy as opposed to the market mccain said although the recession was officially over in june 2009 just three months after the stock market hit its trough many ordinary americans remained in dire financial straits consumers have been the key to growth said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics and until that spending rebounded the rest of the recovery remained muted too the missing ingredient jobs i think the tricky part is that main street is largely dependent on employment prospects samana said when businesses are uncertain about the future they re very reluctant to add additional workers he said it took an unprecedented six years before the record 9 million jobs that vanished in the recession reemerged north said we went through the slowest recovery since world war ii he said a lot of that may have been that people just stayed on the sidelines aided by expanded unemployment insurance and frustrated by employers who would only commit to filling jobs on a part time or temporary basis now a decade after the market trough unemployment is at a historic low and wage growth is managing to keep abreast of inflation albeit barely financial industry reforms and improved confidence among business leaders as well as consumers have lent stability to the nation s economic growth we re in a better place than we were 10 years ago zandi said the changes post crisis will make it less likely that we ll have the booms and the busts the banking system for example holds a lot more capital that makes it safer the system has much more liquidity than it did pre crisis we ve certainly come a long way with respect to the overall outlook of businesses and investors mccain said economic expansion for much of the recovery was muted but mccain suggests that this pace might have ultimately been critical for the longevity of our current growth cycle it s been a difficult time getting to here but when you have slower growth you can have growth for a longer period of time he said there s nothing inherently that says this cycle for the u s in particular has to end any time soon
