exchange one coin for another quickly and easily without moving their funds to a traditional exchange what fees does exodus wallet have exodus wallet design allows users to calculate the fee for making transactions on a network automatically as it supports multiple cryptocurrencies the fee for each network varies greatly however fees on exodus tend to be higher than other wallets as it is designed to send transactions as quickly as possible not as cheaply as possible what you gain in speed you lose in the fee that is part of the reason why we recommend etoro instead you can check out our etoro review here it is much more affordable and has more contained fees compared to exodus exodus also computes mining fees using a dynamic pricing model that tries to get the transaction into the next block i e it focuses on getting quick transaction confirmations users who want to set the fees for each transaction manually should use other wallets how to open an exodus wallet account exodus is a desktop based wallet account therefore users must first download the application on their systems and then create an account here are the steps to creating your own exodus wallet visit the official website of exodus wallet double check if you are not using a phishing website on the top right corner of the website you will find the download button click on it on the next page choose your operating system exodus is available for windows mac and linux run the downloaded file and install the wallet your wallet is now ready to use no sign up necessary how do i transfer coins to exodus wallet when using the exodus wallet you will have three options to transfer coins send receive and exchange here is a step by step procedure to complete all three types of transactions receiving coins on exodus when you first start using the exodus wallet you will have to add coins to it for safe storage and also to send them to other wallets to start with open the application and click on the wallet tab click on the cryptocoin you want to receive in the wallet and click receive you will be shown a wallet address alongside a qr code share it with someone you want to receive money from or copy paste it to receive money from another wallet you own sending coins on exodus click on the wallet tab select the cryptocurrency you want to from the list click on send paste the wallet address or scan a qr code to send money write the amount of money you want to send click send exchanging coins on exodus if you already have some coins in your account you can easily use the in built shapeshift support to exchange coins directly within the wallet here is how to accomplish it click on exchange in the left panel of your app on the left select the cryptocurrency you want to swap on the right select the cryptocurrency you want to receive check the current exchange rate between the two cryptocurrencies click on exchange your new balance will be reflected once shapeshift completes the exchange while the wallet provides quick exchange and transaction facility we must note that it doesn t intend to save money for the users the wallet trades affordability for speed because of which your transactions get accepted more quickly but you also have to pay extra ideally the users must be allowed to manually select how much fee they intend to pay for a particular transaction exodus itself urges users to find better solutions for manual fee decision in other places wallets like etoro serve the users better in this regard exodus wallet pros and cons every bitcoin wallet comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages to the users let s check out what exodus brings to its users pros allows users to retain their private keys allows users to retain their private keys supports multiple cryptocurrencies supports multiple cryptocurrencies allows in app crypto to crypto exchange allows in app crypto to crypto exchange beautiful user interface beautiful user interface easy to use beginner friendly easy to use beginner friendly available as a mobile application too cons high transaction fee high transaction fee doesn t allow manual transaction fee decision doesn t allow manual transaction fee decision doesn t offer two factor authentication doesn t offer two factor authentication does not support multi signature addresses does not support multi signature addresses is not a highly secure wallet exodus vs other wallets exodus is not the only multi currency wallet available to the users there are other popular wallets like etoro and jaxx that pose significant challenges to exodus so let s check how the wallet fares against its peers exodus vs etoro even though exodus is also a reliable cryptocurrency wallet etoro wallet s top of the line security features like two factor authentication and multi signature support beat the security exodus provides etoro also supports a wider range of cryptocurrencies and other types of traditional assets moreover etoro provides unmatched support social trading platform as well as multiple language support which is of great help to non english speakers thus the etoro wallet is a much better wallet than exodus exodus vs jaxx one of jaxx s founder is also the co founder of ethereum which gives a significant edge to the wallet it is a popular desktop based digital currency wallet available for mobile platforms as well unlike exodus jaxx can also be used as an online wallet it supports over 66 digital currencies and can show crypto balances in fiat currency to the users while it is quite similar to exodus in principle jaxx allows users to choose a transaction speed it has three speed options slow medium and fast therefore users get to decide whether they want to send their transaction quickly or cheaply exodus doesn t provide this flexibility it focuses on providing the fastest possible transactions albeit at a higher fee both exodus and jaxx allow in app crypto to crypto exchange using shapeshift though exodus provides a larger selection of coins jaxx offers more advanced features exodus vs ledger nano s the definitive wallet for high end security ledger nano s is the leader of cryptocurrency wallets on the market today it is a hardware wallet that allows users to store their cryptocurrencies offline the usb shaped device can be connected to your computer to complete transactions or view balances it comes with state of the art security features as well exodus on the other hand is a desktop based online wallet it cannot be considered the most secure storage option on the market because of the lack of crucial security features like two factor authentication however it is great to keep smaller sums of multiple coins at a single place while retaining all your private keys exodus is free to use while the ledger nano s is available on the market for under 100 conclusion exodus wallet is a great product designed to help onboard people into the crypto revolution it brings a clean and beautiful user interface users can view their account holdings in a ring pie chart format and can see their crypto holdings in fiat equivalents of their choice one of its disadvantages is that it makes transactions more expensive than wallets that we consider to be more trustworthy such as etoro exodus in fact also has security flaws and lacks advanced features the absence of two factor authentication and the complex process of operating the wallet on multiple machines simultaneously also create several hurdles for an average user it lets users add multiple erc20 based tokens but fails to list them all wallets like etoro steer clear of such issues and allow users to retain some control over the fee they intend to pay for a transaction overall exodus wallet is a good product it is not one of the best in the market in terms of security but provides a highly intuitive way to manage multiple crypto assets read more faqs does exodus charge any fee for holding coins or making transactions no exodus is free to download and use and does not charge a fee from the users however when they make a transaction the users have to pay the current transaction fee of the network this money does not go to exodus and is instead paid directly to the miners or block validators of the blockchain there is no charge for holding coins in your exodus wallet what are erc20 tokens and does exodus support them erc20 tokens are ethereum based digital assets that are often developed by a company startup or developer as part of an ico or other fundraising methods for their blockchain based idea some popular stablecoins in the market are also erc20 assets designed to provide a fiat equivalent to the crypto world exodus wallet supports a select list of erc20 tokens however your eth address can still receive any erc20 token you want these coins will not show up in your wallet asset list you can use your private keys to manage these unlisted assets if any of these assets are formally supported by the wallet in the future they will show up on the list automatically can i use the same exodus wallet on multiple computers it is possible to run the same exodus wallet on two machines however due to the design of the application it could become complicated for the users to do so for instance if the wallet on one computer makes a transaction the wallet on the second computer will not be able to detect the change users will have to refresh and upgrade both the wallets consistently to ensure that they both reflect the correct balances for an average user this could cause unnecessary hurdles however advanced users may want to upgrade their wallets and manually check if their wallets are aligned to each other and the blockchain exodus support could help users explore their transactions if the need be which fiat currencies can i see my balances in the exodus wallet allows you to check your cryptocurrency balances in fiat equivalents which help in providing a smoother experience to the users here are some of the fiat currencies it supports aud australian dollar brl brazilian real cad canadian dollar chf swiss franc clp chilean peso czk czech

the vulnerability of the sri lankan economy to global and domestic disturbances became increasingly visible in 2018 with a modest expansion in real economic activity amidst a low inflation environment during the year real gdp growth was recorded at 3 2 per cent in 2018 compared to 3 4 per cent in the previous year the cbsl annual report stated this growth was largely supported by services activities that expanded by 4 7 per cent and the recovery in agriculture activities which recorded a growth of 4 8 per cent industry activities slowed down significantly to 0 9 per cent during the year mainly as a result of the contraction in construction according to the expenditure approach both consumption and investment expenditure supported growth investment as a percentage of gdp stood at 28 6 per cent in 2018 compared to 28 8 per cent in the previous year while the savings investment gap widened during the year indicating increased dependence on external resources to fill the shortfall the total size of the sri lankan economy was estimated at us dollars 88 9 billion while the per capita gdp was recorded at us dollars 4 102 in 2018 which was marginally lower than in the previous year amidst the moderate growth in economic activity a marginal increase in the unemployment rate and a decline in the labour force participation rate were observed during the year external sector the external sector of the economy was volatile during the year due to both global and domestic factors globally monetary policy normalisation particularly in the united states of america usa resulted in global financial conditions tightening thus causing capital outflows from emerging market economies and increased pressure on exchange rates of twin deficit economies in particular sri lanka also experienced these headwinds particularly from mid april 2018 which were exacerbated following the political uncertainties and the downgrade of the country s sovereign rating in the fourth quarter of the year domestically the trade deficit surpassed us dollars 10 billion for the first time in history with higher growth in import expenditure outpacing the growth in export earnings which were at a record level in nominal terms services and exports although services exports are estimated to have grown substantially the deficit in the merchandise trade balance stagnant workers remittances and rising foreign interest payments resulted in a widened current account deficit of 3 2 per cent of gdp during the year the financial account benefitted from increased foreign direct investment fdi inflows which recorded its historically highest level in 2018 as well as borrowing from abroad particularly through the issuance of international sovereign bonds isbs the combined result of these developments was a deficit in the overall balance in the balance of payments bop market based exchange rate policy in 2018 the central bank followed a market based exchange rate policy and allowed a sharper depreciation of the rupee but intervened in the domestic foreign exchange market particularly at times when large capital outflows and undue speculation caused excessive volatility in the market in order to address the widening trade deficit the central bank and the government implemented a series of measures to curb non essential imports by increasing tariffs imposing margin requirements tightening loan to value ratios on selected types of lending and suspending the issuance of letters of credit lcs on concessionary permits for vehicle imports in response to these measures and the global financial markets becoming less unfavourable the pressure on the bop and the exchange rate subsided during late 2018 and early 2019 and the sri lankan rupee appreciated against major currencies during the first quarter of 2019 thus correcting the overshooting of the exchange rate observed in the previous year to some extent the resumption of discussions and the achievement of staff level agreement with the international monetary fund imf on the programme under the extended fund facility eff arrangement in february 2019 also helped improve investor sentiments in spite of the sharp depreciation of the rupee and the introduction of the pricing formula for domestic petroleum price adjustments headline and core inflation remained well anchored in low single digit levels during the year supported by proactive monetary policy measures improved domestic supply conditions and also due to subdued aggregate demand conditions headline inflation fluctuated largely in line with the price movements of the food category where food prices declined mostly during 2018 owing to favourable weather conditions that prevailed during the year inflation is expected to remain well within mid single digit levels in the medium term particularly under the envisaged flexible inflation targeting fit regime subdued inflation and inflation expectations and lower than potential growth in real economic activity prompted the central bank to signal an end to the monetary tightening cycle in april2018 by reducing the standing lending facility rate slfr by 25 basis points thereafter the central bank maintained a neutral monetary policy stance throughout the year in view of the continued pressure on the external sector amidst the subpar performance in the domestic economy nevertheless the large and persistent liquidity deficit in the domestic money market particularly since september 2018 compelled the central bank to inject liquidity on a permanent basis in november 2018 by way of reducing the statutory reserve ratio srr applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1 50percentage points however at the same time to neutralise the impact of the srr reduction and maintain its neutral policy stance the central bank increased the standing deposit facility rate sdfr by 75 basis points and slfr by 50 basis points further narrowing the policy rate corridor to100 basis points accordingly by end 2018 sdfr and slfr stood at 8 00 per cent and 9 00 per cent respectively as the shortage in rupee liquidity persisted into early 2019 the central bank reduced the srr by a further 1 00 percentage point to 5 00per cent effective march 1 2019 meanwhile the year on year growth of broad money m2b decelerated in 2018 driven by the contraction in net foreign assets nfa of the banking sector however within broad money growth the overall expansion of credit granted to the private sector by commercial banks in 2018 was higher than expected in spite of tight liquidity conditions and high nominal and real market interest rates in the meantime fiscal operations during2018 demonstrated some improvements witha higher primary surplus and a lower budget deficit notwithstanding the decline in revenue mobilisation government revenue the government revenue declined to 13 3 per cent of gdp in 2018 while expenditure and net lending declined particularly due to lower public investment which was affected by political tensions that prevailed towards the end of the year resulting in delays in the implementation of budgetary operations reduced capital expenditure also contributed to a dampening of economic activity the current account deficit increased in 2018 as a percentage of gdp reflecting dissavings of the government the primary balance which mirrors the difference between the government revenue and non interest expenditure registered a surplus of 0 6 per cent of gdp in 2018 compared to the surplus of 0 02 per cent of gdp in 2017 the budget deficit declined to 5 3 per cent of gdp in2018 from 5 5 per cent of gdp in 2017 as a result of the substantial reduction in capital expenditure but a deviation from the target level of 4 8 per cent of gdp envisaged in the budget 2018 was also observed the outstanding central government debt increased to 82 9 per cent of gdp at end2018 from 76 9 per cent at end 2017 which is attributed to the depreciation of the rupee that affected the rupee value of foreign debt relatively low nominal gdp and higher net borrowings during the period rollover risks can be contained through the implementation of the provisions of the active liability management act alma and the introduction of the medium term debt management strategy mtds which would help manage the government s debt obligations in the period ahead with the support of continued commitment towards revenue based fiscal consolidation financial sector the financial sector continued to expand in 2018 supported by the moderate but stable growth of the banking sector however the profitability of the banking sector declined during the year mainly due to some deterioration in the asset quality a rise in operating costs and higher taxes the central bank strengthened the prudential policy measures including the implementation of baseliii requirements and the adoption of sri lanka accounting standard slfrs 9 during the year meanwhile the licensed finance companies lfcs and specialised leasing companies slcs sector also recorded moderate growth amidst a challenging environment and the central bank took measures to resolve distressed finance companies and to address the lingering concerns in the sector the colombo stock exchange cse recorded yet another year of poor performance due to adverse developments on domestic and global fronts which affected investor sentiments amidst efforts to maintain the country s macroeconomic stability over the past several years the postponement of much needed structural reforms has moved the sri lankan economy to a modest growth path sri lanka s graduation to the middle income status almost a decade ago required far reaching policy reforms to move towards higher income status by avoiding the so called middle income trap however delays in addressing barriers to growth and introducing growth enhancing reforms in the areas of export promotion attracting fdi reducing budget deficits and debt levels reforming factor markets strengthening public administration and ensuring the rule of law have largely contributed to sri lanka s economic stagnation while peer economies have progressed rapidly as a result of growth supporting reforms therefore for sri lanka to succeed as a higher income economy and improve the wellbeing of its people it is essential that the root causes for the continued low economic growth are addressed by expediting the required structural reforms with a focus on improving productivity and efficiency of the economy in this background it is vital that all stakeholders make concerted efforts to expedite the reform agenda that is already in place which includes the national export strategy nes and new trade policy ntp to improve earnings from merchandise and service exports the fiscal consolidation programme to improve fiscal discipline and debt sustainability and the central bank s move towards adopting fit by 2020 to ensure sustained price stability the timely implementation of these reforms will not only improve sri lanka s economic outlook and its prospects as a highly sought after destination for investments given the country s strategic location in the indian ocean but also would be essential to uplift the overall standard of living and quality of life of its people the country can no longer afford to postpone such reforms if sri lanka is to progress along a high and sustainable growth trajectory over the medium term and catch up with countries that were behind sri lanka several decades ago
as the popularity of digital payments continues to increase across the globe some believe that a state backed cryptocurrency could be doable when the price of oil crashed in 2014 see fig 1 venezuela s economy plunged into a deep recession with the country almost entirely dependent on the substance an economic crisis erupted while rampant inflation rendered its currency the bolívar virtually worthless the use of cash is dwindling replaced by easy and convenient card and mobile payments in december 2017 nicolás maduro who had become the de facto dictator of the country took a radical step to revive the economy by announcing plans to launch a venezuelan cryptocurrency called the petro the digital coin would be backed by the country s oil reserves at the time cryptocurrencies were gaining wider recognition in the financial world as bitcoin s price soared to record highs the clamour around the currency reached a fever pitch in mid december when it hit an all time high of nearly 20 000 just a month after maduro s announcement however the price of the world s biggest cryptocurrency halved see fig 2 since then its value and the value of other major digital currencies has only continued to fall nevertheless the idea of a state backed cryptocurrency took hold for a number of central bankers although the petro has been engulfed in controversy and confusion a handful of countries are now getting serious about creating their own digital currency a nefarious vehicle the petro was meant to revive venezuela s ailing economy and bring life back to the bolívar using the cryptocurrency essentially a repackaged government controlled asset maduro hoped to avoid us sanctions by making international transactions outside of the conventional banking system darrell west the founding director of the us based brookings institution s centre for technology innovation explained the appeal of cryptocurrencies for sanctioned nations countries that face limitations on global trade or international transactions see these currencies as a way to operate outside the control of central banks that gives them the power to operate autonomously with other nations even though major governments are trying to isolate them internationally but the legitimacy of the petro is still hazy despite maduro s bold claim in 2018 that the petro had already raised 3 3bn a reuters investigation later found that venezuela s cryptocurrency could neither be traded on any major exchange nor accepted as currency by any other country what s more other government officials said the coin was still in development and it is unclear whether the oil reserves said to be the basis of its value can actually be extracted despite the disputes and ambiguity around the petro other countries that are similarly shut out of the global financial system through sanctions are developing plans to create their own state backed cryptocurrencies around the time when venezuela was gearing up to announce the petro russia s plans for a digital alternative to its ruble the cryptoruble emerged in 2018 sergei glazyev an economic advisor to president vladimir putin told a meeting of government officials that a cryptoruble would help russia settle accounts with other counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions according to a report by the financial times 3 3bn the disputed amount generated for venezuela in 2018 by the petro according to president maduro iran revealed that it was also interested in developing a digital currency after the us began reimposing sanctions on the country the coin will reportedly be called paymon and will be backed by iran s gold reserves compared with venezuela s petro these countries are taking a more robust approach to cryptocurrencies according to yaya fanusie a senior fellow at the foundation for defence of democracies not just making an announcement and putting something out there that s not really connected to the rest of the economy they re actually doing research they re laying the groundwork they re collaborating i think their effort is a lot more sophisticated and thought out he told world finance even so it is unlikely the two countries will be able to operate outside of the conventional banking system in the way they envision soon after venezuela launched the petro the us prohibited americans from using or trading the cryptocurrency in an article for the brookings institute west and co author jack karsten called the petro deceitful and said it offered no long term value for international holders they wrote the petro cannot stabilise the venezuelan economy and instead exists to create foreign currency reserves from thin air scandinavian progress circumventing financial sanctions is certainly not the only application for state backed cryptocurrencies elsewhere in the world the use of cash is dwindling replaced by easy and convenient card and mobile payments sweden is expected to become the world s first cashless society by as soon as 2023 the use of cash has been plummeting there since 2007 when around sek 100bn 10 7bn was in circulation in 2018 just sek 45bn 4 8bn moved through the economy the ubiquity of digital payments is beginning to make cash transactions more costly for retailers the ubiquity of digital payments is beginning to make cash transactions more costly for retailers when cash payments fall below seven percent of a swedish retailer s total transactions it becomes more expensive to manage than the marginal profit the sales offer according to a 2018 survey by the country s central bank the riksbank only 13 percent of respondents paid for their most recent purchase in cash compared with 39 percent in 2010 the riksbank is now researching a central bank digital currency cbdc called the e krona unlike venezuela which attempted to create a brand new currency the e krona would give the public access to a digital complement to its physical currency the riksbank said and would remain a state guaranteed means of payment 865m stolen from crypto exchanges in 2018 40 of illicit transactions between criminals in the eu involved bitcoin in 2015 15 7trn worth of global online payments in 2017 were made in china 337bn worth of global online payments in 2017 were made in the us the basic benefits of digitalising a currency include efficiencies in digital payments and transparent transactions central banks could also allow policymakers to see every transaction in real time allowing the bank to track every unit of currency so theoretically for monetary policy better control and maybe more effective policy fanusie said the riksbank has also recognised the risks involved with implementing such new and wide ranging technology saying on its website the question of whether sweden should introduce a state issued digital krona is one that will affect the whole of society by continuing to examine the scope for doing so the riksbank is preparing a possible way forward towards meeting a new digital payment market by not acting on digital currencies the bank said it would be abandoning the payment market to private agents making it difficult to promote a safe and efficient payment system indeed similar discussions are beginning to occur in other countries such as switzerland which in 2018 began research into a state backed e franc starting small while sweden switzerland and others continue weighing the pros and cons of implementing a state backed cryptocurrency a small island nation in the south pacific is preparing to take the plunge the marshall islands plans to launch a digital currency called the sovereign or sov to its population of 53 000 by as soon as 2020 barak ben ezer previously the ceo and co founder of israeli fintech company neema came up with the initial idea which quickly gained the support of hilda heine president of the marshall islands the government s declaration and issuance of the sovereign currency act in february 2018 made the idea into a legal possibility according to its website as both a fiat currency and a cryptocurrency the sov would act as a panama canal between the old world of traditional finance and the rising tide of cryptocurrencies it continued sov is the first crypto free of the regulatory friction and ambiguity faced by bitcoin and others it s just money no different than the dollar euro or yen and benefits from the well established regulatory and legal framework shared by all sovereign currencies countries shut out of the financial system through sanctions are developing their own state backed cryptocurrencies ben ezer has brought on several co founders to help bring his vision to life including peter dittus who was the secretary general of the bank for international settlements bis from 2005 to the end of 2016 and currently acts as the chief economist at sov he told world finance that the marshall islands was the perfect place to test a state backed cryptocurrency because of its small size and the fact that the country s legal tender since the 1980s has been the us dollar if the new cryptocurrency doesn t work as well as you expect you have a fall back position so your downside risk is very small he said a country like sweden on the other hand is much bigger and has a well established currency of its own they must be very careful he warned much can still go wrong when trying to incorporate a new technology like a cryptocurrency into an established economy for instance security systems must be carefully developed to ensure there is no way for hackers to break in as they have at numerous exchanges in recent years in 2018 alone around 865m was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges can happen to central banks as well as to private people or exchanges dittus said on top of that countries like the marshall islands that have a reputation as a tax haven must go further to ensure any new currency cannot be misused cryptocurrencies already have a bad name as a result of their use in illegal activities a 2015 report by europol said bitcoin was used in over 40 percent of illicit transactions between criminals in the european union dittus stressed that the sov would be the first fiat digital currency with anti money laundering and know your customer provisions built into its core the company is calling this the yokwe protocol to make a cryptocurrency a serious currency you must make sure that it cannot be misused dittus said you want to have this currency recognised in international transactions as well and that means that banks and regulators across the world must accept this as a real currency chinese promise however it is neither sweden nor the marshall islands that presents the most exciting prospect for state backed cryptocurrencies in fanusie s mind china has long looked to push the boundaries of the definition of currency it was in china that paper bills were first used in place of coins during the tang dynasty which held power in the country from 618 to 907 today mobile phone payments are soaring in china thanks to the widespread use of payment apps including tencent s wechat and alibaba s alipay digital payments accounted for almost half of the global volume in 2017 according to research by pwc that same year 15 7trn worth of online payments were made in china compared with just 337bn in the us the people s bank of china has been researching and actively monitoring the development of digital currencies and blockchain technology since 2014 in 2018 zhou xiaochuan the former governor of the central bank called the development of a digital currency inevitable experts in the country are approaching cryptocurrencies in a sophisticated and strategic way fanusie said for instance he told world finance the bank s digital currency research institute has set up think tanks in two chinese provinces where innovators are encouraged to work on blockchain projects 39 of survey respondents in sweden in 2010 paid for their most recent purchase in cash 13 of survey respondents in sweden in 2018 paid for their most recent purchase in cash unlike venezuela or sweden china has been tight lipped about its plans for any state issued cryptocurrency including what it would look like how it would work and a timeline of when it would be launched they re pretty much fertilising the environment they re laying down the groundwork on cryptocurrency fanusie said china is going to be the potential game changer a chinese digital currency would not only facilitate a cashless society but it could also bolster monetary policy proposals such as the belt and road initiative china s multibillion dollar plan for a 21st century silk road as jennifer zhu scott a founding partner at the investment community radian partners described in an article for the world economic forum if the chinese central bank used its own cryptocurrency to replace the dollar for trade along the belt and road initiative it could challenge the dollar s dominance china s digital currency revolution would expedite the accelerating retreat of the us in international trade while serving the chinese government s key domestic agendas and potentially have a profound impact on society as we know it she wrote central power the debate around state backed cryptocurrencies has opened up to include key financial institutions around the world for instance the bis warned central bankers in march 2018 that state backed digital currencies could threaten the financial system by causing consumers to swarm from private banks to the central bank during times of financial instability causing a digital run many of the original supporters of cryptocurrencies were compelled by the idea of decentralisation old questions about the role of central bank money the scope of direct access to central bank liabilities and the structure of financial intermediation the bis said in a 2018 report adding that further research was needed on topics including the possible effects on interest rates and movements in exchange rates in november 2018 christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund argued for central banks to consider how state issued digital currencies could boost public policy goals such as financial inclusion consumer protection and privacy in payments speaking at a fintech conference in singapore lagarde also warned of risks to financial stability and innovation but she said the advantages of cbdcs were clear your payment would be immediate safe cheap and potentially semi anonymous and central banks would retain a sure footing in payments in addition they would offer a more level playing field for competition and a platform for innovation she continued putting it another way the central bank focuses on its comparative advantage back end settlement and financial institutions and start ups are free to focus on what they do best client interface and innovation this is public private partnership at its best there are still hurdles the industry would have to overcome however one possible point of contention is likely to remain between those who currently promote cryptocurrencies and central bankers who would control them decentralisation many of the original supporters of cryptocurrencies were compelled by the idea of decentralisation unlike a fiat currency that is controlled by a central bank cryptocurrencies are processed through distributed ledger technology so they are not managed by any one entity state backed cryptos blur the line between digital currencies and state control because they operate at the discretion of the particular government west explained the whole point of a cryptocurrency is to avoid government control in the crypto world dittus said decentralisation is a little bit like a holy grail although ben ezer emphasised in an interview with the next web that the government cannot control the supply of the sov and will have no control over how it circulates dittus said some centralised function is necessary particularly in monitoring the anti money laundering features a purely decentralised official sovereign currency cannot exist in my mind it doesn t work dittus said a country s currency that is accepted internationally must have good enough oversight by this country so that other countries will trust that this is a good currency the riksbank drew a line between cbdcs and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to eliminate this paradox crypto assets like cryptocurrencies are not money it says on its website because these assets lack an official issuer and do not function like a normal means of payment an e krona if it becomes a reality would be issued by sveriges riksbank and have the same value as banknotes and coins on the other hand should not be seen as currencies but rather as a form of financial asset taking root however it is defined experts are still split on whether they think any kind of digital currency issued by a central bank would take off building national cryptocurrencies and the financial systems needed to support them will not be easy west was pessimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies like venezuela s petro telling world finance that central banks were unlikely to trust financial tools outside conventional regulation having digital currencies creates risks that monetary devices will create major loopholes in current rules on global trade he said if these institutions decide to embrace a new technology the question remains whether digital currencies will be introduced in a year a decade or longer having worked on digital money projects since 1995 dittus said the basic idea for cryptocurrencies is the same today as it was then the difference is that now the technology is there and people understand how to implement this in a relatively user friendly way compared to 1995 he said he added that it is something that is taken seriously not just by some sort of crypto freaks but by lots of central banks dittus believes cryptocurrency technology is still in its early days but he sees a lot of potential i have little doubt that some sort of digital money will see the light in many countries still there is much work to be done establishing the financial technology infrastructure needed to support a state backed cryptocurrency the system is not really built and it s more than just having the software fanusie said you need to have exchanges you have to have places where people can purchase the cryptocurrency and ways for merchants to take it that s not something that s going to happen overnight building national cryptocurrencies and the financial systems needed to support them will not be easy but technology will likely continue evolving to catch up with the idealistic plans of entrepreneurs and financial institutions as it has in the more than two decades since dittus first came across digital currencies while we may be many years away from any radical departure from the paper notes and coins we carry around in our pockets it is clear that the seed of an idea has begun to germinate

photo courtesy of the central bank of russia washington dc apr 24 ips olga stankova is with the communications department at the international monetary fund imf within a few short months after taking up her post as governor of the central bank of russia in 2013 elvira nabiullina faced a growing economic crisis brought on by plunging oil prices geopolitical tensions and sanctions by december 2014 the exchange rate and the banking system were under severe pressure and the economy was heading into recession a decisive response was needed and the central bank chose to float the exchange rate announce an immediate move to inflation targeting and step up the pace of banking reform these bold policies have yielded significant positive results the first female governor of the central bank of russia nabiullina was named 2015 s central bank governor of the year by euromoney magazine and 2016 s best central bank governor in europe by the banker she has also appeared on forbes list of the world s most powerful women in september 2018 she delivered the michel camdessus central banking lecture at the imf in this interview with olga stankova of the imf s communications department nabiullina who previously served as minister of economic development discusses her experience leading russia s central bank during this challenging period finance development f d inflation targeting that is when a central bank announces a target for inflation and manages inflation expectations through its policy actions is often considered fairly complex and demanding for emerging market economies what was the rationale for adopting this policy in russia looking at the experience of other countries we saw inflation targeting as a policy that makes it possible to reduce inflation and maintain it consistently at a fairly low level of course this policy can be challenging for emerging markets because their financial markets are relatively shallow and what is probably more important inflation targeting requires the management of inflation expectations this is challenging in an emerging market where the public has lived through periods of high inflation grown accustomed to high inflation and does not believe that low inflation can be achieved over the longer term of course there were many critics of the decision to adopt inflation targeting because russia relies heavily on revenue from the extraction of natural resources many believed that this feature of our economy would limit the effectiveness of inflation targeting but i believe the decision was timely and warranted indeed the need for a transition became obvious after the 2008 crisis we in any event did not make an abrupt switch to inflation targeting we had already begun to prepare for it after the 2008 2009 crisis first we developed the tools needed to refinance banks and those tools made it possible to use interest rate policy through the transmission mechanism to manage inflation second we gradually moved to a more flexible exchange rate from a fairly strictly managed rate to a floating rate third and very importantly inflation targeting depends on the quality of models projections and analysis so we also developed that capacity i think that these three elements were crucial to ensuring that in introducing inflation targeting we were able to achieve the effects that we had promised the public now after four years of inflation targeting i believe that this policy framework suits countries such as russia that is to say emerging market economies many have adopted this policy and i don t know any examples of countries that officially switched from inflation targeting to different policies f d the exchange rate was floated at the peak of the crisis in late 2014 were there any other good choices in that situation and was managing the exchange rate for a while longer an option en indeed we had to move to a floating exchange rate during a period of elevated risks to financial stability i am convinced however that this was not a reason to put off the decision we would have simply spent some part of our gold and forex reserves and then would have needed to float anyhow in my view the floating exchange rate has worked well to absorb external shocks and has facilitated a rapid adjustment of the balance of payments we saw that again during the following cycle in 2016 you will recall that in early 2016 oil prices fell and thanks to the floating exchange rate the effects on the financial markets as a whole were unremarkable f d you worked on the exchange rate policy before adopting inflation targeting would you advise countries looking at your experience to move to a floating exchange rate earlier in the process en we floated the exchange rate gradually before i came to the central bank the corridor had already been widened allowing increased flexibility of the exchange rate there is one issue that i would like to highlight it is true that we floated the exchange rate during a period of financial stress and at that moment it was important to actually float it not just talk about floating all countries have a fear of floating and during a difficult period of instability that fear increases f d what has the cbr done to broaden public support for the policies you followed and what was the role of communications during the crisis and the subsequent transition period en communication was very important during the transition from one policy to another both to explain to society what was happening and to demonstrate the benefits of the new policy this was especially true because the transition to inflation targeting was accompanied by an unpopular measure raising the policy rate and the floating exchange rate also frightened people inflation targeting of course requires a qualitatively higher level of communications with the market than other policies as inflation targeting is based on the management of expectations and on forecasts it was thus critically important for us to establish the needed communications we greatly expanded our communications toolkit starting with announcing the dates of board meetings a year in advance which had not been done before we also began to hold press conferences and provide more analytical materials reports interviews and surveys as well as arrange meetings with investors and analysts in addition we also worked with the regions where we met with business analysts and the regional leadership to make sure that our policies were understood but the most fundamental element of our communications has been achieving our announced target only then do people start believing what you say and your forecasts i want to mention one more important aspect of communications at first the focus was on ensuring that analysts and market professionals understood what we did what is important now is to communicate with a broader business audience and the public to build trust in our policy and to give people greater confidence as they make their life and business plans allowing them to rely on the fact that inflation is under control f d there has been fairly serious pressure on the central bank including from business to reduce the rate faster than you would like what does it take to withstand that pressure en we have just consistently followed our policy our task was to show in practice that high interest rates were curbing inflation and that interest rates in the economy would come down along with inflation this is what started to happen in 2016 2017 we see that mortgage lending for example began to develop and the inflation outlook is very important for that type of lending we are trying to show the business community that our policy is in its interest and notably that it is needed lengthen the planning horizon these changes have of course not always easy for business it is one thing when high inflation allows you to shift your costs into constantly rising prices and another thing entirely when your ability to do this is more limited in order to be competitive you need to make efforts to raise labor productivity and lower costs this is a challenge for business but we believe that low inflation is by now one of the structural factors that will change the model of economic development enhance productivity now we experience a temporary increase in inflation mostly because the vat rate was increased and we raised the key rate to prevent inflation from upward spiraling we expect it to reach as much as 5 5 6 by the end of q1 and then it will start decreasing once again we ve faced critics because of key rate but we also see how fast people started to take low inflation as normal how much they are concerned about its growth and this helps to set our priorities straight low inflation is important for everyone we ll do what s needed to keep it within the target in spite of critics f d in retrospect how do you assess the results of adopting inflation targeting in russia are there some things that you might have done differently with the benefit of hindsight en i think that inflation targeting like the floating exchange rate has been working first we are now able to actually achieve inflation targets sometimes we are told that we are attaining our goal of reducing inflation by raising interest rates too high and suppressing economic growth however our calculations show that this is not really the case because the present economic growth rate is close to the potential growth rate of 1½ to 2 percent the historically low level of unemployment is further evidence of this in addition raising economic growth using monetary policy when output is close to potential is not possible one needs to make structural changes inflation targeting is indeed accomplishing its central objective which is to reduce inflation along with the floating exchange rate inflation targeting has made the economy more resistant to external shocks our policy has made it possible for both business and the public to have more confidence in ruble assets that they will not be devalued and that the purchasing power of the ruble will be maintained one indicator of this among others is de dollarization of deposits regulatory measures have of course also played a role in sum i am confident that strategically we have taken the right decision even if some fine tuning might have been possible when some people talk about what happened in 2014 they say that everything should have been done earlier but a month or two earlier would have changed little a few years earlier yes possibly that would have been better there is also the opposite criticism which holds that when we raised the interest rate and floated the exchange rate it was a mistake not to intervene in the foreign exchange market the critics point to the risks to financial stability at that time and claim that in the end we let the exchange rate overshoot too much however i believe it was absolutely necessary to go through that stage to bring about a change in policy it was important for people to see that the exchange rate was in fact floating and therefore that it should find its equilibrium level in the market if we had intervened we would have continued to waste gold and foreign exchange reserves while stoking expectations of further devaluation f d you also reformed the banking sector what were the economic and political considerations behind your course of action en stable economic growth requires a stable strong financial system a weak financial system cannot support economic growth our banking system had accumulated a range of problems that we have been tackling in recent years first the banking system lacked sufficient genuine capital you will recall that the banking system emerged very quickly in the early 1990s and without capital even afterward capital did not flow into the system in any significant amounts second as a result of the crises of 2008 and then 2014 2015 the quality of banks assets deteriorated those assets remained on banks balance sheets and it was necessary to deal with them another reason is that banks were often used for unscrupulous practices their owners used them to finance their own business with poor risk management and there was money laundering it became obvious that the banking system had to be restructured as it could not support growth and it would continue to require large financial infusions to survive a crisis it is clear why it was necessary to provide such support in 2008 and 2014 it was impossible to let the banking system collapse as this would have immediately led to a domino effect and contagion we had to take measures on improving health of banking system to avoid new infusions in future we revoked about 400 licenses from unstable and fraudulent banks and moreover we had to restructure three large banks and this led to an increase in the share of state ownership in the banking sector we are trying to build regulation and supervision that treats banks equally regardless of whether the state holds their shares we recognize that the market would like to see a reduction in the share of state ownership we certainly intend to put banks in which we are temporarily holding a share back on the market as soon as there is an opportunity f d in 2013 you also assumed responsibility for nonbank financial institutions and the central bank became a mega regulator has that reform proven worthwhile and how do you assess the results en it is probably quite rare for a central bank to be responsible not just for monetary policy and bank regulation and supervision but also for the non bank sector moreover the functions of a securities commission have also been assigned to the central bank one feature of our economy is that our largest banks are part of groups that include insurance companies and private pension funds and the risks are commingled seeing the full picture is difficult looking at the banking sector on its own one also needs to look at the relationships between banks and other members of a financial group in our view the mega regulator approach has many benefits that became evident for example when we began to restructure the three large groups we were able to take a consolidated view of an entire group and identify the risks within it and that allowed us to understand the scale of the problems in those groups a holistic view of financial regulation also reduces regulatory arbitrage and makes it easier to ensure uniform approaches and standards it is likely that there are also some drawbacks to a mega regulator the central bank on the one hand issues money and implements monetary policy while on the other hand it supervises banks which includes the revocation of licenses it makes room for the public demand for the mega regulator to solve banks problems by issuing money as we couldn t prevent their collapses and the mega regulator has to survive under this pressure and should build walls between for example banking supervision and monetary policy but in spite of some controversies i think that the idea of a mega regulator is in my view very promising given the way the financial markets are developing the boundaries between financial institutions are becoming blurred there is digitalization of the financial system ecosystems and platform solutions are emerging it is frequently said that bank regulation grew much tougher after the 2007 crisis and that risks moved to other less regulated parts of the financial sector a consolidated approach helps us better oversee the shadow banking system f d you are seen as a very independent central banker how did you manage to overcome pressure and criticism en well we have not quite overcome it yet f d at least you stayed the course en when serious changes are being made there are always a lot of critics that said surveys showed for many years that inflation was the number one problem for people but it has now dropped far down the list for us this is an important policy outcome low inflation has a positive effect on people s social well being for business low inflation allows for a reduction in interest rates over the long term and not just as a one off result this is very different from giving someone cheap money reducing rates and afterwards rates rise dramatically because inflation has spiraled up f d you are now viewed as a very successful central banker is this the result of your analytical approach and correct calculations or was there some luck involved en i think that it is important to simply implement policy in a consistent way the goal of transitioning to inflation targeting was already announced before i came to the central bank and much preparatory work had already been done it was important to be consistent during turbulent times rather than panicking and flailing about it was also vital not to put off necessary decisions the problems facing central banks usually do not simply go away a late decision carries high costs for society and a populist monetary policy has negative consequences even if it seems easier f d what leadership qualities are essential for success as a central banker en first find professionals you can rely on and do not be afraid to surround yourself with strong people stimulate debate so people are not afraid to express their opinion and then on this basis take a decision and do not deviate from it it is important for people who work at a central bank to understand that they are working for the public good for long range goals we need to deliver on our promises to society that is a key principle for me and for our staff in any policy including monetary policy it is not possible to avoid compromises however it is important to understand that there are limits to compromise opinions expressed in articles and other materials in imf s finance development are those

for change in global markets the investment manager is focused on four strategies where it believes it has a competitive advantage in markets activist and governance focused investments credit securities short selling and identifying emerging compounder securities each of these areas of focus is expected to further increase in size the investment manager has continued to invest in expanding its team recently adding capital markets and risk expertise and formally creating an activist and governance research team steve bates chairman of third point offshore investors limited commented i am encouraged by the positive initiatives enacted by the investment manager following the fund s fourth down year in its nearly 25 year life and believe its strategy is well suited to these markets the investment manager s present approach has generated an 9 8 increase in nav in the first three months of 2019 the board and investment manager recognise the company s persistent share discount to nav which remains too high this is a primary area of focus for the board in the coming year and we remain fully committed to ensuring the market rating better reflects the true value of the company as

investment company registered and incorporated in guernsey on 19 july 2007 the company invests its assets in third point offshore master fund l p the master partnership via third point offshore fund ltd the master fund which pursues an opportunistic investment approach based on event driven fundamental value analysis i was delighted to have been named non executive chairman of the company in february 2019 and this is therefore my first statement to you the returns to investors for the year were disappointing as explained later but the manager has responded to this by refining parts of the investment process to reflect changes in the structure of markets and by resourcing these initiatives with high quality personnel there is a greater wariness of market volatility as a result of the influence of algorithmic and etf trading and this presents both a threat to market stability and an opportunity for the master partnership to be a provider of liquidity when a dislocation occurs a greater degree of caution is evident in the portfolio structure than was the case during much of 2018 and this gives the company the ability to benefit from episodes of volatility that the manager sees lying in wait i am very supportive of third point s ability to create long term shareholder value and believe that the investor will be well served by a high quality team which invests globally across the capital structure and takes a research intensive approach to identifying catalysts for change an area of concern for your board has been the level of the discount to net asset value which remains stubbornly high this will be a major focus for the board in the year ahead and i look forward to engaging with both third point and with shareholders to ensure the market rating more properly reflects the intrinsic value of the company before my arrival the company s board of directors and third point llc the investment manager undertook a number of corporate actions throughout 2018 with the aim of addressing some governance concerns and removing structural obstacles to reducing the discount these included 1 fee structure as announced by the board on 28 december 2018 the company s annual management fee was reduced to 1 25 from 2 effective 1 january 2019 following a transfer into a new share class in the master fund and to reflect the company s size and longevity as an investor in the master fund further because the master fund carries a modified high watermark provision as it relates to the performance fee the company will bear a reduced 10 performance fee on all gains in the master fund until the master fund s returns increase by approximately 35 since 31 december 2018 2 transfer to premium listing on the london stock exchange the company was admitted to the premium official list segment premium listing of the london stock exchange lse on 10 september 2018 following the premium listing tpoil was approved for inclusion in the ftse uk all share index effective 24 december 2018 the directors expect that such inclusion will likely improve liquidity for secondary market trading in the shares on the lse and also improve demand for the shares by appealing to a

variety of new initiatives including a more comprehensive company website www thirdpointoffshore com more frequent engagement with company shareholders senior investment team presence in london and regular portfolio updates i plan to work closely with the board and the investment manager to maintain a constant dialogue with company shareholders as well 4 share buyback programme as announced by the board on 5 december 2018 the company has been engaged in a share repurchase programme the programme with the intention of further improving the company s rating from december 2018 to the date of these financial statements the net asset value nav uplift due to share buybacks was 15 cents per share a monthly summary of repurchase activity related to the programme is available on the company s website 5 updated capital allocation policy in q1 2018 the board reviewed the company s capital allocation policy and determined that the dividend policy established in 2012 is not aligned with the company s corporate structure or the investment manager s strategy as such the dividend policy was discontinued in favour of the share buyback programme shares bought back will either be held in treasury or can be cancelled at the discretion of the board in either event purchases at the current level of discount have a significant positive effect on net asset value the previous buyback approach led to the master fund holding shares in the company and it was felt that this created some confusion leading to the more conventional approach now in place as part of this change the board repurchased and cancelled 5 of the company s outstanding shares held by the master fund resulting in a concurrent uplift to the nav per share of approximately 19 cents 6 conversion of sterling denominated share class finally effective 27 june 2018 the previously existing sterling denominated class shares was converted into the u s dollar denominated class shares in an effort to afford the u s dollar class shareholders greater liquidity the conversion was in accordance with the provision in the company s articles of incorporation granting the directors the discretionary right to convert any class with a net asset value of less than 50 million as i mentioned the results for the year were disappointing with particular weakness visible in the fourth quarter for the year ended 31 december 2018 the nav per share performance decreased by 10 9 for the u s dollar share class performance was driven primarily by losses in core equity long positions against a challenging broader market environment and a significant rise in market volatility i am happy to report that for the first three months of 2019 the nav has increased by 9 8 i am encouraged by the changes the investment manager enacted toward year end including a deleveraging across the portfolio a reduction in net equity exposures and a focus on increasing the short equity portfolio please refer to the investment manager s statement for additional details regarding 2018 performance and portfolio repositioning in 2019 i encourage all shareholders to review the portfolio commentary available on the company

considerations of managing overall exposures across specific asset classes sectors and geographies by evaluating sizing concentration factor risk and beta among other considerations the resulting portfolio expresses the investment manager s best ideas for generating alpha and its tolerance for risk given global market conditions the investment manager is opportunistic and often seeks a catalyst that will unlock value or alter the lens through which the greater market values a particular investment the investment manager applies aspects of this framework to its decision making

procedures are reserved for approval by the board of directors the board receives full information on the company s investment performance assets liabilities and other relevant information in advance of board meetings board tenure and succession planning the board notes the aic code and uk code suggest it would be good practice for all directors to be offered for re election at regular intervals subject to continued satisfactory performance in accordance with the company s articles of incorporation the independent directors and mr targoff treated for the purposes of the aic code as a non independent director may retire at each agm principle 3 aic code the board believes that benefits to shareholders arise from the directors long term knowledge and experience of the company and its management including their ongoing ability to independently review the performance of the investment manager the board have implemented a policy whereby a predesignated director puts himself herself up for re election to the board at each agm this policy is intended to address the balance of views and experience on the board and to comply with the aic code which requires that every director that has completed over nine years service on the board must be subject to annual re election by the shareholders the revised uk corporate governance code effective 1 january 2019 will require that all directors be subject to annual re election the board takes the view that independence is not necessarily compromised by the length of tenure on the board and experience can add significantly to the board s strength the directors undertake an annual evaluation of the board s performance and continuing independence and during this evaluation which includes a review of the diversity of experience within the board to ensure that it remains appropriate all directors are asked to confirm their future intentions the board has robust procedures for the identification of prospective non executive director candidates and as part of the selection process due regard is paid to the recommendations for board diversity however ability and experience will be the prime considerations keith dorrian is

control the committee has examined the need for an internal audit function the committee considered that the systems and procedures employed by the investment manager and the administrator including

disappointed with the results but took the opportunity to learn from mistakes reflect on competitive advantages and adjust the portfolio a significant portion of the negative results for 2018 were attributable to excess unhedged long cyclical investments and one large risk arbitrage position related to a merger that failed to close the investment manager maintained too much long exposure heading into the fourth quarter which drove a portfolio decline during the market sell offs in october and december while the investment manager s single name equity short positions and structured credit portfolios performed well exposures to the assets classes were insufficient to offset the losses in core equity long positions as of 31 december 2018 the top five single issuer positions in the

judgment were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified these matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters risk our response to the risk key observations communicated to the audit committee valuation of investments us 803m py comparative us 1 014m refer to the report of the audit committee accounting policies the investments held are measured at fair value through profit or loss and their fair value is determined by reference to the published nav per share of the investee fund as calculated by its independent administrator the valuation risk considers the risk of an error in the application of the published nav per share obtained from the independent administrator of the investee fund when calculating the fair value of the company s investments as well as the effect on valuation of any gating suspension of redemptions by the investee fund our response comprised of substantive audit testing of investment valuation including agreeing the valuation per share of the company s investments in the investee fund to the nav per share of the investee fund published by its independent administrator agreeing the valuation per share of the company s investments in the investee fund to the nav per share of the investee fund per its audited financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2018

administrator of the investee fund and agreeing it to the accounting records of the company and obtaining supporting documentation for all additions and disposals of holdings in the investee fund that took place during the year ended 31 december 2018 and agreeing the details to the accounting records of the company we confirmed there were no matters identified during our audit work on existence and ownership of investments that we wanted to bring to the attention of the audit committee an overview of the scope of our audit tailoring the scope our assessment of audit risk our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope taken together this enables us to form an opinion on the financial statements our application of materiality we apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion materiality materiality is the magnitude of omissions or misstatements that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures we determined materiality for the company to be us 16 3 million 2017 us 20 3 million which is approximately 2 2017 2 of net assets we believe that net assets provides us with an appropriate basis for audit materiality as it is a key published performance measure and is a key metric used by management in assessing and reporting on overall performance during the course of our audit we reassessed initial materiality and noted no matters leading us to amend the basis of materiality 2 of net assets performance materiality performance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level it is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality on the basis of our risk assessments together with our assessment of the company s overall control environment our judgement was that performance materiality was 75 2017 75 of our planning materiality namely us 12 2 million 2017 us 15 2 million we have set performance materiality at this percentage because we have considered the likelihood of misstatements to be low we have considered both quantitative and qualitative factors when determining the expected level of detected misstatements and setting the performance materiality at this level reporting threshold the reporting threshold is an amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of us 0 8 million 2017 us 1 02 million which is set at 5 2017 5 of planning materiality as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds we evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion other information the other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor s report thereon the directors are responsible for the other information our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon in connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated if we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information if based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information we are required to report that fact we have nothing to report in this regard in this context we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions fair balanced and understandable the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company s

audit responsibilities of directors as explained more fully in the statement of directors responsibilities the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being

applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so auditor s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that

surging global oil prices will pose a first big challenge to india s new government whoever wins an election now under way especially as domestic prices have been allowed to lag meaning consumers are in for a painful surge as they catch up for oil import dependent india higher global prices could lead to a weaker rupee higher inflation the ruling out of interest rate cuts and could further weigh on twin current account and budget deficits economists warned but compounding the future pain state run fuel suppliers and retailers have held off passing on to consumers the higher prices during a staggered general election which began on april 11 and ends on may 23 according to sources familiar with the situation that delay is expected to be unwound once the election is over and there could be additional price increases to make up for losses or profits missed during the period of delayed increases the sources said in some major asian countries such as japan and south korea pump prices are adjusted periodically so they move largely in tandem with international crude prices that was what was supposed to happen in india but the election means there have been many days when pump prices have been unchanged in new delhi for example while crude oil prices have gone up by nearly 9 a barrel or about 12 percent in the past six weeks gasoline prices have only risen by 0 47 rupees a litre or 0 6 percent state controlled fuel suppliers and retailers declined to say why they had delayed price increases or discuss whether there has been any pressure from the government of prime minister narendra modi a government spokesman declined to comment the opposition congress party said modi s government was violating its own policy of daily price revision by advising the state oil companies to hold prices steady the government should cut fuel taxes otherwise consumers will have to pay much higher oil prices once the elections are over said akhilesh pratap singh a senior leader of the congress party nitin goyal treasurer at the all india petroleum dealers association representing fuel stations in 25 states said prices were similarly held down for 19 days in the southern state of karnataka last year when it held state assembly elections only for them to surge after the vote read also india needs to create millions of jobs annually here is why consumers should be ready for a rude shock of a massive jump in retail prices similar to the level we have seen in the karnataka state election goyal said credit negative sri paravaikkarasu director for asia oil at singapore based consultancy fge said retail prices of gasoline and gasoil prices would have been up to 6 percent or about 4 rupee higher if they had been allowed to rise in line with global prices indian pump prices have failed to keep up with the recent uptrend in crude prices paravaikkarasu said with the country s general elections underway the incumbent government has been keeping pump prices relatively unchanged india had switched to a daily price revision in june 2017 from a revision every two weeks as the government allowed retailers to set prices but the government faced protests last october when retailers raised prices by up to 10 rupees a litre after the crude oil price went above 80 a barrel forcing it to cut fuel taxes global prices rose to their highest level in 2019 on thursday days after the united states announced all iran sanction waivers would end by may pressuring importers including india to stop buying tehran s oil higher oil prices will mean asia s third largest economy is likely to see growth of less than 7 percent rate this fiscal year economists said growth slowed to 6 6 percent in the october december quarter the slowest in five quarters rating agency care has warned that a 10 percent rise in global oil prices could increase demand for dollars putting pressure on the rupee and widening the current account deficit india s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending march 31 to 140 5 billion against 108 billion the previous year the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy icra the indian arm of the fitch rating agency said in a note every 10 bbl increase in crude oil prices increases the fiscal deficit by about 0 1 percent of gdp any big price rise would also build a case for the central bank to keep rates steady or even raise them the reserve bank of india s monetary policy committee which cut the benchmark policy repo rate by 25 basis points this month warned that rising oil and food prices could push up inflation policymakers are worried that a sustained increase in the oil price in the range of 70 75 barrel or higher can move the rupee down by 3 4 percent on an annual basis the rupee has depreciated by 1 24 percent against the dollar since a year high in mid march 1 70 1800 indian rupees
the speed at which fire tore through notre dame cathedral was shocking to watch many were quick to ask what caused such a devastating fire a faulty cable an electrical short circuit a careless tourist sadly the risk of fire is a fact of life understanding what started a fire is often less important than figuring out how we can stop fires from spreading so quickly and how we can extinguish them faster the same is true for global economic downturns the next one could be triggered by any number of things brexit the trade war debt a us recession in 2020 the more useful question is not what will cause the downturn given economic shocks are guaranteed but how we can make it less severe and how we can respond faster and more effectively at present the global economy is poorly placed on both counts this means the next downturn could be a nasty one policymakers would be wise to act now the critical factor that determines the severity of an economic downturn is the health of balance sheets preferably lots of liquid assets and few liabilities before it starts healthy balance sheets among households businesses banks and governments produce less severe downturns households businesses and banks can use their savings as a buffer to ride out the downturn and the government can use its balance sheet through temporary fiscal stimulus to speed up the recovery but if balance sheets are weak going into a downturn things can get nasty heavily indebted households respond to a contraction in the economy by sharply cutting back their spending to try to reduce debt businesses cut back on employment and investment to stay afloat banks reduce lending to remain solvent governments have less fiscal space to support the economy each feeds back into the others producing a vicious downward spiral that s where we are today corporate balance sheets are loaded with debt in many economies global corporate debt has doubled to us 13 trillion since 2008 a third of which needs to be paid back or refinanced in the next three years corporate debt is at record highs in the united states and us 1 4 trillion of this is held by firms that have debt more than four times their earnings and already spend half those earnings on interest payments alone large opaque and heavily indebted investment vehicles have seen corporate debt increase substantially in china state owned enterprises are highly leveraged in indonesia and elsewhere in asia corporate debt exceeds 140 per cent of gdp in china france the netherlands sweden and norway more than us 1 1 trillion of loans to highly indebted firms leveraged loans have been securitised through opaque collateralised loan obligations that as with the securities that fuelled the 2008 crisis have limited regulatory oversight household balance sheets often don t look much better household debt exceeds 200 per cent of gdp in denmark the netherlands norway australia and switzerland korea canada and ireland are not far off the growth in household debt has been particularly high in emerging economies doubling as a percentage of gdp since 2008 bank balance sheets are also a concern in some countries the balance sheets of small and medium sized banks are particularly weak in china and threaten cascading failures weak growth and structural concerns have seen sharp declines in the equity valuations of many banks in the euro area and the international monetary fund has raised similar concerns for europe s insurance sector and investment funds government balance sheets are also not what they used to be government debt has increased by us 32 trillion in advanced and emerging economies since 2007 a rise of about 50 per cent as a proportion of gdp italy is particularly concerning but even governments assessed by the imf to have substantial space for budgetary measures like australia s often face political pressure not to use them the way these debts are financed also creates risks many banks firms households and governments borrowed heavily in us dollars and are now feeling pressure as the us dollar appreciates those that borrowed through short term and portfolio lending to finance longer term investment are feeling pressure as credit conditions tighten those that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are feeling pressure as rates increase but the biggest concern isn t that a fire might break out it s that we don t have an adequate fire department the financial first responder is typically the central bank which can lower interest rates to promote economic activity but rates are already very low in most advanced economies leaving little room for central banks to respond to a downturn by cutting interest rates unless they resort to unconventional policies like quantitative easing which can be politically controversial analysis shows that the global financial safety net the imf and other international institutions and mechanisms designed to respond to financial crises and prevent them from spreading are dangerously inadequate research at the brookings institution shows that we would even struggle to match the level of financial support that was provided during past crises what should be done first governments with basically healthy budgets like australia s should help households and businesses to repair their balance sheets by cutting taxes increasing transfer payments and lifting targeted social payments for households and investment support for businesses australia is slowly moving in this direction second we need to bolster the global financial safety net g20 countries should expand temporary loans to the imf to ensure it has enough money to respond effectively urgently increase cooperation between the imf and its regional counterparts strengthen bilateral supports between countries and commit to long term reform of the imf to increase its permanent funding base and third cooperation is vital cooperation between countries is what stopped the great recession from becoming another great depression recommitting to global forums like the g20 and apec and institutions like the world trade organization will minimise the damage of the next downturn there is no shortage of sparks to ignite the next global downturn but if we act now we can minimise its severity by stopping the fire from spreading and extinguishing it faster

overview the equities are finishing softly after the rally stalled in the middle of the week the large markets in asia fell led by china and the msci asia pacific index fell for a third session the longest losing streak in two months europe s dow jones stoxx 600 ended an eight day advance with a two day loss coming into today where it is a little softer it has been alternating between weekly gains and losses for nine weeks the s p 500 has been consolidating after hitting record highs at midweek it is about 0 75 for the week ahead of today s session that features the first look at q1 us gdp benchmark 10 year yields a little lower today the us 10 year yield backed off from the 2 60 area tested last week and is off about seven basis points this week poor survey data earlier in the week have pushed the german 10 year bund back below zero italian bonds are paring this week s losses a little the yield is still up seven basis points this week s p is expected to leave its sovereign rating unchanged at bbb the price of oil continues to consolidate the gains scored earlier this week ostensibly on response to the us decision not to renew any of the exemptions for iranian oil oil though has extended its advance for an eighth consecutive week the price of oil has only fallen in three weeks so far this year the dollar is little changed against the major currencies where it is sporting a slightly heavier tone while emerging market currencies are mixed the turkish lira is softer but consolidating this week 2 decline it the lira does finish lower it will be the eighth consecutive session it has fallen in 11 of the past 12 weeks it is the argentine peso that led the emerging market currencies to decline this week with a 7 drop before today s local session asia pacific japan is set to begin an extended 10 day holiday the traditional golden week holiday has been extended and japanese markets will be closed the next two weeks to celebrate a new emperor and a new era ahead of the holiday there was little economic cheer industrial output which had been expected to be flat in march fell 0 9 offsetting in full the february gain of 0 7 for the quarter as a while industrial production fell 2 6 which is the worst showing in almost five years this report coupled with the unexpectedly large rise in unemployment 2 5 vs 2 3 in february offset the better than expected retail sales 0 2 vs expectations for a flat report and a doubling of the february increase from 0 2 to 0 4 and strong housing starts 10 in march nearly twice what economists expected as we have suggested before and the data reinforces it the japanese economy appears to have contracted in q1 it would be the second quarterly contraction in the past three quarters many participants recall the flash crash on january 3 when the yen soared for apparently little reason and saw many other currencies sell off sharply the lack of liquidity is commonly cited as the key factor and with the long holiday participants are again looking at the retail positioning in tokyo where the flash crash is thought to have emanated we had expected the run up to the holiday to weigh on the yen and the dollar recorded its highs for the year near jpy112 40 in the middle of the week in the last couple of sessions the yen has drifted higher amid position adjusting retail in tokyo has a significant long yen position but also continues to be attracted to the high yield offered by turkey and south africa japan s prime minister abe and finance minister aso are in washington ostensibly to talk trade it appears japan is willing to make concessions to the us granting it similar access to its agriculture market that it has given in the trade agreements with europe and the tpp it wants to be exempt from any auto tariffs the us may impose while aso has pushed against linking the trade agreement with a new pledge on currency intervention it seems mostly semantics while there is some long hanging fruit the real effort to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance may take longer there are two talking points about china first the pboc skipped its open market operations today it said liquidity was sufficient though a cny20 bln reverse repo matured today the pboc set the reference rate for the yuan dollar exchange rate unchanged from yesterday cny6 7307 some observers see it as a protest against further weakening the dollar reached cny6 75 yesterday its strongest level since february 19 we suspect many are less convinced of the signal and if it really is the pboc s intention it will likely have to show its hand again next week second president xi addressed a belt road conference promising to enact many of the reforms the us appears to be demanding in negotiations this is seen as reinforcing expectations of a deal perhaps as early as next month between the two largest economies on the other hand this is not the first time xi has made such declaratory claims the problem ultimately lies with the operational policy and from another angle it appears that china is moving in the desired direction but slower than the us and europe wish the dollar slipped below jpy111 40 yesterday to record its lowest level since april 11 and is consolidating in narrow ranges today near the 20 day moving average jpy111 70 note that the 200 day moving average is near jpy111 50 the australian dollar briefly traded below 0 7000 yesterday for the first time since early january but recovered late in the session and closed above it it remains above 0 7000 today the australian dollar sometimes leads the other major currencies so its recovery is flashing a near term yellow light to us dollar bulls europe spain goes to the polls this weekend the socialists are expected to be the largest party but whether its possible coalition partners garner enough votes for a center left government may be the crux of the matter a key issue in this election cycle is catalonian independence and how the two main secessionist parties which have softened their rhetoric perform may be critical to the center left being able to forge a majority government meanwhile the new right party vox appears to be siphoning votes from the traditional right popular party many economists and participants worry about italy s debt and bad loan burden while we are cognizant of it we see it as a chronic issue not acute moreover the italian bonds that have been bought under the ecb s qe sit on the bank of italy s books and this has reduced italy s net debt debt it owes other than to itself it has among the most sophisticated debt managers who alas have much experience in this the government coalition illustrates the old adage that politics makes for strange bedfellows and despite a near constant tension it is hanging together league leader salvini who is a junior partner in the coalition seen his fortunes rise he acts as the senior partner and the eu parliament election are likely to validate it s p will review its bbb rating for italy today the rating matches fitch s and is one notch above moody s assessment it warned in october that a material undershoot in growth or a deterioration in its debt ratios could spur a downgrade since then investors have learned that the italian economy contracted in q4 18 and q3 18 italy reports q1 gdp next week economists expect another small contraction slower growth translates into a higher deficit to gdp ratio and impacts the debt to gdp ratio as well without remedial action a downgrade is a palpable possibility but we suspect s p will hold off the euro is little changed as it nurses this week s drop it slipped briefly below 1 1120 its lowest level since may 2017 two large option strike may confine it ahead of the weekend there is a 1 1 bln euro option that will be cut today at 1 11 and another 1 2 bln euros at 1 1160 sterling was sold to almost 1 2865 and closed little change before hovering around in a tight range less than 20 ticks on either side of 1 29 with indications that the withdrawal bill will not re submitted to parliament next week more are coming around to the idea that the uk will have to participate in eu parliament elections next week sees local elections america the first quarter began miserably for the us but steadily the data improved expectations have generally trended up though not as much as the atlanta fed s gdp tracker which began the quarter near 0 3 and its last estimate is for 2 7 bloomberg economists revised up their estimate from 1 5 a week ago to 1 9 now while the survey bloomberg conducts found a median forecast of 2 3 just ahead of q4 18 s 2 2 pace our own back of the envelope calculation puts it around 2 while there may be a knee jerk reaction to the headline number we suspect investors and policymakers are looking past q1 so we do not expect lasting influence that said next week emu s q1 gdp will be reported and the divergence theme which underlies our constructive dollar outlook is likely to be on full display the fomc s statement next week is likely to recognize the subsiding of some of the domestic cross currents while the international headwinds remain a slightly more dovish bank of canada has helped keep the canadian dollar on the defensive it is off about 0 75 this week cad1 35 after a 0 5 loss last week the greenback found support near cad1 3470 there is a cad1 35 option for about 510 mln that expires today on a strong us gdp report we suspect the us dollar can push toward cad1 3520 or so before coming off ahead of the weekend after rising toward our resistance near mxn19 20 yesterday the dollar reversed lower to close a little above mxn19 00 mexico is expected to report a larger march trade surplus it would be the first back to back trade surpluses in a year it also reports its economic activity for february and acceleration from january is expected disclaimer

despite a strong economy the u s budget deficit recently rose by nearly 40 percent year over year largely because of the tax cuts passed in 2017 and the spending deal approved in 2018 federal debt the accumulation of past deficits reached its highest level ever relative to the economy with the exception of a few years around world war ii and that s before financial shortfalls for social security and medicare occur and send debt to unprecedented levels some conservatives warn of a coming debt crisis while leading liberal economists argue that we can ignore deficits and debt at this time several myths are muddling the discussion myth no 1 debt is harmless if it s issued in a nation s own currency in 2015 nobel laureate paul krugman wrote that because debt is money we owe to ourselves it does not directly make the economy poorer and paying it off doesn t make us richer stephanie kelton a prominent advocate of modern monetary theory says that we should think of the government s spending as self financing since it pays its bills by sending new money into the economy in 2011 warren buffett said the united states is not going to have a debt crisis as long as we keep issuing our debts in our own currency advertisement yet in a recent university of chicago survey of prominent economists not one agreed that a country that issues debt in its own currency does not have to worry about deficits future debt will stem largely from anemic revenue growth and increased expenditures on an aging population the result will reduce future national saving the sum of saving by the private and public sectors and drag down future national income this could happen through higher interest rates which choke off investment and reduce production and income or it could happen through greater borrowing from abroad which would allow us to maintain production but siphon off increasing resources to debt payments estimates by the congressional budget office and others indicate that these effects could be substantial politically sustained deficits and rising long term debt make it harder to garner support for new policies or to address the next recession war or emergency myth no 2 low interest rates mean debt doesn t matter in a recent address to the american economic association olivier blanchard a former chief economist at the international monetary fund said the signal sent by low rates is that not only debt may not have a substantial fiscal cost but also that it may have limited welfare costs in foreign affairs jason furman and lawrence h summers wrote that low rates mean policymakers should reconsider the traditional fiscal approach that has often wrong headedly limited worthwhile investments although these preeminent economists have been careful to qualify their statements the popular discussion has sometimes jumped to the conclusion that low interest rates mean that deficits don t matter advertisement low interest rates certainly make debt more palatable and make the crisis scenarios look silly but they are not a panacea under current law the congressional budget office projects that federal debt will rise from about 78 percent of gross domestic product gdp now to more than 150 percent by 2048 and will continue to increase afterward net interest payments are projected to rise from about 1 8 percent of gdp to more than 6 percent which would be larger than the entire social security program financial markets imply that low rates will persist but have been wrong at times in the past we can borrow and consume more if interest rates stay low forever but if we accumulate a lot of debt and then rates rise we will face major problems myth no 3 we should balance the budget and pay off the debt centrist and conservative politicians and pundits constantly seek a balanced federal budget former senator orrin g hatch r utah was called mr balanced budget because he sponsored or cosponsored legislation related to that goal more than 25 times in 2018 columnist george will wrote an op ed for the washington post titled america needs a balanced budget amendment advertisement balanced budgets may have symbolic value but they are not necessary rules aimed at forcing balanced budgets make recessions deeper and longer by requiring spending cuts or tax increases during hard times and they can be manipulated through accounting gimmicks almost every state has a balanced budget rule but many of them face future fiscal shortfalls focused on health care and retirement spending just as the federal government does share this article share an even more extreme goal is to pay off the entire debt in 2016 donald trump said we ve got to get rid of the 19 trillion in debt i think i could do it fairly quickly but paying off all debt makes no sense as alexander hamilton explained debt can be a blessing it can facilitate trade finance national defense fight recessions fund investments and provide liquid and safe assets for investors what we really need to do is put the debt on a stable and sustainable path that will be hard enough myth no 4 we can grow our way out of the debt the trump administration s most recent budget projects average annual growth rates of 2 9 percent over the next decade a reduction of the debt to 71 percent of gdp by 2029 and a balanced budget within 15 years as a result of greater tax revenue advertisement those figures however seem implausible the cbo the federal reserve and the blue chip forecasters all predict annual growth at 2 percent or below after this year largely because of slowing labor force expansion using more realistic projections the administration s budget would actually yield a rising debt to gdp ratio faster economic growth could help lower debt but the cbo estimates that raising productivity growth rates by one third an enormous boost would slow the increase in the debt to gdp ratio over 30 years by only one third in 1981 president ronald reagan s tax cuts and defense spending put the nation on a rising debt path that took numerous bipartisan budget deals over 15 years to reverse but now the debt to gdp ratio is three times as large as it was in 1981 and demographics are working against us baby boomers were entering the labor force and buying homes in the 1980s and 1990s but they are retiring now which will increase spending on social security and medicare without policy changes the budget won t be able to avoid rising deficits and debt myth no 5 there s an easy solution to the debt in his 2012 presidential campaign mitt romney implied that he could tackle the debt in part by ending public television subsidies i like pbs i love big bird but i m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from china to pay for it much of the public has similar sentiments as one voter told lawmakers in 2013 get rid of the deductions that don t affect me advertisement any serious plan to lower the debt must involve significant tax increases and or major spending cuts foreign aid government salaries and other programs that politicians typically target are tiny and eliminating them would not make much difference almost 70 percent of federal spending goes to social security health care defense and interest on the debt spending cuts will have to come from those areas we can t unilaterally cut interest payments that s called defaulting and the other programs are extremely popular a second seemingly painless approach is to inflate away the debt trump once suggested to adviser gary cohn that the nation should just run the presses print money to pay off the debt this of course would lead to inflation but most of our long term obligations already are indexed to inflation such as social security medicare and medicaid payments inflation will not cut those costs the ultimate in pain free solutions is the notion that broad based tax cuts raise revenue not only will this tax plan pay for itself but it will pay down debt treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in 2017 but the record very clearly shows that broad tax cuts such as those passed in 2017 reduce revenue twitter williamgale2
as the 2020 us presidential campaign heats up deficits are once again coming back into the spotlight a growing number of candidates are beginning to flirt with the modern monetary theory mmt which is neither modern nor monetary in a nutshell the mmt argues that budget deficits don t matter a sovereign country can print as much money as it wants to spend until inflation rises at which point it can raise taxes to cool down the economy since the great recession major countries have done this for example via quantitative easing to support a recovery nothing new there however to carry this argument to its extreme saying categorically that deficits don t matter is wrong nevertheless it is music to the ears of politicians both on the right who favor more tax cuts and the left who propose medicare for all and the green new deal to most of us it seems too good to be true and it is deficits don t matter according to the mmt a country with monetary sovereignty thus excluding members of a monetary union such as the euro area can always issue money to spend without fear of default more specifically a government can ask its central bank to print money or more precisely to create central bank liabilities to deposit in the government s account in exchange for government bonds so that the government can spend on worthwhile projects persistent deficit spending will eventually get to full employment of the economy s resources causing inflation to rise at which point the government can raise taxes to reduce money from the private sector to cool things down presumably using such tax revenue to retire government debt in other words a government s spending ability comes from its power to issue money and to compel its citizens to use the money as legal tender while tax is used to control inflation the last point ignores the fact that raising taxes is difficult in modern societies involves a lengthy and messy process and is not wholly suitable to combat inflation the power to issue money has always conferred income i e seignorage to the government mmt proponents now suggest expanding this with the central bank monetizing government debt either directly or by buying government bonds on the secondary markets either way the liabilities of the sovereign sector government and central bank vis à vis other sectors of the economy increase balanced on the asset side of the sovereign balance sheet by the present value of future tax and seignorage revenues the key question is whether such increase in the sovereign deficit and accumulated debt has serious consequences mmt proponents focus on the positive effects of deficit spending while hardly mentioning any negative effects it is important to be clear about the trade off increasing the deficit will stimulate the economy in the near term but its expansionary effect on the economy is rather limited beyond the initial spending burst the fiscal multiplier has generally been low as a result the stimulation this spending causes will quickly peter out leaving higher sovereign debt in its wake accumulating too much debt will lead to heightened expectations that monetary accommodation thus inflation and or taxes will be increased in future sapping confidence and activity of consumers and businesses as well as raising serious inter generational equity problems it is not a free lunch mmt proponents also refer to as supporting evidence japan s decades of low growth low inflation and interest rates despite soaring government deficit and debt as well as similar experiences of the united states since the financial crisis these convenient examples are the result of unique circumstances however and do not reflect the general rule in the case of japan its household sector has traditionally been a big saver and thus a net lender to other sectors of the economy fluctuating largely between 10 percent and 20 percent of gross domestic product gdp a year for decades the non financial corporate nfc sector has also been almost as big a net lender instead of being a net borrower to fund investments like in most other countries together the private non financial sector has posted a huge surplus of domestic savings over investment more than sufficient to lend to the government and fund its deficits in addition the financial surplus has also been lent to the foreign sector via a persistent current account surplus averaging 2 5 percent of gdp the japanese government s deficit spending did complement the low consumption and investment by the private sector but still only produced real growth of little more than 1 percent a year over the past three decades moreover the huge household savings will likely decline in the future as more and more people retire government deficit spending will then run into the constraint of having to attract funding from the foreign sector via a current account deficit putting japan in a similar situation to countries such as the united kingdom in the united states net lending by the household sector jumped sharply after the financial crisis in 2009 to an average of 800 billion annually from an average level of around 200 billion from 1965 to 2008 without such historically large net household lending to the government sector us interest rates would probably have been higher in addition relying on the reserve currency status of the us dollar to attract foreign buying of us sovereign debt is not prudent foreign official investors have been a net seller of us treasuries since 2015 while net buying by foreign private investors have been declining from an annual pace of 550 billion in 2011 to 150 billion at present the conundrum of low inflation and natural unemployment rates the argument that increases in deficits and money central bank reserves do not raise inflation also needs to be put into context in the united states the federal reserve s quantitative easing operations increased the monetary base notes and coins plus reserves deposits at the fed significantly from 800 billion in 2008 to a peak of 4 165 billion in late 2015 before declining to 3 363 billion at the end of march 2019 after the fed decided to shrink its balance sheet however the ratio of the monetary aggregate m1 currency in circulation plus demand deposits at banks to the monetary base showing how much central bank money has been transformed into spending power declined from 1 74 in 2008 to a low of 0 74 in late 2015 before recovering to 1 10 in march 2019 in other words the fed can boost its liabilities and thus the monetary base but that does not mean that consumption and investment will automatically increase households and companies can decide not to borrow and spend causing the commercial banks to maintain huge excess reserves at the fed as a consequence domestic demand has not been strong enough to push inflation up this is a special situation where the private sector needs to save to repair its balance sheets after a severe financial crisis and not at all a general rule as mmt proponents try to make out speaking more broadly persistently low inflation and apparent declines in the natural unemployment rate or non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment may reflect the combined effects of globalization and technological changes probably leading to a greater supply of goods relative to their effective demand propagating low manufacturing cost conditions in emerging markets and weakening upward pressures on prices and wages due to the spread of online economic activity including contingent self employment since those structural effects are still poorly understood and it is uncertain how low nairu has fallen from previous estimates of around 4 percent with the current unemployment rate at 3 8 percent it pays to be prudent as wages have begun to rise in many emerging markets and trade tensions persist cost push inflationary pressure will likely build and change the consequences of printing too much money more importantly mmt proponents seem to ignore the lessons of the great financial crisis the authorities had been singing the praise of the great moderation of decent growth low interest rates and low inflation despite easy monetary conditions until built up financial excesses and imbalances caused the crisis to erupt in 2008 09 this could happen again mind the tradeoffs deficit spending can support the economy when it is below full employment levels even if the unemployment rate is low when inflation remains subdued but mmt proponents have quickly generalized this to a belief that deficit spending is good regardless of the specific circumstances while glossing over any negative consequences more importantly they fail to clarify the tradeoffs between near term stimulation and longer term deterioration of the sovereign financial position and its consequences as important and necessary public debates about reforming and re prioritizing the us budget whose deficit is estimated to exceed 1 trillion per year as far as the eye can see begin in anticipation of the us presidential election campaign these tradeoffs and clarifications need to be raised hung tran is a

buenos aires argentina tomás ruiz embraced his father one last time at the buenos aires airport before he boarded a plane in search of a new life in ireland his sister recently did the same when she moved to spain like many other young argentines the siblings hold european passports by descent and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents far from argentina s sizzling inflation high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation my country s situation prompted me to take this decision ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall it was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge barely making it to the end of the month ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in argentina s capital but even when he worked extra shifts he couldn t manage to save money and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent outside his room family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard i love you and i ll miss you his mother wrote others said the best is yet to come and carpe diem latin for seize the day it s not the first time argentines have sought shelter in europe in times of economic uncertainty hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002 now argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50 annual inflation rate one of the world s worst many have also protests president mauricio macri s decision to cut subsidies leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation last year the argentine peso lost more than half its value to the u s dollar following a run on the local currency causing the government to seek a record 56 billion bailout loan with the international monetary fund to try to come out of the recession as a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation more young professionals are thinking about a future in europe said alejandro servide director of professionals and recruitment process outsourcing at argentina s branch of randstad the world s second largest staffing company as part of the austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget macri s administration has laid off thousands of government workers and slashed funding for dance science and other programs hundreds recently protested outside the headquarters of the national scientific and technical research council argentina s main agency for science and technology the science sector is suffering because these budget cuts ordered by macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity said alberto kornblihtt a molecular biologist this is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that we ve suffered at other times of crisis in our country there are no official statistics available on how many argentines have moved to europe argentina s immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because argentines leaving the country don t have to provide information on their destination or how long they ll stay but academics research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving especially among young educated argentines just as there was during the nation s worst crisis 17 years ago back then millions were plunged into poverty more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one world s biggest producers of beef soy and wheat when argentina goes through these profound crises people search for options and just like it happened in 2001 2002 when nearly 800 000 argentines went abroad today we re living through perhaps the initial phase said ariel gonzalez executive secretary of the center for international studies at the catholic university of argentina that means that there s a sector of society the middle and high class professionals who are eyeing a plan b which is that if the crisis deepens one of the options would be to go abroad servide said randstad argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for surveys one of the questions they ask is whether if given the chance they would be interested in living abroad about 80 percent tell you yes he said manuel miglioranza a 26 year old lawyer is moving next month to toulouse france although he doesn t have dual argentine french nationality he s going to take french lessons and find a job through a temporary work permit allowed through a treaty between the two nations the economic situation in argentina is not helping you can t progress unless you work for the state or you have dollars he said i know many people who are leaving millions of europeans flooded into argentina in the 19th century to escape war and poverty back home which has been a source of pride for the country argentina gave peace to those who were escaping war freedom to those escaping religious persecution and bread and work to those escaping hunger said horacio garcia director of argentina s national migration directorate of the last six presidents four of them were first generation sons of immigrants garcia noted their fathers came to argentina with a cardboard suitcase and they saw that their children in a short amount of time became presidents of the nation that hardly happens anywhere else in the world by the 20th century a strong workforce along with export earnings from agricultural products and beef had helped turn argentina into one of the wealthiest countries in the world argentines were also among the most europeanized and educated people in latin america gabriela nouzeilles and graciela montaldo write in their anthology the argentina reader history culture and politics their literacy rate about 90 percent was the highest by far until 1945 the country boasted the highest per capita income on the continent the most extensive urbanization the largest middle class as well as the best newspapers universities and publishing houses but political mismanagement and lower prices for agricultural products that form the country s economic backbone have for decades led to cyclical booms and busts the spanish government recently launched an initiative that allows a limited number of descendants of spaniards living in argentina without a spanish passport to seek a special three month work visa once they find a job they can request spanish nationality and bring their families there were 76 328 argentines officially registered by mid 2018 in spain there are many many argentines living here we re like pigeons everywhere quipped paz pucheu an argentine now living in spain the 25 year old radio and television announcer went to

despite the best wishes of gold promoters contrarians and fundamental analysts the u s dollar is still king around the world in fact thanks to a decade of zero bound interest rates in dollars the synthetic demand for them is higher now than it s been in years what do i mean by synthetic demand it s simple really there are trillions of dollars in debt on the balance sheets of emerging market corporations that are denominated in dollars they were built up because borrowing in dollars was cheaper than the local currency those debts have to be repaid in dollars while the companies earn their revenues for the most part in their local currencies if the currency weakens versus the dollar the effective value of that debt in local currency terms rises quickly and that dollar demand is what hangs over the markets today which despite terrible u s economic fundamentals kept the dollar buoyant during the janet yellen led fed years the problem is so widespread that yellen delayed raising interest rates for more than a year to keep from blowing up banks and the world economy of course without raising rates the fed doesn t change the incentive structure to stop people borrowing in dollars when yellen finally did begin raising rates she quit knowing full well that her replacement would have to deal with the fallout and the fallout is here current fed chair jerome powell balked on normalizing rates and signaled the end of quantitative tightening though not much in the way of evidence exists yet per the fed s weekly balance sheet report for months the u s dollar index has been butting up against the 97 area chart below while the index has been capped at around 97 each pullback has been shallower and shallower black arrows until this week this week s breakout on the u s dollar index is very significant it s a formation that s been forming for months and has now moved into the next phase and it stems not from any fundamental strength of the u s economy though as terrible as it is it is still far better than europe but rather the aforementioned synthetic demand look around you not only are important emerging market currencies in trouble like the turkish lira as i talked about a few weeks ago but also major ones like the euro and the british pound as i said then what we ve seen is a massive flight into the dollar despite the fed rolling over last week the u s dollar index is threatening a big breakout above 98 the only thing keeping it in check is the daily head fakes coming out of brexit negotiations which keep both the pound and the euro range bound the problem now is that both the pound and euro have broken down out of their ranges and are threatening free fall the euro broke support at 1 12 and looks for all the world that it is headed to the 2017 low of 1 034 the pound is fairing a bit better trading just below 1 29 with the february low of 1 277 still in play a weekly close below that and 1 198 comes into play this wasn t supposed to happen with the european union winning the battle of brexit by keeping the u k locked into its death spiral like a peregrine falcon hanging onto a wolverine and getting torn to shreds so while we ve been focused on the turkish lira it is the euro and pound that are the worrying ones as europe now seems to be losing the real war the one for investor confidence and as i pointed out in my previous article major european banks are heavily exposed to turkish corporate debt they did this why incredibly low interest rates set by both the ecb and the fed having them scrounge around the world dumpster diving looking for yield to replace their now destroyed lending businesses it s clear now with gold under continued pressure despite record central bank buying including those wily russians picking nickels up off the ground to the tune of another 37 3 tonnes in february and march there is a real scramble for dollars happening around the world it s a tug of war between the need for dollars to keep collateral chains from breaking and safe haven buying on increasing distrust of government leaders having any clue as to what to do to stop them but this problem goes beyond the gold

indian consumers face post election fuel price shock economy could be hit by manoj kumar and nidhi verma new delhi april 26 reuters surging global oil prices will pose a first big challenge to india s new government whoever wins an election now under way especially as domestic prices have been allowed to lag meaning consumers are in for a painful surge as they catch up for oil import dependent india higher global prices could lead to a weaker rupee higher inflation the ruling out of interest rate cuts and could further weigh on twin current account and budget deficits economists warned but compounding the future pain state run fuel suppliers and retailers have held off passing on to consumers the higher prices during a staggered general election which began on april 11 and ends on may 23 according to sources familiar with the situation that delay is expected to be unwound once the election is over and there could be additional price increases to make up for losses or profits missed during the period of delayed increases the sources said in some major asian countries such as japan and south korea pump prices are adjusted periodically so they move largely in tandem with international crude prices that was what was supposed to happen in india but the election means there have been many days when pump prices have been unchanged in new delhi for example while crude oil prices have gone up by nearly 9 a barrel or about 12 percent in the past six weeks gasoline prices have only risen by 0 47 rupees a litre or 0 6 percent state controlled fuel suppliers and retailers declined to say why they had delayed price increases or discuss whether there has been any pressure from the government of prime minister narendra modi a government spokesman declined to comment the opposition congress party said modi s government was violating its own policy of daily price revision by advising the state oil companies to hold prices steady the government should cut fuel taxes otherwise consumers will have to pay much higher oil prices once the elections are over said akhilesh pratap singh a senior leader of the congress party nitin goyal treasurer at the all india petroleum dealers association representing fuel stations in 25 states said prices were similarly held down for 19 days in the southern state of karnataka last year when it held state assembly elections only for them to surge after the vote consumers should be ready for a rude shock of a massive jump in retail prices similar to the level we have seen in the karnataka state election goyal said credit negative sri paravaikkarasu director for asia oil at singapore based consultancy fge said retail prices of gasoline and gasoil prices would have been up to 6 percent or about 4 rupee higher if they had been allowed to rise in line with global prices indian pump prices have failed to keep up with the recent uptrend in crude prices paravaikkarasu said with the country s general elections underway the incumbent government has been keeping pump prices relatively unchanged india had switched to a daily price revision in june 2017 from a revision every two weeks as the government allowed retailers to set prices but the government faced protests last october when retailers raised prices by up to 10 rupees a litre after the crude oil price went above 80 a barrel forcing it to cut fuel taxes global prices rose to their highest level in 2019 on thursday days after the united states announced all iran sanction waivers would end by may pressuring importers including india to stop buying tehran s oil higher oil prices will mean asia s third largest economy is likely to see growth of less than 7 percent rate this fiscal year economists said growth slowed to 6 6 percent in the october december quarter the slowest in five quarters rating agency care has warned that a 10 percent rise in global oil prices could increase demand for dollars putting pressure on the rupee and widening the current account deficit india s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending march 31 to 140 5 billion against 108 billion the previous year the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy icra the indian arm of the fitch rating agency said in a note every 10 bbl increase in crude oil prices increases the fiscal deficit by about 0 1 percent of gdp any big price rise would also build a case for the central bank to keep rates steady or even raise them the reserve bank of india s monetary policy committee which cut the benchmark policy repo rate by 25 basis points this month warned that rising oil and food prices could push up inflation policymakers are worried that a sustained increase in the oil

the us europe and most of the developed world on are the road to japanification like i wrote last week we will see financial repression ever increasing deficits slower growth etc essentially the rest of us will begin to look like japan with its astronomical deficits and ultra dovish monetary policy i tried to emphasize this is not the end of the world it s not the best world either but we ve gone too far to come back now there is no significant constituency for any of the things it would take for the us government to balance its budget neither party wants to reduce the deficit and the mmt fans want to make it even bigger that means the rules of investing we have come to know over the last 50 years are likely as in very very likely to change but we should generally do fine as long as we change our own investment strategies accordingly ben hunt over at epsilon theory recently riffed on stanley kubrick s 1964 masterpiece dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb he did a great parody with it called modern monetary theory how i learned to stop worrying and love the national debt source wikimedia could we actually see modern monetary theory in the us lacy hunt in his latest quarterly explains how it is theoretically possible for the treasury department to issue zero maturity zero interest bonds to the fed which would then deposit dollars into the treasury bank account this would at a minimum create inflation and possibly hyperinflation to say it would be destructive is like comparing an ocean breeze to a category five hurricane it would in fact be a financial disaster of biblical proportions i don t believe it will happen that way though we will instead run up debt the old fashioned way japanification and massive amounts of quantitative easing let s look at how that might play out the financial times has a very helpful graph using congressional budget office data showing the deficit as a percentage of gdp both in the past and forecast for the next 10 years you can see the underlying cbo report here when you realize that the gdp is well over 20 trillion now and the cbo projects the gdp to grow this chart visually understates the reality of growing deficits let s look at another helpful chart which actually shows the dollar amount of the projected deficits source cbo basically the projection is an average annual deficit of 1 2 trillion per year for the next 10 years but there are a few caveats first let s assume away the real world to give the cbo their due they only assume 2 3 gdp growth very mild unemployment growth and roughly 2 inflation but here s the kicker well actually there s two they assume no recession and they make no allowance for the roughly 400 billion per year in off budget expenditures that i described last week the off budget expenditures mean that even without a recession the debt will rise 1 6 trillion per year for the next decade that means the national debt will be 40 trillion by 2029 if as i expect there is a recession we will reach that 40 trillion number sooner sometime in 2026 through 2028 the deficit in a recession will be a minimum of 2 trillion per year and maybe much higher than those suggested above there will be some token movement to reduce spending but it won t make much difference because mandatory spending a euphemism for medicare social security and other entitlement programs plus interest on the debt plus defense spending overwhelms so called discretionary spending here s the cbo chart again in terms of gdp because the absolute numbers would scare you source cbo even if we could cut some discretionary spending the deficits would still be huge as there is no constituency for cutting entitlement programs we will talk about why growth will actually slow under such a scenario in a later letter today s question is where will we get the money to pay for this spending answer the treasury department will sell bonds and run up the debt that s a given then there will be a recession as there always is and then the federal reserve will take interest rates down to the zero boundary otherwise known as financial repression and the devastation of savers followed by unprecedented amounts of quantitative easing just like japan has done like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy

and if i seriously expected it i would be preparing to ride out a hyperinflation scenario but i do not think that will happen is it possible sure the most dangerous thing for investors is to not imagine what could go wrong with their basic thesis hat tip ben hunt right now my base case is for a more or less deflationary world we will explore that and some alternatives at the conference this year which is sold out but you can still get a virtual pass here now let s think how we got here the response to the last crisis setup the next one a lot happened in 2007 2009 during which we endured a recession that left little chance for reflection now we have that chance those in authority back then faced enormous pressure to do something letting nature take its course may well have been the best strategy but it couldn t happen that way in our political system they had to act sidebar historical note there was a crash depression in 1920 1921 you never read about it president warren harding simply did nothing and let prices and markets clear it was all over by mid 1921 and we got the roaring 20s no fed or government intervention except the fed did raise interest rates to 7 after inflation world war i so they get a share of the blame and there was the gold standard so no qe was available back to our world in 2008 2009 we got things like tarp the troubled asset relief program that used 431 billion of your money to buy loans that banks no longer wanted on their books the government eventually sold most of them as well as equity warrants received from participating banks so the net cost came out much lower but that wasn t a sure thing what we now forget is that tarp helped banks that weren t even banks before that point goldman sachs morgan stanley and numerous other broker dealers and insurers hurriedly got bank charters specifically so they could be part of tarp the government welcomed it too that s the kind of unpredictable change i described last week but these fiscal and regulatory surprises pale in comparison to the federal reserve s unprecedented monetary actions rate cuts were only part of it and not the most important but they were huge in august 2007 they cut fed funds a quarter point from 5 25 where it had stayed for some time a year later it was down to 2 and soon was effectively zero compare that to the current cycle which spent four years raising the rate from that effectively zero level to the present 2 5 chart st louis fed the fed is perfectly capable of moving rates far more aggressively than we have seen recently and in either direction but the bigger and even more aggressive policy move was in asset purchases which included but weren t limited to quantitative easing when the crisis hit the fed by law could only buy certain kinds of assets treasury securities bank debt federally backed mortgage securities and the like they didn t change the rules but instead stretched them far beyond what anyone envisioned could ever happen chart st louis fed that hockey stick jump in the fed s balance sheet assets wasn t on anyone s radar but it happened the fed then added several more rounds before finally topping out and recently beginning to exit was any of this the end of the world no the markets absorbed it all and even performed well in fact markets performed well because they absorbed all this craziness in that lies the seed of our next cycle recently i sent over my shoulder members a swiss newspaper interview with my friend william white bill is former chief economist with the bank for international settlements and my favorite central banker he speaks with unusual candor he ll be at the sic by the way and you can hear him by getting a virtual pass in discussing the current move to loosen policy the reporter asked how did we end up in the debt trap bill s answer we were encouraged to do this just think what we have been doing since 2007 monetary easing is an invitation to take on more private sector debt and fiscal expansion is by definition an increase of government debt both instruments carry the risk of higher debt levels that eventually will kill you like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha in the great recession we had both fiscal easing tarp expanded safety net programs etc and monetary easing lower rates asset purchases qe the result exactly as bill said was sharply more government debt and private sector debt that may seem counterintuitive since recessions supposedly bring deleveraging that happened but not uniformly some deleveraged while others added more and the latter group was much larger and the fed s vast liquidity injections enabled it bill went on to explain that debt problems are about solvency but central banks provide liquidity a fractional reserve banking system has a lender of last resort in order to avoid collapse in a bank run bailing out borrowers who can t repay is not its mission or its talent nonetheless under pressure to act the fed and its peers did what they could throw money in all directions hoping some of it would stick some of it did too the new liquidity found its way into assets whose prices then rose enabling more borrowing driving asset prices higher again and here we are according to the institute for international finance global debt was 244 trillion as of q3 2018 more than half of it was financial and non financial corporate debt about 27 65 trillion was government debt not counting unfunded liabilities which are huge source bloomberg household debt was the small category and hasn t grown that much in the us here s a closer look via the new york fed s quarterly survey you can see in the chart how us households retrenched in the recession then began slowly adding more debt in 2013 and after mortgage debt is still slightly below its pre crisis peak corporations did not limit themselves like families did here s nonfinancial corporate debt growth for that same period 2003 2018 source st louis fed the recession shaded area had almost no effect on corporate debt growth which continued merrily higher note that this is only securitized debt much more exists on private books you could argue that the added debt is not so dramatic as a percentage of gdp which also grew in this period that s true but it s also riskier debt the proportion of bonds at junk or near junk status has grown significantly i ve quoted several times now my friend peter boockvar s statement we no longer have business cycles we have credit cycles his point falling asset prices won t be a result of the next recession they will cause the next recession and asset prices will fall when the free flowing credit that pushed them so high recedes which it is doing right now thanks to the fed s two factor experiment of simultaneously hiking interest rates and reversing qe peter will speak at the sic too by the way get your virtual pass the fed is now at least pausing that experiment and appears set to reverse it later this year i fear they are acting too late the latest corporate earnings news and lots of other data suggests the cyclical weakening has begun the next marker will be some high profile debt defaults probably among lower rated issuers i don t know who wework tesla name your favorite but somebody is going to run out of cash and find themselves unable to refinance for the 97th time and then the real fun will begin years ago i started calling japan a bug in search of a windshield i was certain their economy would go splat as they ran huge government deficits cratered their own currency and had the bank of japan buy every financial asset that wasn t nailed down well the japanese have enthusiastically implemented all those policies i m not going to say it worked but the bug hasn t yet hit the windshield other governments and central banks have noticed too here s what they observe japan has spent decades with zero or negative rates engaged in massive qe and boondoggle spending gone in and out of recession and somehow stayed on its feet an economic boom it is not but the country avoided the worst nightmares that s a win in the way central bankers think meanwhile mario draghi s european central bank tried a similar strategy to the extent it could given that the eurozone lacks a unified fiscal authority it seemed to be working well enough that the ecb decided last year to end some of the extraordinary measures but simply talking about it appears to have put the eurozone economy into a mild flu so now they are back on a japan like course italy alone has so much debt it could easily become another greece but far larger and more difficult for the rest of europe to rescue italy is already in recession albeit a mild one so far but its debt load is still rising at some point it becomes a systemic risk to the eurozone and eu like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha and the us as i ve said the fed waited too long to start exiting from crisis era measures they gave the economy time to go from dependence on easy money to outright addiction and as we all know addictions are very very hard to break so now the fed has cold feet too further tightening appears unlikely they will try to cut rates as the weakness grows more obvious but it won t help and they will start digging through the toolbox for something else to try whatever they do will probably surprise and alarm us it will not have the desired effects at least not as fast as they want but it also won t kill us if we prepare for it the dominoes are starting to drop as expected to review the entire world is up to its ears in debt thanks to a decade of central bank action we are late in a growth cycle that is going to end possibly soon whenever it does us government borrowing needs will skyrocket higher from already astronomical levels the federal reserve will end up monetizing this new debt working off that debt will take years possibly decades hence the long slow japanization i ve described i don t think we will endure it for 30 years like japan has we will instead force a worldwide default which i ve dubbed the great reset beyond that lie better times but we ll go through hell first next week i fly up to washington dc to record a video with my good friend neil howe i m sure i will find a few other friends to meet with before i turn around and come back to puerto rico towards the middle of may i will head to dallas for the strategic investment conference almost every day i have a session with some of the conference speakers and panelists coordinating what they will say and making sure that we stay on theme i am really pumped and almost can t wait while the conference is sold out a few spots may open up on the waiting list if you want to be there if not the virtual pass is the next best thing on wednesday i met with a group of very sharp investment advisors hosted by brian lockhart of peak capital management we talked portfolio construction and strategy the conversation reminded me that i need to do a letter or two on that topic plus a new indexing methodology that i suspect is going to take the world by storm there are so many things happening in the investment world as opposed to the macroeconomic world that really should be explored finally i had dinner with lyric hughes hale and some of our friends she invited a young man in from silicon valley who literally watches over 5 000 ethereum developers working to use that blockchain technology to change the world i am a big intellectual fan of ethereum lyric who is writing a book on china and one of the smartest economists i know made the boldest prediction of the night she thinks trump will outlast xi jinping in office she regaled us with stories of what s happening on the ground in china and if true there really is trouble in river city it made for a fun evening have yourself a good day and get together with some friends shane and i get to go meet some neighbors this evening here in dorado who have as their guest liz ann sonders chief investment strategist for schwab who will kick off my conference on

the second quarter dividend of 0 27 per share payable on june 3 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on may 22 2019 outlook commenting on the company s results chairman and chief executive officer daniel p amos stated i am pleased with the company s overall performance our strong first quarter results advanced our progress toward achieving the company s annual objectives aflac japan our largest earnings contributor generated strong financial results that were in line with our expectations for the quarter we continue to anticipate a slight decline in aflac japan s total earned premium in 2019 mainly due to limited pay policies reaching paid up status we also continue to anticipate full year sales of third sector and first sector protection products to decline in the low to mid single digits coming off the highest third sector sales year in recent history with the very successful launch of a new cancer product in the second quarter of 2018 turning to our u s operations we are pleased with the financial performance of aflac u s in the quarter which is particularly significant because these results also reflect ongoing investment in our platform distribution and customer experience our sales results were in line with our expectations for the quarter we continue to expect aflac u s to deliver solid results in 2019 with earned premium growth of 2 to 3 and stable sales growth we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders and balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares the dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows we continue to anticipate that we ll repurchase in the range of 1 3 to 1 7 billion of our shares in 2019 with the range allowing us to be more tactical in our deployment strategy as we demonstrated this quarter as is always the case this assumes stable capital conditions and the absence of compelling alternatives at the same time we recognize that prudent investment in our platform is critical to our growth strategy and driving efficiencies that will impact the bottom line for the long term i want to reiterate our 2019 earnings guidance our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year benefiting from timing of expenses and a modestly favorable effective tax rate in the period which puts us on track to produce stable adjusted earnings per diluted share of 4 10 to 4 30 assuming the 2018 weighted average exchange rate of 110 39 yen to the dollar as

financial measures this earnings release includes references to aflac s non u s gaap financial measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted return on equity amortized hedge costs income and adjusted book value these measures are not calculated in accordance with u s gaap the measures exclude items that the company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations management uses adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of aflac s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of aflac s insurance business the company believes that amortized hedge costs income which are a component of adjusted earnings measure the periodic currency risk management costs income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income the company considers adjusted book value important as it excludes accumulated other comprehensive income aoci which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management s control definitions of the company s non u s gaap financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable u s gaap measures are provided below and in the following schedules due to the size of aflac japan where the functional currency is the japanese yen fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results in periods when the yen weakens translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported when the yen strengthens translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported consequently yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for u s gaap reporting purposes which results in foreign currency impact to earnings cash flows and book value on a u s gaap basis because foreign exchange rates are outside of management s control aflac believes it is important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into u s dollars adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted return on equity all excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using

by lance roberts the s p 500 and nasdaq composite had their highest closings on record tuesday regaining ground lost in last year s rout stocks have flourished under a more accommodative federal reserve in january the central bank said it would hold interest rates steady setting in motion the stock market s strongest first quarter run in more than two decades as investors dialed back up their appetite for riskier assets like stocks on tuesday the stock market hit all time highs such should not be surprising given the rally particularly in the very heavily weighted technology sector xlk and something i penned several weeks ago for our ria pro subscribers get a 30 day free trial currently xlk is on a buy signal bottom panel but that signal is crazy extended however the good news is that four sectors have broken out to all time highs and technology is one of them this is suggesting the overall market will break out to new highs as well of course the rise in the market since the december lows has quickly replaced the panic felt then with an unbridled optimism currently as i showed this past weekend in f o m o the fear of missing out and in our ria pro weekly technical market gauge the bulls are back it isn t just our technical gauge which suggests investors have returned to their bullish ways the ria pro asset allocation composite suggests the same as well as numerous other data points showing investors jumping back into equities with both feet as markets approach all time highs a recent survey from ally invest showed much the same the bullish sentiment by investors which doubled between q1 and q2 of this year appears in part supported by the majority of respondents belief that interest rates will remain unchanged this year 67 and the government will sign economic trade agreements that will help drive the markets higher 61 other major market drivers cited by respondents include positive year over year earnings 26 low unemployment rate 24 lack of inflation 18 and tax reform 15 e trade also recently released survey data showing bullish sentiment returns bullishness rose 12 percentage points since last quarter to once again represent the majority of investors at 58 percent bullishness rose 12 percentage points since last quarter to once again represent the majority of investors at 58 percent investors believe there s more room for the bull market to run two thirds of investors say they think the bull market has a year or more to go 66 up seven percentage points from last quarter two thirds of investors say they think the bull market has a year or more to go 66 up seven percentage points from last quarter the majority gave the us economy a passing grade investors who gave the economy an a or b grade rose 9 percentage points this quarter to 64 investors who gave the economy an a or b grade rose 9 percentage points this quarter to 64 volatility concerns remain investors who believe volatility will stay the same was up by 8 percentage points from q1 you get the idea just 8 weeks after panic selling lows investors are once again back in the pool willful blindness willful blindness also known as willful ignorance or contrived ignorance is a term used in law to describe a situation in which a person seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by keeping themselves unaware of the facts that would render them liable or implicated although the term was originally used in legal contexts the phrase willful blindness has come to mean any situation in which people intentionally turn their attention away from the facts to avoid the liability of their actions in the financial markets this is most prevalent investors regularly dismiss the facts which run contrary to their current opinion as markets are rising they take on excessive risk with the full knowledge that such actions will have a negative consequence when that negative consequence eventually occurs they blame the media wall street their advisor and anyone else they can find for their losses this currently where we are in the markets today investors know there is a rising risk of loss but they are willfully ignoring the facts and and piling into risk because the narrative has simply become fundamentals don t matter the federal reserve has got your back after all cnbc said so this is a dangerous assumption given that buoying stock prices are not part of the federal reserve s mandate congress set dual goals of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment the central bank s preferred inflation gauge registered at 1 8 in january just below its 2 target and the unemployment rate in march was 3 8 below the 4 3 the fed estimates is sustainable further wage pressures are rising which will put pressure on the federal reserve to raise rates however as i penned previously investors currently are under the impression the federal reserve will not hike rates further and more importantly will quickly initiate qe if the market begins to weaken this is likely a misplaced belief cleveland fed president loretta mester could we be done with policy rate increases this cycle it is possible but if the economy performs along the lines i think is the most likely case the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels philadelphia fed president patrick harker i continue to be in wait and see mode with expectations of at most one hike for 2019 and one for 2020 those comments don t align with a fed eager to sit on the sidelines reduce rates or begin to inject further stimulus furthermore fed officials think the economy is in a good place with low unemployment and benign inflation if they sense a slowdown fed officials would first act by trimming their benchmark interest rate we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us then there is the question of its effectiveness anyway what investors should realize is that markets will be in a deep bear market and recession before qe would be restarted however that appears to be a point lost on market participants currently furthermore investors have become willfully blind to a few salient points the fed isn t hiking rates but they aren t reducing them either the fed isn t reducing their balance sheet any more after september but they aren t increasing it either economic growth outside of china remains weak employment growth is slowing there is no massive disaster currently to spur a surge in government spending and reconstruction there isn t another stimulus package like tax cuts to fuel a boost in corporate earnings with the deficit already pushing 1 trillion there will only be an incremental boost from additional deficit spending this year unfortunately it is also just a function of time until a recession occurs of course the fed isn t the only thing behind the market s recovery about those soaring profits as noted by the wsj recently noted u s corporate profits have surged which have been the support for surging asset prices the important thing about looking at corporate profits rather than earnings is that this is what is reported to the internal revenue service for taxation purposes it also strips out all of the accounting gimmickry found in operating earnings excessive share buybacks and other obscuring factors while stock prices have surged to all time highs corporate profits remain at the same level as they were in 2011 on a pre tax basis and 2014 on a post tax basis while the wsj is correct that corporate profits now 10 of gdp up from 6 8 prior to the turn of the century there are two factors worth noting corporate profits are very diverged from economic growth which is contributing to the wealth inequality issue the profit gdp ratio is still lower than it was in 2010 2011 despite the massive boost from tax cuts 1 trillion in deficit spending and a booming stock market looking at this a little differently we can better understand what is occurring in the 60 70 s leading up to the black bear market of 1974 corporate profits were growing faster than gdp this is ultimately an unsustainable trend as profits are a function of economic growth and not the reverse the 80 90 s bull market was a period of economic growth outstripping profit growth as interest rates and inflation fell beginning at the turn of the century and now three asset bubbles later profits are again growing faster than the economy the same can be seen in the cumulative change in asset prices versus profits when price inflation exceeds profit growth that deviation has not historically lasted very long economic hopes to be disappointed but the global slowdown is temporary the expectation of an economic recovery to support the continuation of the bull market is likely misplaced for several reasons the fed rate hikes that were done in 2018 are still working their way through the economy higher rates are impacting economically sensitive sectors like autos housing and manufacturing economic growth globally remains weak and is impacting growth in the u s interest rates and the yield curve despite stocks hitting all time highs are suggesting that economic weakness is likely more pervasive than currently believed the rising trend of the u s dollar will impact exports which makes up between 40 50 corporate profits imports continue to suggest the u s consumer 70 of the economy is weaker than headlines suggest rising oil prices and gasoline prices are a tax on consumers and will further impair economic growth deflation is a rising concern there is no massive slate of natural disasters to pull forward consumption or boost manufacturing construction or commodity demand while deficit spending is certainly supportive of growth with the deficit already at 1 2 trillion the rate of change in deficit spending will not be supportive of stronger economic growth the ria economic composite index a broad composite of hard soft and leading indicators and surveys has turned lower historically turns from high levels dashed black line tend to revert to the lower bound suggesting more economic weakness is likely in the quarters ahead that reversion would also align with the recent cfo survey which generated responses from more than 1 500 chief financial officers including 469 from north america and showed 67 of those surveyed predicted the u s economy would be in recession by the third quarter of 2020 84 believe a recession will have begun by the first quarter of 2021 38 of respondents predicted a recession by the first quarter of next year while cfos are not as pessimistic as they were three months ago it is unusual in the history of the survey for such a large share of respondents to predict a recession just 16 months from now the problem of eternal bullishness with the current economic cycle already long by historical standards economic data continuing to remain weak and profit margins on the decline there is an increasing possibility that risk may well outweigh reward at this juncture such doesn t mean that stocks can t go higher in the near term and despite some wiggles along the way it is quite likely they will simply because of momentum and lot s of bullish bias however the problem of eternal bullishness is that it leads to the willful blindness of risks rather than having a healthy respect for and recognition of those risks this leads to the unfortunate problem of being all in on every hand which has a devastating consequence when a mean reverting event occurs john hussman once penned an excellent piece on the full market cycle regardless of very short term market direction it is urgent for investors to understand where the equity markets are positioned in the context of the full market cycle while the most extreme overvalued overbought overbullish rising yield syndrome we define has generally appeared only at the most wicked market peaks in history and investors have ignored those conditions over the past year we can t be certain when the deferred consequences will emerge but a century of market history provides strong reason to believe that any intervening gains will be wiped out in spades it s instructive that the 2000 2002 decline wiped out the entire total return of the s p 500 in excess of treasury bills all the way back to may 1996 while the 2007 2009 decline wiped out the entire excess return of the s p 500 all the way back to june 1995 overconfidence and overvaluation always extract a terrible payback in the end it does not matter if you are bullish or bearish the reality is that both bulls and bears are owned by the broken clock syndrome during the full market cycle however what is grossly important in achieving long term investment success is not necessarily being right during the first half of the cycle but by not being wrong during the second half
reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 dollar juggernaut the dollar has zipped to near two year highs leaving many scratching their heads to many it s down to signs the u s economy is chugging ahead while the rest of the world loses steam after all wall street is busily scaling new peaks day after day never mind the cause the effect is stark the euro has tumbled to 22 month lows against the dollar and investors are preparing for more buying options to shield against further downside emerging market currencies are also in pain with turkish lira and argentine peso both sharply weaker now u s data need to keep surprising on the upside or even just meet expectations the international monetary fund sees u s growth at 2 3 percent this year for germany the forecast is 0 8 percent the u s economy s rude health has given rise to speculation the fed might resume raising interest rates unlikely but as other countries canada sweden and australia are the latest hint at more policy easing there seems to be one way the dollar can go up graphic dollar outperforms g10 fx 2 fed up or down wall street is near record highs and recession worries are receding so as we mentioned above investors might wonder if the federal reserve will start raising rates again such a pivot is unlikely after the fed killed off rate rise expectations at its march meeting and the latest reuters poll all but puts to bed any risk of rates will go up this economic cycle given inflation remains below the fed s alarm threshold and unemployment is the lowest in generations before the march rate pause announcement a preponderance of economists penciled in one or more increases this year but that has flipped a majority of those surveyed april 22 24 see no further tightening through december and more are leaning toward a cut by the end of next year indeed interest rate futures imply fed funds will be below the current 2 25 2 50 percent target range by this december recent positive consumer spending and exports data have eased market concerns of a sharp economic slowdown but inflation probably needs to run hot for a long period to panic policymakers off their wait and see course graphic federal funds and the economy 3 heisei to reiwa next week ends three decades of japan s heisei era heisei or achieving peace began in 1989 near the peak of a massive stock market bubble and closes with the country trapped in low growth no inflation and negative interest rates the new era that dawns on may 1 is called reiwa meaning beautiful harmony it begins when crown prince naruhito ascends the chrysanthemum throne but do investors really want harmony what they want to see is a bit of economic growth and inflation to shake up the status quo the bank of japan s stimulus toolkit to revive a long suffering economy is anything but harmonious and yet it s set to stay the central bank confirmed recently rates will stay near zero for a long time but the coming days may not be harmonious or peaceful for currency markets a 10 day golden week holiday kicks off on april 29 and investors are fretting over the risk of a flash crash a violent currency spasm that can occur in times of thin trading turnover the year has already seen two yen spikes and many including japan s housewife

thirds of companies results have beat expectations and they point to earnings growth of 4 5 percent year on year financials have delivered the biggest surprises according to analysis by barclays that might just show how low expectations were in fact analysts are still taking a red pen to their estimates the latest i b e s data from refinitiv shows analysts on average expect first quarter earnings per share for stoxx 600 listed companies to fall 4 2 percent that would be their worst quarter since 2016 and down sharply from an estimated 3 4 percent just a week earlier those estimates may end up being a little too bearish as earnings season goes on quelling worries that europe is heading toward a corporate recession gsk and reckitt benckiser will give the market a glimpse of the health of the

weakest since 2009 investment is down and governor mark carney says business uncertainty is through the roof indeed expectations for an interest rate increase have been whittled down reuters polls forecast rates will not move until early 2020 a calendar quarter later than was forecast a month ago the hunt for a new governor to replace carney in october adds more uncertainty to the mix the

in the spring of 1944 the world s attention was rightly focused elsewhere american and british troops were stuck at the anzio beachhead in italy surrounded by germans the red army was flooding into the ukraine while the us navy and marines were island hopping japanese strongholds throughout the pacific the empire of japan launched operation icho go in central china in the vain attempt to halt american bombers launching strikes from the region on its home islands and there was that massive buildup in england toward what everyone knew was the coming invasion of europe while the youth of so many nations slugged it out in faraway places amidst devastating carnage and often total destruction officials gathered in the us to begin planning for a new postwar order there were political discussions about a great number of topics how a defeated germany and japan might be dealt with but also the more mundane mechanical necessities the treasury department had organized convened and otherwise supported working groups of financial professionals in cities across the country boston chicago philadelphia st louis new york in each place experts had gathered in the early months of 44 to figure out the best way to solve one factor which may have been the greatest contributor to world war ii if the great depression had fanned the flames of internal resentments into global disharmony the best course would be to avoid another one hardly anyone though could agree on a common cause where everyone did find common ground was in how once begun it had spread all over on april 21 1944 seventy five years ago this week a joint statement was issued the experts on the establishment of an international monetary fund of the united and associated nations was a working group of delegates drawn from dozens of those nations primarily the work of the us uk and canada less than two months before d day this declaration was the first step toward the international arrangement everyone hoped would follow from the invasion s ultimate success as a result of discussions among the technical experts of more than 30 of the united and associated nations the conclusion was reached that the most practical method of assuring international monetary cooperation is through the establishment of an international monetary fund the imf was not meant to be what it has become today indeed the april 44 communication was actually the first step toward what would be known to history as bretton woods the system of gold exchange which would light the way for a war ravaged world to move into unparalleled prosperity was born from it that the imf was at the center was no accident when the full conference at bretton woods new hampshire was held in early july 1944 the first of its three commissions was dedicated to the imf chaired by the chief american negotiator harry dexter white assistant to us treasury secretary henry morgenthau who presided over the whole conference the task was to create a mechanism for fair settlement of global imbalances the very first sentences in the introductory statement went straight to the point when currency systems were restored after the last war there was little or no attempt at coordination of measures to provide stability no machinery was set up to facilitate an orderly adjustment of exchange rates when fundamental conditions necessitated such a revision the disturbances of the 1930 s involving a resort to competitive currency depreciation imposition of exchange restrictions import quotas and other devices which all but stifled trade made it clear that improved international financial arrangements were necessary it was equally clear given the very raw history of the thirties then the forties why this was so important the april 1944 joint statement set out these overriding concerns the principles that would guide the imf eventually gold exchange bretton woods were first and foremost 1 to promote international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation on international monetary problems 2 to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and to contribute in this way to the maintenance of a high level of employment and real income which must be a primary objective of economic policy we give almost no consideration to what a reserve currency is today it is almost always thought of in terms of something like oil the us dollar means people in the united states get to price the vital commodity in their own currency some like to talk about a petrodollar as if that actually means something there are very crucial roles that any reserve currency must fill these were best described in detail by robert solomon the federal reserve s chief international monetary expert who decades later as bretton woods unraveled counseled the imf toward recognizing what was wrong a reserve currency solomon said must provide three functions liquidity adjustment and confidence under bretton woods it was gold which was meant for the last and us dollars along with british pound sterling currency for the first no one gave much thought to the middle because in 1944 a more fully globalized world was still too far distant a reserve currency is an intermediator more than a buffer between national systems often with very little in common starting with currency denomination and monetary terms the example i often use is an export firm in sweden obtaining goods in that country to be shipped to japan for final use the trade can certainly happen without a global reserve but not efficiently the japanese importer somehow has to find kronor and then send it to sweden for payment otherwise the swedish exporter has to accept yen and then find something to do with it while the funds are now trapped far away from their home these are not likely to be successful scenarios the firms can appeal to help from each s local banking networks though here too there are serious drawbacks the japanese bank must find and maintain a stockpile of kronor made available to japanese importers alternately swedish banks must be capable of regularly and efficiently disposing of yen these are not likely successful scenarios either if however both sides can use a currency that is common in both areas it then obviates the need for either of their national denominations should japanese as well as swedish banks both hold balances of this middle currency as a regular part of their business no special concessions required then trade becomes easy and very nearly free the downside is that this requires a whole lot of that middle currency to be made available practically everywhere under bretton woods the task of the imf was originally to foster that sort of liquidity meaning redistribution of monetary resources when imbalances arose in more practical terms it just wasn t realistic as economist robert triffin famously described the bretton woods system was set up at odds with its own mechanisms gold remained convertible into dollars and sterling at a fixed price therefore limiting quantities while at the same time a globalizing world required more and more of a middle reserve currency to facilitate trade that began to really truly flourish gold exchange effectively lasted just sixteen years until the establishment of the london gold pool in 1960 the imf in the sixties was highly active by necessity yet helpless the world needed liquidity and adjustment not just its confidence liquidity though is no easy trick it requires momentous resources the voluntary heavy participation of a broad cross section of private financial institutions there needs to be substantial infrastructure a dependable marketplace whereby the firm or bank in sweden or japan knows that it can efficiently source the middle currency and never give it a moment s thought how that middle currency is sourced changes with time the adjustment function is perhaps the most misunderstood piece of a global reserve currency architecture it s like this with a lot of modern economics a discipline dedicated to describing a world which in its theories always stands still we live in a dynamic world change is the only constant innovation and evolution are factors in money and finance just as they are in technology and medicine as the world around it is altered and altered again so too must be the middle currency this adjustability applies to liquidity as well as confidence can the reserve currency be settled by anything other than actual bars of bullion or even stacks of physical currency notes in today s digital world trade settlement that might ve been booked by something like a banker s acceptance long ago and changed to certificates of deposit somewhere in the middle now have to incorporate swaps forwards and multi faceted derivatives footnote dollars so to speak that s adjustment the flexibility in the design of the currency system to evolve with our dynamic innovative world small wonder then that a credit based offshore global reserve system rose up to replace gold exchange it performed all the roles almost beautifully at the same time nearly living up to the ideals set forth by that very first joint statement of the experts a globalizing global economy meant prosperity shared worldwide behind the scenes very necessary for it a flexible monetary design which allowed for even incentivized imagination adjustment as well as immense support liquidity and it was all denominated in us dollars confidence this eurodollar it only went too far way way too far small wonder too that coincidentally beginning march 2009 serious complaints began to be lodged in public first the chinese who were immediately dismissed as geopolitical saber rattlers it is a huge mistake to assume such single motivation that was more than ten years ago plenty of time for any organic problems which may have arisen as our current set of officials claim subprime to have long since passed into history they haven t if anything the complaints about the dollar grow louder and more persistent with each passing recovery less year it s very easy to presume only politics because again hardly anyone politicians included actually politicians are right at the top of this list of offenders bothers to consider what a global reserve currency is and what it does or is supposed to do to everyone there s dollars and so potential global dollar shortage makes no sense to the people who pay no attention to these things are aware of none of its history this can t be a problem yet just a few days ago the wall street journal of all mainstream economics mouthpieces meekly reported china s major commercial banks have a funding issue outside beijing s control they re running low on the u s dollars they need for activities both at home and abroad at home and abroad sort of like the functions of a middle currency this is not a new development either not that you would know it from the text of the article the chart accompanying it does describe well enough a situation that is more than half a decade in arrears it predates qt and rate hikes all the typical mainstream stuff which usually gets carelessly applied to anything so inconvenient i wrote five years ago in march 2014 what all this data shows as opposed to conjecture about the supernatural powers of central banks is that yuan s devaluation may be directly tied to dollar shortages in fact as i argue here it is far more plausible that a dollar shortage showing up as a rising dollar or depreciating yuan is forcing the pboc to allow a wider band in order that chinese banks can more aggressively obtain dollars they desperately need worse than that the pboc itself cannot meet that need with its own reserve actions without further upsetting the entire fragile system i wrote that in response to a contemporary journal article which purported cny s decline at the time just getting started was intentional the whole supernatural powers thing was the journal claiming the pboc was actually engineering the currency s drop to punish and drive out speculators in the half decade since a little more than 900 billion have disappeared from china s official reserve count up and vanished where d a trillion dollars in reserves go more importantly why these are questions no one answers the latest article which admits to china s dollar problem conspicuously asks neither it is still too far outside of mainstream intellectual convention this massive disconnect between what actually goes on in the real world and what we are told to believe goes on should the difference between these grow too large well that s how you get something like 2008 what connects 2008 to 2019 as you may have noticed lately is liquidity adjustment and confidence or more appropriate the at times heavy absence of liquidity like today the very much still misunderstood nature of adjustment as well as more and more the decline in confidence the middle currency has persistently degraded in all three phases thus if you are an importer in japan perhaps china and you go to your local bank looking for dollars to buy and import something on the global market and your local bank says sorry what next you can as before attempt to find some kronor rand reals rupees whatever but it s not the same as it was when the middle currency dependably cheaply proficiently stood in between everything around the world this is a notable and noticeable friction a direct harm for more than global trade the whole point of bretton woods impediments to it are very real threats to the maintenance of a high level of employment and real income especially in the national economies where its officials are mind numbingly blind to the matter in short all of them just like the thirties the imf today is watching the largest bailout in the organization s history go up in smoke argentina despite a 50 billion rescue is like china running out of dollars the massive portion which was pledged and delivered so far will not have lasted a year the us dollar as reserve currency is obviously a political question however the eurodollar as the world s actual middle currency is a far more complicated one all that aside there are these technical matters which must must be addressed before or as the basis of any political discussion and politics does not mean partisanship there is still tremendous opportunity here even after eleven years already it calls for another bretton woods gathering not to mimic its specific answer to the thirties and forties but in the same spirit of desperate global cooperation to solve a truly global problem a very severe and persistent one coming together to achieve something honestly noble before the background behind that last conference is repeated too
news national by staff reporter government has laid siege on the business sector ominously accusing it of overcharging consumers in pursuit of super profits and engaging in financial terrorism president emmerson mnangagwa his deputy constantino chiwenga finance minister mthuli ncube and foreign affairs minister sibusiso moyo are leading the assault this comes as the country is holding the zimbabwe international trade fair zitf in bulawayo which is meant to showcase the nation s business innovation as well as promote trade and investment the annual event will be officially opened today by ugandan president yoweri museveni who has been in power for 33 years he is currently in the spotlight for clamping down on the opposition particularly the persecution of musician and political opponent robert kyagulanyi known by his stage name bobi wine prices of basic commodities have shot through the roof since october last year after the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya announced the separation of rtgs and foreign currency accounts signalling abandonment of the fixed 1 1 exchange rate between quasi local currencies and the united states dollar prices again rose sharply after mangudya s february 20 monetary policy statement which devalued the official exchange rate from 1 1 to 1 2 5 official statistics have shown that some basic commodities have skyrocketed by nearly 200 during the period between october last year and april this year giving oral evidence before a parliamentary portfolio committee on information communication technology and courier services chaired by kuwadzana east legislator chalton hwende mdc alliance earlier this month mangudya also castigated business for hiking prices you do not need to track the exchange rate on a daily basis if your cost of production is 20 foreign currency i think it would be wrong to use exchange rate as a price determining factor which i see in zimbabwe mangudya said in south africa you hear that every day the rand has moved from 12 to 13 14 or whatever to the us dollar but they do not change the price because of movement of exchange rate if you go to zambia the kwacha moves from 9 10 they do not change the price we do not necessarily want this tracking mechanism i think it is a disease that needs to be removed in this country yes we know that zimbabwe depends on foreign currency but let us not over emphasise that dependency ncube has also weighed in accusing business of profiteering by using the exchange rate as a benchmark for pricing it is actually bad economics to link price increases to the exchange rate that s not how you do it it is profiteering he told reporters earlier this month ncube attacked business on the same issue yet again at the zitf this week please it is bad economics very bad economics where you tie price increases directly to the exchange rate good economics says tie prices around a consumption basket you don t earn your salary to go and buy us dollars so inflation thinking should be hinged around consumption basket and not us dollars he said in his independence day speech mnangagwa slammed business over the price increases government is alarmed by the recent wanton and indiscriminate increases of prices which have brought about untold suffering to the people this conduct by stakeholders in business industry and commerce is inhumane unethical unpatriotic and goes against the grain of economic dialogue which the second republic has espoused government remains determined to restore the purchasing power to all workers mnangagwa said vice president constantino chiwenga this week issued an ominous threat to business describing them as financial terrorists i want to give a stern warning to those practising financial terrorism in the country we will react accordingly as government and nobody should claim that they were not warned we ll take very strict measures said chiwenga business has however reacted angrily to the government s accusations pointing out that the price increases are a result of toxic policies the chairperson of the presidential advisory council and prominent industrialist joe mutizwa yesterday declined to say whether or not his panel has given mnangagwa advice on prices you will appreciate that i advise the president in confidence at this point it would not be proper to comment on that mutizwa said the threats by government are reminiscent of former president robert mugabe s propensity to blame business over prices and inflation mugabe in 2008 formed a pricing commission chaired by goodwills masimirembwa which imposed price controls resulting in massive shortages and empty shelves the international monetary fund imf has predicted that zimbabwe will slide into recession this year previous forecasts by the imf had projected growth of at least 4 2 but now the economy is seen contracting by as much as 5 2 annual inflation has been galloping while purchasing power and aggregate demand have resultantly plunged due to exchange rate movements and differentials salaries and wages have gone down almost four times in real terms company balance sheets value stocks pensions and savings have been badly eroded local companies with foreign debts could become insolvent and close shop as their liabilities have multiplied by up to 400 due to the adjustment of the exchange rate by the rbz in february volatility which provides a measure of price uncertainty in the market has been rising and companies have reacted by delaying investment and other decisions as they intensified risk management activities the poor have been the hardest hit by price spikes rising inflation and eroding incomes the situation has been exacerbated by exchange rate volatility zimbabweans are now languishing deeper in poverty zimstats figures show poverty levels in zimbabwe have reached alarming proportions poverty headcount ratio at national poverty line percentage of the population is rising economist godfrey kanyenze said threats by the government against business raise déjà vu history is repeating itself if you go back to 2004 businesspeople were called economic saboteurs kanyenze said government has a knack for blaming either sanctions or business whenever there is a crisis when you float the exchange rate and when there is no foreign currency the prices will go one way up it s not rocket science economic analyst and zimbabwe independent columnist victor bhoroma points to the low confidence in the market as a major factor to the economic crisis as zimbabwe s economy wobbles on the brink of recession the cost of low confidence in the market is taking a huge toll on various policies to resuscitate the economy prices for most consumer foodstuffs industrial products and services have been skyrocketing since the october 2018 monitory policy statement with official inflation rate hitting 66 8 in march 2019 bhoroma says

french language version of which is filed by the company with the french autorité des marchés financiers and annual report on form 20 f filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec financial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows internal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of total in addition to ifrs measures certain alternative performance indicators are presented such as performance indicators excluding the adjustment items described below adjusted operating income adjusted net operating income adjusted net income return on equity roe return on average capital employed roace and gearing ratio these indicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance of total and the comparison of income between periods they allow investors to track the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of the group these adjustment items include i special items due to their unusual nature or particular significance certain transactions qualified as special items are excluded from the business segment figures in general special items relate to transactions that are significant infrequent or unusual however in certain instances transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals which are not considered to be representative of the normal course of business may be qualified as special items although they may have occurred within prior years or are likely to occur again within the coming years ii inventory valuation effect the adjusted results of the refining chemicals and marketing services segments are presented according to the replacement cost method this method is used to assess the segments performance and facilitate the comparability of the segments performance with those of its competitors in the replacement cost method which approximates the lifo last in first out method the variation of inventory values in the statement of income is depending on the nature of the inventory determined using either the month end price differentials between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value the inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results according to the fifo first in first out and the replacement cost iii effect of changes in fair value the effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects for some transactions differences between internal measures of performance used by total s management and the accounting for these transactions under ifrs ifrs requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period end spot prices in order to best reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions internal indicators used to measure performance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices furthermore total in its trading activities enters into storage contracts whose future effects are recorded at fair value in group s internal economic performance ifrs precludes recognition of this fair value effect the adjusted results adjusted operating income adjusted net operating income adjusted net income are defined as replacement cost results adjusted for special items excluding the effect of changes in fair value euro

overview equities are finishing softly after the rally stalled in the middle of the week the large markets in asia fell led by china and the fell for a third session the longest losing streak in two months europe s dow jones ended an eight day advance with a two day loss coming into today where it is a little softer it has been alternating between weekly gains and losses for nine weeks the has been consolidating after hitting record highs at midweek it is about 0 75 for the week ahead of today s session that features the first look at q1 us gdp benchmark 10 year yields a little lower today the us yield backed off from the 2 60 area tested last week and is off about seven basis points this week poor survey data earlier in the week have pushed the german bund back below zero italian bonds are paring this week s losses a little the yield is still up seven basis points this week s p is expected to leave its sovereign rating unchanged at bbb the price of oil continues to consolidate the gains scored earlier this week ostensibly on response to the us decision not to renew any of the exemptions for iranian oil oil though has extended its advance for an eighth consecutive week the price of oil has only fallen in three weeks so far this year the dollar is little changed against the major currencies where it is sporting a slightly heavier tone while emerging market currencies are mixed the is softer but consolidating this week 2 decline it the lira does finish lower it will be the eighth consecutive session it has fallen in 11 of the past 12 weeks it is the argentine peso that led the emerging market currencies to decline this week with a 7 drop before today s local session asia pacific japan is set to begin an extended 10 day holiday the traditional golden week holiday has been extended and japanese markets will be closed the next two weeks to celebrate a new emperor and a new era ahead of the holiday there was little economic cheer industrial output which had been expected to be flat in march fell 0 9 offsetting in full the february gain of 0 7 for the quarter as a while industrial production fell 2 6 which is the worst showing in almost five years this report coupled with the unexpectedly large rise in unemployment 2 5 vs 2 3 in february offset the better than expected retail sales 0 2 vs expectations for a flat report and a doubling of the february increase from 0 2 to 0 4 and strong housing starts 10 in march nearly twice what economists expected as we have suggested before and the data reinforces it the japanese economy appears to have contracted in q1 it would be the second quarterly contraction in the past three quarters many participants recall the flash crash on january 3 when the soared for apparently little reason and saw many other currencies sell off sharply the lack of liquidity is commonly cited as the key factor and with the long holiday participants are again looking at the retail positioning in tokyo where the flash crash is thought to have emanated we had expected the run up to the holiday to weigh on the yen and the dollar recorded its highs for the year near jpy112 40 in the middle of the week in the last couple of sessions the yen has drifted higher amid position adjusting retail in tokyo has a significant long yen position but also continues to be attracted to the high yield offered by turkey and south africa japan s prime minister abe and finance minister aso are in washington ostensibly to talk trade it appears japan is willing to make concessions to the us granting it similar access to its agriculture market that it has given in the trade agreements with europe and the tpp it wants to be exempt from any auto tariffs the us may impose while aso has pushed against linking the trade agreement with a new pledge on currency intervention it seems mostly semantics while there is some long hanging fruit the real effort to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance may take longer there are two talking points about china first the pboc skipped its open market operations today it said liquidity was sufficient though a cny20 bln reverse repo matured today the pboc set the reference rate for the yuan dollar exchange rate unchanged from yesterday cny6 7307 some observers see it as a protest against further weakening the dollar reached cny6 75 yesterday its strongest level since february 19 we suspect many are less convinced of the signal and if it really is the pboc s intention it will likely have to show its hand again next week second president xi addressed a belt road conference promising to enact many of the reforms the us appears to be demanding in negotiations this is seen as reinforcing expectations of a deal perhaps as early as next month between the two largest economies on the other hand this is not the first time xi has made such declaratory claims the problem ultimately lies with the operational policy and from another angle it appears that china is moving in the desired direction but slower than the us and europe wish the dollar slipped below jpy111 40 yesterday to record its lowest level since april 11 and is consolidating in narrow ranges today near the 20 day moving average jpy111 70 note that the 200 day moving average is near jpy111 50 the australian dollar briefly traded below 0 7000 yesterday for the first time since early january but recovered late in the session and closed above it it remains above 0 7000 today the australian dollar sometimes leads the other major currencies so its recovery is flashing a near term yellow light to us dollar bulls europe spain goes to the polls this weekend the socialists are expected to be the largest party but whether its possible coalition partners garner enough votes for a center left government may be the crux of the matter a key issue in this election cycle is catalonian independence and how the two main secessionist parties which have softened their rhetoric perform may be critical to the center left being able to forge a majority government meanwhile the new right party vox appears to be siphoning votes from the traditional right popular party many economists and participants worry about italy s debt and bad loan burden while we are cognizant of it we see it as a chronic issue not acute moreover the italian bonds that have been bought under the ecb s qe sit on the bank of italy s books and this has reduced italy s net debt debt it owes other than to itself it has among the most sophisticated debt managers who alas have much experience in this the government coalition illustrates the old adage that politics makes for strange bedfellows and despite a near constant tension it is hanging together league leader salvini who is a junior partner in the coalition seen his fortunes rise he acts as the senior partner and the eu parliament election are likely to validate it s p will review its bbb rating for italy today the rating matches fitch s and is one notch above moody s assessment it warned in october that a material undershoot in growth or a deterioration in its debt ratios could spur a downgrade since then investors have learned that the italian economy contracted in q4 18 and q3 18 italy reports q1 gdp next week economists expect another small contraction slower growth translates into a higher deficit to gdp ratio and impacts the debt to gdp ratio as well without remedial action a downgrade is a palpable possibility but we suspect s p will hold off the is little changed as it nurses this week s drop it slipped briefly below 1 1120 its lowest level since may 2017 two large option strike may confine it ahead of the weekend there is a 1 1 bln euro option that will be cut today at 1 11 and another 1 2 bln euros at 1 1160 sterling was sold to almost 1 2865 and closed little change before hovering around in a tight range less than 20 ticks on either side of 1 29 with indications that the withdrawal bill will not re submitted to parliament next week more are coming around to the idea that the uk will have to participate in eu parliament elections next week sees local elections america the first quarter began miserably for the us but steadily the data improved expectations have generally trended up though not as much as the atlanta fed s gdp tracker which began the quarter near 0 3 and its last estimate is for 2 7 bloomberg economists revised up their estimate from 1 5 a week ago to 1 9 now while the survey bloomberg conducts found a median forecast of 2 3 just ahead of q4 18 s 2 2 pace our own back of the envelope calculation puts it around 2 while there may be a knee jerk reaction to the headline number we suspect investors and policymakers are looking past q1 so we do not expect lasting influence that said next week emu s q1 gdp will be reported and the divergence theme which underlies our constructive dollar outlook is likely to be on full display the fomc s statement next week is likely to recognize the subsiding of some of the domestic cross currents while the international headwinds remain a slightly more dovish bank of canada has helped keep the on the defensive it is off about 0 75 this week cad1 35 after a 0 5 loss last week the greenback found support near cad1 3470 there is a cad1 35 option for about 510 mln that expires today on a strong us gdp report we suspect the us dollar can push toward cad1 3520 or so before coming off ahead of the weekend after rising toward our resistance near mxn19 20 yesterday the reversed lower to close a little above mxn19 00 mexico is expected to

percent for 2019 the key factor in the surge is not the prospect for economic growth either in the us or global economy in fact the outlook has worsened amid growing signs of a downturn especially germany which is on the edge of zero growth or even a recession in its world economic outlook issued earlier this month the international monetary fund reported that 70 percent of the world economy by value that is the advanced economies were experiencing decelerating growth after an upturn in 2017 such was the slowdown that the imf said global growth prospects for 2020 depended on emerging and developing economies specifically citing turkey and argentina both beset by currency and debt problems as crucial the key factor in the market turnaround has been the 180 degree pivot by the us federal reserve together with the european central bank ecb and others from seeking to gradually normalise monetary policy and lift interest rates to initiating a new round of financial stimulus in 2018 in response to increased us growth and what appeared to be a world upturn the us fed made four interest rate hikes of 0 5 percentage points each it also indicated it would wind down its holdings of financial assets accumulated during the quantitative easing program following the 2008 financial crash at the rate of 50 billion a month this produced a furious reaction in financial markets in december after the fourth interest rate rise and a sustained attack on the fed in the corporate media spearheaded by us president donald trump but by no means confined to him the fed rapidly jumped into line chairman jerome powell made clear in a january speech that rate rises pencilled in for 2019 were off the table at its march meeting the fed s open market committee ruled out increases for the rest of the year and decided to stop reducing its asset holdings at the end of september leaving them at around 3 5 trillion compared to 800 billion before 2008 since then the prospect has been raised that the fed may even cut interest rates by the end of the year the trump administration is calling for a reduction of 0 5 percent as well as a resumption of asset purchases derivatives markets data indicate a 56 percent chance of a rate cut by the end of the year the world s second most important central bank the ecb is moving in the same direction providing further financial stimulus at its last meeting in response to the euro zone slowdown the bank of japan committed to keeping interest rates at rock bottom lows this year after a downward revision of japanese growth prospects for the first time in three years this was a result of slowing domestic consumption weakening exports and rising international trade risks the bank warned of high uncertainties and indicated it does not expect to reach its inflation target at least until march 2020 nine years after its initial moves to lift prices export dependent south korea regarded as a bellwether for technology yesterday reported the biggest contraction in its economy for a decade gross domestic product fell by 0 3 percent for the first quarter the reserve bank of australia is also considering an interest rate cut at its may 7 meeting following data showing zero inflation for the march quarter and only 1 3 percent for the past year well below the bank s target rate of 2 3 percent the us market rise has been provoked by the fed turnaround and the prospect of still further stimulus to come however it points to a more far reaching structural change in the foundations of the us and global financial system financial times columnist michael mackenzie noted last month that amid all the twists and turns the past decade has been a rewarding one for those owning us assets further gains have been recorded since then in march 2009 the s p 500 went as low as 666 on tuesday it reached almost 3 000 an increase of around 470 percent mackenzie noted the role of central banks in nurturing the strong recovery in stocks and other risky assets has been so significant that it makes the years leading up to 2009 look like another era for markets the essence of the post 2009 era is that central banks now provide the underpinning for accumulation of profit via financial market operations and speculation nothing like this has ever been seen in the history of global capitalism far from representing a strength it shows that the disease which led to the 2008 crash has not been cured it has simply mutated to assume even more dangerous forms the precarious structure of the entire system was highlighted by steve blitz an analyst at the financial research firm ts lombard cited by mackenzie according to blitz the december turmoil could be thought of as dress rehearsal and we are left with an economy that can ill afford the loss of wealth from a bear market and with market structures unable to handle a massive reversal in the flow of investment monies apart from the underwriting of the financial markets by the fed and other central banks the other main factor in the rise of stock prices is the growing use of share buybacks in a bygone era such measures were considered to be market manipulation they are now standard operating procedure according to calculations by the economist william lazonick between 2007 and 2016 the s p 500 companies spent 96 percent of their profits to finance share buybacks and pay dividends a process that has continued since then this gives the lie to the claim that the trump administration s corporate tax cuts would lead to increased investments greater production and higher wages the outcome of the measures implemented since 2008 is the establishment of a financial mechanism by which the wealth created by the labour of the working class is sucked up and deposited in the hands of the banks hedge funds finance houses and their owners karl marx s analysis that the inherent logic of the capitalist system was the creation of wealth at one pole of society and poverty and misery at the other was once denounced as a wild exaggeration refuted by the course of events today it is a living reality the majority of american workers have not experienced a rise in their real wages in more than three decades at the same time executives of large us companies last year received more than 254 times the compensation of their median employees with about one in ten earning 1 000 times as much forty years ago the ratio was under 30 the much vaunted low unemployment figures in the us reveal the same trend a study by harvard economist lawrence katz and princeton economist alan krueger at the end of 2016 found that 94 percent of the 10 million jobs created during the obama administration were temporary contract or part time positions as a result such workers comprised almost 16 percent of the workforce the rise and rise of the stock market is not an indication of economic health it is rather a fever chart of a coming financial and economic meltdown that will be accompanied by an explosion of class struggle
news national by staff reporter government has laid siege on the business sector ominously accusing it of overcharging consumers in pursuit of super profits and engaging in financial terrorism president emmerson mnangagwa his deputy constantino chiwenga finance minister mthuli ncube and foreign affairs minister sibusiso moyo are leading the assault this comes as the country is holding the zimbabwe international trade fair zitf in bulawayo which is meant to showcase the nation s business innovation as well as promote trade and investment the annual event will be officially opened today by ugandan president yoweri museveni who has been in power for 33 years he is currently in the spotlight for clamping down on the opposition particularly the persecution of musician and political opponent robert kyagulanyi known by his stage name bobi wine prices of basic commodities have shot through the roof since october last year after the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya announced the separation of rtgs and foreign currency accounts signalling abandonment of the fixed 1 1 exchange rate between quasi local currencies and the united states dollar prices again rose sharply after mangudya s february 20 monetary policy statement which devalued the official exchange rate from 1 1 to 1 2 5 official statistics have shown that some basic commodities have skyrocketed by nearly 200 during the period between october last year and april this year giving oral evidence before a parliamentary portfolio committee on information communication technology and courier services chaired by kuwadzana east legislator chalton hwende mdc alliance earlier this month mangudya also castigated business for hiking prices you do not need to track the exchange rate on a daily basis if your cost of production is 20 foreign currency i think it would be wrong to use exchange rate as a price determining factor which i see in zimbabwe mangudya said in south africa you hear that every day the rand has moved from 12 to 13 14 or whatever to the us dollar but they do not change the price because of movement of exchange rate if you go to zambia the kwacha moves from 9 10 they do not change the price we do not necessarily want this tracking mechanism i think it is a disease that needs to be removed in this country yes we know that zimbabwe depends on foreign currency but let us not over emphasise that dependency ncube has also weighed in accusing business of profiteering by using the exchange rate as a benchmark for pricing it is actually bad economics to link price increases to the exchange rate that s not how you do it it is profiteering he told reporters earlier this month ncube attacked business on the same issue yet again at the zitf this week please it is bad economics very bad economics where you tie price increases directly to the exchange rate good economics says tie prices around a consumption basket you don t earn your salary to go and buy us dollars so inflation thinking should be hinged around consumption basket and not us dollars he said in his independence day speech mnangagwa slammed business over the price increases government is alarmed by the recent wanton and indiscriminate increases of prices which have brought about untold suffering to the people this conduct by stakeholders in business industry and commerce is inhumane unethical unpatriotic and goes against the grain of economic dialogue which the second republic has espoused government remains determined to restore the purchasing power to all workers mnangagwa said vice president constantino chiwenga this week issued an ominous threat to business describing them as financial terrorists i want to give a stern warning to those practising financial terrorism in the country we will react accordingly as government and nobody should claim that they were not warned we ll take very strict measures said chiwenga business has however reacted angrily to the government s accusations pointing out that the price increases are a result of toxic policies the chairperson of the presidential advisory council and prominent industrialist joe mutizwa yesterday declined to say whether or not his panel has given mnangagwa advice on prices you will appreciate that i advise the president in confidence at this point it would not be proper to comment on that mutizwa said the threats by government are reminiscent of former president robert mugabe s propensity to blame business over prices and inflation mugabe in 2008 formed a pricing commission chaired by goodwills masimirembwa which imposed price controls resulting in massive shortages and empty shelves the international monetary fund imf has predicted that zimbabwe will slide into recession this year previous forecasts by the imf had projected growth of at least 4 2 but now the economy is seen contracting by as much as 5 2 annual inflation has been galloping while purchasing power and aggregate demand have resultantly plunged due to exchange rate movements and differentials salaries and wages have gone down almost four times in real terms company balance sheets value stocks pensions and savings have been badly eroded local companies with foreign debts could become insolvent and close shop as their liabilities have multiplied by up to 400 due to the adjustment of the exchange rate by the rbz in february volatility which provides a measure of price uncertainty in the market has been rising and companies have reacted by delaying investment and other decisions as they intensified risk management activities the poor have been the hardest hit by price spikes rising inflation and eroding incomes the situation has been exacerbated by exchange rate volatility zimbabweans are now languishing deeper in poverty zimstats figures show poverty levels in zimbabwe have reached alarming proportions poverty headcount ratio at national poverty line percentage of the population is rising economist godfrey kanyenze said threats by the government against business raise déjà vu history is repeating itself if you go back to 2004 businesspeople were called economic saboteurs kanyenze said government has a knack for blaming either sanctions or business whenever there is a crisis when you float the exchange rate and when there is no foreign currency the prices will go one way up it s not rocket science economic analyst and zimbabwe independent columnist victor bhoroma points to the low confidence in the market as a major factor to the economic crisis as zimbabwe s economy wobbles on the brink of recession the cost of low confidence in the market is taking a huge toll on various policies to resuscitate the economy prices for most consumer foodstuffs industrial products and services have been skyrocketing since the october 2018 monitory policy statement with official inflation rate hitting 66 8 in march 2019 bhoroma says

trucking industry including increased ton miles and higher utilization emea s commercial replacement business also posted solid growth aided by the strength of our proactive solutions offering european consumer replacement industry demand waned throughout the quarter reflecting weakness in the emerging markets in germany this negatively affected emea s consumer replacement volume and as

nearly 15 in the quarter i d like to take a few moments to address some of the key areas driving and influencing our business and the first is china looking at china overall we started seeing indicators of stabilization in the quarter as government stimulus has shown signs of improving business confidence sales of new commercial trucks have improved as construction and infrastructure projects are increasing and as i mentioned while new car sales contracted for the ninth month in a row the rate of decline moderated relative to the previous month as well as through the first quarter we re also seeing some encouraging developments in the consumer replacement channel most notably industry selling trends are improving aided by lower inventory levels following months of destocking activity by small and medium sized distributors next i d like to address some actions taken in the quarter regarding our manufacturing footprint recently we took steps to improve the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase our premium tire capacity both of these actions will help us with our goal of having the right tire at the right place at the right time and at the right cost we announced plans to modernize our hanau and fulda manufacturing facilities in germany these investments will bolster the capabilities and the productivity of our german plants strengthening our competitive position in the market the transformation will result in these plants having more automated production and being fully capable of producing consumer tire with rim diameters greater than or equal to 17 inches these transformational investments along with the planned expansion of our plant in slovenia announced earlier this year will add nearly 4 5 million units of high value added capacity better positioning us to meet the growing demand in the higher margin premium segments of the european market our portfolio of industry leading products is key to capturing this growing demand product innovation and vitality continue to be areas of focus for us in 2019 on the last call i provided an overview of four new tires that we are launching in the us this year each of which were well received at our annual north america customer conference our product development team in emea also has tremendous momentum on this front with several new high value added products scheduled for launch this year including the eagle f1 asymmetric 5 and the eagle f1 supersport consumer tires the vector 4seasons cargo for the all important cargo van segment and the kmax gen 2 and fuelmax gen 2 commercial tires for the drive and steer positions these tires feature our latest technology the eagle f1 asymmetric 5 delivered excellent performance in this year s european magazine summer tire tests including earning first or second place finishes in four out of four tests the eagle f1 supersport will enhance goodyear s position in the ultra ultra high performance category this tire delivers superior wet braking and dry handling performance versus the competition both contributing to superior track times the vector 4season cargo refreshes our offering in the all important cargo van segment this marks the first refresh in a number of years within this category this product offers superior wet breaking snow handling and mileage performance compared to its predecessor and our customers are waiting for it the kmax gen 2 aimed at the regional haul service segment delivers enhanced all weather capability and tread robustness compared to its predecessor and lastly the fuelmax gen 2 is tuned for long haul service providers and offer superior all weather capability noise reduction and mileage potential versus the earlier generation each of these new product launches represent the power of our market back approach to product design and innovation i m really excited about the prospects for each of these lines as we move throughout 2019 into 2020 our product line is second to none in addition to our industry leadership and products which is the foundation of what we do our progress in the area of emerging mobility continued in the quarter turning to slide nine i d like to spotlight our latest mobility partnerships we expanded our portfolio of mobility and technology partners to include envoy technologies local motors and yourmechanic envoy technologies provides turnkey ev car sharing solutions that allow real estate owners and operators to offer mobility as an amenity goodyear s proprietary predictive tire servicing solution will enable envoy s fleet managers to efficiently manage the service needs of the company s vehicles with the aim of minimizing the operational downtime of the fleet and maximizing the user experience local motors is a ground mobility company focused on shaping the future for the better through open collaboration and co creation goodyear has teamed with local motors to conduct tire testing with olli an eight passenger autonomous shuttle local motors also selected goodyear tires for exclusive fitment on its olli vehicles expanding our fleet of test vehicles will allow us to continue advancing our knowledge of the best strategies and formats for transferring advanced vehicle and ride sharing data into value added information to improve operating performance and benefit customers tire innovation is that our core but these partnerships are demonstrating the increasing importance of data and fleet management as a service and solving our customer s problems better than anyone else another partner yourmechanic offers mobile repair maintenance inspection and reconditioning services directly to millions of consumers and fleets across north america the company added goodyear com to its platform for tire sales and services yourmechanic will further enhance goodyear s global innovation network that includes numerous customers suppliers and independent start up businesses all in the name of making the tire buying process easier these initiatives provide us with valuable opportunities to continue learning and innovating the collective insights that we gain from our mobility partnerships when combined with our remarkable set of core assets will ensure that goodyear has a seat at the table to shape the mobility revolution as it unfolds finally selling tires online with our aligned partner dealers continues to unfold and grow new technologies and changing consumer and customer needs are reshaping how tires are bought and sold this dynamic is not only here to stay but it s a trend that we think will only accelerate going forward as consumers increase their knowledge and comfort of buying tires online and having them installed at trusted partners like goodyear our b2c e commerce site tirehub goodyear mobile install and roll by goodyear are examples of our response to changing consumer behavior as it relates to the tire buying process in 2015 we were the first tire manufacturer to move online with the launch of our e commerce platform goodyear com in june we will launch our commercial e commerce pilot marking another first for our company and industry this new platform provides us with an opportunity to better meet the changing needs of commercial truck fleets and owner operators and increase the business and online competitiveness of goodyear s commercial tire dealers there has been a pull from the market for this platform and we re pleased to initiate it with our partner dealers each of these mobility partnerships as well as the upcoming launch of our commercial e commerce pilot were made possible because our connected business model was able to provide an attractive solution to an unmet need or unresolved problem this is the beauty of what we have with the connected business model nobody in the us can do what we do nobody has all the required elements our number one brand our strong position in the market the right fitments with original equipment manufacturers our outstanding product portfolio our unmatched aligned distribution including tirehub and our third party retail and wholesale distribution and our industry leading e commerce platform and nobody has the ability to connect them the way we do this is what creates competitive advantage in the marketplace this is why oems dealers distributors and consumers want to do business with us now and will continue to do business with us as the mobility revolution unfolds we can deliver them something that they can t get anywhere else this is what allows us to separate ourselves in those segments of the market where want to play and win as we continue strengthening our connected business model i am confident we will be positioned to deliver results that meet and exceed our previous peak performance through the cycle now i ll turn the call over to darren darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you rich and good morning everyone i ll begin my remarks with a couple of reflections on the quarter first i think you ll find that the factors that shaped our first quarter performance which is largely consistent with the drivers we discussed as part of our year end conference call we did see a couple of slight shifts as the us replacement industry was stronger than we had planned and the replacement industry in europe was weaker second i d say that overall nothing we ve seen during the first quarter has fundamentally changed the way we re thinking about full year 2019 having said that we ve continued to take action to build our long term fundamentals including the modernization and restructuring plans we ve announced in germany which we expect to benefit our earnings next year turning to slide 12 our first quarter sales were 3 6 billion down 6 from last year reflecting the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower volume partially offset by improvements in price mix unit volume contracted 3 driven by an 8 decline in consumer oe shipments the global consumer oe environment continued to be challenging during the quarter particularly in our asia pacific region due to weak demand in china and india light vehicle production also declined in europe and the americas replacement shipments were relatively stable with weakness in emea and asia pacific largely offset by growth in the americas asia pacific s performance was driven by weak consumer replacement shipments in china european consumer replacement demand was also soft driven by difficult winter tire comparisons and a slow start to the summer selling season robust growth in the us consumer replacement market drove the increase in the americas segment operating income for the quarter was 190 million down about 90 million from a year ago and slightly better than we expected primarily reflecting improvements in cost performance our results were influenced by certain significant items most notably charges relating to the restructuring plan we announced in germany adjusting for these items earnings per share on a diluted basis was 0 19 the step chart on slide 13 summarizes the change in segment operating income versus last year the impact of lower volume was largely offset by improved overhead absorption from increased production in q4 in the americas and europe middle east africa raw material cost increased 137 million reflecting higher commodity prices transactional currency headwinds and an increase in non feedstock cost related to stricter enforcement of environmental regulations in china we delivered 42 million of price mix improvements as we benefited from our recent pricing actions and improving supply in the americas cost savings of 55 million more than offset 45 million of inflation inflationary headwinds were the strongest in emea particularly in emerging markets there the negative effects of foreign currency translation totaled 14 million the other category includes benefits from lower advertising expense and reduced start up costs at our new americas plant which were partially offset by weaker results from other tire related businesses including us chemical operations turning to the balance sheet on slide 14 net debt totaled 5 6 billion up from 5 billion at year end primarily reflecting the seasonal build of working capital as a side note in january we adopted the new lease accounting standard which requires substantially all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet to this end we recognize liabilities reflecting our operating lease obligations and corresponding assets to account for the right of use of the underlying assets this change does not have a significant impact on our net income cash flow or book equity our liquidity profile remains strong with approximately 3 5 billion in cash and available credit at the end of the quarter in march we refinanced our principal revolving credit facility in europe extending its maturity to 2024 given the favorable loan market conditions we increased the size of the facility by eur250 million and reduced the margin by 25 basis points with this refinancing complete we have no significant maturities until 2021 slide 15 summarizes our cash flows net cash used by operating activities was 364 million which is in line with last year s first quarter usage as lower restructuring payments helped to offset lower earnings and higher working capital turning to our segment results on slide 16 americas volume of 16 7 million units was stable versus 2018 replacement shipments were very strong in the us and canada this growth offset declines in our us consumer oe business and in several countries in latin america that continue to experience economic volatility including brazil segment operating income was 89 million down 38 million from last year the decline was driven by increased raw material costs reduced earnings from third party chemical sales and unfavorable foreign currency translation these factors were partially offset by better price mix improved overhead absorption and lower start up costs associated with our new americas plan last quarter we reported supply constraints affecting our results in the americas these constraints were driven by a combination of stronger than expected demand trends in the second and third quarters of 2018 which reduced our safety stocks as well as lower production resulting from increasing manufacturing complexities and poor performance in a couple of our us factories although we have more work to do we ve made progress on supply in the first quarter and we were able to reduce our order backlog turning to slide 17 europe middle east and africa s unit sales totaled 14 4 million down about 2 5 from the prior year the volume decline primarily reflects weakness in the consumer replacement business as shipments fell 4 driven by decreases in less than 17 inch rims sizes consumer oe shipments decreased 1 these declines in the consumer business more than offset strength in the commercial shipments emea s strong commercial truck business reflects the benefits of favorable freight trends and the momentum of our fleet services offering segment operating income for emea was 54 million a 24 million decrease from last year the decline was mainly due to higher raw material costs inflation including higher transportation costs and lower volume partially offset by improvements in price mix turning to slide 18 asia pacific volume declined 9 to 6 9 million units reflecting the challenging industry environment in china where our combined consumer oe and replacement volume declined over 15 weak consumer oe volume in india was offset by double digit increase in consumer replacement shipments there segment operating income was 47 million a 29 million decrease from last year the decline was driven by higher raw material costs lower volume in china and lower fixed cost absorption these factors were partially offset by the benefit of cost controls on sag despite the challenging external environment we continue to build a strong foundation for long term growth in the asia pacific region including expanding our retail network and building our oe pipeline both of which will help us drive demand in a key growth markets of china and india as markets recover turning to slide 19 we ve reiterated the positives and negatives affecting our results in 2019 both sides of the ledger remained as we showed them in february we continue to expect raw material cost pressures of approximately 300 million for the year based on forecasted rates including an 80 million headwind in the second quarter i will point out however that our oe volume outlook while still negative has improved slightly trending toward the more favorable end of the range on slide 20 we show the puts and takes for the second quarter for each of our regions the americas will continue to be challenged by higher raw material costs and weaker results in our other tire related business primarily our us chemical operations given low butadiene prices improved overhead absorption is expected to offer a partial offset due to higher production volume in q1 once again emea s results will be influenced by weaker currency and higher inflation including increases in energy and transportation rates as well as general cost pressures in emerging markets emea s volume is also expected to decline principally due to lower consumer oe shipments resulting from strategic choices we made in previous years similar to the trends during the first quarter asia pacific s performance will be shaped by higher raw material cost and the impacts of weaker volume in china including higher unabsorbed overhead due to lower production levels in the first quarter on slide 22 we provide an updated industry outlook for the us and western europe we ve adjusted our expectations for the us commercial replacement industry to reflect the sharp decline in commercial tire imports during the first quarter this volatility affects the reported commercial replacement sell in figures but it is not a reflection of sell through trends in the market which remain constructive we also increased our expectations for commercial oe industry shipments in western europe to reflect healthy truck production there we list other key financial assumptions for 2019 on slide 23 we increased our forecast for interest expense to approximately 350 million from the prior range of 325 million to 350 million as we ve seen increases in certain emerging market interest rates the other estimates are unchanged from the view we presented in february the last point i want to cover is the factory restructurings announced in europe which lay the path for a significant improvement in our results in the emea these plants pair our modernization investments with cost reductions in our hanau and fulda plants in germany the equipment upgrades will take place over a period of approximately three years and require capital investments of approximately 120 million and cash restructuring will total about 125 million the benefit of reduced headcount will ultimately improve segment operating income by 60 million to 70 million on annualized basis and the investment will enable improved margins as we shift 2 5 million units from less than 17 inch to 17 inch or greater in rim diameter the plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 as is the case with these projects our focus continues to be on the steps we can take to improve our momentum and we remain confident our actions will not only support earnings recovery in the near term but also enable new highs over the coming years now we ll open up the line for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions today s first question will come from rod lache with wolfe research please go ahead richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president good morning rod rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst good morning everybody i guess my main question is just i was hoping you could just characterize pricing conditions in north america and wanted to ask you whether you think it s time to reexamine pricing just given the recent raw material price increases plus the fact that you really haven t fully recovered everything that you lost in terms of the spread over the past two years richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah so rod it is an ongoing matter for us to look at what we need to do in order to recover the lost margins that we ve experienced from the increased raw material costs over the last couple of years and it s something we re confident we ll be able to do over time i think if we look at where we were in the first quarter we were able to we achieved price mix of 42 million which compares to 35 million in q4 and negative numbers for several quarters before that so i think we feel like we re making progress and in particular it was good for us to see price mix in the americas turned positive after having slightly negative in q4 so in the americas we ve got good momentum on price and we ve got mix improving as we enter q2 and this is at the same time when raw material year over year raw material cost increases are getting a little more moderate so that s a good combination so that i mean that s kind of how we feel about the americas in just to hit on europe and asia pacific i think where we have good momentum on pricing in the americas not as clear in emea and asia pacific as price mix in q1 for both of them was a little lower than q4 so there s some seasonality in it for the emea business but i think it s fair to say the momentum there is not as good as this in the americas but overall i think i mean we feel like we re making progress we re still working toward that crossover point where we can start to recover the loss margins that we ve experienced from rising raw materials i didn t include the cyclical price versus raw materials chart in today s deck it hadn t really changed very much as you can as you might imagine but we will come back to that later in the year to do a progress check and to talk some more about that but that s obviously an ongoing point of focus for us rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst maybe i could just ask this a little bit differently what would be the key metrics or indicators that you would analyze to determine that the time is right to implement additional pricing richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president rod i don t think i ll jump in i don t think they re a lot different than what we ve done in the past it s a combination of where our input the change in our input costs and we go as well as other market conditions that are relevant to each of the particular areas that we deal with so i don t think the things that we look at are going to be any different it s going to be the environment and it s also going to be we ve said this consistently in the past and we believe this and darren just said it again that we believe we can recover over time not just on market conditions and input costs but also the value we re putting out in the marketplace whether it s a new products that we put out and we highlighted again of where our product portfolio is that s an opportunity for us to continue to go back and look at what we can offer in the marketplace and the price at which we re offering it so we look at our portfolio we look at the services we re providing and we look at the value we re bringing around all the programs whether it be advertising whether it be some of the distribution programs we have whether it be some of the new products all those type of things that we bring to market are all things that go into the mix of what we do rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst okay and just lastly could you just remind us in north america how big is your truck and bus radial tire business and has there been any benefit to you since the us obviously implemented some pretty significant tariffs starting february 15th richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president so rod when you re asking about the commercial truck tire business you re just asking for the relative size of the business rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst yeah the relative size to you right the size to you within the north america business and obviously a lot of tires imported from china in that segment maybe it s more lower end but i think the tariffs are like 40 or something like that on those imports is that something that richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst you re seeing as a positive is it domestic manufacture richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah you re really just trying to get the you re trying to get the tariff impact more than anything else rod is that that s kind of where you re going with it rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst well presumably not much direct tariff impact for you but maybe richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president right rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst indirect richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president right yeah yeah so rod i think the size of the business just use the overall size we use in north america to for the total business is relative to north america as well as we look at it so and i think you re right i mean i ll kind of i ll jump to the end and maybe add a little bit more color but our focus is typically on the oe s and the fleets and that s between our product and product performance as well as our fleet solutions and proactive solutions our brand technology and those type of things is what drives our business as opposed to the low end but as we look at it there is now as you know a 4 standard tariff in place as we look at it then there s a 10 section if i get a little technical section 301 tariff that went into effect in the middle of 2018 and the increase to 25 as you may remember was supposed to occur at the start of the year that s been delayed and then also there was the itc announced the anti dumping and countervailing duties that went into effect in mid february and those amounts can differ by company as you probably know but the combined sort of effective rate for most manufacturers call it between 42 to 45 and those rates that are applied to the import price of those tires coming in so as an example a standard sort of commercial truck tire coming in from china on average is about import value about 120 so the importer of record would need to pay approximately an incremental call it 70 to cover all the duties so that s sort of how to think about the tariffs coming in remember for us nearly all our commercial truck tires that we sell in the us are made in the us and they re made to support that business model that we spoke of so clearly it has an impact there darren made reference to that in his formal remarks about what it does to the industry but our focus is going to continue to remain on where we add value to our customers in the oe s and the fleets rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst okay great so it sounds like you re seeing some benefit i guess in a nutshell just given what s happening competitively there richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah i think we re at a point where the it s an industry that is in good shape and we ve got a very competitive offering so i think commercial truck business is a strength for us right now rod avraham lache wolfe research analyst okay great thank you richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president thanks rob operator we ll take our next question from john healy with northcoast research please go ahead john michael healy northcoast research partners llc analyst hi thank you richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president good morning john john michael healy northcoast research partners llc analyst good morning guys i wanted to ask a big picture question when i think about everything that s going on operationally i feel like there s two sides of the coin you ve got the us business where you ve made some pretty significant moves in terms of changing distribution and exciting launch in june with the e commerce on the commercial truck side and then if you go over to europe and it seems like you guys are really digging in on the operations in terms of being effective with your production and production capabilities as you look at those two things do you see things in europe that you can bring to the us maybe in 2020 on the production side and then do you see things in the us on the distribution side that you can take to europe in 2020 and i guess the way i m asking this is at some point over the next two years do you see yourself pivoting where you take lessons learned and try to implement those across the state back and forth and can the business look like in the us what you re building can that be the model in europe and then vice versa on the production side richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah so john i think it s reasonable to look at what we ve done in terms of distribution in the us and think that that is going to be instructive for the way we want to approach align distribution in other parts of the world and we are and we we are thinking about what it takes to establish that level of alignment in other markets where we operate so i think it s fair those are changes that take place tend to take place over extended periods of time so your specific question was about 2020 the work that we ve done in distribution in north america has taken place over many years so there was no tirehub was a significant event but there was a lot of work done over a long period of time that led up to that so i think directionally we are looking to develop that level of alignment in other markets but those changes take some time to accomplish in terms of production certainly our european factories have had a longer have had a lot of experience with high levels of product complexity and skew proliferation so i think inevitably there are some lessons that can be shared and i think we look at our manufacturing programs on a global basis so our plant optimization program including the efforts that we re undergoing to address any sort of constraints that we have on producing the type and variety of skews that we re now being asked to produce those are learnings that we share globally and to the extent we have factories that have greater levels of experience then we re going to leverage those learnings and we are going to try to share those around the globe so i think both the points you make are relevant points john michael healy northcoast research partners llc analyst okay fair enough and then i wanted to ask about one of the comments in the slides it comes out of me as you guys gone up building a strong oe pipeline for 2020 and beyond can you maybe talk to if that s us if that s europe is it new partners maybe potentially how meaningful that can be relative to the performance you ve seen in 2018 and then the start of 2019 richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah i think john how i would look at it is really on a continuum and you ve heard us talk about this in the past is having a selectivity strategy where we ve been very thoughtful about the portfolio and where it was and where we wanted to take it and i would tell you to think of what we re doing now is very much in line with that we ve been on that journey and we will continue to be on it to make sure we re getting on the right fitments and have the right pull with the right partners going forward and what you ve seen is certainly a lot of decisions to move away from products and pull replacement pull that wasn t there to improve our business and to be able to get our cost structure in line to do that as we look ahead i would say that this is not region specific i think it s company specific i m very pleased with the oe fitments and the win rates that we re having in the americas including latin america in europe as well as in asia in asia particularly both china and india where we re having a very successful win rates in getting on the fitments we want and that means not only a particular country platforms but global platforms and it means av s and it means a lot of unique tires and characteristics that those manufacturers want not for the vehicles that we re seeing on the road today but as they re thinking about where those platforms are going forward so we re having i am very pleased with the success we re having on win rates and i m even more pleased with the partnerships that we re having with those individual oems to work together on bringing those vehicles to market darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so if i can john michael healy northcoast research partners llc analyst okay darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer john if i could just add one thing because again you were focused on the year that the benefits might begin i do we did we had a question on the year end conference call when we were talking about the 2 million to 3 million units of oe volume that we expected to reduce this year because of selections that we had made in our portfolio and there have been a question about whether or not that loss oe volume was going to be something that would go on for several years and i think we want to keep making the point that while we re our oe volume is expected to decline this year and now probably closer to 2 million and 3 million units we ve won fitment that s going to start to bring that volume back and in a significant way beginning in 2020 so we don t see that oe decline in terms of our fitments as a long term thing it really is it s principally a 2019 thing and we ll recover thereafter richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah that s a good point darren our pipeline to get those tires out is full right now so we re feeling good john michael healy northcoast research partners llc analyst great thank you guys richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah operator we ll take our next question from ryan brinkman with j p morgan please go ahead richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president hi ryan ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst thanks for taking my question hi richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president sure ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst regarding the german plant modernization and restructuring program should we think about this more as an lva to hva type conversion that is aimed at benefiting mix or is it more of a cost reduction action and what are your latest thoughts generally on cost saves versus general inflation i think there has been some anticipation you might be set to pull additional levers to try to ramp cost saves back up to the level of recent years now where are you in that process is germany part of it and when might we expect to learn more richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president okay so ryan let me i m going to ask answer your last question first regarding cost savings versus inflation and the i think we were pleased to see that in the first quarter we were we had cost savings that exceeded inflation by 10 million and that was after a fourth quarter where if we exclude the one time settlement we had on brazil vat which was a benefit in terms of cost savings in the fourth quarter if we exclude that fourth quarter inflation and savings we re about equal now in the first quarter we ve gotten some net savings which i think we re pleased about and is part of what delivered earnings a little bit better than we might have been expecting in q1 the cost inflation issue though is still very much in front of us so our cost savings programs are going to have to ramp up we ve kept a lot of attention in that area but inflation is continuing to build i think particularly in emea particularly in emerging markets we re feeling that and it s going to be a struggle for us this year to deliver net savings i mean that s kind of that s where we ve been it hasn t really changed we re one quarter in and we delivered a little bit more than we had originally expected i think that s good we re going to stay focused there it s no question but not at the level of net savings what we that we really like to see if i come back to the german restructuring i think the way you phrased your question is right on the mark because you are separating the two different aspects of this project and there are two aspects because first we are reducing some high cost capacity that s no longer capable of producing tires that are in highest demand and that s the element of it you would think of as a restructuring and rather than taking reducing capacity by i mean between the two factories we are in fact reducing high cost capacity by the equivalent of about one factory so it s half of each of two factories but we re kind of taking out that level of high cost capacity and then second there s an investment in new equipment that s going to allow us to produce 2 5 million units of additional high value added tires or 17 inch and above rim diameter tires and that is similar to some other upgrade projects and expansion projects that we ve done so i think that s really the way i think about it is we re going to take out a significant high cost a part of the high cost footprint that s no longer capable and then we re going to add that 2 5 million units as a capex project and we re going to get benefits from each one of those the benefit the strict benefit from the restructuring from the approximately 1 100 headcount reduction is the 60 million to 70 million so we re going to get that benefit we ll get that over time so over the next three years and then there will be the additional benefit which is the added margin on the 2 5 million incremental high value units so that s a mix up benefit that we re going to get over about that same timeframe now that there s about 120 million of capital expenditures that go into that so we ve got 125 million of cash restructuring 120 million of capex and what we get from that is 60 million to 70 million of cost savings plus the added margin on those 2 5 million of high value added tires ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst i see thanks for all the great color and then just lastly from me i think it s encouraging that you are gaining share in the us consumer replacement market including after the price increases in the back half of 2018 maybe you can talk about the role that tirehub if any may have played in improving share i m curious to know also though if you think that you took that much price in the back half of 2018 as did your average competitor or if maybe you elected to invest in a little bit more competitive price point to try to recover some of that share that was lost when maybe you were in retrospect being too assertive in raising price in 2017 richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah i mean i ll jump in i would say our value proposition in the fourth quarter was what i thought and what we thought was appropriate for the markets at the time so i think i would i d leave it at that in terms of how we went to market we were very pleased in the fourth quarter coming out of the fourth quarter in terms of how we were set up in the market and i think you saw that coming to q1 i think you re rightly pointed out we were i think as darren mentioned in his remarks we were 6 up in the quarter in the us market i think that s reflective of that value proposition i talked about great products in the marketplace new products in the marketplace and a strong demand out there and as we look at it from overall we saw market prices sort of trending higher in the quarter year over year and sequentially and again as you said our revenue per tire was up our volume was up our market share was up and that comes off of the situations that we had in 2017 as well as 2018 with tirehub so i m very pleased with the way that we ve worked through that and i might add we don t see any sort of broad evidence that any inventory is really building up in the channel remember sell out has been good vehicle miles traveled is good consumer confidence is good so the industry is pretty good and from our perspective our inventories are certainly in relatively good shape at both the wholesale and retail level so we feel pretty good about that and in terms of tirehub tirehub is doing what we intended to do right this is we started it last year we did that as part of our initiative overall to drive our aligned distribution with our aligned partners to support our delivery of tires in the marketplace to support the initiatives that we re putting out there it s doing just that we exceeded our transition plans last year yes we ve had some bumps in the road but we continue to build momentum we haven t lost thee customer and we re executing against those customer deliveries so and as i mentioned inventories are in good shape and we re actually operating with less inventory that our previous national distributor had and we re doing that getting better visibility into the demand trends and consumer preferences that are out there so i think wouldn t attribute everything to certainly the tirehub based on our first quarter volume i think that s a lot of things but tirehub certainly is doing what we intended it to do darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i d add to that rich is that while there were certainly an effort early in 2018 to go back and get the volume and the market share that we have lost in 2017 when our pricing got out of phase with the rest of the industry so i think that happened but if i look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter i would say that our pricing momentum there was strong and the i think and we have talked about this at the fourth quarter call we had good pricing momentum in the americas but we had negative mix some of that related to the supply situation there is still a bit of that in the first quarter right so we re still looking to get to the point where we start to get some benefit from mix because the last couple of quarters mix in fact has been a bit of a drag and is hiding some of the benefit of the pricing that we ve got richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president no and darren that s a great point and maybe i d add one final comment is just to say we put tirehub we started tirehub sort of the middle of 2018 a big decision for us to do particularly coming off of 2017 as we described and you re seeing that momentum now come back into 2019 i d say it s just a view that we do that strategy we have long term is something we re committed to and we re executing against ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst very helpful thank you operator we ll take the next question from armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley please go ahead richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president hi armintas armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst good morning thank you for taking the question question around raw materials last quarter you said that the guidance was for 300 million of headwind in 2019 versus 2018 based on forecasted rates but it would be 150 million of a headwind based on spot rates it looks like raw materials have been holding in fairly well since then but the raw materials guidance is still at minus 300 million so just wondering about the puts and takes anything we might be missing there richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president sure armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst as to why we re not seeing a tailwind to raw materials versus prior commentary darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer no good question and as you point out our forecast has not changed and when we did our call in february spot prices at that point would have implied if they stayed where it was would have implied 150 million less costs than we were forecasting as we expected feedstock costs have actually risen over the last 60 days and that is true and natural rubber certainly it s true in carbon black obviously a little bit of the effect of oil prices rising over that period of time at today s commodity and prices and also taking into account some further strengthening of the us dollar what today s spot prices would imply is about 50 million below the 300 million forecasts that we have so the picture at spot prices gotten 100 million worse than it was 60 days ago so i guess we re still at a point where we believe the 300 million cost increase is the right assumption for the year because we re still expecting it still expecting a little bit further increase it s embedded in our forecast if it doesn t happen obviously that 50 million of good news would still be there but i think we re feeling like we ve done the right thing given that we ve seen what we were expecting to see armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst okay appreciate it thank you for the clarification darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer sure richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll take our next question from david tamberrino with goldman sachs please go ahead david j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc analyst great richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president good morning david david j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc analyst good morning guys two questions for you just the back and forth a couple of questions does it sound like is what i m hearing there s potentially less pricing action on the horizon or are we on a wait and see mode given how the market shaping up from an oe consumer replacement demand and supply in the market richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah so i think that what we re seeing right now is yeah in terms of price mix is good is really good momentum in the americas so i think headed the right direction there a little bit more of a mixed picture in europe yeah so in europe we ve seen for the summer season we ve seen some manufacturers raise price we ve seen other manufacturers lower price so kind of a mixed situation there and obviously the situation in china is that improves it may change but right now very weak markets there and that s having an impact so i do think there are some regional differences there with the north american market probably being in the best position so but i don t i think our intentions are to recover the cost of raws over time and we ve got a ways to go before we achieve that so it s a constant area of focus for us david j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc analyst okay and then my second one which i feel like is probably the key question for you for this year because if i m not mistaken your guide or your directional commentary was for soi to be down slightly somewhat from 2018 to 2019 and i look at the free cash flow ttm look at where you were at for 2018 just trying to get a sense of if you think darren that 2019 you re going to be able to achieve a positive free cash flow and if not just assume you ll continue to fund the dividend from the balance sheet and cash darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah no so david i think that i continue to be comfortable that the level of earnings where we re running today that we re in a position to fund the investments we re making in the business which are principally some restructuring in our capex plan and cover the dividend without increasing our leverage and that s the balance that we are focused on we are clearly focused on protecting the balance sheet and we so we ve taken actions to make sure that we re doing that our leverage ratios are up and that is to some degree cyclical and related to where earnings are but we re very focused on making sure that we re not increasing our debt levels so we ve taken some discrete actions there including discontinuing the share repurchases but we re also taking operational actions including a lot of focus on working capital to look at opportunities to improve our balance sheet and then obviously as the cycle turns and earnings and cash flow improve we ll be looking to take advantage of that to further improve the balance sheet david j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc analyst understood but for this year i mean you re expecting positive free cash flow mostly as less capex darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think we i am comfortable that we ll be able to cover our dividend payment if that s the question david j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc analyst it s like part of the question just darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah david j tamberrino goldman sachs group inc analyst wanted to get your sense but ok thank you very much darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator we ll take our final question today from anthony deem with longbow please go ahead richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president hey anthony darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer hi anthony anthony j deem longbow research llc analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions first one fixed cost absorption so 80 million positive in the quarter you ve had lower volumes in the past couple of quarters so i m just wondering is tirehub product or regional mix maybe the americas plant just having a meaningfully positive impact on your overhead absorption and certainly next quarter looks like you re guiding to a positive outcome in the americas segment but you have seen flat or down volume in the past couple of quarters so just wondering if you could share anything potentially abnormal going on this line item richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president that s specific to overhead absorption anthony j deem longbow research llc analyst yeah richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah okay so i think we that s a good question because we do have in an environment where our volume has been down we ve got favorable overhead absorption which i think is makes it a very natural question our i think though as we look at a lot of the volume decline has been asia pacific and our production the reduced production has principally been in the asia pacific and that s our overhead for tire is the lowest there so we ve had our hot our production has been actually up in the americas and emea notwithstanding the volume and part of that s been trying to catch up with our supply situation in the americas and it s been up and it s been up the most in commercial truck so it s been up in some areas that have the highest overhead absorption so there s a bit of a mix among geographies that s benefiting us there the so i think that is really what you re seeing and i think we ll continue to see a bit of that so that s the question now you asked the question also about the increased production in our new americas factory and obviously we re getting some benefit as that ramps up as well anthony j deem longbow research llc analyst okay that s helpful thanks for the color and so on the supply constraints update so it looks like you did 12 hva growth in the us this past quarter and you took some share so i guess the question we re wondering is what could those numbers be without some of these supply constraints are you able to put a value or unit number toward that richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah so i think two i mean two benefits that we would get if we were able to supply better certainly we would have opportunity for those numbers to be higher because we re not supplying all the high value tires that we would be able to supply and to be clear that s true in the consumer business also true in the commercial truck business and the 12 you re referring to that s only consumer business point but the same effect is true in the commercial truck business so you would see that the other thing that it would help us with is it would help us supply all of our customers where we do have some customers who have first claim on supply and obviously the oes are the clearest example of that but we have replacement customers who also have sort of a first call on our supply and they re not always our highest margin customers and that s been one of the challenges we have in achieving mix is that we are selling more tires to some of our lower margin customers and we will be able to supply some of our higher margin customers better if we can get supply situation in a better spot anthony j deem longbow research llc analyst i can ask one question more here so advertising r d sort of the other category in soi walk net benefit in the quarter it looks like so is it fair to assume i know you re not giving explicit guidance but i m wondering if it s fair to assume if these were main tailwinds remaining of the year perhaps this is just the savings lever that goodyear at this point thank you very much darren wells executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think the fact that we re very cost focused i think shouldn t be a surprise i will say that there are when it comes to advertising there are some differences quarter to quarter so i don t know that i would look at first quarter as a clear indicator of where we re going to be in the full year the timing of product launches and some of our marketing pushes can change and if in fact we start to see some recovery in some of our markets in the second half that would have an impact on the investment we d be making in marketing advertising and sag so i guess i don t read too much into one quarter but i think it is fair to say that we re going to stay very very focused on costs for the foreseeable future richard j kramer chairman chief executive officer and president yeah and all i would add is over time i think we ve demonstrated a very good sort of decision making and timing of capex and r d as we go through the cycle so you would expect to do the same we ll make good decisions but we re no less committed to our particularly you mentioned our r d expense that remains a priority for us but i would say we manage it very well in terms of prioritizing and executing our projects and i believe that was the last call so i just want to thank everyone for your attention today thanks very much operator and this will conclude today s program thanks for your participation you may now disconnect duration 62 minutes call participants operator nicholas mitchell senior director investor relations richard j kramer chairman chief

marchés financiers and annual report on form 20 f filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec financial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows internal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of total in addition to ifrs measures certain alternative performance indicators are presented such as performance indicators excluding the adjustment items described below adjusted operating income adjusted net operating income adjusted net income return on equity roe return on average capital employed roace and gearing ratio these indicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance of total and the comparison of income between periods they allow investors to track the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of the group these adjustment items include i special items due to their unusual nature or particular significance certain transactions qualified as special items are excluded from the business segment figures in general special items relate to transactions that are significant infrequent or unusual however in certain instances transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals which are not considered to be representative of the normal course of business may be qualified as special items although they may have occurred within prior years or are likely to occur again within the coming years ii inventory valuation effect the adjusted results of the refining chemicals and marketing services segments are presented according to the replacement cost method this method is used to assess the segments performance and facilitate the comparability of the segments performance with those of its competitors in the replacement cost method which approximates the lifo last in first out method the variation of inventory values in the statement of income is depending on the nature of the inventory determined using either the month end price differentials between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value the inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results according to the fifo first in first out and the replacement cost iii effect of changes in fair value the effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects for some transactions differences between internal measures of performance used by total s management and the accounting for these transactions under ifrs ifrs requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period end spot prices in order to best reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions internal indicators used to measure performance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices furthermore total in its trading activities enters into storage contracts whose future effects are recorded at fair value in group s internal economic performance ifrs precludes recognition of this fair value effect the adjusted results adjusted operating income adjusted net operating income adjusted net income are defined as replacement cost results adjusted for special items excluding the effect of changes in fair value euro amounts presented for the fully adjusted diluted earnings per share

condition results of operations business strategy and plans of total these data do not represent forecasts within the meaning of european regulation no 809 2004 such forward looking information and statements included in this document are based on a number of economic data and assumptions made in a given economic competitive and regulatory environment they may prove to be inaccurate in the future and are subject to a number of risk factors that could lead to a significant difference between actual results and those anticipated the price of petroleum products the ability to realize cost

marchés financiers and annual report on form 20 f filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec financial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows internal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of total in addition to ifrs measures certain alternative performance indicators are presented such as performance indicators excluding the adjustment items described below adjusted operating income adjusted net operating income adjusted net income return on equity roe return on average capital employed roace and gearing ratio these indicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance of total and the comparison of income between periods they allow investors to track the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of the group these adjustment items include i special items due to their unusual nature or particular significance certain transactions qualified as special items are excluded from the business segment figures in general special items relate to transactions that are significant infrequent or unusual however in certain instances transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals which are not considered to be representative of the normal course of business may be qualified as special items although they may have occurred within prior years or are likely to occur again within the coming years ii inventory valuation effect the adjusted results of the refining chemicals and marketing services segments are presented according to the replacement cost method this method is used to assess the segments performance and facilitate the comparability of the segments performance with those of its competitors in the replacement cost method which approximates the lifo last in first out method the variation of inventory values in the statement of income is depending on the nature of the inventory determined using either the month end price differentials between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value the inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results according to the fifo first in first out and the replacement cost iii effect of changes in fair value the effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects for some transactions differences between internal measures of performance used by total s management and the accounting for these transactions under ifrs ifrs requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period end spot prices in order to best reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions internal indicators used to measure performance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices furthermore total in its trading activities enters into storage contracts whose future effects are recorded at fair value in group s internal economic performance ifrs precludes recognition of this fair value effect the adjusted results adjusted operating income adjusted net operating income adjusted net income are defined as replacement cost results adjusted for special items excluding the effect of changes in fair value euro amounts presented for the fully adjusted diluted earnings per share

please try again later a boy walks past an oil tanker train stationed at a railway station in ghaziabad on the outskirts of new delhi india february 1 2019 reuters anushree fadnavis by manoj kumar and nidhi verma new delhi reuters surging global oil prices will pose a first big challenge to india s new government whoever wins an election now under way especially as domestic prices have been allowed to lag meaning consumers are in for a painful surge as they catch up for oil import dependent india higher global prices could lead to a weaker rupee higher inflation the ruling out of interest rate cuts and could further weigh on twin current account and budget deficits economists warned but compounding the future pain state run fuel suppliers and retailers have held off passing on to consumers the higher prices during a staggered general election which began on april 11 and ends on may 23 according to sources familiar with the situation that delay is expected to be unwound once the election is over and there could be additional price increases to make up for losses or profits missed during the period of delayed increases the sources said in some major asian countries such as japan and south korea pump prices are adjusted periodically so they move largely in tandem with international crude prices advertisement advertisement that was what was supposed to happen in india but the election means there have been many days when pump prices have been unchanged in new delhi for example while crude oil prices have gone up by nearly 9 a barrel or about 12 percent in the past six weeks gasoline prices have only risen by 0 47 rupees a litre or 0 6 percent state controlled fuel suppliers and retailers declined to say why they had delayed price increases or discuss whether there has been any pressure from the government of prime minister narendra modi a government spokesman declined to comment the opposition congress party said modi s government was violating its own policy of daily price revision by advising the state oil companies to hold prices steady advertisement advertisement the government should cut fuel taxes otherwise consumers will have to pay much higher oil prices once the elections are over said akhilesh pratap singh a senior leader of the congress party nitin goyal treasurer at the all india petroleum dealers association representing fuel stations in 25 states said prices were similarly held down for 19 days in the southern state of karnataka last year when it held state assembly elections story continues only for them to surge after the vote consumers should be ready for a rude shock of a massive jump in retail prices similar to the level we have seen in the karnataka state election goyal said credit negative sri paravaikkarasu director for asia oil at singapore based consultancy fge said retail prices of gasoline and gasoil prices would have been up to 6 percent or about 4 rupee higher if they had been allowed to rise in line with global prices indian pump prices have failed to keep up with the recent uptrend in crude prices paravaikkarasu said with the country s general elections underway the incumbent government has been keeping pump prices relatively unchanged advertisement advertisement india had switched to a daily price revision in june 2017 from a revision every two weeks as the government allowed retailers to set prices but the government faced protests last october when retailers raised prices by up to 10 rupees a litre after the crude oil price went above 80 a barrel forcing it to cut fuel taxes global prices rose to their highest level in 2019 on thursday days after the united states announced all iran sanction waivers would end by may pressuring importers including india to stop buying tehran s oil higher oil prices will mean asia s third largest economy is likely to see growth of less than 7 percent rate this fiscal year economists said growth slowed to 6 6 percent in the october december quarter the slowest in five quarters advertisement advertisement rating agency care has warned that a 10 percent rise in global oil prices could increase demand for dollars putting pressure on the rupee and widening the current account deficit india s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending march 31 to 140 5 billion against 108 billion the previous year the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy icra the indian arm of the fitch rating agency said in a note every 10 bbl increase in crude oil prices increases the fiscal deficit by about 0 1 percent of gdp advertisement advertisement any big price rise would also build a case for the central bank to keep rates steady or even raise them the reserve bank of india s monetary policy committee which cut the benchmark policy repo rate by 25 basis points this month warned that rising oil and food prices could push up inflation policymakers are worried that a sustained increase in the oil price in the range of 70 75 barrel or higher can move the rupee down by 3 4 percent on an annual basis the rupee has depreciated by 1 24 percent against the dollar since

photo depositphotos com mikemareen given the reer s importance for economic policy in the current trade discussions between the united states and china for example central banks and international financial institutions devote considerable resources to calculating and analyzing it but their methods have become outdated as global value chains gvcs become increasingly widespread we therefore recently proposed a new reer calculation with zhi wang that addresses the current shortcomings standard calculations of the reer by most central banks and statistical agencies assume that countries export only final goods but gvcs spread the different stages of production among different countries they can do so thanks to technological improvements lower trade barriers and the closer integration of emerging markets into the global economy ignoring this reality can lead to substantial mismeasurement of the reer resulting in questionable policy inferences to see how the standard approach could be wrong consider a hypothetical value chain for the production of smartphones suppose japan manufactures the components and ships them to china where the phones are assembled and exported globally as finished products traditional reer models would assume that japan exports final goods to china and that the two countries are competitors a depreciation of the japanese yen therefore would help japan s competitiveness and hurt that of china in this case however a weaker yen would lower the price of japanese components which may lead to lower prices and increased demand for chinese phones leading to an improvement in china s competitiveness this example shows that the standard reer calculation is getting not only the magnitude wrong but also the direction of change our proposed framework addresses these problems it also provides reer measures for individual sectors within a country this makes it possible to assess the competitiveness of different parts of the economy and to determine which sectors are the main drivers of the overall reer taking gvcs into account alters our understanding of china s bilateral real exchange rate against the us dollar china has increased its global trade footprint massively following its accession to the world trade organization in 2001 the us meanwhile has long blamed its rising current account deficit on the renminbi s allegedly undervalued exchange rate although china s gross exports to the us are sizeable china operates largely downstream in several gvcs this is exemplified in the production of smartphones and electronic goods as a result a large part of chinese exports represents value added embedded in parts and components from other countries besides china including a significant share coming from the us itself moreover us competitiveness relative to china depends more on prices in tradable sectors such as electronics than on those in non tradable parts of the economy like real estate but commonly used aggregate measures of the reer do not allow for these distinctions once these factors are taken into account our analysis shows that china s real exchange rate against the us dollar displays a pronounced and consistent appreciation trend by contrast the standard calculation shows a real depreciation of the renminbi in the period leading up to china s abandonment of its exchange rate peg in 2005 and then an exchange rate appreciation that is smaller than the traditionally measured one similarly for the eurozone our gvc exchange rate based measure implies that greece s loss of competitiveness or reer appreciation relative to germany was worse than the standard measure suggests and that greece s competitiveness in the period leading up to the eurozone crisis was thus worse this mismeasurement arose because the standard reer calculation was based on the extent to which germany s inflation rate differed from greece s but it underestimated the difference made by gvcs far from being a theoretical concept confined to economics textbooks the reer has significant real world relevance calculating it more accurately could reduce the risk of misguided economic policies and it may lead policymakers to reach some very different conclusions about which measures to pursue nikhil patel is an economist at the bank for international settlements shang jin wei a former chief economist of the asian development bank is professor of chinese business and economy and professor of finance and economics at columbia university project syndicate 1995 2019

insurance japan charles lake chairman and representative director president of aflac international masatoshi koide president and representative director todd daniels director and principal financial officer koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing before we start let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of federal securities laws although we believe these statements are reasonable we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today we encourage you to look at our annual report on form 10 k for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results the earnings release is available on the investors page of aflac s website at investors aflac com and includes reconciliations of certain non gaap measures i ll now hand the call over to dan dan daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer thank you david and good morning and thank you for joining us the first quarter of 2019 established a solid foundation as we set out to achieve our annual objectives let me give you more detailed beginning with japanese operation aflac japan our largest earnings contributor generated strong financial results that are in line with our expectations for the quarter for 2019 we continue to expect a slight decline in aflac japan s total earned premium primarily due to the limited pay policies reaching paid up status as you saw in the release third sector combined with first sector protection sales were down low single digit in the first quarter but generally in line with our expectations for the quarter our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success as do our alliance partners while cancer insurance sales were up for the quarter with strength in our associates channel results were weaker at japan post as they achieved their 2018 fiscal year targets early both daido and dai ichi increased cancer sales in the final quarter of the japanese fiscal year as for medical sales we ve focused on riders in the medical area to retain and attract new customers with mid term riders policyholders can update their existing medical coverage by adding a rider to their existing policy they also have the option to purchase a new policy with an income support rider targeting young and middle aged segment or nursing rider designed for the middle to older age groups while this strategy is effective in driving better overall economics in earned premium it s less beneficial to the sales versus replacement of the whole policy as you know we take a longer term perspective looking forward to the remainder of the year let me just say that we anticipate making our annual sales objective last year beginning in the second quarter we had a very successful launch of our new cancer insurance product which drove a 16 increase and third sector sales for the second quarter 2018 this makes a very difficult comparison we want to make sure you understand that we expect third sector and first sector protection combined sales to be down in the high teens in the second quarter of 19 this means that we expect those sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits having said that though we anticipate a strong second half and more importantly we expect to achieve our annual sales of objective of a mid single digit decline in the third sector and first sector protection sales for the year ultimately our focus remains on maintaining our leadership in the third sector products while complementing this core business with similarly profitable first sector protection products to that end we will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new products that our policyholders want and need and where they will want to purchase them finally with respect to japan post in our launch you may recall that at the end of february we announced in the filing that japan post holdings formed a trust that permits the trustees to purchase aflac incorporated shares we continue to anticipate the completion of the regulatory approvals in the second half of 2019 as we have mentioned previously we view 2019 as more of a year of planning around opportunities for aflac in japan post holding companies to collaborate when i was in tokyo last month i met with the ceo of japan post holdings along with the senior executives of both companies we had very productive meetings to work toward areas that are mutually beneficial to both parties as we told you 2019 is a year of planning and 2020 will be more of an execution on our plans turning to aflac us our revenues increased 2 2 at the same time pre tax earnings continued to reflect ongoing investments in our platform distribution and customer experience us sales were up 1 5 which was in line with our expectations for the quarter aflac is unique with respect to our peers and as the majority of our sales comes from independent sales agents we are fortunate to be representative by such a strong field force which is truly distinctive within our industry these independent career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to assess and therefore succeed with smaller employers in groups with fewer than 100 employees aflac agents have always enhanced their collaboration with local and regional brokers as we continue to grow broker sales while our team of broker sales professionals has taken and made great strides in enhancing our relationship with the large broker community brokers have recognized more and more that their clients need the types of products aflac offers this is increased the appeal and therefore the interest in doing business with aflac with the continued growth of our broker business our sales have been increasingly skewed toward fourth quarter with the continued growth of the broker business and we expect 2019 to be no different we were also pleased with the continued improvement in productivity in the quarter at the same time net earned premium rose 2 4 and we continue to expect aflac us to deliver solid results in 2019 with earned premium growth in the 2 to 3 range ultimately we believe the investments we ve made in our distribution and customer experience will promote increased productivity stable persistency and improved long term economics while fred will address capital deployment in more details we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our bondholders shareholders and policyholders at the same time we re balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business increasing the dividend and repurchasing our shares through aflac incorporated subsidiaries in japan and the united states we have the privilege of helping provide financial protection to more than 50 million people in both countries we have earned our position as the leading supplemental insurer by paying cash fast when our policyholders get sick or injured looking ahead we believe that our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in japan and the united states it will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders at the same time it will reflect our dedication to delivering on the promises that we made to our policyholders now i will turn the program over to fred to cover the financial results fred frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you dan we are off to a strong start to the year on the earnings front as results for the quarter exceeded our expectations adjusted earnings of 1 12 per share benefited from strong margins both in japan and the us our reported results were modestly impacted by a weakening of the yen as compared to the 2018 period reducing our earnings by approximately 0 01 per share in the quarter the quarter s adjusted effective tax rate of 25 5 includes the tax treatment of equity compensation under gaap that contributed roughly 0 01 to our adjusted earnings per share when normalized our effective tax rate of 26 3 came in as expected and represents a blended rate based on our current mix of japan earnings tax at 28 and us earnings tax at 21 turning to our japan segment results earned premium for our third sector products increased 1 8 and in line with our expectations with continued headwinds from paid up first sector products overall earned premium growth was down nearly 1 in the quarter as we move through the year the earned premium impact from paid up policies will remain stable the first sector ways paid up impact will gradually reduce throughout 2019 however a portion of our medical sales in 2017 was a newly introduced two pay product which was popular in the bank channel and will have a slight impact to third sector earned premium growth for the remainder of 2019 overall it s important to note that this strain to the top line does not impact profitability our total benefit ratio came in at 69 1 and at the lower end of our annual guidance range driven by a favorable third sector benefit ratio and the continued shift in business mix from first sector toward third sector which carries a lower benefit ratio our expense ratio in japan was 20 2 consistent with our projected range while year over year our expense ratio increased expenses came in below our forecast due to the timing of sales promotions and lower dac expense as lapse experience was better than expected our expense ratio outlook for the year remains in the range of 19 5 to 21 5 net investment income in our japan segment contributed to our strong results while no one area drove the outperformance continued favorable returns in our floating rate loan portfolio modestly lower hedge costs and variable income from our building alternative investment portfolio contributed to results overall in japan we recorded a very strong pre tax profit margin of 21 9 with all key earnings drivers coming in better than our forecast turning to the us results earned premium was up a steady 2 4 our total benefit ratio came in at 49 3 at the lower end of our annual guidance range and generally consistent with recent claims trends and our mix of business our expense ratio in the us was 36 3 breaking down the expense ratio further dac amortization was elevated in the quarter reflecting natural growth mix of business and adjustments related to lapse experience in truing up previous estimates in terms of general operating expenses this quarter benefited from timing of spend which we expect to build throughout the year our expense ratio outlook for the year remains in the range of 35 to 37 net investment income performance was in line with expectations and reflects our continued movement of excess capital out of the us to the holding company in our corporate segment the main driver of improved earnings year over year is net investment income and amortized hedge income investment income benefited from the movement of capital and increased liquidity at the holding company our corporate hedging program reduces our economic exposure to the yen while lowering enterprise wide hedge costs amortized hedge income contributed 20 million on a pre tax basis to the quarter s earnings with a notional position of just over 2 5 billion as you may have noticed we have added disclosures in our financial supplement with additional detail on our corporate hedging program and associated amortized hedge income capital remains strong japan solvency margin ratio is estimated in the 950 range in april we issued jpy30 billion of hybrid debt out of our japan subsidiary which receives regulatory capital treatment at a very low cost of capital we estimate that this will contribute approximately 20 points to smr and is another example of financial flexibility stemming from the conversion of our aflac japan from a branch to a subsidiary our estimated us only risk based capital ratio at quarter end is now in the 700 range rbc is a bit elevated as we have planned increases in operating dividends and the drawdown of 500 million of excess capital scheduled for later this year as we target 500 we ended the quarter with nearly 2 5 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company asset quality remained strong with very little in the way of impairments in the quarter following a solid recovery in pricing we elected to sell our entire 146 million position in pg e realizing a small gain in the quarter we had previously impaired our position in the fourth quarter by 21 million in the quarter we repurchased 10 2 million shares for approximately 490 million this amount was elevated as we tactically accelerated repurchase early in the quarter we are maintaining our current range for repurchase of 1 3 billion to 1 7 billion in 2019 in closing we re off to a solid start both in japan and in the us and i ll now hand the call over to david to begin q a session david david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations thank you fred before we take your questions let me just ask you to please limit yourself to one initial question and a follow up you can always get back in the queue and we ll now take the first question operator questions and answers operator thank you first question is from the line of john barnidge of sandler o neill you may now ask your question john barnidge sandler o neill analyst yeah so productivity in the us was rather strong for a 1q what do you see as a driver for this and these digital investments that you re making already yielding in if that s what the driver of productivity is can you maybe talk about some examples teresa l white president of aflac us well i ll start off this is teresa what we re seeing if yes so the digital investments are assisting us with especially on the broker side of the business with enrollment tools that allow to be more productive on that side of the business we re also seeing additional productivity based on product offerings as portfolio offerings that we have if you recall we introduced some life products and we expanded our portfolio with our life and disability to help us to improve some of the be able to see more people and also to be able to respond to more rfps and so we are seeing a number of the investments that we ve done not just in digital investments but also investments in product to help us to be more productive in the market i ll let rich talk if you have anything else rich richard l williams executive vice president and chief distribution officer yeah teresa i think you said that well the only thing i would add to it is the engagement of our veteran associates has been very positive for us they ve adopted the training in our technology solutions with everwell and so i think part of the productivity is driven by our veteran associates teresa l white president of aflac us absolutely john barnidge sandler o neill analyst and then my follow up question sticking with us we ve just completed the first tax filing season post reform can you talk about any behavioral changes either on individuals or business owners that stand out for distribution thank you very much teresa l white president of aflac us you ll take that rich richard l williams executive vice president and chief distribution officer i think the short answer is we have not seen any meaningful changes and it s continued to be business as usual john barnidge sandler o neill analyst thanks for the answers operator thank you next question is from the line of nigel dally of morgan stanley your line is now open nigel dally morgan stanley analyst great thanks good morning i had a question on japan sales appreciate the color on japan post being down as i previously hit their budget my question is whether this decline was anticipated when you said the sales growth guidance whether the results this quarter make any full year sales growth guidance has a little more challenging also you seem bullish on the prospects of the second half has anything changed there to drive that optimism or was that always your expectation david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations koji koide you want to answer that koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language this is koji i will answer your question foreign language as dan mentioned in his speech because japan post or jp as the january to march was there last at the very last quarter of the fiscal year and they focused on the sales of the proprietary product sales foreign language from april of this year this is the start of the new fiscal year for jp so now they are starting to sell more cancer insurance product foreign language however but it s different from last year is that even though there quarter is at the fiscal year starting they will be selling their cancer insurance and more in an equalized manner than compared with last year i would say it was really focusing on just particular quarter foreign language so as a result we are expecting that jp will still be a negative at the end of the second quarter foreign language however since last year jp has been working on improving the productivity such as to really strengthen their sales skill foreign language and they have also been accumulating very efficient motivation increasing effort foreign language and we do believe that their sales and performance will increase in the second half by leveraging all of these efforts that they have been working on foreign language now going onto the associates channel foreign language and the second quarter last year was when we had a very large increase in the third sector sales because of the new cancer product launch last year foreign language and we are expecting that the second quarter of this year will be negative because of the reason that i have mentioned as well as the long consecutive holidays for our emperor s accession to the improvement of this year foreign language however at the end of the second quarter there will be further revision of medical insurance although we are not able to disclose the details at this point foreign language however we will have expecting that we will have an increase in our third quarter because we will be launching very effective commercial together with associated direct mail and then starting with that our activities our associates sales activities will increase as a result we will have a good third quarter is our expectation foreign language as a result associated with the guidelines that we have our guidance that we have are indicated at the beginning of the year we will end in single mid to mid range negative even the single mid range negative figure and business units foreign language that is the combined number of associates and jp channel foreign language that s it from me daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer nigel the one thing that you asked the question was i want to be clear is is that nothing has changed we expected this so it just as we were preparing for the first quarter release we realized we needed to make sure everyone else understood that but when i saw the 16 coming in last year i knew in 2019 it s going be a big hurdle and how we are going to offset it and the answer was even going back to the second quarter of last year we re going to have a great second half of 2019 and so we re on plan to do that nigel dally morgan stanley analyst okay that s very helpful second question just on investments incorporating floating rate securities have been important part of the change in the portfolio mix now future rate increases looking less likely any implications of that expect this both positives and negatives but i hope you can flesh that up daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks nigel and as a reminder relative to fed rate changes it really impacts not only the floating rate assets but the hedging strategy as well because that correlated with libor which obviously is heavily influenced by fed action but to be specific to your question i ll break it into two buckets for 2019 we expect very little impact to our forecast in income from fed action and that s for two reasons one you recollect that our outlook call when we talked about hedge costs we locked in about 85 of our 2019 hedge cost by terming them out so in essence regardless of what happens to hedge costs most of our hedge costs will be locked in if the fed should lower rates for instance secondly on the floating rate assets just from a mechanical standpoint if the fed is lowering rates and libor was going down that would certainly impact our coupons when they reset however in late december we had put on an income hedged in essence of fixed for floating rate swap because we had saw the change in the fed view going from hawkish to dovish so about 75 of our floating rate income is locked in as well because we did the hedge so that s why that s my first part of the statement regardless of what the fed does this year our income actually from the floating rate portfolio including the hedge costs will be relatively stable and within a tight range the second bucket though is when you look out to 2020 obviously when we redo our budgets at the end of this year to reflect 2020 at libor continues to go down the fed should be cutting rates that will get reflected in the floating rate income but also get reflected in the marking to market of the hedge costs and if you recollect the whole concepts of the floating strategy is you should always think of those two buckets together the floating rate securities with the hedges and in essence we re earning a nice net spread so there ll be some impact in 2020 if the fed were to continue to lower rates and if libor goes down assuming no other factors change and of course the opposite is true we don t know exactly what will happen we just saw a good trend for gdp this morning so if rates should be rising we should we get the opposite impact which certainly we saw in 2018 in our results nigel dally morgan stanley analyst that s very helpful thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of john nadel of ubs your line is now open john nadel ubs investment bank analyst good morning i have a couple of quick ones first it sounded in your opening remarks dan like japan post actually doesn t yet have everything in place to begin purchasing aflac shares did i hear that right and if i did when do you expect that they will actually get the approvals needed to get that process started daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i will let fred take that because he has been even working with them frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the way to interpret dan s comments are as follows one is as we may have mentioned i think or made public a few months ago japan post has established the trust which now allows them to move forward on the purchasing stock when they re prepared to do so dan s comment was related to ongoing regulatory approvals that are required particularly in the us that will go on through into deeper into the year this is essentially the form a process in various states that they need to go through that however doesn t prohibit their ability to start the process of building shares they simply needed to get the trust in place and then of course it s entirely up to them and their tactics as to how and when they begin purchasing and we re sort of leaving that up to them of course so that s the way to interpret it john john nadel ubs investment bank analyst okay so can you actually tell us whether maybe you know maybe you don t know whether they ve actually started the cost thing or no frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the answer is no i can t tell you no i don t know and that is somewhat by design in the sense that we other than the provisions of the alliance for example the one year provision that starts from the beginning of them purchasing shares and building to the 7 ownership level we re treating them as any other institutional investor which means we re not in a position to either no and or report out on what they re doing relative to building the position what i would say is this though it s an obvious question that we would receive and we know that and so what we would do is refer you to any disclosures that japan post mix as part of their registered environment with the tokyo stock exchange or any other disclosures they choose to make and so we ll be paying attention to that but otherwise we are treating them as any other institutional investor in that regard john nadel ubs investment bank analyst got you thank you and then my second question is just around expenses it sounded also from your prepared remarks like you re expecting that the pace of spending i think both in japan and but in particular in the us we ll pick up as we move through the year so i just wanted to confirm whether that s what you re actually foreshadowing and then also specific to the us you talked about dac amortization being a bit higher is that a level that we should expect now on a go forward basis or was there some reason why that s unusual in 1q frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me answer both and give you more perspective you and everybody else on the call and that is so from the standpoint of expenses it is a timing related area and the quarter did in fact benefit from the timing of expenses which by default means that these expenses will start the process of building and running through in the latter part of the year to be more specific in the us our estimates are that expenses ran approximately 20 million better than we had anticipated and therefore we would expect the build of that or shift of that expense into future periods there is nothing necessarily unusual about this it s what i would call the normal timing related to the picking up of various initiatives and spend related to that staying on the us and answering your dac question we did see elevated dac expense in the quarter it s not unusual for dac expense to be elevated in the first quarter you will see that in some of our supplemental information and that s because you have a natural level of higher lapsation in the first quarter due to annual enrollment dynamics and so each year you ll notice that our benefit ratio tends to be a bit lower in the first quarter and our dac amortization higher and that s the result of increased lapsation particularly as we start to change the mix of business toward group and larger groups you ll see that perhaps a little bit more pronounced and so that s what s driving dac expense up we also had a little bit of what i would call clean up if you will related to estimates we made around dac amortization on certain groups that we anticipated lapsing or that had lapsed in late in the year in december and we had to true up those estimates that probably kicked up our dac expense in the us by about 5 million so back on the delayed expense issue to japan japan also had that dynamic it was largely revolving around promotional spend and we estimate that about jpy1 6 billion ok of delay if you will in other words we had anticipated jpy1 6 billion more yen of expense related to promotion that will shift into the later quarters and then finally on corporate corporate expenses were also a bit below our estimate and that actually has more to do with the pace of spend on the new accounting adoption as many companies are doing in our industry we re having to adopt a new accounting and we re starting into the more significant project spend related to that in fact we anticipate that spend being pre tax around 20 million to 25 million in 2019 and that will start to pick up as we go through the year so if you want me to wrap it all in a bow for you we would estimate that the quarter benefited by approximately 0 04 a share related to these expense timing issues john nadel ubs investment bank analyst that s all extremely helpful and i guess full employment dac per accountants in inaudible frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah right john nadel ubs investment bank analyst bye thanks operator thank you next question is from the line of suneet kamath of citi your line is now open suneet kamath citigroup inc analyst thanks good morning i wanted to go back to japan sales particularly the cancer product i guess the drop the drop off from japan post but i had thought that the second quarter 18 launch was sort of characterized as a new product and it sounds like your second half 19 recovery is also tied to a medical products my question is is this sales cycle for a new product really that short that you get most of the sales associated with the new product in the first couple of quarters sort of requiring you guys to refresh on that kind of annual basis daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i m going to let koji talk but i want to remind you that part of the reason that it s changed somewhat is due to this new rider concept we were we would write a new policy and they would then lapse their old one and now what is more efficient and better for the company and for the policyholders is to add riders so koji why don t you discuss that for a moment and then i ll if there s anything else i ll be glad to answer it too koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language well first of all in the second quarter we were once again revised a medical insurance which we also had in the first quarter foreign language but as you know compared with any other companies aflac has the largest number of medical policies foreign language and so although the competition is very tough and it s important that we increased the number of new businesses but then it is also important for us to protect our current existing policy foreign language especially because the most of the policies are whole life policy foreign language and what that means is that depending on customers life stage the need change foreign language and the customers health status of health also change foreign language so what we are doing now is to considering all these factors we are developing these providers that the customer really wants to buy depending on their life stage for example thinking of their health state of particular age customers foreign language and this is why their strategy is a part of this positive thing for customers and this also aligned with our core value of aflac foreign language and when the new power when the existing policy is lapsed and a new policy is purchased the premium normally goes up foreign language and with this new rider strategy what we are able to do for customers is that the customers will be able to maintain their policies and also just add whatever the coverage is needed with lower premiums foreign language so in the long term what we are thinking is that we are actually responding to what the customers are wanting foreign language and because of the fierce competition it does cost a lot of money to change product foreign language and i would like todd to really follow up on the economics of what we re doing todd todd daniels director and principal financial officer thank you koji yeah as koji mentioned we re doing this for benefiting not just the customer but it benefits our economics we developed these riders that with the mid term rider addition they re able to add these riders to existing policies that have been issued many years ago and so with that we don t have to incur another acquisition expense if we were to issue another based policy and i know you mentioned earlier asking about product lifecycle we have seen shorter product lifecycles on the medical particularly because there is lots of competition but we maintain this past round with issuing the riders that the customers want withholding the base policy premiums consistent with what we had with the prior version of the product for years we have been repricing product as interest rates change in competitors come in the market to keep up with different benefits and features that customers need but this time we decided to keep those premiums consistent with the prior version so policyholders would not want to lapse the base policy and buy a newer one which would have a higher premium so they re able to enjoy better economics at the same time we re able to enjoy better economics by having riders that are cheaper per unit to develop frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer one one thing i do want to step in and make a comment about this is fred that entire discussion with surrounding the very important strategy related to our medical product but when you first asked your question you were somewhat pointing to cancer product and be very careful about looking at the pattern of sales in cancer over the last several quarters and think of it in terms of the life cycle of the product last year in the second quarter and that was the first time that we refreshed the cancer product of course in four years which means there is substantial advancements in the quality of the product in coverage because of advancements in cancer treatment it also included a very attractive premium waiver feature which was particularly attractive in the japan post channel and importantly it was the first time that we meaningfully revised the cancer product in the japan post channel and so you saw a big spike in sales in the second quarter and then continued strength throughout 2018 you can t look at the first quarter results in cancer sales in jp in particular and in their fourth quarter and think of that as the end of the product cycle that has more to do with them having reached all of their goals and so they naturally pivoted toward their proprietary product they re going to pivot back to this very attractive cancer product as we go throughout the year and that s what s going to give the recovery so just to be careful about looking at those patterns and assume there some sort of shorten cancer product cycle suneet kamath citigroup inc analyst got it and then just my follow up and that was all very helpful is you have data that you can share with us in terms of what percentage of your sales are to existing policyholders in japan versus new policyholders masatoshi koide president and representative director yes koide speaking roughly speaking the 50 and the 50 the proportion will depend on the timing of launch of the new products of course but generally 50 and 50 daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i ll just add one thing real quick to on the cancer block you ll recall that we re developing new cancer policies to keep up with treatments for cancer and it s in our best interest to offer this to existing policyholders so part of our marketing campaigns over time had been through direct mails and follow up by our agents to offer them the latest cancer coverage which we think is the best interest of the policyholder suneet kamath citigroup inc analyst got it thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of tom gallagher from evercore your line is now open tom gallagher evercore isi analyst good morning also a few questions on japan sales any product enhancements or product expansion in terms of the relationship between you and japan post that you re planning or are you just still selling the same initial cancer product that you launched there daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer what i would do is to ask koide to talk about the four different groups that have full warmed within japan post koide you want to talk a little bit about that masatoshi koide president and representative director foreign language this is koide from aflac japan foreign language as we all know in this strategic alignments within december last year foreign language the third pillar of the three pillars of the strategic on this foreign language is to work on a new collaborative work with jp foreign language we will be working on both teams foreign language and leveraging business technology foreign language a new product of development corporation foreign language and during investment in the third party or the domestically internationally at business expansion together foreign language and cooperation with investments foreign language and for all these four stage that we have already launched working group and have started to have discussions foreign language that s all from me daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer and so what i would say is this that we are proceeding in a very methodical and cautious way to where we can have products and services that will enhance not only our business but also enhanced dependent those business and it never moves as fast as any other s launch but i m very pleased with the cooperation of both aflac japan s management team and also what they re doing with japan post though as i ve said 2019 is a year of planning 2020 will be part of execution and moving forward so we are working toward that end tom gallagher evercore isi analyst okay that s helpful and then my follow up is just did i hear correctly in one of the responses that you re revising the medical rider again in 2q after revising it in 1q or did i not understand that correctly the reason i ask is there are you changing something relative to what you did initially with the launch of that product or is that can you a little bit elaborate on that daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer let s have koji koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language well what we are going to do is that there are some things that we would nicely able to incorporate some of the changes incorporated in the january change of revisions foreign language and i m not able to elaborate on the details because it has not been announced yet foreign language as we try to provide a very good product based on the needs foreign language we would likely providing these kind of benefits and coverage depending on the status of our customers health because our policy life is very long daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me just say that this is not unusual in that when we re dealing with our sales people they come up with ideas and thoughts and we look back to see if there s anything that we can ultimately make it more sales appealing so i wouldn t take into this anything major this is a minor adjustment and but if it will help our sales people then we try to work toward that end frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer just to be clear though this has always been our plan we re not redoing anything in june or second quarter in response to our result in first quarter this has been our plan all along tom gallagher evercore isi analyst got you thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of jimmy bhullar of jpmc your line is now open jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst hi good morning first i had a question for eric on just the new money yield it was up a lot i think 3 29 in japan and a lot higher than the portfolio yields so to what extent is this a better rate environment or what i suspect it is just the decision to allocate more money i guess to us dollar investments and would you expect the new money yield to drop as the year goes on versus the 1q level eric kirsch global chief investment officer thanks jimmy it s definitely not a function of the rate environment because the rates are lower all around the globe but it is more reflection of asset allocation so you re right on that part and perhaps like japan approximately half just a little bit under half went into us dollar assets and a good portion of that went into our loan portfolio transitional real estate and middle market loans and those are having average yields from 5 5 6 up to 7 on middle market loans so that s really the driver of the higher new money yield it s really asset allocation because from a new money perspective as you know yields have been coming down spreads have gotten tighter fortunately for us relative to our income objectives for the year that s not a big driver of whether or not we would make our numbers and the asset allocation i described is within our plan so there s nothing that deviated and for the loan portfolio we start to receive prepayments on those loans and therefore they get reinvested back into dollars so our asset allocation is very much in line with our strategic asset allocation and how the underlying loan portfolios are performing for the rest of the year i wouldn t expect big deviations necessarily subject to of course market yields and any tactical actions we might take if something were to present itself in the market jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst and then maybe a question for todd on the just the whole full policy versus the rider dynamic can you sort of give us an idea on what s the premiums per policy are if you sell the rider versus selling stand alone policy and that just to be able to assess how much is that weighing on your sales this year todd daniels director and principal financial officer yeah i m going to hand it to koji they had some numbers and will came refer to this koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language the rider versus the base policy is 15 to 16 premium foreign language in the case of the income support rider 15 to 16 in the case of care riders 15 to 20 todd daniels director and principal financial officer so i think it varies greatly by which rider you re looking at versus a base policy and one thing to keep in mind is these riders are limited benefits versus buying the entire base policy for our income support rider it s covering long term being out of work and supporting your income where this rider that we ve developed is a lump sum one time payment so it s a limited benefits to try to make it more affordable for the customer to purchase this as a rider same thing with the care option for the older age people it s sold as a lump sum benefit so the premium is going to be quite a bit less than if we were to design and develop a true nursing care policy jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst okay and just lastly for fred will the post be required to file with the sec once they get to 5 stake i m assuming they will be but frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we would expect them to after obviously follow all of the guidelines associated with the reporting jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst okay thank you frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer the nyse operator thank you next question is from the line of greg peters of raymond james your line is now open greg peters raymond james analyst good morning i was wondering if we could just step back from a big picture perspective and i guess i got to say upfront i realize your us business has a different focus but i was hoping you could comment on all the recent political rhetoric around the possibility of medicare for all and what your perspective is on that daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i ll say something and then i ll see if teresa our medicare for all is nothing more in my opinion than some form of what we see in japan with their national healthcare system granted they ve gone from no deductibles to 10 to 20 and to 30 but we have been selling it in environment since inception that consumers would own some type of major medical insurance whether it be blue cross blue shield to obamacare to anything that might be out there because there are costs associated with unexpected expenses that are not covered by any type of medicare medicaid whatever it might be so from our standpoint i don t think it s going to change how we address these issues i do think it will we will hear a lot about it with the election in 2020 but i don t think when it all boils down that it s going to change anything in terms of the way we are selling now so i really don t worry about that from that standpoint i m paid to worry so i do watch it carefully but there is nothing on the horizon that makes me nervous about that teresa teresa l white president of aflac us i think you ve pretty much summed it up at the end of the day i think it becomes more apparent to the consumer about their risks and gaps when they have whichever coverage whether it s medicare for all or it s blue cross blue shield as you mentioned so from that perspective i think the value of our product the value of what aflac offers continues to be apparent which ever major medical you have as a consumer daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer and let me say this is a company we want everybody to have health insurance teresa l white president of aflac us absolutely daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer we re absolutely for that we think it s in the best interest the cost associated with it are going to be through the route because as you know in other countries they have they limit medical access on different things and we would be the first country that would go to a period of where you would have unlimited access with unlimited calls so the cost associated with it is another issue political one in my opinion but just know we as a company want people to have it because we think we ve got the product that will help build those gaps that are going to be created in today s society greg peters raymond james analyst thank you for that answer i guess staying on the same theme of politics there s also been rhetoric around share repurchase activity and i m curious dan at the board level if you guys are starting to change your thinking around capital allocation is ready to share repurchase versus perhaps possibly a dividend or a special dividend or anything like that frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is fred i ll answer and then and then dan can pickup from the board level but i think just in terms of capital allocation obviously after a 36 year track record of increasing the dividend and certainly intending to continue that track record we feel like we re in good shape on balancing the dynamics of investing in our business buying back stock and paying out a common stock dividend in terms of stock repurchase it remains a very good investment of the company particularly on a risk adjusted basis and it also is the basis upon which we measure up other opportunities the degree to which other nonorganic for example opportunities can come into play i think from the political perspective the only thing i would generally agree with because i think it s just good management and that is you don t have the company you don t deserve to be significantly buying back your stock and frankly paying a high dividend until you first and foremost secure your balance sheet and secure your capital ratios in such a way that you can meet all the promises of your policyholders and frankly meet any obligations you have to your employees that includes pension obligations and so there s elements of it i agree with however i don t see any need to regulate that type of dynamic i think frankly good management and governance self regulates those issues in my view so that s my thing daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer and i think our position all along has been a very moderate position we haven t been extreme on any area and it s the extremism that brings on the most criticism and so i think we re very well positioned i think we will continue at this pace the board will of course constantly review that to see if there s any areas that they think we should be looking at but i think there is anything you know about our company is we try to look ahead of what the trends are no matter what they might be political consumer activism or whatever it might be to make sure we re on top of what s taking place though i can assure you this is a top of nine subjects that we will continue to monitor but we feel we re well positioned right now greg peters raymond james analyst again thank you for your answers david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations and that brings us to the top of the hour 10 00 am i appreciate

president xi jinping addressed some 40 world leaders at the belt and road forum in beijing but his speech may have been aimed at a head of state not in the audience u s president donald trump xi spent

competitive devaluation of the yuan all four are issues the u s is addressing in trade talks with beijing we will establish a binding enforcement system for international agreements xi said adding that china will standardize all levels of government in terms of issuing administrative licenses and market regulation and also eliminate improper rules subsidies and practices that impede fair

frank herbert dune 2020 biden d 1 joe biden raises 6 3 million topping rivals first day hauls all told mr biden s campaign said 96 926 people had contributed in the first day and that 65 000 of the donations were from people who were not previously on his email list of supporters the campaign said that 97 percent of online donations were below 200 but it did not disclose the share of overall contributions that were below that threshold i would like to know how many of those 65 000 donations were debundled biden d 2 the good the bad and the biden on former vp s first day on the trail but barely seven hours in there came a reminder of some of biden s most glaring vulnerabilities with a flare up of the 1990s drama surrounding anita hill that reverberated with racial and gender overtones biden calls anita hill to share his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country hill responds i cannot be satisfied by simply saying i m sorry for what happened to you i will be satisfied when i know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose ouch f biden runs true to form the first day of his campaign will also be the best day so it s downhill all the way from here biden d 3 how biden plans to steamroll the 2020 democratic field but biden s calls are also part of a real traditional show of force strategy to demonstrate from his first week in the race that he is in a category of his own a pol to be reckoned with this time complete with more institutional support in the form of endorsements surrogates and defenders than all the other candidates combined i think you will see a lot of key elected endorsements come out of the chute said james smith the biden friend and former south carolina legislator who ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2018 biden is wagering that in an age of digital fundraising insurgent politics and trump s twitter wars this kind of thing still matters especially when he s likely to be target no 1 for the rest of the field yet in the biden team s eyes it s only natural their guy is in a unique position to approach even the top potential endorsers who are unlikely to weigh in for anyone else and say we ve known each other forever and i m your best bet biden d 4 biden would be arguably the most experienced new president ever the conclusion biden effectively will be campaigning as a george h w bush style president we won t have to train that may be the perfect message for the moment and he may be the perfect man to deliver it but there is also the danger that biden is something else the candidate who cannot be trained if that is the case all of his experience may have been for naught in this campaign if he becomes

their economic well being because it s affected by agricultural prices that farmers can t control besides weather the entities that control farm prices largely have to do with business interests that lobby heavily at the state and federal levels if the behavioral health state of farmers is poor you can bet those lobbies are winning nessel creates enforcement unit to crack down on payroll fraud

free twice daily newsletter don t miss the latest investment and personal finances news market analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up unfortunately there s a financial serpent in this bullish paradise it takes the form of the us dollar this has been an epic year for investors so far markets have been in risk on mode all this year 2019 has seen just about every asset class enjoy monster rallies even if it hasn t always felt terribly cheerful on this side of the atlantic what with shrieking brexit headlines everywhere according to bank of america merrill lynch by mid april commodities were up nearly 20 global stocks by 14 and junk bonds by about 7 that has made it one of the strongest starts to a year on record fair enough the year started on a low following the panic in the last quarter of 2018 even so that s an impressive start to the year though notably 1987 started off in the same way so let s not count our chickens yet anyway one thing about a risk on market is this you d normally expect it to be accompanied by a weaker us dollar why firstly the us dollar is generally viewed as a safe haven asset when people are feeling exuberant they sell dollars and dollar assets to buy riskier assets overseas so that s one reason why the continued strength of the dollar is a little surprising second a stronger us dollar typically goes hand in hand with tighter monetary policy the federal reserve has u turned quite dramatically this year on interest rates and yet the dollar has hung on and in fact stubbornly continued to head higher indeed this week the us dollar index a measure of the strength of the american currency against a basket of the currencies of its main trading partners hit its highest point for the year and it s now near a two year high that s a bit of a worry for the bulls for a third reason that is a strong us dollar effectively means tighter monetary policy for the entire world put simply everyone needs dollars so the more expensive they are the less money there is for everything else we re already seeing the resulting squeeze having an impact on the world s more perennially fragile markets such as argentina and turkey and if the dollar stays up here for much longer the jitters could spread to emerging economies normally viewed as more resilient as macro intelligence 2 partners points out in a recent commentary the dollar at this level is stuck firmly in the middle of the crisis zone a band where historically dollar strength was sufficient to trigger the latam debt crisis in the 80s the asian crisis in the 90s and china s 2015 devaluation that s a bit of a worry are we facing a melt up or a meltdown so why has the us dollar been so strong a lot of it is simply down to weakness in other currencies it s true that the fed u turned at the start of this year but so has pretty much every other central bank in the world europe is slowing down china is warming up to do more stimulus japan is well japan the uk has brexit to suppress sterling australia s economy is slowing due to its house price bubble popping sweden has just decided to do more quantitative easing in effect the fed is losing the war of the doves the us is hardly enjoying epic economic growth and yet it is still one of the healthiest looking economies out there with central banks around the world showing no signs of raising rates that should be good for asset prices but the risk is that a strong dollar not only exerts a pinch on vulnerable countries with dollar denominated debt but also that it starts to squeeze earnings for big us companies a big chunk of profits in the s p 500 derive from overseas sales some are already feeling the pinch us conglomerate 3m maker of post it notes issued a profit warning yesterday and saw its share price tumble by more than 10 combine a strong dollar with a weakening global economy and that s a recipe for a profit squeeze which is in turn bad news for highly valued share prices now if i m writing about this it s hardly a big secret so it s quite possible that a nervy fed will act to curb dollar strength or that donald trump will get on twitter and try to talk it down to be clear if janet yellen was running the show right now i reckon the fed would already have stopped quantitative tightening qt and raised hints about another bout of qe but yellen is not in charge any more and the market has yet to fully believe that jerome powell has its back my base case at the moment is that we get the melt up followed by meltdown scenario driven mainly by overly loose monetary policy allowing inflationary pressure to get out of hand but if the us dollar doesn t turn lower soon we might have to see another big plunge in the s p 500 to convince the fed that it needs to address this by the way to be clear i am not calling for fed intervention i like the idea of free markets being able to roam as they see fit ideally being informed by economic reality rather than the volume of printed money available but this is the way the world currently works for the bull case to win out from here we probably need to see the fed pull another surprise out of its hat for more on melt ups and meltdowns check out my colleague merryn somerset webb s letter in the latest issue of moneyweek magazine and get your first six issues free here if you haven t already

prepared remarks operator welcome to the aflac s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call your lines have been placed on listen only until the question and answer session please be advised today s conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to mr david young vice president of aflac investor and rating agency relations david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations thank you and good morning and welcome to our first quarter call this morning we will be hearing remarks from dan amos chairman and ceo of aflac incorporated about the quarter as well as our operations in japan and the united states then fred crawford executive vice president and cfo of aflac incorporated will follow with more details about our financial results in addition joining us this morning during the q a portion are members of our management team in the united states teresa white president of aflac us eric kirsch global chief investment officer rich williams chief distribution officer al riggieri global chief risk officer and chief actuary and max broden treasurer and head of corporate development we are also joined by members of our executive management team in tokyo at aflac life insurance japan charles lake chairman and representative director president of aflac international masatoshi koide president and representative director todd daniels director and principal financial officer koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing before we start let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of federal securities laws although we believe these statements are reasonable we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today we encourage you to look at our annual report on form 10 k for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results the earnings release is available on the investors page of aflac s website at investors aflac com and includes reconciliations of certain non gaap measures i ll now hand the call over to dan dan daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer thank you david and good morning and thank you for joining us the first quarter of 2019 established a solid foundation as we set out to achieve our annual objectives let me give you more detailed beginning with japanese operation aflac japan our largest earnings contributor generated strong financial results that are in line with our expectations for the quarter for 2019 we continue to expect a slight decline in aflac japan s total earned premium primarily due to the limited pay policies reaching paid up status as you saw in the release third sector combined with first sector protection sales were down low single digit in the first quarter but generally in line with our expectations for the quarter our traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success as do our alliance partners while cancer insurance sales were up for the quarter with strength in our associates channel results were weaker at japan post as they achieved their 2018 fiscal year targets early both daido and dai ichi increased cancer sales in the final quarter of the japanese fiscal year as for medical sales we ve focused on riders in the medical area to retain and attract new customers with mid term riders policyholders can update their existing medical coverage by adding a rider to their existing policy they also have the option to purchase a new policy with an income support rider targeting young and middle aged segment or nursing rider designed for the middle to older age groups while this strategy is effective in driving better overall economics in earned premium it s less beneficial to the sales versus replacement of the whole policy as you know we take a longer term perspective looking forward to the remainder of the year let me just say that we anticipate making our annual sales objective last year beginning in the second quarter we had a very successful launch of our new cancer insurance product which drove a 16 increase and third sector sales for the second quarter 2018 this makes a very difficult comparison we want to make sure you understand that we expect third sector and first sector protection combined sales to be down in the high teens in the second quarter of 19 this means that we expect those sales in the first half to be down in the high single digits having said that though we anticipate a strong second half and more importantly we expect to achieve our annual sales of objective of a mid single digit decline in the third sector and first sector protection sales for the year ultimately our focus remains on maintaining our leadership in the third sector products while complementing this core business with similarly profitable first sector protection products to that end we will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new products that our policyholders want and need and where they will want to purchase them finally with respect to japan post in our launch you may recall that at the end of february we announced in the filing that japan post holdings formed a trust that permits the trustees to purchase aflac incorporated shares we continue to anticipate the completion of the regulatory approvals in the second half of 2019 as we have mentioned previously we view 2019 as more of a year of planning around opportunities for aflac in japan post holding companies to collaborate when i was in tokyo last month i met with the ceo of japan post holdings along with the senior executives of both companies we had very productive meetings to work toward areas that are mutually beneficial to both parties as we told you 2019 is a year of planning and 2020 will be more of an execution on our plans turning to aflac us our revenues increased 2 2 at the same time pre tax earnings continued to reflect ongoing investments in our platform distribution and customer experience us sales were up 1 5 which was in line with our expectations for the quarter aflac is unique with respect to our peers and as the majority of our sales comes from independent sales agents we are fortunate to be representative by such a strong field force which is truly distinctive within our industry these independent career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to assess and therefore succeed with smaller employers in groups with fewer than 100 employees aflac agents have always enhanced their collaboration with local and regional brokers as we continue to grow broker sales while our team of broker sales professionals has taken and made great strides in enhancing our relationship with the large broker community brokers have recognized more and more that their clients need the types of products aflac offers this is increased the appeal and therefore the interest in doing business with aflac with the continued growth of our broker business our sales have been increasingly skewed toward fourth quarter with the continued growth of the broker business and we expect 2019 to be no different we were also pleased with the continued improvement in productivity in the quarter at the same time net earned premium rose 2 4 and we continue to expect aflac us to deliver solid results in 2019 with earned premium growth in the 2 to 3 range ultimately we believe the investments we ve made in our distribution and customer experience will promote increased productivity stable persistency and improved long term economics while fred will address capital deployment in more details we remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our bondholders shareholders and policyholders at the same time we re balancing our financial strength with reinvesting in our business increasing the dividend and repurchasing our shares through aflac incorporated subsidiaries in japan and the united states we have the privilege of helping provide financial protection to more than 50 million people in both countries we have earned our position as the leading supplemental insurer by paying cash fast when our policyholders get sick or injured looking ahead we believe that our strong earnings growth will reflect the underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in japan and the united states it will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that balances the interest of all stakeholders at the same time it will reflect our dedication to delivering on the promises that we made to our policyholders now i will turn the program over to fred to cover the financial results fred frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you dan we are off to a strong start to the year on the earnings front as results for the quarter exceeded our expectations adjusted earnings of 1 12 per share benefited from strong margins both in japan and the us our reported results were modestly impacted by a weakening of the yen as compared to the 2018 period reducing our earnings by approximately 0 01 per share in the quarter the quarter s adjusted effective tax rate of 25 5 includes the tax treatment of equity compensation under gaap that contributed roughly 0 01 to our adjusted earnings per share when normalized our effective tax rate of 26 3 came in as expected and represents a blended rate based on our current mix of japan earnings tax at 28 and us earnings tax at 21 turning to our japan segment results earned premium for our third sector products increased 1 8 and in line with our expectations with continued headwinds from paid up first sector products overall earned premium growth was down nearly 1 in the quarter as we move through the year the earned premium impact from paid up policies will remain stable the first sector ways paid up impact will gradually reduce throughout 2019 however a portion of our medical sales in 2017 was a newly introduced two pay product which was popular in the bank channel and will have a slight impact to third sector earned premium growth for the remainder of 2019 overall it s important to note that this strain to the top line does not impact profitability our total benefit ratio came in at 69 1 and at the lower end of our annual guidance range driven by a favorable third sector benefit ratio and the continued shift in business mix from first sector toward third sector which carries a lower benefit ratio our expense ratio in japan was 20 2 consistent with our projected range while year over year our expense ratio increased expenses came in below our forecast due to the timing of sales promotions and lower dac expense as lapse experience was better than expected our expense ratio outlook for the year remains in the range of 19 5 to 21 5 net investment income in our japan segment contributed to our strong results while no one area drove the outperformance continued favorable returns in our floating rate loan portfolio modestly lower hedge costs and variable income from our building alternative investment portfolio contributed to results overall in japan we recorded a very strong pre tax profit margin of 21 9 with all key earnings drivers coming in better than our forecast turning to the us results earned premium was up a steady 2 4 our total benefit ratio came in at 49 3 at the lower end of our annual guidance range and generally consistent with recent claims trends and our mix of business our expense ratio in the us was 36 3 breaking down the expense ratio further dac amortization was elevated in the quarter reflecting natural growth mix of business and adjustments related to lapse experience in truing up previous estimates in terms of general operating expenses this quarter benefited from timing of spend which we expect to build throughout the year our expense ratio outlook for the year remains in the range of 35 to 37 net investment income performance was in line with expectations and reflects our continued movement of excess capital out of the us to the holding company in our corporate segment the main driver of improved earnings year over year is net investment income and amortized hedge income investment income benefited from the movement of capital and increased liquidity at the holding company our corporate hedging program reduces our economic exposure to the yen while lowering enterprise wide hedge costs amortized hedge income contributed 20 million on a pre tax basis to the quarter s earnings with a notional position of just over 2 5 billion as you may have noticed we have added disclosures in our financial supplement with additional detail on our corporate hedging program and associated amortized hedge income capital remains strong japan solvency margin ratio is estimated in the 950 range in april we issued jpy30 billion of hybrid debt out of our japan subsidiary which receives regulatory capital treatment at a very low cost of capital we estimate that this will contribute approximately 20 points to smr and is another example of financial flexibility stemming from the conversion of our aflac japan from a branch to a subsidiary our estimated us only risk based capital ratio at quarter end is now in the 700 range rbc is a bit elevated as we have planned increases in operating dividends and the drawdown of 500 million of excess capital scheduled for later this year as we target 500 we ended the quarter with nearly 2 5 billion of capital and liquidity at the holding company asset quality remained strong with very little in the way of impairments in the quarter following a solid recovery in pricing we elected to sell our entire 146 million position in pg e realizing a small gain in the quarter we had previously impaired our position in the fourth quarter by 21 million in the quarter we repurchased 10 2 million shares for approximately 490 million this amount was elevated as we tactically accelerated repurchase early in the quarter we are maintaining our current range for repurchase of 1 3 billion to 1 7 billion in 2019 in closing we re off to a solid start both in japan and in the us and i ll now hand the call over to david to begin q a session david david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations thank you fred before we take your questions let me just ask you to please limit yourself to one initial question and a follow up you can always get back in the queue and we ll now take the first question operator questions and answers operator thank you first question is from the line of john barnidge of sandler o neill you may now ask your question john barnidge sandler o neill analyst yeah so productivity in the us was rather strong for a 1q what do you see as a driver for this and these digital investments that you re making already yielding in if that s what the driver of productivity is can you maybe talk about some examples teresa l white president of aflac us well i ll start off this is teresa what we re seeing if yes so the digital investments are assisting us with especially on the broker side of the business with enrollment tools that allow to be more productive on that side of the business we re also seeing additional productivity based on product offerings as portfolio offerings that we have if you recall we introduced some life products and we expanded our portfolio with our life and disability to help us to improve some of the be able to see more people and also to be able to respond to more rfps and so we are seeing a number of the investments that we ve done not just in digital investments but also investments in product to help us to be more productive in the market i ll let rich talk if you have anything else rich richard l williams executive vice president and chief distribution officer yeah teresa i think you said that well the only thing i would add to it is the engagement of our veteran associates has been very positive for us they ve adopted the training in our technology solutions with everwell and so i think part of the productivity is driven by our veteran associates teresa l white president of aflac us absolutely john barnidge sandler o neill analyst and then my follow up question sticking with us we ve just completed the first tax filing season post reform can you talk about any behavioral changes either on individuals or business owners that stand out for distribution thank you very much teresa l white president of aflac us you ll take that rich richard l williams executive vice president and chief distribution officer i think the short answer is we have not seen any meaningful changes and it s continued to be business as usual john barnidge sandler o neill analyst thanks for the answers operator thank you next question is from the line of nigel dally of morgan stanley your line is now open nigel dally morgan stanley analyst great thanks good morning i had a question on japan sales appreciate the color on japan post being down as i previously hit their budget my question is whether this decline was anticipated when you said the sales growth guidance whether the results this quarter make any full year sales growth guidance has a little more challenging also you seem bullish on the prospects of the second half has anything changed there to drive that optimism or was that always your expectation david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations koji koide you want to answer that koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language this is koji i will answer your question foreign language as dan mentioned in his speech because japan post or jp as the january to march was there last at the very last quarter of the fiscal year and they focused on the sales of the proprietary product sales foreign language from april of this year this is the start of the new fiscal year for jp so now they are starting to sell more cancer insurance product foreign language however but it s different from last year is that even though there quarter is at the fiscal year starting they will be selling their cancer insurance and more in an equalized manner than compared with last year i would say it was really focusing on just particular quarter foreign language so as a result we are expecting that jp will still be a negative at the end of the second quarter foreign language however since last year jp has been working on improving the productivity such as to really strengthen their sales skill foreign language and they have also been accumulating very efficient motivation increasing effort foreign language and we do believe that their sales and performance will increase in the second half by leveraging all of these efforts that they have been working on foreign language now going onto the associates channel foreign language and the second quarter last year was when we had a very large increase in the third sector sales because of the new cancer product launch last year foreign language and we are expecting that the second quarter of this year will be negative because of the reason that i have mentioned as well as the long consecutive holidays for our emperor s accession to the improvement of this year foreign language however at the end of the second quarter there will be further revision of medical insurance although we are not able to disclose the details at this point foreign language however we will have expecting that we will have an increase in our third quarter because we will be launching very effective commercial together with associated direct mail and then starting with that our activities our associates sales activities will increase as a result we will have a good third quarter is our expectation foreign language as a result associated with the guidelines that we have our guidance that we have are indicated at the beginning of the year we will end in single mid to mid range negative even the single mid range negative figure and business units foreign language that is the combined number of associates and jp channel foreign language that s it from me daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer nigel the one thing that you asked the question was i want to be clear is is that nothing has changed we expected this so it just as we were preparing for the first quarter release we realized we needed to make sure everyone else understood that but when i saw the 16 coming in last year i knew in 2019 it s going be a big hurdle and how we are going to offset it and the answer was even going back to the second quarter of last year we re going to have a great second half of 2019 and so we re on plan to do that nigel dally morgan stanley analyst okay that s very helpful second question just on investments incorporating floating rate securities have been important part of the change in the portfolio mix now future rate increases looking less likely any implications of that expect this both positives and negatives but i hope you can flesh that up daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer sure thanks nigel and as a reminder relative to fed rate changes it really impacts not only the floating rate assets but the hedging strategy as well because that correlated with libor which obviously is heavily influenced by fed action but to be specific to your question i ll break it into two buckets for 2019 we expect very little impact to our forecast in income from fed action and that s for two reasons one you recollect that our outlook call when we talked about hedge costs we locked in about 85 of our 2019 hedge cost by terming them out so in essence regardless of what happens to hedge costs most of our hedge costs will be locked in if the fed should lower rates for instance secondly on the floating rate assets just from a mechanical standpoint if the fed is lowering rates and libor was going down that would certainly impact our coupons when they reset however in late december we had put on an income hedged in essence of fixed for floating rate swap because we had saw the change in the fed view going from hawkish to dovish so about 75 of our floating rate income is locked in as well because we did the hedge so that s why that s my first part of the statement regardless of what the fed does this year our income actually from the floating rate portfolio including the hedge costs will be relatively stable and within a tight range the second bucket though is when you look out to 2020 obviously when we redo our budgets at the end of this year to reflect 2020 at libor continues to go down the fed should be cutting rates that will get reflected in the floating rate income but also get reflected in the marking to market of the hedge costs and if you recollect the whole concepts of the floating strategy is you should always think of those two buckets together the floating rate securities with the hedges and in essence we re earning a nice net spread so there ll be some impact in 2020 if the fed were to continue to lower rates and if libor goes down assuming no other factors change and of course the opposite is true we don t know exactly what will happen we just saw a good trend for gdp this morning so if rates should be rising we should we get the opposite impact which certainly we saw in 2018 in our results nigel dally morgan stanley analyst that s very helpful thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of john nadel of ubs your line is now open john nadel ubs investment bank analyst good morning i have a couple of quick ones first it sounded in your opening remarks dan like japan post actually doesn t yet have everything in place to begin purchasing aflac shares did i hear that right and if i did when do you expect that they will actually get the approvals needed to get that process started daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i will let fred take that because he has been even working with them frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the way to interpret dan s comments are as follows one is as we may have mentioned i think or made public a few months ago japan post has established the trust which now allows them to move forward on the purchasing stock when they re prepared to do so dan s comment was related to ongoing regulatory approvals that are required particularly in the us that will go on through into deeper into the year this is essentially the form a process in various states that they need to go through that however doesn t prohibit their ability to start the process of building shares they simply needed to get the trust in place and then of course it s entirely up to them and their tactics as to how and when they begin purchasing and we re sort of leaving that up to them of course so that s the way to interpret it john john nadel ubs investment bank analyst okay so can you actually tell us whether maybe you know maybe you don t know whether they ve actually started the cost thing or no frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the answer is no i can t tell you no i don t know and that is somewhat by design in the sense that we other than the provisions of the alliance for example the one year provision that starts from the beginning of them purchasing shares and building to the 7 ownership level we re treating them as any other institutional investor which means we re not in a position to either no and or report out on what they re doing relative to building the position what i would say is this though it s an obvious question that we would receive and we know that and so what we would do is refer you to any disclosures that japan post mix as part of their registered environment with the tokyo stock exchange or any other disclosures they choose to make and so we ll be paying attention to that but otherwise we are treating them as any other institutional investor in that regard john nadel ubs investment bank analyst got you thank you and then my second question is just around expenses it sounded also from your prepared remarks like you re expecting that the pace of spending i think both in japan and but in particular in the us we ll pick up as we move through the year so i just wanted to confirm whether that s what you re actually foreshadowing and then also specific to the us you talked about dac amortization being a bit higher is that a level that we should expect now on a go forward basis or was there some reason why that s unusual in 1q frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me answer both and give you more perspective you and everybody else on the call and that is so from the standpoint of expenses it is a timing related area and the quarter did in fact benefit from the timing of expenses which by default means that these expenses will start the process of building and running through in the latter part of the year to be more specific in the us our estimates are that expenses ran approximately 20 million better than we had anticipated and therefore we would expect the build of that or shift of that expense into future periods there is nothing necessarily unusual about this it s what i would call the normal timing related to the picking up of various initiatives and spend related to that staying on the us and answering your dac question we did see elevated dac expense in the quarter it s not unusual for dac expense to be elevated in the first quarter you will see that in some of our supplemental information and that s because you have a natural level of higher lapsation in the first quarter due to annual enrollment dynamics and so each year you ll notice that our benefit ratio tends to be a bit lower in the first quarter and our dac amortization higher and that s the result of increased lapsation particularly as we start to change the mix of business toward group and larger groups you ll see that perhaps a little bit more pronounced and so that s what s driving dac expense up we also had a little bit of what i would call clean up if you will related to estimates we made around dac amortization on certain groups that we anticipated lapsing or that had lapsed in late in the year in december and we had to true up those estimates that probably kicked up our dac expense in the us by about 5 million so back on the delayed expense issue to japan japan also had that dynamic it was largely revolving around promotional spend and we estimate that about jpy1 6 billion ok of delay if you will in other words we had anticipated jpy1 6 billion more yen of expense related to promotion that will shift into the later quarters and then finally on corporate corporate expenses were also a bit below our estimate and that actually has more to do with the pace of spend on the new accounting adoption as many companies are doing in our industry we re having to adopt a new accounting and we re starting into the more significant project spend related to that in fact we anticipate that spend being pre tax around 20 million to 25 million in 2019 and that will start to pick up as we go through the year so if you want me to wrap it all in a bow for you we would estimate that the quarter benefited by approximately 0 04 a share related to these expense timing issues john nadel ubs investment bank analyst that s all extremely helpful and i guess full employment dac per accountants in inaudible frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah right john nadel ubs investment bank analyst bye thanks operator thank you next question is from the line of suneet kamath of citi your line is now open suneet kamath citigroup inc analyst thanks good morning i wanted to go back to japan sales particularly the cancer product i guess the drop the drop off from japan post but i had thought that the second quarter 18 launch was sort of characterized as a new product and it sounds like your second half 19 recovery is also tied to a medical products my question is is this sales cycle for a new product really that short that you get most of the sales associated with the new product in the first couple of quarters sort of requiring you guys to refresh on that kind of annual basis daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i m going to let koji talk but i want to remind you that part of the reason that it s changed somewhat is due to this new rider concept we were we would write a new policy and they would then lapse their old one and now what is more efficient and better for the company and for the policyholders is to add riders so koji why don t you discuss that for a moment and then i ll if there s anything else i ll be glad to answer it too koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language well first of all in the second quarter we were once again revised a medical insurance which we also had in the first quarter foreign language but as you know compared with any other companies aflac has the largest number of medical policies foreign language and so although the competition is very tough and it s important that we increased the number of new businesses but then it is also important for us to protect our current existing policy foreign language especially because the most of the policies are whole life policy foreign language and what that means is that depending on customers life stage the need change foreign language and the customers health status of health also change foreign language so what we are doing now is to considering all these factors we are developing these providers that the customer really wants to buy depending on their life stage for example thinking of their health state of particular age customers foreign language and this is why their strategy is a part of this positive thing for customers and this also aligned with our core value of aflac foreign language and when the new power when the existing policy is lapsed and a new policy is purchased the premium normally goes up foreign language and with this new rider strategy what we are able to do for customers is that the customers will be able to maintain their policies and also just add whatever the coverage is needed with lower premiums foreign language so in the long term what we are thinking is that we are actually responding to what the customers are wanting foreign language and because of the fierce competition it does cost a lot of money to change product foreign language and i would like todd to really follow up on the economics of what we re doing todd todd daniels director and principal financial officer thank you koji yeah as koji mentioned we re doing this for benefiting not just the customer but it benefits our economics we developed these riders that with the mid term rider addition they re able to add these riders to existing policies that have been issued many years ago and so with that we don t have to incur another acquisition expense if we were to issue another based policy and i know you mentioned earlier asking about product lifecycle we have seen shorter product lifecycles on the medical particularly because there is lots of competition but we maintain this past round with issuing the riders that the customers want withholding the base policy premiums consistent with what we had with the prior version of the product for years we have been repricing product as interest rates change in competitors come in the market to keep up with different benefits and features that customers need but this time we decided to keep those premiums consistent with the prior version so policyholders would not want to lapse the base policy and buy a newer one which would have a higher premium so they re able to enjoy better economics at the same time we re able to enjoy better economics by having riders that are cheaper per unit to develop frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer one one thing i do want to step in and make a comment about this is fred that entire discussion with surrounding the very important strategy related to our medical product but when you first asked your question you were somewhat pointing to cancer product and be very careful about looking at the pattern of sales in cancer over the last several quarters and think of it in terms of the life cycle of the product last year in the second quarter and that was the first time that we refreshed the cancer product of course in four years which means there is substantial advancements in the quality of the product in coverage because of advancements in cancer treatment it also included a very attractive premium waiver feature which was particularly attractive in the japan post channel and importantly it was the first time that we meaningfully revised the cancer product in the japan post channel and so you saw a big spike in sales in the second quarter and then continued strength throughout 2018 you can t look at the first quarter results in cancer sales in jp in particular and in their fourth quarter and think of that as the end of the product cycle that has more to do with them having reached all of their goals and so they naturally pivoted toward their proprietary product they re going to pivot back to this very attractive cancer product as we go throughout the year and that s what s going to give the recovery so just to be careful about looking at those patterns and assume there some sort of shorten cancer product cycle suneet kamath citigroup inc analyst got it and then just my follow up and that was all very helpful is you have data that you can share with us in terms of what percentage of your sales are to existing policyholders in japan versus new policyholders masatoshi koide president and representative director yes koide speaking roughly speaking the 50 and the 50 the proportion will depend on the timing of launch of the new products of course but generally 50 and 50 daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i ll just add one thing real quick to on the cancer block you ll recall that we re developing new cancer policies to keep up with treatments for cancer and it s in our best interest to offer this to existing policyholders so part of our marketing campaigns over time had been through direct mails and follow up by our agents to offer them the latest cancer coverage which we think is the best interest of the policyholder suneet kamath citigroup inc analyst got it thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of tom gallagher from evercore your line is now open tom gallagher evercore isi analyst good morning also a few questions on japan sales any product enhancements or product expansion in terms of the relationship between you and japan post that you re planning or are you just still selling the same initial cancer product that you launched there daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer what i would do is to ask koide to talk about the four different groups that have full warmed within japan post koide you want to talk a little bit about that masatoshi koide president and representative director foreign language this is koide from aflac japan foreign language as we all know in this strategic alignments within december last year foreign language the third pillar of the three pillars of the strategic on this foreign language is to work on a new collaborative work with jp foreign language we will be working on both teams foreign language and leveraging business technology foreign language a new product of development corporation foreign language and during investment in the third party or the domestically internationally at business expansion together foreign language and cooperation with investments foreign language and for all these four stage that we have already launched working group and have started to have discussions foreign language that s all from me daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer and so what i would say is this that we are proceeding in a very methodical and cautious way to where we can have products and services that will enhance not only our business but also enhanced dependent those business and it never moves as fast as any other s launch but i m very pleased with the cooperation of both aflac japan s management team and also what they re doing with japan post though as i ve said 2019 is a year of planning 2020 will be part of execution and moving forward so we are working toward that end tom gallagher evercore isi analyst okay that s helpful and then my follow up is just did i hear correctly in one of the responses that you re revising the medical rider again in 2q after revising it in 1q or did i not understand that correctly the reason i ask is there are you changing something relative to what you did initially with the launch of that product or is that can you a little bit elaborate on that daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer let s have koji koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language well what we are going to do is that there are some things that we would nicely able to incorporate some of the changes incorporated in the january change of revisions foreign language and i m not able to elaborate on the details because it has not been announced yet foreign language as we try to provide a very good product based on the needs foreign language we would likely providing these kind of benefits and coverage depending on the status of our customers health because our policy life is very long daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer yeah let me just say that this is not unusual in that when we re dealing with our sales people they come up with ideas and thoughts and we look back to see if there s anything that we can ultimately make it more sales appealing so i wouldn t take into this anything major this is a minor adjustment and but if it will help our sales people then we try to work toward that end frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer just to be clear though this has always been our plan we re not redoing anything in june or second quarter in response to our result in first quarter this has been our plan all along tom gallagher evercore isi analyst got you thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of jimmy bhullar of jpmc your line is now open jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst hi good morning first i had a question for eric on just the new money yield it was up a lot i think 3 29 in japan and a lot higher than the portfolio yields so to what extent is this a better rate environment or what i suspect it is just the decision to allocate more money i guess to us dollar investments and would you expect the new money yield to drop as the year goes on versus the 1q level eric kirsch global chief investment officer thanks jimmy it s definitely not a function of the rate environment because the rates are lower all around the globe but it is more reflection of asset allocation so you re right on that part and perhaps like japan approximately half just a little bit under half went into us dollar assets and a good portion of that went into our loan portfolio transitional real estate and middle market loans and those are having average yields from 5 5 6 up to 7 on middle market loans so that s really the driver of the higher new money yield it s really asset allocation because from a new money perspective as you know yields have been coming down spreads have gotten tighter fortunately for us relative to our income objectives for the year that s not a big driver of whether or not we would make our numbers and the asset allocation i described is within our plan so there s nothing that deviated and for the loan portfolio we start to receive prepayments on those loans and therefore they get reinvested back into dollars so our asset allocation is very much in line with our strategic asset allocation and how the underlying loan portfolios are performing for the rest of the year i wouldn t expect big deviations necessarily subject to of course market yields and any tactical actions we might take if something were to present itself in the market jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst and then maybe a question for todd on the just the whole full policy versus the rider dynamic can you sort of give us an idea on what s the premiums per policy are if you sell the rider versus selling stand alone policy and that just to be able to assess how much is that weighing on your sales this year todd daniels director and principal financial officer yeah i m going to hand it to koji they had some numbers and will came refer to this koji ariyoshi director and head of sales and marketing foreign language the rider versus the base policy is 15 to 16 premium foreign language in the case of the income support rider 15 to 16 in the case of care riders 15 to 20 todd daniels director and principal financial officer so i think it varies greatly by which rider you re looking at versus a base policy and one thing to keep in mind is these riders are limited benefits versus buying the entire base policy for our income support rider it s covering long term being out of work and supporting your income where this rider that we ve developed is a lump sum one time payment so it s a limited benefits to try to make it more affordable for the customer to purchase this as a rider same thing with the care option for the older age people it s sold as a lump sum benefit so the premium is going to be quite a bit less than if we were to design and develop a true nursing care policy jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst okay and just lastly for fred will the post be required to file with the sec once they get to 5 stake i m assuming they will be but frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we would expect them to after obviously follow all of the guidelines associated with the reporting jimmy bhullar jp morgan chase analyst okay thank you frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer the nyse operator thank you next question is from the line of greg peters of raymond james your line is now open greg peters raymond james analyst good morning i was wondering if we could just step back from a big picture perspective and i guess i got to say upfront i realize your us business has a different focus but i was hoping you could comment on all the recent political rhetoric around the possibility of medicare for all and what your perspective is on that daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer i ll say something and then i ll see if teresa our medicare for all is nothing more in my opinion than some form of what we see in japan with their national healthcare system granted they ve gone from no deductibles to 10 to 20 and to 30 but we have been selling it in environment since inception that consumers would own some type of major medical insurance whether it be blue cross blue shield to obamacare to anything that might be out there because there are costs associated with unexpected expenses that are not covered by any type of medicare medicaid whatever it might be so from our standpoint i don t think it s going to change how we address these issues i do think it will we will hear a lot about it with the election in 2020 but i don t think when it all boils down that it s going to change anything in terms of the way we are selling now so i really don t worry about that from that standpoint i m paid to worry so i do watch it carefully but there is nothing on the horizon that makes me nervous about that teresa teresa l white president of aflac us i think you ve pretty much summed it up at the end of the day i think it becomes more apparent to the consumer about their risks and gaps when they have whichever coverage whether it s medicare for all or it s blue cross blue shield as you mentioned so from that perspective i think the value of our product the value of what aflac offers continues to be apparent which ever major medical you have as a consumer daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer and let me say this is a company we want everybody to have health insurance teresa l white president of aflac us absolutely daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer we re absolutely for that we think it s in the best interest the cost associated with it are going to be through the route because as you know in other countries they have they limit medical access on different things and we would be the first country that would go to a period of where you would have unlimited access with unlimited calls so the cost associated with it is another issue political one in my opinion but just know we as a company want people to have it because we think we ve got the product that will help build those gaps that are going to be created in today s society greg peters raymond james analyst thank you for that answer i guess staying on the same theme of politics there s also been rhetoric around share repurchase activity and i m curious dan at the board level if you guys are starting to change your thinking around capital allocation is ready to share repurchase versus perhaps possibly a dividend or a special dividend or anything like that frederick j crawford executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is fred i ll answer and then and then dan can pickup from the board level but i think just in terms of capital allocation obviously after a 36 year track record of increasing the dividend and certainly intending to continue that track record we feel like we re in good shape on balancing the dynamics of investing in our business buying back stock and paying out a common stock dividend in terms of stock repurchase it remains a very good investment of the company particularly on a risk adjusted basis and it also is the basis upon which we measure up other opportunities the degree to which other nonorganic for example opportunities can come into play i think from the political perspective the only thing i would generally agree with because i think it s just good management and that is you don t have the company you don t deserve to be significantly buying back your stock and frankly paying a high dividend until you first and foremost secure your balance sheet and secure your capital ratios in such a way that you can meet all the promises of your policyholders and frankly meet any obligations you have to your employees that includes pension obligations and so there s elements of it i agree with however i don t see any need to regulate that type of dynamic i think frankly good management and governance self regulates those issues in my view so that s my thing daniel p amos chairman and chief executive officer and i think our position all along has been a very moderate position we haven t been extreme on any area and it s the extremism that brings on the most criticism and so i think we re very well positioned i think we will continue at this pace the board will of course constantly review that to see if there s any areas that they think we should be looking at but i think there is anything you know about our company is we try to look ahead of what the trends are no matter what they might be political consumer activism or whatever it might be to make sure we re on top of what s taking place though i can assure you this is a top of nine subjects that we will continue to monitor but we feel we re well positioned right now greg peters raymond james analyst again thank you for your answers david a young vice president investor and rating agency relations and that brings us to the top of the hour 10 00 am i appreciate

financial serpent in this bullish paradise it takes the form of the us dollar this has been an epic year for investors so far markets have been in risk on mode all this year 2019 has seen just about every asset class enjoy monster rallies even if it hasn t always felt terribly cheerful on this side of the atlantic what with shrieking brexit headlines everywhere according to bank of america merrill lynch by mid april commodities were up nearly 20 global stocks by 14 and junk bonds by about 7 that has made it one of the strongest starts to a year on record fair enough the year started on a low following the panic in the last quarter of 2018 even so that s an impressive start to the year though notably 1987 started off in the same way so let s not count our chickens yet anyway one thing about a risk on market is this you d normally expect it to be accompanied by a weaker us dollar why firstly the us dollar is generally viewed as a safe haven asset when people are feeling exuberant they sell dollars and dollar assets to buy riskier assets overseas so that s one reason why the continued strength of the dollar is a little surprising second a stronger us dollar typically goes hand in hand with tighter monetary policy the federal reserve has u turned quite dramatically this year on interest rates and yet the dollar has hung on and in fact stubbornly continued to head higher indeed this week the us dollar index a measure of the strength of the american currency against a basket of the currencies of its main trading partners hit its highest point for the year and it s now near a two year high that s a bit of a worry for the bulls for a third reason that is a strong us dollar effectively means tighter monetary policy for the entire world put simply everyone needs dollars so the more expensive they are the less money there is for everything else we re already seeing the resulting squeeze having an impact on the world s more perennially fragile markets such as argentina and turkey and if the dollar stays up here for much longer the jitters could spread to emerging economies normally viewed as more resilient as macro intelligence 2 partners points out in a recent commentary the dollar at this level is stuck firmly in the middle of the crisis zone a band where historically dollar strength was sufficient to trigger the latam debt crisis in the 80s the asian crisis in the 90s and china s 2015 devaluation that s a bit of a worry are we facing a melt up or a meltdown so why has the us dollar been so strong a lot of it is simply down to weakness in other currencies it s true that the fed u turned at the start of this year but so has pretty much every other central bank in the world europe is slowing down china is warming up to do more stimulus japan is well japan the uk has brexit to suppress sterling australia s economy is slowing due to its house price bubble popping sweden has just decided to do more quantitative easing in effect the fed is losing the war of the doves the us is hardly enjoying epic economic growth and yet it is still one of the healthiest looking economies out there with central banks around the world showing no signs of raising rates that should be good for asset prices but the risk is that a strong dollar not only exerts a pinch on vulnerable countries with dollar denominated debt but also that it starts to squeeze earnings for big us companies a big chunk of profits in the s p 500 derive from overseas sales some are already feeling the pinch us conglomerate 3m maker of post it notes issued a profit warning yesterday and saw its share price tumble by more than 10 combine a strong dollar with a weakening global economy and that s a recipe for a profit squeeze which is in turn bad news for highly valued share prices now if i m writing about this it s hardly a big secret so it s quite possible that a nervy fed will act to curb dollar strength or that donald trump will get on twitter and try to talk it down to be clear if janet yellen was running the show right now i reckon the fed would already have stopped quantitative tightening qt and raised hints about another bout of qe but yellen is not in charge any more and the market has yet to fully believe that jerome powell has its back my base case at the moment is that we get the melt up followed by meltdown scenario driven mainly by overly loose monetary policy allowing inflationary pressure to get out of hand but if the us dollar doesn t turn lower soon we might have to see another big plunge in the s p 500 to convince the fed that it needs to address this by the way to be clear i am not calling for fed intervention i like the idea of free markets being able to roam as they see fit ideally being informed by economic reality rather than the volume of printed money available but this is the way the world currently works for the bull case to win out from here we probably need to see the fed pull another surprise out of its hat for more on melt ups and meltdowns check out my colleague merryn somerset webb s letter in the latest issue of moneyweek magazine and get your first six issues free here if you haven t already

credit suisse cs reported net profit of chf 749 billion for the first quarter of 2019 which is 8 higher than the first quarter of 2018 and 11 higher than consensus expectations however the increase was solely the result of a lower tax rate pretax profit of chf 1 1 billion was stable compared with the first quarter of 2018 we expect a full year pretax profit increase of 39 which may look a bit rich considering the flat first quarter however we point out that the first quarter of 2018 contributed 31 of pretax profit and the first half of 2018 accounted for 62 of pretax profit we maintain our narrow moat rating and fair value estimate and believe the shares are undervalued group revenue declined 4 year over year as primary market activities in the investment bank collapsed equity underwriting and debt underwriting declined 44 and 27 respectively year on year management did indicate that there is a substantial pipeline of deals that should support future revenue growth the key wealth management banking businesses did see a revenue decline of 3 year on year but given market weakness and a flattening yield curve we view this as a robust result most pleasingly the wealth management businesses recorded a net new money inflow of chf 10 billion for the first quarter of 2019 despite buying back chf 261 million of shares credit suisse managed to maintain its common equity tier 1 ratio at 12 6 we continue to believe that 2019 will be the first relatively clean fiscal year for the better part of a decade with earnings free of distortions from noncore portfolios in rundown this should confirm the solid profitability of credit suisse s underlying business to the market we also believe that the market has to date not acknowledged the significant derisking that has taken place at credit suisse compared with a few years ago credit suisse relies much less on volatile trading revenue and is on much sounder capital footing true profitability has been hidden the profitability of credit suisse s core businesses comfortably exceeds its cost of capital we estimate a midcycle return on equity of 12 compared with our cost of capital estimate of 10 a few issues have concealed the company s true profitability as part of the process of derisking the business away from volatile sales and trading credit suisse has run down a massive noncore book of eur 130 billion to eur 20 billion since 2015 incurring cumulative before tax losses of eur 15 billion in the process to add insult to injury credit suisse has incurred legal expenses of chf 7 billion over the past four years credit suisse has often been criticized that it was behind ubs ubs in adapting its strategy to the new requirements for swiss private banks the market has hounded credit suisse to reduce its exposure to risky sales and trading and replicate ubs business mix where wealth management dominates however there are many more similarities between credit suisse and ubs than there are differences we believe that losses booked out of the noncore portfolio have led investors to overestimate the importance of sales and trading to credit suisse wealth management provides a moat we believe credit suisse deserves a narrow moat for its wealth management business we find moats for intangible assets and switching costs in wealth management a moat for intangible assets is built on a firm s reputation specialized expertise and scope of services we also believe that the complexity of client needs supports wider moats the needs of clients become more complex as one moves up the wealth pyramid credit suisse emerged as one of the stronger banks after the 2008 financial crisis and did not need a government bailout its reputation did suffer from the tax evasion investigation and subsequent fines levied by the u s authorities however while a well known and respected brand is important to attract clients it is an equally important consideration for incumbent and prospective bankers and relationship managers credit suisse was rated the third best private bank globally by its peers in the 2017 euromoney awards and was rated very highly in the key growth markets of the middle east first and asia second after the 2009 crisis the importance of capital adequacy to a bank s reputation has increased this is illustrated by the significant outflows ubs experienced from its wealth management business when there were concerns surrounding the bank s level of capital credit suisse has one of the highest core tier 1 equity ratios in europe but its leverage ratio has been problematic even more so than main rival ubs given credit suisse s historical focus on fixed income trading we believe that complexity supports moats in wealth management and that ultra high net worth individuals and family offices are a much more moaty business than the mass affluent market ultra high net worth individuals and family offices have needs that are as complex as those of institutional investors if not more so they may need access to structured financing generational wealth planning family office support and international tax planning across multiple geographies they also tend to have much more complex portfolios often including family businesses real estate hedge funds and other illiquid assets these issues are typically outside the ability of advisors at lower tier firms hiring professionals to address these issues is not cheap and only a relative handful of companies have enough ultra rich clients to make the cost worth their while many have international holdings which increases the complexity of compliance with anti money laundering know your customer tax reporting and other regulations credit suisse confirms our view at a recent investor day it showed that typical returns on risk adjusted capital in its ultra high net worth segment exceed 30 while returns in the mass affluent market vary between 10 and 15 ultra high net worth clients value strong relationships with their bankers typically built up over years often across generations we believe that credit suisse s client base faces high switching costs typically for wealth managers and commercial banks we believe that switching costs are mostly implicit and include losing a valued relationship with the incumbent advisor the time necessary to find and vet a new advisor and or firm the paperwork involved in moving accounts and the mental energy needed to choose and approve new investment vehicles these switching costs are all true for credit suisse as well but we believe the company s book with its significant portion of ultra high net worth individuals faces even higher switching costs it will have deep relationships with its clients spanning various investment transactional and lending products often integrated which makes pricing opaque products are often tailor made to the client s needs so it is impossible for a client to easily compare pricing the daunting prospect of untangling the web of products that a client has with a bank is often enough to prevent the client from moving to a competitor private bank clients will typically not only have investment products with their bank the distinction between a private bank and a wealth manager is blurry and often overlooked we believe it is important a private bank that offers its clients transactional and lending products raises switching costs compared with wealth management businesses that only offer investment products we believe that having an in house investment bank improves the ability to provide complex solutions to ultra high net worth clients these individuals are also often entrepreneurs who have banking needs in their business capacity in addition to their personal needs the ability to service the client s business as well as personal needs is a major competitive advantage however an investment bank is much more capital hungry than a pure private bank and introduces added risks that may detract from a bank s reputation for solidity in the case of ubs its investment banking adventures nearly led to the bank s demise swiss banking environment attractive an evaluation of the banking system that a bank operates in is critical for us to have a high level of conviction in the moats we find for an individual bank we define a banking system in broader terms than merely the regulatory environment in a particular jurisdiction competitive political and economic elements also contribute to the robustness of a system to withstand banking crises overall we assign ratings to banking systems into four buckets very good good fair and poor we view the swiss banking system as very good the only european country that we accord this rating globally it is only the australian and canadian banking systems that we view equally positively the swiss regulatory environment is exceptionally strong and the swiss national bank s requirements often exceed those of the basel accord and the european banking authority switzerland is one of the world s most stable democracies and its devolved cantonal system of government limits the potential of populist extremist parties competition in switzerland is also less intense and more rational than in most other european jurisdictions ubs and credit suisse dominate the swiss banking sector holding 50 of all swiss banking assets partially state owned cantonal banks and mutually owned raiffeisen account for 25 of swiss banking assets but we believe that in contrast to some other jurisdictions in europe the cantonal banks are much more rational in pricing and there is a desire to cover cost of capital in fact the cantonal banks are more profitable than the pure commercial banks switzerland has a long history as the banker to the world and 25 of cross border assets around the world are managed there historically swiss banking was best known for its fabled numbered of anonymous accounts the numbered account and indeed any amount of privacy over financial matters the global consensus seems to be that the right of the majority to have unfettered access to data trumps the right of privacy of the individual the u s clampdown on offshore tax structures and antiterrorism measures further eroded the swiss reputation for guardians of financial information the bailout of ubs by the swiss government in 2009 did damage to the popular image of the inviolable stability of swiss banks however we believe that swiss banks remain attractive to the world s elite for two main reasons first swiss neutrality and second the swiss franc both factors speak to downside protection and safeguarding of wealth switzerland has been neutral since 1815 and escaped the ravages of both world wars switzerland is also not aligned to any power bloc it is not an eu member nor is it a member of nato even for wealthy citizens of stable democracies in the rest of europe or north america switzerland represents a safe haven that provides diversification and liquidity to their portfolios the swiss franc has long been seen as an alternative for gold during the 2008 and 2011 financial crises the franc appreciated against both the u s dollar and the euro illustrating this concept the removal of the franc s peg against the euro in 2015 enhanced the attraction of the franc as portfolio diversification tool to minimize risk the franc also serves as protection against any debasement of other major currencies by loose monetary policies market risk still exists credit suisse retains meaningful exposure to market risk despite scaling back and derisking its investment banking activities apart from trading credit suisse s wealth management and asset management revenues are linked to the market with fees based on assets under management also performance fees are more likely to occur in bull than bear markets traditional market risk measurements also do not capture the impact of declining markets on client behavior where lower client risk appetite typically lead to lower new business inflows the extreme volatility of the postcrisis years is likely to be a thing of the past however revenue denominated in u s dollars makes up 49 of credit suisse s overall revenue yet dollar denominated costs contribute only 34 to total costs credit suisse is thus positively correlated to a weak swiss franc credit suisse estimates that a strengthening of 10 of the franc dollar will lead to a decline of pretax earnings of chf 468 million which we estimate is around 11 of normalized pretax earnings net interest income makes up 30 of overall revenue which is a lower portion than one would find at a typical universal bank in its 2016 risk disclosure credit suisse indicates that a 1 parallel shift in the yield curve will lead to a chf 500 million change in profits before tax we estimate this equates to 11 of normalized profits before tax credit suisse has one of the lowest exposures to credit risk in our european coverage universe on balance sheet lending is not an important part of the overall business model loans make up only 35 of the balance sheet and 80 of loans are granted to clients of the swiss universal bank or wealth management clients we view these as very high quality exposures in addition 75 of all credit exposures are secured by collateral if one looks at credit suisse s core equity tier 1 ratio of 12 8 it seems to be comfortably capitalized however its leverage ratio of 3 8 is very close to the minimum 3 5 required by the swiss national bank we are a bit puzzled as to why credit suisse did not raise more capital to create a more comfortable buffer when it made its capital call in 2017 both credit suisse s liquidity coverage ratio and its net stable funding ratio are comfortably above 100 which indicates sound liquidity to our mind these ratios while helpful do not fully capture the quality of a bank s funding one should also consider the structure of a bank s funding where the relatively lower importance of wholesale deposits in credit suisse s funding mix is a clear positive however private banking wealth management clients will typically be more sophisticated than the average retail banking client and therefore more likely to withdraw funds in times of stress we therefore do not believe that private banking deposits are as sticky as general retail deposits although they remain more sticky than wholesale funding

the quarter and our full year 2019 outlook noel will then provide a few quick thoughts before we open it up to q a our net sales declined 3 in q1 we delivered 3 organic sales growth with 1 unit volume growth and 2 favorable pricing this was offset by negative foreign exchange impact of 6 we know that there is still work to do but we are pleased with the further improvement in organic sales growth in the quarter as we believe our strategy is to reaccelerate growth are beginning to bear fruit importantly the composition of the growth gives us comfort that we are returning to a more sustainable trajectory on an organic basis we delivered both volume and pricing growth for the first time in over two years with volume and pricing growth in all four of our categories oral care pet nutrition personal care and home care we delivered geographically balanced organic sales growth with emerging markets and developed markets both up 3 and we delivered breadth in our organic sales growth with more than 75 of our hubs delivering organic sales growth in the quarter our focus on driving the core through innovation attacking adjacent segments and expanding the availability of our brands in new and higher growth channels and markets is beginning to pay off coupled with our increased brand support we are optimistic that we can continue to deliver against the expectations for 2019 that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call on a gaap basis our gross profit margin was down 130 basis points year over year excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program it was down 110 basis points year over year for the quarter our 200 basis points of pricing provided a 70 basis point benefit to gross margin raw materials costs including foreign exchange transaction costs were at 320 basis point drag on gross margin year over year our productivity programs led by our funding the growth initiatives provided a 150 basis point benefit to gross margin other was a 10 basis point drag on an absolute basis advertising investment was up 3 year over year on a percent of sales basis advertising was up 60 basis points year over year with increases on a percent of sales basis in every division excluding charges resulting from our global growth and efficiency program and advertising spending our sg a expenses were down year over year in the first quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales benefiting from our productivity programs on a gaap basis diluted earnings per share of 0 65 were down 10 year over year in q1 excluding charges resulting from our global growth and efficiency program diluted earnings per share were down 10 to 0 67 our free cash flow in the quarter was 534 million which was up 7 versus q1 2018 taking a look at the divisional results north america delivered 3 net sales growth and 3 5 organic sales growth in the quarter with 2 volume growth and 1 5 pricing growth we saw strong sales growth in toothpaste in the quarter driven by colgate totalsf colgate optic white colgate essentials and tom s of maine club and e commerce delivered particularly strong toothpaste growth this quarter the colgate total relaunch is proceeding in line with our expectations as total s market share is up year over year since the launch in the u s we took pricing through a downsizing and this should lead to a shorter repurchase cycle which should accelerate unit growth going forward as consumers come back more quickly north america also benefited from the strong growth in the eltamd and pca skincare businesses we acquired during q1 of 2018 these brands are delivering very strong growth across a number of channels including professional b2c and e commerce europe s net sales were down 7 in q1 driven by negative foreign exchange organic sales were up 0 5 in the quarter as volume growth of 1 5 was mostly offset by negative pricing of 1 while categories in europe remained sluggish our market shares were up or flat in 7 to 10 categories we delivered strong volume growth in northern europe with the uk and scandinavia both up on the back of the colgate total relaunch we have reintroduced colgate total in scandinavia and it is driving strong incremental market share gains in that region we also launched meridol pure in several markets in europe in q1 which brings our top therapeutic gum offering into the natural space at a premium price in personal care we continue to drive significant share gains behind the sanex body wash business in france sanex s body wash share is up more than 100 basis points year to date behind sanex 0 and the sanex physiologic brand latin america we are pleased with our acceleration in organic sales growth in latin america in q1 net sales declined 4 5 in the quarter as 10 5 negative foreign exchange more than offset 2 5 volume growth and 3 5 pricing growth in the quarter importantly the growth was broad based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub we are particularly pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in brazil in the quarter versus q4 2018 as we delivered both pricing and volume growth encouragingly category trends in brazil do seem to be better although the market remains very promotional our recent innovations in oral care are paying off nicely as we are seeing market share gains for our colgate natural extract toothpaste line our colgate guard franchise in pharmacies in brazil and the colgate slim soft advanced toothbrush net sales in asia pacific were down 8 driven by negative foreign exchange of 5 5 a 2 5 decline in volume and flat pricing our results in china remain challenged by the difficult steps we are taking to reorient our portfolio and in oral care category that is rapidly premiumizing and shifting into e commerce as we indicated in january we still expect trends to improve in the second half of the year encouragingly we saw strong growth in both volume and pricing in india with growth coming on both the colgate maxfresh and colgate vedshakti franchises in order to drive penetration of vedshakti we recently gave away 30 million samples at the ardh kumbh mela festival in india our africa eurasia business showed solid underlying business momentum in q1 despite the negative impact of foreign exchange fx was a 13 drag on sales growth in the quarter offsetting 7 pricing growth and flat volume our eurasia hub delivered a strong mixture of pricing and volume growth in the quarter driven by russia our north africa middle east turkey hub also delivered volume growth in the quarter despite significant pricing to offset foreign exchange in order to help continue this momentum we launched the full meridol regimen toothpaste toothbrushes and mouth rinse in the pharmacy channel in turkey in the first quarter we also launched palmolive micellar care shower gel in russia this past quarter taking advantage of a big personal care trend and finally hills our strong growth at hills continued in q1 growth was led by the united states with particularly strong growth in e commerce pet specialty and farm and feed internationally our growth was very broad based we delivered both volume and pricing growth in canada europe australia asia and latin america as we discussed at cagny q1 marked the beginning of our relaunch of our science diet brand with the new packaging on shelf as we speak initial response has been positive as science diet market share trends continue to increase year over year in q1 the relaunch will continue across the globe through the first half of 2020 we have also significantly exceeded our subscription targets for our hill s to home service which allows pet parents to realize the benefits of home delivery while maintaining contact with the veterinarian moving on to full year guidance we continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits we continue to expect organic sales to be up to 2 to 4 based on current spot rates for the full year we still expect gross margin to be up year over year on both a gaap basis and excluding charges related to our global growth and efficiency program we expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs which includes the impact of transnational foreign exchange we expect our advertising spending to be up notably year over year on both an absolute basis and as a percent of sales we would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the q1 level we continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25 5 and 26 5 both on a gaap basis and excluding charges related to our global growth and efficiency program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to u s tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 based on current spot rates we expect gaap earnings per share to be down low single digits for the year excluding the charges related to the global growth and efficiency program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to u s tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 based on current spot rates we expect earnings per share to decline mid single digits for the year we would note that the consensus eps estimate is in the middle of that range and with that i will turn it over to noel for his thoughts before the q a noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks john and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today i thought it appropriate to begin by framing three strategic areas of focus for our company that i believe will be critical to our ongoing success and we certainly started to see transpire in the first quarter the first area of focus is how we re thinking about organic sales growth no question that to deliver long term revenue growth that s sustainable we need to be more aggressive about going after growth and we re going after growth differently as you recall in the fourth quarter call and at cagny i spoke about some of our growth mindset specifically we re driving the colgate brands like total and science diet remember these are big brands big brands with a global penetration in many countries around the world and we re bringing that to market through significant new innovation and superior product and formulations we d also bringing that alongside significant brand building along those businesses with real brand purpose that resonates with consumers in the different way second we re going after adjacent categories and product segments like naturals which is doing very well for us therapeutics by expanding elmex and meridol to select markets and importantly expanding skincare and continuing to focus our investment on opening new doors and channels with that category third we re expanding the availability of our products through distribution and new markets being very thoughtful in that regard but we see opportunities in new channels particularly in channels like e commerce which is key to our continued growth moving forward we were very pleased with the growth in e commerce in the first quarter which was up 28 versus the year ago period so more to do and more to come and we re certainly focused on those areas our second key area of focus is to simplify our processes and our structures around the world we recognize that we need to change in order to respond to a rapidly changing marketplace in terms of our ease and how consumers are shopping for example we ve revamping our innovation process to dramatically reduce the time to market you heard my dear fellows ph speak about that at cagny and those changes are under way beginning in latin america and we ll begin to roll those out around the world as we move into the balance of the year third area of focus for us is using data and looking to digitize the organization very differently we know that data can enable faster growth and faster decision making we know that data drives further roi in media and we know that data driven marketing is far better return on investment than the way we re spending today we also know that we can use data to improve our assortment in e commerce in the area of digitization some exciting thing is coming down the pipeline for us to drive productivity across the organization we re going to change from our sap system that we ve had in that we started in 1994 to the upgraded sap s 4hana which we think is going to simplify our processes significantly around the world drive more standardization and better reporting and decision making from all of that so you begin to see a lot of this unfold as we move into the balance of the year we re pleased to see some of that taking hold in the first quarter of this year so before i jump into q a i wanted to take a moment to thank the 35 000 colgate people for supporting me during this important transition over the last year i m extremely proud to lead to listen and to learn from that extraordinary team and i know with their drive and continued commitment and our focus on growth we will build a future to inaudible and it s those people that i want to extend a special thanks to ian cook for the past 12 years of his extraordinary leadership as ceo of this company he has transformed this organization in many ways and we ll be forever grateful for his leadership i especially want to thank him for his wise counsel and mentorship over the last six months as he has prepared me for this new role so with that let me turn it over to the questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and we will take our first question today from lauren lieberman with barclays please go ahead lauren rae lieberman barclays analyst great thanks good morning noel i was curious if we could you talk a little bit about market shares just you know market shares in oral care have been an important metric for the business like health of the business and so on and like a badge of honor frankly and this quarter topline certainly improved sequentially but shares are down versus i think where we talked about them at the end of january both globally and in some key markets like brazil mexico india so can you just talk a little bit about that how you re thinking about market share in particular when you would expect that to turn as you think about the path forward and some to the greater growth mindset you re putting in play thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure thanks lauren overall we have seen significant growth first of all on untracked channels particularly in u s where we saw double digit growth in a lot of those untracked channels which we re very encouraged about if i stay within north america the toothpaste shares are flat we obviously introduce colgate total in the middle of february we saw a significant competitive response and we ve responded accordingly but we weren t going to deal overly aggressive in order to drive share bear in mind that we are in this for the long term this is a marathon not a sprint with the launch of colgate total it s not like introducing a new product we have existing shelf space and existing penetration it s a big brand and we re looking to continue the drive trial and repeat throughout the year so the way we ve structured and strategized our media spending over the year is to continue with high investments quarter on quarter through the balance of the year and we think in the end that would generate sustained growth for the business moving on to some of the other markets our value shares and volume shares in mexico are actually flat we re slightly down in brazil and that was due to some aggressive promotion from the competitive environment recognize that the colgate total launch which will have a significant premium in both those markets which where it has a sizable share will launched in the second quarter our volume shares on balance are only down 30 basis points so we feel quite comfortable with where we are particularly given the activity in most of the total spending coming in the year to go operator we ll take the next question from bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie herzog wells fargo securities llc research division analyst all right thank you good morning so i had a question on your pricing in the quarter i guess i m wondering why it slowed sequentially and then i m also curious about this for your emerging markets where i assume you would have been taking more pricing for fx and then could you update us on your plan to any future pricing or essentially do you expect pricing to accelerate in the future or remain constant at current levels thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure thanks bonnie we were actually very pleased with the balance of organic growth in the first quarter obviously both volume and pricing up we had good pricing in the fourth quarter as you ve pointed out and likewise good pricing in the first quarter so coming off of that we re quite pleased some of the pricing still yet to come we talked about in the fourth quarter the two thirds would roll through from 2018 to 2019 we have a third to go and we re quite confident that we will generate the pricing that we set out for ourselves on the year certainly at the current spot rates if spot rates change we certainly have to look to take more pricing but we re quite comfortable with where we are and how that s flowed through specifically on total we re very pleased from the fact that we ve seen pricing stick everywhere we have launched colgate total coming back to the u s our equivalized shares as john mentioned we downsized the price per ounce is up about 16 in the total toothpaste franchise and the u s is up 8 so price is holding and more to come as we move through the balance of the year operator and the next question will come from wendy nicholson with citi wendy nicholson citigroup inc research division analyst hi good morning just following up on china specifically could you tell us exactly how much volumes were down in china and i know you re going through a big repositioning of the brand and product assortment in that market but can you sort of give us some timing on that when should we expect to see stronger numbers are there specific new products coming out or new advertising or anything like that so when do you think we turn positive in china thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure so china came in as we expected in the quarter we had i think communicated in the fourth quarter call that we expected china to turn in the back half and that s exactly the timing that we re still looking for some significant changes in investment going into china as we speak we are looking at obviously to get the portfolio structured appropriately we re getting the structure in the organization and putting resources where we think the growth will come in that business moving forward so we re making some investments in the business in the short term that we believe would drive sustainable growth in the long term for our business which will be we ll start to see that turn in the back half of the year operator and we ll go to andrea teixeira with jpmorgan andrea teixeira jp morgan chase co research division analyst thank you good morning so my question is on north america organic volumes and a follow up on the colgate total relaunch so on north america you called out on the prepared remarks that the benefit from eltamd and pca skin now included in organic growth can you give us like kind of a sort of magnitude not a magnitude of that launch about ph that launch and the inclusion on the organic growth and also on the colgate total relaunch thinking about specifically latin america with brazil in terms of the timing of the launch will all the volume of the relaunch be shipped during the second quarter you had some of that done in the first quarter so i m trying to see if there is any lumpiness on the volume as we progress through the quarters thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks andrea again a good growth in the first quarter out of north america we re not going to break it out but suffice to say all of the key elements of the north america business grew in the first quarter we were particularly pleased with tom s of maine which had another significant growth following a sequential growth over the last three quarters so that s doing well the sell in on total performed well obviously as you ve pointed out pca and elta were added into the organic growth not a significant portion but we re very pleased with the progress on that business that we ve seen thus far so overall a good performance in north america across a well balanced organic growth in all of their categories and their core businesses in terms of the relaunch of our colgate total in latin america we just started shipping at the end of the first quarter with most of the activity and all of the investment to come in the second quarter so i would say a portion in the first most to come in the second as we move forward operator we ll go to ali dibadj with bernstein ali dibadj sanford c bernstein co llc research division analyst i m just trying to contextualize some of the discussions so far in the quarterly results in a little bit more broad and you ve done that a couple of times but i want to continue on that theme the big debate i think is are you spending enough that s the one i hear the most and so if you look at the quarter s results you could argue that they are consistent with that concerning narrative right we re not spending enough to turn the ship the sequential pricing i e probably more create spend more promo this quarter to get more shelf space there was clearly a lot of the inventory load right so that pricing that you guys talked about on colgate total for example in north america a lot of inventory loaded in elmex and others amp was up maybe not quite as much as i thought it might be but it s up which i guess is good but all this activity so far and we still see those market share issues in the u s and in mexico brazil russia india china i mean u k looks little bit better but still some pressure and by the way do you wonder in the u s what the sell out was versus the sell in so it doesn t look great on the tracked channels so i guess i m just trying to get underneath this idea of should we just be more patient to see those terms i think that s your messaging but should we just be more patient to see this upturn and so you re 100 confident that you re actually spending enough and so this concern about another rebase to happen around the corner or not spending enough that view is just so far what you re seeing going to be wrong noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks ali a lot in that question so let me try to step back for a moment talk a little bit about our strategy we realized to drive long term sustainable growth that we do things very thoughtfully and in a measured way we ve taken the advertising up as you well pointed out quite significantly in our view up in the first quarter we will hold those levels through the balance of the year and everything that we know about building brands particularly brands as big and as scalable as colgate total it s that continuity that really pays off in the long run we don t look to a percent to sales we look for what do we need to do to create the right impressions and the right engagement behind a significant innovation like colgate total and that s exactly what we re doing we re going to continue to plot away with the plan that we have we were very strategic in not making and not necessarily spending all of our money in the first quarter we want to balance out over the year we re not buying shelf space i heard you mention that and a brand like colgate total which is an existing brand in the u s at 10 share that s a successful brand already so what we re doing is basically trying to drive more velocity off the shelf we re not necessarily increasing shelf and we didn t necessarily see any of that in terms of shelf increases in the first quarter so we ve got strong shares strong shelf space and we re going to continue to build on that i ll give you a little bit about consumption on colgate total obviously as we move through some of the high competitive reactions in february and march the last four weeks on colgate total the consumption is up 40 and our share is up 1 point so we re in a good position relative to what we re seeing there and obviously a lot of the work to come as we move through the balance of the year and in terms of advertising we ll likewise see those increases come to bear as we roll it out particularly in big markets like latin america operator and the next question is from steve powers with deutsche bank steve powers deutsche bank ag research division analyst great thanks neol so as you talked about in the open you re arguably managing a larger number of growth priorities today versus history and i guess what i m wondering as we you can talk more about how you re prioritizing them relative to one other i m sure the first order of business is ensuring the colgate the core colgate oral care franchise returns to market leading growth but around that as you talked about you got the expansion into naturals you re broadening the reach of brands like elmex investing in e commerce stepping up support for professional skincare and obviously driving hill s as well and obviously not all of those initiatives are mutually exclusive but again how are you thinking about allocating relative investment dollars to each of them if you had an extra dollar which bucket are you most likely to add to and any thoughts if you can do it all organically or are you increasingly opened to m a in support of those initiatives thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks steve so let me go back to a little bit about with regards to my upfront comments around how we re framing growth as i talked about at cagny we re really looking at three specific priorities and in many respects that would kind of prioritize how we re spending that will unfold through the balance of the year historically we were very focused on line extensions and to a certain extent growing in the adjacencies and we quickly recognized that we have to have a real balance colgate has big core businesses that are in many countries around the world that had significant leakage relative to share and were not driving the growth that we needed hence our need to put real superior bundles behind the core in order to shore up the core so when we balance that with increased innovation behind adjacencies like naturals like therapeutics that we get the incremental growth moving forward and that s exactly how we re going to prioritize it relative to m a certainly there is a lot of activity out there we re still going to be extremely thoughtful on how we approach m a we ve obviously done some great m a over the last couple of years specifically pca and elta which we re very excited about as those assets become available we will think through them very carefully relative to their strategic fit in the business and what they bring and if we find the right value we will certainly go after them operator and we ll go to olivia tong with bank of america olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning i wanted to talk a little bit about the balance you talked a lot about the balance between developed markets versus emerging market performance volume versus price so as you progress through the year how do you think about that because i would assume that there you talked about some of the pricing that you re planning to do in some of the markets you know a third of it still hasn t rolled through so i would assume that price becomes a bigger component of that do you think that volume then sort of turns a little bit and just your overview on the balance between all those different factors thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure i think at the heart of a lot of that good balance this year particularly between emerging and the developed world was the fact that we re starting to see some of the categories turn in the emerging markets which is particularly encouraging for us given our footprint so moving forward we would continue to see that balance of pricing and volume moving through the balance of the year the innovation will support the volume that the innovation will support the premiumization that we re going after particularly as we see total and the science diet business which is just now going into the u s and the roll out through the balance of the year start to take hold so we ll continue to see the right balance as we move forward keeping the investment there will help drive that operator next is kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy jefferies analyst thanks good morning so noel my question is on the industry growth rates relative to your organic sales growth guidance of 2 to 4 so at this point where would you peg industry growth in total as you roll up your business and your geographies relative to the 3 organic growth in the quarter how has that changed if at all since 4q you sound more upbeat on emerging markets which is obviously a good thing and then for us is it fair that we should expect an acceleration in your organic sales growth over the next couple of quarters as year over year comp season and more spending goes into the marketplace and it seems like the emerging markets are in a better place so thank you for that noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure the categories as you mentioned we ve seen a pickup particularly in emerging we re modeling organic excuse me we re modeling category growth rates in that 3 to 5 5 depending on the market around the world in the developed world somewhere between flat to around 2 5 we ve seen a little bit of tick up in the u s europe continues to move sideways but the u s we ve seen a little bit of acceleration there so we think we re relative to our guidance on the 2 to 4 we re well positioned where the categories are and if latin america and particularly africa continue to accelerate or hold at their current levels that would bode well for us but we ve said that before let s get a couple of more quarters underneath us relative to those categories and we ll go from there operator we ll now go to bill chappell with suntrust bill chappell suntrust analyst thanks good morning noel first just a clarification you had said to bonnie s question we came into the year two thirds of pricing and still a third to go are we still a third to go or did you do a fair amount during first quarter and then the second just on hills can you give us a little more color on the strength and maybe from a market share perspective we don t get to see i mean so much of the channels are on track it s kind of hard to understand exactly where you re getting it is it from emphasis from the specialty channel coming back or is it just the vet channels doing well or just kind of help us give us more color why it s doing better noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure well let me take the pricing question first yes we re about right we re right where we thought we d be about two third s of the business we re seeing roll through and the third to go and we ve got some pricing that s going into place starting in the second quarter so we re quite comfortable with that in terms of how that s going to roll through the balance of the quarters in 19 hills is a great story i come back to a lot of the fundamentals of our strategy which is driving the core working on adjacencies and particularly expanding into new segments and new retail environments and hill s ticks those boxes extraordinarily well we obviously had great growth in the fourth quarter really strong start to the year relative to what we re seeing the science diet relaunch just now going into the market as i mentioned in terms of the full impact of the new packaging and the new formulations which as i mentioned at cagny will be coupled with increased pricing and the media investment behind that business particularly in north america we ll now start to go into the market in the second quarter our u s had a very strong first quarter and again i think it s driven by great market share gains particularly in pet specialty we obviously continue to have a very strong e commerce business and holding shares there and we in terms of expanding into new channels we ve gone aggressively after part the farm and feed channel which was growing and we were under indexed and we ve seen incremental distribution and sales growth come from that so all in all really pleased with where hill s is right now and particularly pleased given a lot of the science diet stuff is still to come in the u s and we ll start to roll that out in the balance of the world as we move into the second half operator we ll go to robert ottenstein with evercore isi robert edward ottenstein evercore isi analyst great thank you very much and nice start to the year wondering if we could drill down a little bit more into what s going on to in brazil and so a couple of sub points perhaps you can talk a little bit more about the competitive situation you mentioned still very tough promo environment is there any visibility on that changing and how do you expect to deal with that second the rollout of the therapeutics elmex meridol in brazil how that s going do you need more investment there or is it kind of going to be self funding at this point and i guess tied to that how you re doing in the pharmacy channel thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer great thanks robert so again good results coming out of brazil we are pleased particularly given that we ve generated both volume and pricing in brazil in the quarter which was terrific to see in relative to the promotion environment yes we saw some of our competitors going quite aggressive in the first quarter we decided not to chase that with our business it was interesting the share loss that we saw in the first quarter which is roughly about a point on the business we re still at 72 a share came out of our kolynos our resale ph brand which is our secondary brand because of the deep discounting we saw from some our competitors that being said our instinct is that will particularly be driven by high promotional activity that we always see in the first quarter that we opted not to chase given some of the foreign exchange headwinds that we ve seen in that market and we think that will balance away itself out through the remainder of the year early days on elmex we have rolled it into the pharmacy channel the pharmacy channel is in a roughly 15 to 20 of the acv in brazil early news is really good on elmex in terms of driving incremental share in the pharmacy channel we re up about a point so far in that channel but lots more to go the investments there we ring fenced it it s an important strategic initiative for us and we re optimistic that we ll continue to see particularly that channel grow as we move through the balance of the year operator next is jason english with goldman sachs jason m english goldman sachs group inc analyst hi good morning folks thank you for the question sticking on the topic of going a little bit deeper into some of the markets can you take us a little bit deeper into china give us a beat on where you think your consumption is tracking and whether or not your net sales are still lagging on inventory reduction or whether or not that s been flushed out and then a second question and sorry for pausing on thinking about your gross margin trajectory for the year cost inflation headwind stepped down fairly sizably 4q to 1q how should we expect that to trend through the remainder of the year noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks jason so quickly coming back to china not a lot more to add there we re obviously it came in line with our expectations the inventory de stocking continues we ve made good progress in the fourth quarter continued progress in the first we re rebalancing as i mentioned some of our go to market structures and how we take the product to market particularly as it results around the portfolio specifically and that will unfold as we move through the balance of the year so as i said we expect to see sequential improvement moving through the back half of the year and that is on schedule as we speak relative to gross margin so your question around cost yes we saw a significant elevation of costs in the fourth quarter a little bit better in the first quarter we re in the range of 4 to 6 commodities in terms of increases moving through the gross profit line and we expect that to abate as we move through and lap some of the foreign exchange transaction impact that we had last year that occurred in the first half and will get better as we move through the balance of the year so the answer to your question is yes we expect that debate which is giving us confidence that we can continue to hold and increase gross margins moving forward operator we ll go to camille garshwala ph with credit suisse unidentified partcipant analyst good morning guys noel you mentioned e commerce in various parts of your prepared remarks can you perhaps provide us a little more context what your share looks like online results where maybe what your margins are like online versus elsewhere and then i think you said e commerce was up 28 are you able to give some context on how much that contributed to organic growth noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure first of all we re very pleased again coming back to those growth strategies that outlined earlier expanding in new retail environments and getting our fair share so to speak is a real strategic focus for us and e commerce is an important area of that as i mentioned we were up just shy of 29 in the first quarter importantly that was driven with a strong north america performance their shares were up 1 7 points on the colgate franchise alone which was terrific and likewise driven by a continued strong growth on the hill s business the little softness that we have is to a certain extent as in asia while the e commerce shares are flat we didn t see the growth that we were expecting there and that s part of the turnaround strategy that we re looking to execute as we move through the back half of this year operator next is steven strycula with ubs steven a strycula ubs investment bank research division analyst hi good morning and congratulations on the new seat so neol my question is as you look across the portfolio after the work you guys have done in the last few years which three countries in categories combinations do you think are the biggest revenue and profit dollar opportunity from an incrementality standpoint as we look forward the next few years and a quick second part of that would be is there any reason you guys haven t given anymore defined perimeter around your gross margin outlook for the year relative to what you did last quarter thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer so listen on the categories we love all our children equally in this case obviously oral care continues to be a real focus for us the first quarter organic that we delivered was largely driven by toothpaste and by hill s and so we re very encouraged but as john mentioned in his opening remarks we have positive organic across all the categories which in our view is the quality and the composition that we re ultimately looking for but from a prioritization certainly our oral care personal care and our pet food have always been our top three priorities and we ll continue to focus on growth in that regard in terms your second question was around gross margins listen we ve as i ve mentioned not much more to add we expect gross margins to be up on the year we expect some of the cost environment that we saw in the fourth and in the first quarter to abate as we move through the balance of the year we ve got more pricing to come and we obviously have the total relaunch and science diet relaunch rolling out around the world so we re comfortable with where we are now at the current spot rates and we ll see how that unfolds but comfortable in terms of the outlook that we ve given operator and we ll go to mark astrachan with stifel mark stiefel astrachan stifel nicolaus company incorporated research division analyst thanks and good morning everybody i wanted to ask about specific learning s from pca and elta i m curious do you think you can take those brands into other channels how you think about differences of selling into specific specialty type channels doctor s offices and the like versus mass or other channels and perhaps indulge me and kind of take that a step further what gives confidence that you can have success in skincare more broadly just given competitive dynamics in the market and i m kind of alluding to your comment about expanding on skincare going forward noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes thanks mark let me step back for a minute and give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we look at m a not just simply from the economics and the growth aspects of those categories of businesses that we acquired but more importantly what are the core competencies and learning s that they can bring into the larger enterprise across the company and elta and pca fit those parameters just perfectly obviously we love businesses with strong endorsement levels elta at the dermatology level pca at sufficient level and we ve learned from obviously what we ve done in oral care and our vet business on how to successfully monetize that going forward both those businesses have unique aspects to them elta has an incredible e commerce business and an influencer model particularly as they use digital very effectively likewise pca has a wonderful in office strategy in terms of how they go to market there particularly around their data driven marketing that they use so some great insights that we ll bring into the business and certainly leverage across other categories and we continue to dial up the investment in those businesses given the great growth that we re seeing coming out of them at least initially in the first quarter moving forward skincare is interesting to us so we ve got two businesses that we re focused on right now we ll continue to drive those moving forward if we see other things become available that we think are interested and will bring real value to the colgate company we will certainly go after those but we re very focused on what we have right now and that s how we re going to lay it out for the balance of the year so again let me extend my thanks to the entire colgate team obviously a good quarter that we should be proud of we all know there is a lot of work to do we re very focused on growth and let s get after it we re in the second quarter as they say and we ll be in touch with everyone on the call as we move through the balance of the quarter and into the third quarter thanks so much operator and thank you very much that does conclude our call for today i d like to thank everyone for your participation and you may now disconnect duration 46 minutes call participants john

compared to net income of 516 million in the same period of 2018 overall upstream gross oil equivalent production averaged 388 000 barrels per day up from 370 000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018 due to improved syncrude reliability and the restart of the norman wells operation gross production at kearl averaged 180 000 barrels per day in the first quarter consistent with the company s commitment to achieve full year production of 200 000 barrels per day in 2019 in addition the supplemental crusher project continues on schedule and is expected to be complete by year end increasing annual average production to 240 000 barrels per day in 2020 refinery throughput averaged 383 000 barrels per day compared to 408 000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018 petroleum product sales averaged 477 000 barrels per day in the first quarter essentially flat with the prior year downstream financial results were impacted by weaker industry product margins and lower refinery utilization first quarter operational performance was impacted by challenges in both the upstream and downstream early in the quarter in part due to extreme cold weather across the country furthermore the government of alberta s production curtailment order significantly affected financial performance as improved upstream realizations were more than offset by reduced downstream margins said rich kruger chairman president and chief executive officer alberta s mandated curtailment continues to impact crude by rail economics after increasing crude by rail shipments to record levels in late 2018 the company discontinued shipments in february late in the quarter the company resumed limited rail shipments and will continue to evaluate future movements as economically justified said kruger imperial declared a second quarter dividend of 22 cents per share an increase of 3 cents per share from the first quarter supported by the company s strong balance sheet and resilient cash flow imperial remains committed to returning cash to shareholders through the payment of a reliable and growing dividend and an ongoing share purchase program the volatility in crude prices over the last several months and resulting impact on upstream and downstream margins continue to demonstrate the value of imperial s balance and integration the company s upstream production midstream logistics and

by shrutee sarkar bengaluru reuters major central banks are done tightening policy according to a majority of economists polled by reuters with the growth outlook wilting across developed and emerging economies along with scant prospects for a surge in inflation while that is largely reflected in bond markets with major sovereign bond yields falling this year global equities have rallied and the s p 500 index is near record highs after its best start this year in more than three decades one striking conclusion from the latest surveys of over 500 economists from around the world covering more than 40 economies was not just a toning down of the economic outlook but a clear shift away from long held optimistic views although economists who answered an additional question were split on whether a deeper global economic downturn was more likely than a synchronized rebound this year s growth outlook was downgraded or left unchanged for 38 of the countries polled the recent weakness of global growth will persist for much longer than is commonly assumed a dovish turn by central banks and stimulus in china will not be enough to boost world gdp growth from its current slow pace noted jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics disappointing economic performance will leave inflation very low and cause monetary policy to be loosened almost across the board but we do not see this prompting any meaningful recovery until 2021 global growth was forecast to average 3 4 percent this year the lowest since polling began for 2019 almost two years ago the most optimistic prediction was also more modest than at the start of the year the 2020 forecast held at 3 4 percent the joint lowest since reuters began polling on it however the 2019 consensus was a touch higher than the international monetary fund s latest view of 3 3 percent the risk of an escalation of the u s china trade war and prospects of britain exiting the european union without a deal two of the more prominent threats that initially drove the current slowdown have eased story continues yet most major central banks have been hinting at a move away from hiking rates and nearly 60 percent of more than 200 economists who answered a separate question said they were confident the global tightening cycle was over on thursday the bank of japan dispelled any doubt about its commitment to ultra loose policies and sweden s central bank said a forecast interest rate hike would come slightly later than it had planned the u s federal reserve is done raising rates until at least the end of next year with about a third of economists polled predicting at least one rate cut by then with euro zone economic growth and inflation prospects dimming the european central bank may have missed its opportunity to raise rates before the next downturn the ecb blames the euro zone weakness on a slowdown in china and concerns about the trade war the fed meanwhile pointed the finger to europe and china as the main drags on u s growth but with everyone looking across the border for a scapegoat someone must inevitably be watching the wrong space noted elwin de groot head of macro strategy at rabobank one could speculate that the central banks are pointing the finger just because they have little confidence that their actions are effective growth forecasts for developed economies including germany france italy spain britain japan australia the united states and canada for this year and next weakened it was not very different for emerging market economies despite efforts from policymakers to boost sluggish growth economic growth in major economies from asia to africa to latin america was predicted to lose more momentum although india is still expected to be the fastest growing major economy growth predictions were lowered compared with the previous poll looser fiscal and monetary policy should help to cushion the impact of weaker export demand on growth in emerging asia nevertheless regional growth this year is still likely to slow to its weakest rate in a decade added capital economics mckeown analysis and additional reporting by indradip ghosh in bengaluru polling and reporting by the reuters polls team in bengaluru and bureaus in shanghai tokyo london milan paris oslo istanbul johannesburg toronto brasilia mexico city lima buenos aires bogota caracas and santiago editing by ross finley and hugh lawson

transformation of our business over the past several years is paying off we are now realizing higher per barrel margins across the company peabody noted that while husky s upstream segment made a strong contribution to funds from operations as a result of tighter canadian heavy light differentials the largest benefit was from u s refining margins this further demonstrates the value of our integrated corridor business he said we can capture value at any point along the upstream downstream chain resulting in global pricing for most of our production husky further advanced its process

i will start off with the review of the quarter and our full year 2019 outlook noel will then provide a few quick thoughts before we open it up to q a our net sales declined 3 in q1 we delivered 3 organic sales growth with 1 unit volume growth and 2 favorable pricing this was offset by negative foreign exchange impact of 6 we know that there is still work to do but we are pleased with the further improvement in organic sales growth in the quarter as we believe our strategy is to reaccelerate growth are beginning to bear fruit importantly the composition of the growth gives us comfort that we are returning to a more sustainable trajectory on an organic basis we delivered both volume and pricing growth for the first time in over two years with volume and pricing growth in all four of our categories oral care pet nutrition personal care and home care we delivered geographically balanced organic sales growth with emerging markets and developed markets both up 3 and we delivered breadth in our organic sales growth with more than 75 of our hubs delivering organic sales growth in the quarter our focus on driving the core through innovation attacking adjacent segments and expanding the availability of our brands in new and higher growth channels and markets is beginning to pay off coupled with our increased brand support we are optimistic that we can continue to deliver against the expectations for 2019 that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call on a gaap basis our gross profit margin was down 130 basis points year over year excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program it was down 110 basis points year over year for the quarter our 200 basis points of pricing provided a 70 basis point benefit to gross margin raw materials costs including foreign exchange transaction costs were at 320 basis point drag on gross margin year over year our productivity programs led by our funding the growth initiatives provided a 150 basis point benefit to gross margin other was a 10 basis point drag on an absolute basis advertising investment was up 3 year over year on a percent of sales basis advertising was up 60 basis points year over year with increases on a percent of sales basis in every division excluding charges resulting from our global growth and efficiency program and advertising spending our sg a expenses were down year over year in the first quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales benefiting from our productivity programs on a gaap basis diluted earnings per share of 0 65 were down 10 year over year in q1 excluding charges resulting from our global growth and efficiency program diluted earnings per share were down 10 to 0 67 our free cash flow in the quarter was 534 million which was up 7 versus q1 2018 taking a look at the divisional results north america delivered 3 net sales growth and 3 5 organic sales growth in the quarter with 2 volume growth and 1 5 pricing growth we saw strong sales growth in toothpaste in the quarter driven by colgate totalsf colgate optic white colgate essentials and tom s of maine club and e commerce delivered particularly strong toothpaste growth this quarter the colgate total relaunch is proceeding in line with our expectations as total s market share is up year over year since the launch in the u s we took pricing through a downsizing and this should lead to a shorter repurchase cycle which should accelerate unit growth going forward as consumers come back more quickly north america also benefited from the strong growth in the eltamd and pca skincare businesses we acquired during q1 of 2018 these brands are delivering very strong growth across a number of channels including professional b2c and e commerce europe s net sales were down 7 in q1 driven by negative foreign exchange organic sales were up 0 5 in the quarter as volume growth of 1 5 was mostly offset by negative pricing of 1 while categories in europe remained sluggish our market shares were up or flat in 7 to 10 categories we delivered strong volume growth in northern europe with the uk and scandinavia both up on the back of the colgate total relaunch we have reintroduced colgate total in scandinavia and it is driving strong incremental market share gains in that region we also launched meridol pure in several markets in europe in q1 which brings our top therapeutic gum offering into the natural space at a premium price in personal care we continue to drive significant share gains behind the sanex body wash business in france sanex s body wash share is up more than 100 basis points year to date behind sanex 0 and the sanex physiologic brand latin america we are pleased with our acceleration in organic sales growth in latin america in q1 net sales declined 4 5 in the quarter as 10 5 negative foreign exchange more than offset 2 5 volume growth and 3 5 pricing growth in the quarter importantly the growth was broad based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub we are particularly pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in brazil in the quarter versus q4 2018 as we delivered both pricing and volume growth encouragingly category trends in brazil do seem to be better although the market remains very promotional our recent innovations in oral care are paying off nicely as we are seeing market share gains for our colgate natural extract toothpaste line our colgate guard franchise in pharmacies in brazil and the colgate slim soft advanced toothbrush net sales in asia pacific were down 8 driven by negative foreign exchange of 5 5 a 2 5 decline in volume and flat pricing our results in china remain challenged by the difficult steps we are taking to reorient our portfolio and in oral care category that is rapidly premiumizing and shifting into e commerce as we indicated in january we still expect trends to improve in the second half of the year encouragingly we saw strong growth in both volume and pricing in india with growth coming on both the colgate maxfresh and colgate vedshakti franchises in order to drive penetration of vedshakti we recently gave away 30 million samples at the ardh kumbh mela festival in india our africa eurasia business showed solid underlying business momentum in q1 despite the negative impact of foreign exchange fx was a 13 drag on sales growth in the quarter offsetting 7 pricing growth and flat volume our eurasia hub delivered a strong mixture of pricing and volume growth in the quarter driven by russia our north africa middle east turkey hub also delivered volume growth in the quarter despite significant pricing to offset foreign exchange in order to help continue this momentum we launched the full meridol regimen toothpaste toothbrushes and mouth rinse in the pharmacy channel in turkey in the first quarter we also launched palmolive micellar care shower gel in russia this past quarter taking advantage of a big personal care trend and finally hills our strong growth at hills continued in q1 growth was led by the united states with particularly strong growth in e commerce pet specialty and farm and feed internationally our growth was very broad based we delivered both volume and pricing growth in canada europe australia asia and latin america as we discussed at cagny q1 marked the beginning of our relaunch of our science diet brand with the new packaging on shelf as we speak initial response has been positive as science diet market share trends continue to increase year over year in q1 the relaunch will continue across the globe through the first half of 2020 we have also significantly exceeded our subscription targets for our hill s to home service which allows pet parents to realize the benefits of home delivery while maintaining contact with the veterinarian moving on to full year guidance we continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits we continue to expect organic sales to be up to 2 to 4 based on current spot rates for the full year we still expect gross margin to be up year over year on both a gaap basis and excluding charges related to our global growth and efficiency program we expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs which includes the impact of transnational foreign exchange we expect our advertising spending to be up notably year over year on both an absolute basis and as a percent of sales we would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the q1 level we continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25 5 and 26 5 both on a gaap basis and excluding charges related to our global growth and efficiency program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to u s tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 based on current spot rates we expect gaap earnings per share to be down low single digits for the year excluding the charges related to the global growth and efficiency program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to u s tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 based on current spot rates we expect earnings per share to decline mid single digits for the year we would note that the consensus eps estimate is in the middle of that range and with that i will turn it over to noel for his thoughts before the q a noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks john and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today i thought it appropriate to begin by framing three strategic areas of focus for our company that i believe will be critical to our ongoing success and we certainly started to see transpire in the first quarter the first area of focus is how we re thinking about organic sales growth no question that to deliver long term revenue growth that s sustainable we need to be more aggressive about going after growth and we re going after growth differently as you recall in the fourth quarter call and at cagny i spoke about some of our growth mindset specifically we re driving the colgate brands like total and science diet remember these are big brands big brands with a global penetration in many countries around the world and we re bringing that to market through significant new innovation and superior product and formulations we d also bringing that alongside significant brand building along those businesses with real brand purpose that resonates with consumers in the different way second we re going after adjacent categories and product segments like naturals which is doing very well for us therapeutics by expanding elmex and meridol to select markets and importantly expanding skincare and continuing to focus our investment on opening new doors and channels with that category third we re expanding the availability of our products through distribution and new markets being very thoughtful in that regard but we see opportunities in new channels particularly in channels like e commerce which is key to our continued growth moving forward we were very pleased with the growth in e commerce in the first quarter which was up 28 versus the year ago period so more to do and more to come and we re certainly focused on those areas our second key area of focus is to simplify our processes and our structures around the world we recognize that we need to change in order to respond to a rapidly changing marketplace in terms of our ease and how consumers are shopping for example we ve revamping our innovation process to dramatically reduce the time to market you heard my dear fellows ph speak about that at cagny and those changes are under way beginning in latin america and we ll begin to roll those out around the world as we move into the balance of the year third area of focus for us is using data and looking to digitize the organization very differently we know that data can enable faster growth and faster decision making we know that data drives further roi in media and we know that data driven marketing is far better return on investment than the way we re spending today we also know that we can use data to improve our assortment in e commerce in the area of digitization some exciting thing is coming down the pipeline for us to drive productivity across the organization we re going to change from our sap system that we ve had in that we started in 1994 to the upgraded sap s 4hana which we think is going to simplify our processes significantly around the world drive more standardization and better reporting and decision making from all of that so you begin to see a lot of this unfold as we move into the balance of the year we re pleased to see some of that taking hold in the first quarter of this year so before i jump into q a i wanted to take a moment to thank the 35 000 colgate people for supporting me during this important transition over the last year i m extremely proud to lead to listen and to learn from that extraordinary team and i know with their drive and continued commitment and our focus on growth we will build a future to inaudible and it s those people that i want to extend a special thanks to ian cook for the past 12 years of his extraordinary leadership as ceo of this company he has transformed this organization in many ways and we ll be forever grateful for his leadership i especially want to thank him for his wise counsel and mentorship over the last six months as he has prepared me for this new role so with that let me turn it over to the questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and we will take our first question today from lauren lieberman with barclays please go ahead lauren rae lieberman barclays analyst great thanks good morning noel i was curious if we could you talk a little bit about market shares just you know market shares in oral care have been an important metric for the business like health of the business and so on and like a badge of honor frankly and this quarter topline certainly improved sequentially but shares are down versus i think where we talked about them at the end of january both globally and in some key markets like brazil mexico india so can you just talk a little bit about that how you re thinking about market share in particular when you would expect that to turn as you think about the path forward and some to the greater growth mindset you re putting in play thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure thanks lauren overall we have seen significant growth first of all on untracked channels particularly in u s where we saw double digit growth in a lot of those untracked channels which we re very encouraged about if i stay within north america the toothpaste shares are flat we obviously introduce colgate total in the middle of february we saw a significant competitive response and we ve responded accordingly but we weren t going to deal overly aggressive in order to drive share bear in mind that we are in this for the long term this is a marathon not a sprint with the launch of colgate total it s not like introducing a new product we have existing shelf space and existing penetration it s a big brand and we re looking to continue the drive trial and repeat throughout the year so the way we ve structured and strategized our media spending over the year is to continue with high investments quarter on quarter through the balance of the year and we think in the end that would generate sustained growth for the business moving on to some of the other markets our value shares and volume shares in mexico are actually flat we re slightly down in brazil and that was due to some aggressive promotion from the competitive environment recognize that the colgate total launch which will have a significant premium in both those markets which where it has a sizable share will launched in the second quarter our volume shares on balance are only down 30 basis points so we feel quite comfortable with where we are particularly given the activity in most of the total spending coming in the year to go operator we ll take the next question from bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie herzog wells fargo securities llc research division analyst all right thank you good morning so i had a question on your pricing in the quarter i guess i m wondering why it slowed sequentially and then i m also curious about this for your emerging markets where i assume you would have been taking more pricing for fx and then could you update us on your plan to any future pricing or essentially do you expect pricing to accelerate in the future or remain constant at current levels thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure thanks bonnie we were actually very pleased with the balance of organic growth in the first quarter obviously both volume and pricing up we had good pricing in the fourth quarter as you ve pointed out and likewise good pricing in the first quarter so coming off of that we re quite pleased some of the pricing still yet to come we talked about in the fourth quarter the two thirds would roll through from 2018 to 2019 we have a third to go and we re quite confident that we will generate the pricing that we set out for ourselves on the year certainly at the current spot rates if spot rates change we certainly have to look to take more pricing but we re quite comfortable with where we are and how that s flowed through specifically on total we re very pleased from the fact that we ve seen pricing stick everywhere we have launched colgate total coming back to the u s our equivalized shares as john mentioned we downsized the price per ounce is up about 16 in the total toothpaste franchise and the u s is up 8 so price is holding and more to come as we move through the balance of the year operator and the next question will come from wendy nicholson with citi wendy nicholson citigroup inc research division analyst hi good morning just following up on china specifically could you tell us exactly how much volumes were down in china and i know you re going through a big repositioning of the brand and product assortment in that market but can you sort of give us some timing on that when should we expect to see stronger numbers are there specific new products coming out or new advertising or anything like that so when do you think we turn positive in china thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure so china came in as we expected in the quarter we had i think communicated in the fourth quarter call that we expected china to turn in the back half and that s exactly the timing that we re still looking for some significant changes in investment going into china as we speak we are looking at obviously to get the portfolio structured appropriately we re getting the structure in the organization and putting resources where we think the growth will come in that business moving forward so we re making some investments in the business in the short term that we believe would drive sustainable growth in the long term for our business which will be we ll start to see that turn in the back half of the year operator and we ll go to andrea teixeira with jpmorgan andrea teixeira jp morgan chase co research division analyst thank you good morning so my question is on north america organic volumes and a follow up on the colgate total relaunch so on north america you called out on the prepared remarks that the benefit from eltamd and pca skin now included in organic growth can you give us like kind of a sort of magnitude not a magnitude of that launch about ph that launch and the inclusion on the organic growth and also on the colgate total relaunch thinking about specifically latin america with brazil in terms of the timing of the launch will all the volume of the relaunch be shipped during the second quarter you had some of that done in the first quarter so i m trying to see if there is any lumpiness on the volume as we progress through the quarters thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks andrea again a good growth in the first quarter out of north america we re not going to break it out but suffice to say all of the key elements of the north america business grew in the first quarter we were particularly pleased with tom s of maine which had another significant growth following a sequential growth over the last three quarters so that s doing well the sell in on total performed well obviously as you ve pointed out pca and elta were added into the organic growth not a significant portion but we re very pleased with the progress on that business that we ve seen thus far so overall a good performance in north america across a well balanced organic growth in all of their categories and their core businesses in terms of the relaunch of our colgate total in latin america we just started shipping at the end of the first quarter with most of the activity and all of the investment to come in the second quarter so i would say a portion in the first most to come in the second as we move forward operator we ll go to ali dibadj with bernstein ali dibadj sanford c bernstein co llc research division analyst i m just trying to contextualize some of the discussions so far in the quarterly results in a little bit more broad and you ve done that a couple of times but i want to continue on that theme the big debate i think is are you spending enough that s the one i hear the most and so if you look at the quarter s results you could argue that they are consistent with that concerning narrative right we re not spending enough to turn the ship the sequential pricing i e probably more create spend more promo this quarter to get more shelf space there was clearly a lot of the inventory load right so that pricing that you guys talked about on colgate total for example in north america a lot of inventory loaded in elmex and others amp was up maybe not quite as much as i thought it might be but it s up which i guess is good but all this activity so far and we still see those market share issues in the u s and in mexico brazil russia india china i mean u k looks little bit better but still some pressure and by the way do you wonder in the u s what the sell out was versus the sell in so it doesn t look great on the tracked channels so i guess i m just trying to get underneath this idea of should we just be more patient to see those terms i think that s your messaging but should we just be more patient to see this upturn and so you re 100 confident that you re actually spending enough and so this concern about another rebase to happen around the corner or not spending enough that view is just so far what you re seeing going to be wrong noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks ali a lot in that question so let me try to step back for a moment talk a little bit about our strategy we realized to drive long term sustainable growth that we do things very thoughtfully and in a measured way we ve taken the advertising up as you well pointed out quite significantly in our view up in the first quarter we will hold those levels through the balance of the year and everything that we know about building brands particularly brands as big and as scalable as colgate total it s that continuity that really pays off in the long run we don t look to a percent to sales we look for what do we need to do to create the right impressions and the right engagement behind a significant innovation like colgate total and that s exactly what we re doing we re going to continue to plot away with the plan that we have we were very strategic in not making and not necessarily spending all of our money in the first quarter we want to balance out over the year we re not buying shelf space i heard you mention that and a brand like colgate total which is an existing brand in the u s at 10 share that s a successful brand already so what we re doing is basically trying to drive more velocity off the shelf we re not necessarily increasing shelf and we didn t necessarily see any of that in terms of shelf increases in the first quarter so we ve got strong shares strong shelf space and we re going to continue to build on that i ll give you a little bit about consumption on colgate total obviously as we move through some of the high competitive reactions in february and march the last four weeks on colgate total the consumption is up 40 and our share is up 1 point so we re in a good position relative to what we re seeing there and obviously a lot of the work to come as we move through the balance of the year and in terms of advertising we ll likewise see those increases come to bear as we roll it out particularly in big markets like latin america operator and the next question is from steve powers with deutsche bank steve powers deutsche bank ag research division analyst great thanks neol so as you talked about in the open you re arguably managing a larger number of growth priorities today versus history and i guess what i m wondering as we you can talk more about how you re prioritizing them relative to one other i m sure the first order of business is ensuring the colgate the core colgate oral care franchise returns to market leading growth but around that as you talked about you got the expansion into naturals you re broadening the reach of brands like elmex investing in e commerce stepping up support for professional skincare and obviously driving hill s as well and obviously not all of those initiatives are mutually exclusive but again how are you thinking about allocating relative investment dollars to each of them if you had an extra dollar which bucket are you most likely to add to and any thoughts if you can do it all organically or are you increasingly opened to m a in support of those initiatives thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks steve so let me go back to a little bit about with regards to my upfront comments around how we re framing growth as i talked about at cagny we re really looking at three specific priorities and in many respects that would kind of prioritize how we re spending that will unfold through the balance of the year historically we were very focused on line extensions and to a certain extent growing in the adjacencies and we quickly recognized that we have to have a real balance colgate has big core businesses that are in many countries around the world that had significant leakage relative to share and were not driving the growth that we needed hence our need to put real superior bundles behind the core in order to shore up the core so when we balance that with increased innovation behind adjacencies like naturals like therapeutics that we get the incremental growth moving forward and that s exactly how we re going to prioritize it relative to m a certainly there is a lot of activity out there we re still going to be extremely thoughtful on how we approach m a we ve obviously done some great m a over the last couple of years specifically pca and elta which we re very excited about as those assets become available we will think through them very carefully relative to their strategic fit in the business and what they bring and if we find the right value we will certainly go after them operator and we ll go to olivia tong with bank of america olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning i wanted to talk a little bit about the balance you talked a lot about the balance between developed markets versus emerging market performance volume versus price so as you progress through the year how do you think about that because i would assume that there you talked about some of the pricing that you re planning to do in some of the markets you know a third of it still hasn t rolled through so i would assume that price becomes a bigger component of that do you think that volume then sort of turns a little bit and just your overview on the balance between all those different factors thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure i think at the heart of a lot of that good balance this year particularly between emerging and the developed world was the fact that we re starting to see some of the categories turn in the emerging markets which is particularly encouraging for us given our footprint so moving forward we would continue to see that balance of pricing and volume moving through the balance of the year the innovation will support the volume that the innovation will support the premiumization that we re going after particularly as we see total and the science diet business which is just now going into the u s and the roll out through the balance of the year start to take hold so we ll continue to see the right balance as we move forward keeping the investment there will help drive that operator next is kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy jefferies analyst thanks good morning so noel my question is on the industry growth rates relative to your organic sales growth guidance of 2 to 4 so at this point where would you peg industry growth in total as you roll up your business and your geographies relative to the 3 organic growth in the quarter how has that changed if at all since 4q you sound more upbeat on emerging markets which is obviously a good thing and then for us is it fair that we should expect an acceleration in your organic sales growth over the next couple of quarters as year over year comp season and more spending goes into the marketplace and it seems like the emerging markets are in a better place so thank you for that noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure the categories as you mentioned we ve seen a pickup particularly in emerging we re modeling organic excuse me we re modeling category growth rates in that 3 to 5 5 depending on the market around the world in the developed world somewhere between flat to around 2 5 we ve seen a little bit of tick up in the u s europe continues to move sideways but the u s we ve seen a little bit of acceleration there so we think we re relative to our guidance on the 2 to 4 we re well positioned where the categories are and if latin america and particularly africa continue to accelerate or hold at their current levels that would bode well for us but we ve said that before let s get a couple of more quarters underneath us relative to those categories and we ll go from there operator we ll now go to bill chappell with suntrust bill chappell suntrust analyst thanks good morning noel first just a clarification you had said to bonnie s question we came into the year two thirds of pricing and still a third to go are we still a third to go or did you do a fair amount during first quarter and then the second just on hills can you give us a little more color on the strength and maybe from a market share perspective we don t get to see i mean so much of the channels are on track it s kind of hard to understand exactly where you re getting it is it from emphasis from the specialty channel coming back or is it just the vet channels doing well or just kind of help us give us more color why it s doing better noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure well let me take the pricing question first yes we re about right we re right where we thought we d be about two third s of the business we re seeing roll through and the third to go and we ve got some pricing that s going into place starting in the second quarter so we re quite comfortable with that in terms of how that s going to roll through the balance of the quarters in 19 hills is a great story i come back to a lot of the fundamentals of our strategy which is driving the core working on adjacencies and particularly expanding into new segments and new retail environments and hill s ticks those boxes extraordinarily well we obviously had great growth in the fourth quarter really strong start to the year relative to what we re seeing the science diet relaunch just now going into the market as i mentioned in terms of the full impact of the new packaging and the new formulations which as i mentioned at cagny will be coupled with increased pricing and the media investment behind that business particularly in north america we ll now start to go into the market in the second quarter our u s had a very strong first quarter and again i think it s driven by great market share gains particularly in pet specialty we obviously continue to have a very strong e commerce business and holding shares there and we in terms of expanding into new channels we ve gone aggressively after part the farm and feed channel which was growing and we were under indexed and we ve seen incremental distribution and sales growth come from that so all in all really pleased with where hill s is right now and particularly pleased given a lot of the science diet stuff is still to come in the u s and we ll start to roll that out in the balance of the world as we move into the second half operator we ll go to robert ottenstein with evercore isi robert edward ottenstein evercore isi analyst great thank you very much and nice start to the year wondering if we could drill down a little bit more into what s going on to in brazil and so a couple of sub points perhaps you can talk a little bit more about the competitive situation you mentioned still very tough promo environment is there any visibility on that changing and how do you expect to deal with that second the rollout of the therapeutics elmex meridol in brazil how that s going do you need more investment there or is it kind of going to be self funding at this point and i guess tied to that how you re doing in the pharmacy channel thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer great thanks robert so again good results coming out of brazil we are pleased particularly given that we ve generated both volume and pricing in brazil in the quarter which was terrific to see in relative to the promotion environment yes we saw some of our competitors going quite aggressive in the first quarter we decided not to chase that with our business it was interesting the share loss that we saw in the first quarter which is roughly about a point on the business we re still at 72 a share came out of our kolynos our resale ph brand which is our secondary brand because of the deep discounting we saw from some our competitors that being said our instinct is that will particularly be driven by high promotional activity that we always see in the first quarter that we opted not to chase given some of the foreign exchange headwinds that we ve seen in that market and we think that will balance away itself out through the remainder of the year early days on elmex we have rolled it into the pharmacy channel the pharmacy channel is in a roughly 15 to 20 of the acv in brazil early news is really good on elmex in terms of driving incremental share in the pharmacy channel we re up about a point so far in that channel but lots more to go the investments there we ring fenced it it s an important strategic initiative for us and we re optimistic that we ll continue to see particularly that channel grow as we move through the balance of the year operator next is jason english with goldman sachs jason m english goldman sachs group inc analyst hi good morning folks thank you for the question sticking on the topic of going a little bit deeper into some of the markets can you take us a little bit deeper into china give us a beat on where you think your consumption is tracking and whether or not your net sales are still lagging on inventory reduction or whether or not that s been flushed out and then a second question and sorry for pausing on thinking about your gross margin trajectory for the year cost inflation headwind stepped down fairly sizably 4q to 1q how should we expect that to trend through the remainder of the year noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks jason so quickly coming back to china not a lot more to add there we re obviously it came in line with our expectations the inventory de stocking continues we ve made good progress in the fourth quarter continued progress in the first we re rebalancing as i mentioned some of our go to market structures and how we take the product to market particularly as it results around the portfolio specifically and that will unfold as we move through the balance of the year so as i said we expect to see sequential improvement moving through the back half of the year and that is on schedule as we speak relative to gross margin so your question around cost yes we saw a significant elevation of costs in the fourth quarter a little bit better in the first quarter we re in the range of 4 to 6 commodities in terms of increases moving through the gross profit line and we expect that to abate as we move through and lap some of the foreign exchange transaction impact that we had last year that occurred in the first half and will get better as we move through the balance of the year so the answer to your question is yes we expect that debate which is giving us confidence that we can continue to hold and increase gross margins moving forward operator we ll go to camille garshwala ph with credit suisse unidentified partcipant analyst good morning guys noel you mentioned e commerce in various parts of your prepared remarks can you perhaps provide us a little more context what your share looks like online results where maybe what your margins are like online versus elsewhere and then i think you said e commerce was up 28 are you able to give some context on how much that contributed to organic growth noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure first of all we re very pleased again coming back to those growth strategies that outlined earlier expanding in new retail environments and getting our fair share so to speak is a real strategic focus for us and e commerce is an important area of that as i mentioned we were up just shy of 29 in the first quarter importantly that was driven with a strong north america performance their shares were up 1 7 points on the colgate franchise alone which was terrific and likewise driven by a continued strong growth on the hill s business the little softness that we have is to a certain extent as in asia while the e commerce shares are flat we didn t see the growth that we were expecting there and that s part of the turnaround strategy that we re looking to execute as we move through the back half of this year operator next is steven strycula with ubs steven a strycula ubs investment bank research division analyst hi good morning and congratulations on the new seat so neol my question is as you look across the portfolio after the work you guys have done in the last few years which three countries in categories combinations do you think are the biggest revenue and profit dollar opportunity from an incrementality standpoint as we look forward the next few years and a quick second part of that would be is there any reason you guys haven t given anymore defined perimeter around your gross margin outlook for the year relative to what you did last quarter thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer so listen on the categories we love all our children equally in this case obviously oral care continues to be a real focus for us the first quarter organic that we delivered was largely driven by toothpaste and by hill s and so we re very encouraged but as john mentioned in his opening remarks we have positive organic across all the categories which in our view is the quality and the composition that we re ultimately looking for but from a prioritization certainly our oral care personal care and our pet food have always been our top three priorities and we ll continue to focus on growth in that regard in terms your second question was around gross margins listen we ve as i ve mentioned not much more to add we expect gross margins to be up on the year we expect some of the cost environment that we saw in the fourth and in the first quarter to abate as we move through the balance of the year we ve got more pricing to come and we obviously have the total relaunch and science diet relaunch rolling out around the world so we re comfortable with where we are now at the current spot rates and we ll see how that unfolds but comfortable in terms of the outlook that we ve given operator and we ll go to mark astrachan with stifel mark stiefel astrachan stifel nicolaus company incorporated research division analyst thanks and good morning everybody i wanted to ask about specific learning s from pca and elta i m curious do you think you can take those brands into other channels how you think about differences of selling into specific specialty type channels doctor s offices and the like versus mass or other channels and perhaps indulge me and kind of take that a step further what gives confidence that you can have success in skincare more broadly just given competitive dynamics in the market and i m kind of alluding to your comment about expanding on skincare going forward noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes thanks mark let me step back for a minute and give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we look at m a not just simply from the economics and the growth aspects of those categories of businesses that we acquired but more importantly what are the core competencies and learning s that they can bring into the larger enterprise across the company and elta and pca fit those parameters just perfectly obviously we love businesses with strong endorsement levels elta at the dermatology level pca at sufficient level and we ve learned from obviously what we ve done in oral care and our vet business on how to successfully monetize that going forward both those businesses have unique aspects to them elta has an incredible e commerce business and an influencer model particularly as they use digital very effectively likewise pca has a wonderful in office strategy in terms of how they go to market there particularly around their data driven marketing that they use so some great insights that we ll bring into the business and certainly leverage across other categories and we continue to dial up the investment in those businesses given the great growth that we re seeing coming out of them at least initially in the first quarter moving forward skincare is interesting to us so we ve got two businesses that we re focused on right now we ll continue to drive those moving forward if we see other things become available that we think are interested and will bring real value to the colgate company we will certainly go after those but we re very focused on what we have right now and that s how we re going to lay it out for the balance of the year so again let me extend my thanks to the entire colgate team obviously a good quarter that we should be proud of we all know there is a lot of work to do we re very focused on growth and let s get after it we re in the second quarter as they say and we ll be in touch with everyone on the call as we move through the balance of the quarter and into the third quarter thanks so much operator and thank you very much that does conclude our call for today i d like to thank everyone for your participation and you may

operational performance was impacted by challenges in both the upstream and downstream early in the quarter in part due to extreme cold weather across the country furthermore the government of alberta s production curtailment order significantly affected financial performance as improved upstream realizations were more than offset by reduced downstream margins said rich kruger chairman president and chief executive officer alberta s mandated curtailment continues to impact crude by rail economics after increasing crude by rail shipments to record levels in late 2018 the company discontinued shipments in february late in the quarter the company resumed limited rail shipments and will continue to evaluate future movements as economically justified said kruger imperial declared a second

china s xi says infrastructure building initiative will set high standards as countries fret over debt from left chinese president xi jinping egypt s president abdel fattah el sisi and russian president vladimir putin arrive for the opening ceremony of the second belt and road forum for international cooperation brf in beijing friday april 26 2019 how hwee young pool photo via ap beijing ap chinese president xi jinping promised friday to set high standards for beijing s sweeping infrastructure building initiative as fellow leaders praised the effort despite worries it leaves some developing countries with too much debt xi avoided mentioning debt in a speech at a belt and road forum celebrating his signature foreign initiative but he promised changes in response to complaints about costs and possible corruption and environmental damage beijing wants open green and clean cooperation with zero tolerance for corruption xi said developing countries have welcomed the initiative launched in 2013 to expand trade by building roads ports and other facilities from asia through africa and the middle east to europe but some governments are struggling to repay chinese loans fueling complaints poor countries are being pushed into a debt trap the united states japan india and russia also chafe at the expansion of beijing s influence through building trade and political networks centered on china despite that russian president vladimir putin on friday praised the initiative saying it dovetails with the goals of a russian promoted market with four of its neighbors the eurasian economic union advertisement advertisement malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad who had suspended plans for a chinese built railway and other projects due to their cost said he was fully in support prime minister imran khan of pakistan one of china s closest allies said belt and road has produced substantial progress in increasing power supplies and other areas the u n s secretary general antonio guterres said belt and road projects could help turn the balance in mitigating climate change xi s government is trying to revive the initiative s momentum after the number of new projects plunged last year that came after chinese officials said state owned banks would step up scrutiny of borrowers and some governments complained projects do too little for their economies and might give beijing too much political influence advertisement advertisement other countries including thailand and nepal have canceled or scaled back projects while ethiopia and others have renegotiated debt repayment xi promised changes to forestall corruption and environmental damage he tried to allay worries beijing reaps most of the economic benefits and is gaining political influence belt and road is not an exclusive club and promotes common development and prosperity xi said he said belt and road will embrace international standards for project development purchasing and operations china s ministry of finance issued debt sustainability guidelines thursday for assessing debt risks to borrowers the ministry said they are based on standards of the international monetary fund and other international institutions advertisement advertisement the guidelines are intended to prevent and solve debt problems said finance minister liu kun they will classify countries as high middle and low risk based on productivity economic growth and other factors the standard may help reduce the financial stability risks faced by some borrowers but that will depend on how widely it is applied said moody s investors service in a statement other leaders attending the forum included aung san suu kyi state councilor for myanmar ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed and leaders or envoys from germany italy and greece xi said beijing wants to encourage cooperation on health water resources agriculture and technology he promised scholarships for students from belt and road countries advertisement advertisement chinese lenders have provided 440 billion in financing the country s central bank governor yi gang said thursday without giving details on repayments or risks of defaults in addition some 500 billion yuan 75 billion has been raised in chinese bond markets according to yi the united states japan and other wealthy countries also finance construction in a region the asia development bank says needs 26 trillion of investment through 2030 to keep economic growth strong in march italy became the first member of the group of seven major economies to sign an agreement to support belt and road advertisement advertisement belt and road countries also include many of the poorest and most indebted in africa and asia about one quarter of the 115 governments that have signed agreements to support the initiative have foreign debt equal to at least 75 of their annual economic output according to moody s mongolia is the most extreme at 240 egypt indonesia and pakistan all are above 50 none is in immediate danger of default but belt and road economies tend to have higher debt than average weaker financial flows and more vulnerability to economic shocks said lillian li a moody s vice president borrowing more external funds will be more dangerous to themselves as well as to the lending countries li said in an interview advertisement advertisement there s a limit to how much xi s government might change the initiative because beijing still wants to increase its influence and generate work for chinese industries tom rafferty of the economist intelligence unit said in a report ahead of friday s forum one element to watch will be whether beijing tries to enhance the appeal of belt and road by making it more like the world bank or other multinational organizations he said this has the potential to generate further tensions with the u s rafferty said ___ associated press writer christopher bodeen contributed

transformation of our business over the past several years is paying off we are now realizing higher per barrel margins across the company peabody noted that while husky s upstream segment made a strong contribution to funds from operations as a result of tighter canadian heavy light differentials the largest benefit was from u s refining margins this further demonstrates the value of our integrated corridor business he said we can capture value at any point along the upstream downstream chain resulting in global pricing for most of our production husky further advanced its process

president xi jinping laid out china s aspirations for its belt and road initiative that spans the globe china s belt and road initiative bri will focus on transparency and clean governance president xi jinping said at the opening of a summit on his grand plan on friday adding that the massive infrastructure and trade plan should result in high quality growth for everyone xi s plan to rebuild the ancient silk road to connect china with asia europe and beyond has become mired in controversy as some partner nations have bemoaned the high cost of infrastructure projects china has not said exactly how much money will be needed in total but some independent estimates suggest it will run into several trillion dollars beijing has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap anyone with debt and only has good intentions and has been looking to use this week s three day summit in beijing to recalibrate the policy and address those concerns everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption xi said in a keynote speech building high quality sustainable risk resistant reasonably priced and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to fully utilise their resource endowments unlike the first summit in 2017 where xi said chinese banks would lend 380 billion yuan 56 43bn to support belt and road cooperation he did not give a figure for new financing support but xi is expected to give another speech on saturday debt trap diplomacy al jazeera s katrina yu reporting from beijing said president xi used most of his half hour speech trying to allay concerns about the bri one of the main criticisms is that this really is a big plan which basically is a form of debt trap diplomacy what happens is some of these countries are saddled with millions potentially billions of dollars worth of debt that they re unable to pay back katrina said they default on these loans which leaves them quite vulnerable to chinese political influence she added international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde echoed those concerns 190107030233089 history has taught us that if not managed carefully infrastructure investments can lead to a problematic increase in debt lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the conference i have said before that to be fully successful the belt and road should only go where it is needed i would add today that it should only go where it is sustainable in all aspects sri lanka sold china a 70 percent stake in a major port hambantota in 2017 despite security concerns and demonstrations sri lankan officials said the deal was the only way the country could repay debt much of it owed to china malaysia halted a bri rail project last year restarting after it renegotiated to reduce the cost of construction by a third and increase the level of local involvement i am fully in support of the belt and road initiative malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad said at the forum i am sure my country malaysia will benefit from the project social uplift pakistan s prime minister imran khan said his country s electricity supplies had increased massively with the implementation of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec 190321170015949 china has pledged more than 60bn to pakistan in loans and investments for roads ports power plants and industrial parks making the country one of the largest bri recipients khan said pakistan was looking forward to the project moving into its next phase focusing on social uplift poverty alleviation agriculture and industry including the opening of special economic zones in a world of uncertainty khan said the initiative offered a model of collaboration partnership connectivity and shared prosperity united nations secretary general antonio guterres said the environment could also benefit the scale of planned belt and road investments offers a meaningful opportunity to contribute to the creation of a more equitable prosperous world for all and to reversing the negative impact of climate change guterres said xi launched the bri in 2013 and according to financial markets data company refinitiv the total value of projects in the scheme stands at 3 67 trillion spanning countries in asia europe africa oceania and south america chinese promises the bri will also bring development opportunities for china as it further opens its markets to the world xi said in accordance with the need for further opening up improve laws and regulations regulate government behaviour at all levels in administrative licensing market supervision and other areas and clean up and abolish unreasonable regulations subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market he said xi promised to significantly shorten the negative list that restricts foreign investments and allow foreign companies to take a majority stake or set up wholly owned companies in more sectors tariffs will be lower and non tariff barriers will be eliminated xi added china also aims to import more services and goods and is willing to import competitive agricultural products and services to achieve trade balance and inclusive growth for the world economy xi said but despite the promises there are other criticisms over how some of these deals are actually implemented al jazeera s katrina said there is very little rule of law involved very opaque deals resulting in corruption in environmental damage she said although the summit brought together 37 heads of state the united states had no significant representation nor did most major european countries katrina noted they remain deeply suspicious and sceptical of this plan being anything more than beijing trying to attain more political influence worldwide she said russian president vladimir putin said bri will provide a harmonious and sustainable economic development economic growth throughout the eurasian space giuseppe conte the prime minister of italy which recently became the first g7 country to sign on to the initiative is also attending the summit

synchronised rebound this year s growth outlook was downgraded or left unchanged for 38 of the countries polled the recent weakness of global growth will persist for much longer than is commonly assumed a dovish turn by central banks and stimulus in china will not be enough to boost world gdp growth from its current slow pace noted jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics disappointing economic performance will leave inflation very low and cause monetary policy to be loosened almost across the board but we do not see this prompting any meaningful recovery until 2021 advertisement global growth was forecast to average 3 4 percent this year the lowest since polling began for 2019 almost two years ago the most optimistic prediction was also more modest than at the start of the year the 2020 forecast held at 3 4 percent the joint lowest since reuters began polling on it advertisement however the 2019 consensus was a touch higher than the international monetary fund s latest view of 3 3 percent the risk of an escalation of the u s china trade war and prospects of britain exiting the european union without a deal two of the more prominent threats that initially drove the current slowdown have eased advertisement yet most major central banks have been hinting at a move away from hiking rates and nearly 60 percent of more than

policies and sweden s central bank said a forecast interest rate hike would come slightly later than it had planned advertisement the u s federal reserve is done raising rates until at least the end of next year with about a third of economists polled predicting at least one rate cut by then with euro zone economic growth and inflation prospects dimming the european central bank may have missed its opportunity to raise rates before the next downturn advertisement the ecb blames the euro zone weakness on a slowdown in china and concerns about the trade war the fed meanwhile pointed the finger to europe and china as the main drags on u s growth but with everyone looking across the border for a scapegoat someone must inevitably be watching the wrong space noted elwin de groot head of macro

sen bernie sanders i vt says every american should be concerned about the rising federal deficit sen elizabeth warren d mass has detailed how she would raise enough in new tax revenue to pay for her proposals for universal child care and tuition free college even long shot candidate andrew yang who is perhaps best known for the memes around his candidacy has called for a broad based consumption tax to finance his signature issue of a universal basic income in a democratic presidential primary where candidates have championed many ideas once relegated to the far left of american politics a federal jobs guarantee forgiveness of student debt reparations for descendants of slaves there is one left wing economic position none has espoused that idea modern monetary theory has coursed through the online activist and academic left over the past several years it argues that the u s government cannot go bankrupt and therefore does not need to raise tax revenue to fund new spending initiatives advertisement mmt supporters say it is a mistake to push for lower deficits because that risks contracting spending and as a result slowing economic growth the theory has long been criticized by economists affiliated with the party drawing criticism from fed chair janet l yellen and lawrence summers who served as an adviser to president barack obama although rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y has said it deserves a larger part of the conversation the theory has essentially no support among congressional democrats the 2020 presidential contenders have been shy to embrace it though they have worked with economists who support mmt warren s and sanders s campaigns suggest they have largely accepted the more conventional view that the government should be careful not to explode the federal deficit and have proposed paying for large new federal programs with new tax revenue advertisement in segments of the online community there has been some enthusiasm for mmt but politicians have been much slower to embrace it said ernie tedeschi an economist who served in the treasury department under obama supporters of mmt recognize the democratic presidential candidates have not espoused their beliefs on the stump but they say their work has still measurably shifted policy by pressing against what they regard as mainstream economists overblown fears of the deficit mmt advocates also note some of the proposals they most support like a green new deal have gained traction among key democrats much of the democratic field as well as more than 90 members of congress have embraced ocasio cortez and sen edward j markey s d mass resolution to decarbonize the u s economy with a massive federal jobs and infrastructure investment sanders has said he will introduce a federal jobs guarantee which stephanie kelton an mmt economist who worked for sanders on the budget committee played a key role in persuading the senator from vermont to support mmt has promoted the idea of a jobs guarantee for more than two decades advertisement mmt advocates also see encouraging signs that democrats have begun to agree with their rejection of traditional fears of large fiscal deficits earlier this year warren and sanders joined ocasio cortez and rep ro khanna d calif in criticizing a house rule requiring legislation to be paid for when passed share this article share it s not easy to overnight move people s perspectives it s very difficult to communicate these ideas in a way people can understand said pavlina r tcherneva an economist at bard college and an mmt supporter but for me what s more important is that the conversation has profoundly shifted we are now talking about big bold policies that everybody used to say were pie in the sky but both sanders and warren have taken positions that appear to break with mmt sanders has repeatedly criticized the impact of the gop tax law on the federal deficit he has for years called himself the true fiscal hawk of the senate citing his votes against expensive conservative priorities such as the iraq war tax cuts passed under both president george w bush and president trump and higher budgets for the military advertisement sanders has also released plans to pay for his social programs with taxes on offshore tax havens and wall street transactions and by lifting payroll taxes on the wealthy he has been less direct about paying for medicare for all his plan to nationalize the u s health insurance industry but has released a white paper with potential tax hikes and has acknowledged it will require tax hikes on middle class americans hikes he says will be offset by eliminating premium and deductible payments i am concerned about the debt that s a legitimate concern every american should be concerned about it sanders said at a fox news town hall event in pennsylvania earlier this month the deficit is not something we should be leaving to our kids and our grandchildren but we pay for what we are proposing warren has proposed close to 3 trillion in tax hikes on corporate profits above 100 million and on wealthy people with more than 50 million the taxes would generate more than enough money to pay for her universal child care free college tuition and student debt forgiveness programs according to nonpartisan estimates asked whether she believes democrats should be restricted by the need to be wary of the national debt she said even under the current monetary theories debt matters there comes a point where debt matters mmt advocates hope to see a presidential candidate more directly espouse their beliefs at some point but they acknowledge it could take years for that to occur rep john yarmuth d ky chair of the house budget committee has also signaled interest in holding hearings on mmt according to bloomberg news advertisement there is a very big political danger to say this in the open for anyone running for president said l randall wray an economist at bard college who has supported modern monetary theory for decades the thing is we have to make it acceptable to say this in public before we can expect a presidential candidate to other close allies of sanders however hope he resists the pull of mmt jeffrey sachs an mmt skeptic and a columbia university economist who has advised sanders says european countries with stronger safety nets created them by bringing in substantially more tax revenue
beijing ap chinese president xi jinping promised friday to set high standards for beijing s sweeping infrastructure building initiative as fellow leaders praised the effort despite worries it leaves

complaints about costs and possible corruption and environmental damage beijing wants open green and clean cooperation with zero tolerance for corruption xi said developing countries have welcomed the initiative launched in 2013 to expand trade by building roads ports and other facilities from asia through africa and the middle east to europe but some governments are struggling to repay chinese loans fueling complaints poor countries are being pushed into a debt trap the united states japan india and russia also chafe at the expansion of beijing s influence through building trade and political networks centered on china despite that russian president vladimir putin on friday praised the initiative saying it dovetails with the goals of a russian promoted market with four of its neighbors the eurasian economic union malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad who had suspended plans for a chinese built railway and other projects due to their cost said he was fully in support prime minister imran khan of pakistan one of china s closest allies said belt and road has produced substantial progress in increasing power supplies and other areas the u n s secretary general antonio guterres said belt and road projects could help turn the balance in mitigating climate change xi s government is trying to revive the initiative s momentum after the number of new projects plunged last year that came after chinese officials said state owned banks would step up scrutiny of borrowers and some governments complained projects do too little for their economies and might give beijing too much political influence other countries including thailand and nepal have canceled or scaled back projects while ethiopia and others have renegotiated debt repayment xi promised changes to forestall corruption and environmental damage he tried to allay worries beijing reaps most of the economic benefits and is gaining political influence belt and road is not an exclusive club and promotes common development and prosperity xi said he said belt and road will embrace international standards for project development purchasing and operations china s ministry of finance issued debt sustainability guidelines thursday for assessing debt risks to borrowers the ministry said they are based on standards of the international monetary fund and other international institutions the guidelines are intended to prevent and solve debt problems said finance minister liu kun they will classify countries as high middle and low risk based on productivity economic growth and other factors the standard may help reduce the financial stability risks faced by some borrowers but that will depend on how widely it is applied said moody s investors service in a statement other leaders attending the forum included aung san suu kyi state councilor for myanmar ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed and leaders or envoys from germany italy and greece xi said beijing wants to encourage cooperation on health water resources agriculture and technology he promised scholarships for students from belt and road countries chinese lenders have provided 440 billion in financing the country s central bank governor yi gang said thursday without giving details on repayments or risks of defaults in addition some 500 billion yuan 75 billion has been raised in chinese bond markets according to yi the united states japan and other wealthy countries also finance construction in a region the asia development bank says needs 26 trillion of investment through 2030 to keep economic growth strong in march italy became the first member of the group of seven major economies to sign an agreement to support belt and road belt and road countries also include many of the poorest and most indebted in africa and asia about one quarter of the 115 governments that have signed agreements to support the initiative have foreign debt equal to at least 75 of their annual economic output according to moody s mongolia is the most extreme at 240 egypt indonesia and pakistan all are above 50 none is in immediate danger of default but belt and road economies tend to have higher debt than average weaker financial flows and more vulnerability to economic shocks said lillian li a moody s vice president borrowing more external funds will be more dangerous to themselves as well as to the lending countries li said in an interview there s a limit to how much xi s government might change the initiative because beijing still wants to increase its influence and generate work for chinese industries tom rafferty of the economist intelligence unit said in a report ahead of friday s forum one element to watch will be whether beijing tries to enhance the appeal of belt and road by making it more like the world bank or other multinational organizations he said this has the potential to generate further tensions with the u s rafferty said ___ associated press writer christopher bodeen

by reuters by lucia mutikani washington reuters the u s economy likely maintained a moderate pace of growth in the first quarter which could further dispel earlier fears of a recession even though activity was driven by temporary factors the commerce department s gross domestic product gdp report to be published on friday at 8 30 a m edt 1230 gmt is expected to sketch a picture of an economy growing close to potential mostly reflecting the impact of an ebbing boost from a giant fiscal stimulus and past interest rate increases gross domestic product probably increased at a 2 0 percent annualised rate in the first quarter as a burst in exports strong inventory stockpiling and government investment in public construction projects offset slowdowns in consumer and business spending according to a reuters survey of economists with global growth still sluggish the surge in exports is likely to reverse and the inventory build will probably need to be worked off which could curtail production at factories that could restrain growth in the second quarter the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the october december period growth has stepped down from a peak 4 2 percent pace in the second quarter of 2018 when the white house s 1 5 trillion 1 2 trillion tax cut package jolted consumer spending economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at between 1 7 and 2 0 percent the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record the economy remains solid but we anticipate a slowing in the pace of growth in the medium term as the tailwinds from fiscal stimulus fade and the headwinds of tighter monetary policy take hold said sam bullard a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina the economy stumbled at the turn of the year with a batch of weak economic reports suggesting first quarter gdp growth as low as a 0 2 percent rate the soft data stream stoked fears of a recession that were also exacerbated by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve some of the weak data especially retail sales were blamed on a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government which hurt confidence and delayed processing of tax refunds since the shutdown ended on jan 25 economic data have mostly perked up leading to a sharp upgrading of first quarter gdp estimates slower but moderate economic growth is continuing and we might see some slight acceleration as we head into second quarter said sung won sohn an economics professor at loyola marymount university in los angeles weak domestic demand the improvement in the economy s fortunes has been mirrored by strong corporate profits for the quarter some economists caution that growth could surprise on the downside because of a seasonal quirk the so called residual seasonality has tended to understate economic growth in the first quarter though the government said last year it had addressed the methodology problem economists believe residual seasonality has not been entirely eliminated from the data a surge in exports and weak imports are expected to have sharply narrowed the trade deficit in the first quarter trade is believed to have added more than one percentage point to gdp after being neutral in the fourth quarter trade tensions between the united states and china have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants the trade standoff has also had an impact on inventories which are expected to have increased in the first quarter at their strongest pace since 2015 part of the inventory build is related to weak demand especially in the automotive sector advertisement inventories are expected to have contributed a full percentage point to first quarter gdp after adding one tenth of a percentage point in the october december period excluding trade and inventories the economy is expected to have expanded at a roughly 1 6 percent rate in the first quarter economists said federal reserve officials were likely to focus on this growth measure the fed recently suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign dropping forecasts for any interest rate hikes this year the u s central bank increased borrowing costs four times in 2018 the composition of the data will not look favourably on domestic economic activity nor provide a positive forward look at current quarter activity said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm in new york policymakers will likely look past this growth report when formulating rate policy growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity is expected to have slowed significantly from the fourth quarter s 2 5 percent rate economists said the government shutdown was the main factor behind the anticipated deceleration in spending advertisement a moderation is also expected in businesses spending on equipment because of the delayed impact of sharp drops in oil prices towards the end of 2018 and fading depreciation provisions in the 2018 tax bill supply chain disruptions caused by washington s trade war with beijing were also seen crimping business investment reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci
by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s economic growth accelerated in the first quarter but the burst in growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015 temporary boosters that are seen weighing on the economy later this year the surge in growth reported by the commerce department on friday put to rest fears of a recession that were stoked by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve in march but it also exaggerates the health of the economy as consumer and business spending slowed sharply and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter gross domestic product increased at a 3 2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter the government said in its advance gdp report growth was also driven by increased investment in roads by local and state governments the gain in first quarter gdp would seem to make a mockery of claims that the u s economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto looking beyond the headline number however there are plenty of causes for concern the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the october december period economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp increasing at a 2 0 percent rate in the first three months of the year the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record advertisement advertisement president donald trump cheered the economy s performance in the first quarter this is far above expectations or projections trump tweeted the white house has sought to boost growth through an array of policies including a 1 5 trillion tax cut package passed in december 2017 economists believe the fiscal stimulus which also included more government spending peaked in the third quarter they expect gdp to slow this year with annual growth forecast around 2 5 percent below the trump s administration s 3 percent target the economy missed the growth target in 2018 excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at only a 1 3 percent rate in the first quarter the slowest since the second quarter of 2013 this measure of domestic demand increased at a 2 6 percent pace in the october december quarter advertisement advertisement a gauge of inflation tracked by the federal reserve increased at a 1 3 percent rate last quarter fed policymakers are likely to shrug off the last quarter s growth spurt and focus on the weak domestic demand and inflation when they meet next week the u s central bank recently suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign dropping forecasts for any interest rate increases this year the fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018 the fed will focus on the composition of growth which points to a slowing trend amid softening inflation said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm in new york this data reinforces the prudent pause the fed is engaged in the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies as investors fretted over the weak details of the gdp report u s treasury prices rose while stocks on wall street were mixed advertisement advertisement business spending stalls exports surged and imports declined in the first quarter leading to a small deficit that added 1 03 percentage points to gdp after being neutral in the fourth quarter trade tensions between the united states and china have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants the standoff has also had an impact on inventories which increased at a 128 4 billion rate in the first quarter the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015 inventories increased at a 96 8 billion pace in the october december quarter part of the inventory build was because of weak demand especially in the automotive sector which is expected to weigh on future production at factories inventories contributed 0 65 percentage point to first quarter gdp after adding one tenth of a percentage point in the october december period advertisement advertisement growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity slowed to a 1 2 percent rate from the fourth quarter s 2 5 percent rate the moderation in spending reflected a decline in motor vehicle purchases and other goods likely related to a 35 day shutdown of the federal government there was also a slowdown in spending on services the government said the shutdown had subtracted three tenths of a percentage point from gdp last quarter retail sales have since rebounded strongly pointing to some acceleration in consumption in the second quarter momentum in consumer spending picked up toward the end of the first quarter which augurs well for a better consumption outcome in the second quarter said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york even so we continue to expect gdp growth to step down to a 2 25 percent pace in second quarter business spending on equipment braked sharply rising at only at a 0 2 percent rate the slowest since the third quarter of 2016 spending was held down by weak outlays on agricultural machinery and office furniture investment in structures contracted for a third straight quarter advertisement advertisement residential construction fell at a 2 8 percent rate marking the fifth straight quarterly decline government investment rebounded at a 2 4 percent rate driven by spending at state and local governments federal government spending was flat reporting by lucia
