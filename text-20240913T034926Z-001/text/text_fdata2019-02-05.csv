it was perhaps the closest that the economics profession has ever come to a consensus in january 43 of the world s most eminent economists signed a statement published in the wall street journal calling for a us carbon tax the list included 27 nobel laureates four former chairs of the federal reserve and nearly every former chair of the council of economic advisers since the 1970s both republican and democratic by correcting a well known market failure a carbon tax will send a powerful price signal that harnesses the invisible hand of the marketplace to steer economic actors towards a low carbon future the economists noted all revenue from the tax should be paid in equal lump sum rebates directly to us citizens they added not all economists agree that the tax should be revenue neutral in this way but the profession has been coalescing in recent years around the idea of a carbon tax most prefer such a tax to the most prominent alternative policy for tackling carbon emissions cap and trade according to a recent poll of expert economists but a carbon tax seems to be a political nonstarter in the united states the bipartisan call for action from economists over the years has been echoed by a failure to act by presidents from both parties president donald trump denies the need to confront man made climate change but although barack obama his predecessor in 2015 called a carbon tax the most elegant way to fight global warming he didn t push strongly for one to be introduced one of my very very few disappointments in obama when he was president is that he did not come out in favor of carbon tax yale s william d nordhaus told the new york times last october days after winning the 2018 nobel prize in economic sciences for his work on economic modeling and climate change us states have shown that they too can reject a carbon tax even in heavily democratic washington state voters last year rejected for the second time a proposal to tax carbon dioxide emissions the new york times published an opinion column in december by one of its former environmental reporters titled forget the carbon tax for now calling it politically toxic days later paul krugman a times columnist and 2008 nobel laureate wrote that he too had concluded there was no near term political support for such a tax in terms of confronting climate change the us is a laggard twenty six countries and provinces have implemented some form of carbon tax according to the world bank and there are another 25 emissions trading systems in canada where some provinces have introduced carbon pricing prime minister justin trudeau is leading a charge to introduce a federal carbon tax with 90 percent of the revenues directly rebated to citizens to its proponents a carbon tax is simple and clearly beneficial it would account for the costs of pollution that aren t already priced into what people pay at the pump to fuel cars send to the electric company to power homes or offer up daily to amazon to have items shipped releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is heating the planet melting glaciers and changing the earth s weather patterns these emissions cause long term damage that could destroy the environment as we know it and the argument goes a tax would give businesses governments and households an incentive to reduce and ultimately eliminate them many believe the need for action is urgent according to the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration carbon stored in the earth s atmosphere is at its highest levels in 800 000 years the effects of the warming atmosphere will be felt more quickly than anticipated a un scientific panel concluded last october saying that without a global carbon tax any temperature target will be exponentially harder to meet however does a tax arguably the best economic tool that exists for addressing climate change have any possibility of ever being implemented widely and if not through a carbon tax how should we put a price on carbon the cost of carbon economists generally believe that we as current users of fossil fuels heating and air conditioning our homes driving to work have gotten a free ride for too long because the price we pay at the pump however high it may seem accounts only for the costs of extracting and refining the oil plus profit and overhead for the company selling it we re not paying for the costs that come later in the form of harm to future generations rising sea levels destructive heat and erratic weather patterns and social and political turmoil the market hasn t accounted for these external costs because they are not embedded in the prices of the carbon intensive goods we produce and consume today as a result we ignore those costs carbon emissions are high and the burden falls on others down the road this puts democracies in a particular political pickle when a commuter burns a tank of gas and belches exhaust the brunt of the bill is passed to future generations the same is true for people who fly in planes or leave their lights or appliances switched on using electricity often supplied by burning coal the free ride has gone on for so long how can anyone convince the current generation of consumers many of whom are skeptical that the government s role should be expanded that the bill should land on them carbon emissions create an economic externality when the costs of an economic activity are borne by neither the producer nor the consumer economists would have us measure the cost of the externality and add it to the price of the good if producing plastic coffee pods releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for example the price of pods at the grocery store would reflect that the idea is that adding to the costs of pollution will eventually reduce pollution as businesses and consumers find money saving alternatives however the amount today s consumers should pay for tomorrow s problems is far from settled science nordhaus one of the first economists to consider the role of the changing climate in economic growth pioneered a climate change model that estimates the social cost of carbon emissions and has become something of an industry standard but models involve various discount rates and significant assumptions yielding vastly different estimates and there s disagreement about whether or not to attempt to include costs associated with unknown but potentially catastrophic events caused by climate change such as reduced biodiversity or even war should carbon be priced at 30 a ton or 300

the call over to jim zallie james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks heather and welcome to everyone joining us today let me start with a discussion of our fourth quarter and what was most relevant the market dynamics in north america as we have discussed in prior calls we have been strategically focused on positioning our business toward the shifts in consumer preferences and a changing customer landscape operating income in north america was down for the quarter impacted by lower sweetener demand higher supply chain costs and commodity margin pressures in response we continued to make progress against cost smart actioning 11 million of run rate savings exceeding our 5 million target for the year we successfully retained our west coast customers having reduced our us high fructose corn syrup manufacturing footprint with the cessation of operations at our stockton plant and we continued to invest in our specialties growth platforms with our decision to diversify our portfolio into plant based proteins with the announced acquisition and retrofitting of a plant to produce p protein and the formation of a new joint venture with verdient produce a range of pulse based protein ingredients in addition we enhanced our sugar reduction formulating capabilities by building new processing capacity in mexico to produce the rare sugar allulose moving outside of north america we continued to experience the effects of foreign currency devaluations primarily in brazil argentina and pakistan in response to market conditions and foreign currency devaluations we are taking a series of pricing actions to mitigate currency impacts in addition we continue to structurally reduce our cost base an example of which is the extension of our shared service capabilities into latin america to highlight the quarter four results ingredion volumes were up 2 driven by specialty growth north america and south america operating incomes were down asia pacific operating income was up given pricing actions to offset the extraordinary rise in tapioca costs that we ve experienced throughout the year emea operating income was down slightly given a lag in pricing to offset the pakistan rupee devaluation during the quarter we continued to deploy cash for shareholder value creation with nearly 4 25 million of share repurchases for the full year our volumes were up 1 driven by specialty volume growth our specialty portfolio grew to 29 of total net sales driven by continued demand for ingredients from our on trend specialty growth platforms such as clean and simple ingredients sugar reduction in specialty sweeteners and specialty texturizers i m pleased that our team is finding attractive investment opportunities to further broaden our specialty ingredient portfolio in addition to the p and pulse protein and sugar reduction investments mentioned earlier we also announced 60 million of investments in thailand and china to support additional specialties growth by expanding our modified and clean label starch capabilities in tapioca waxy corn and rice and we continued to deploy cash for shareholders with our fourth consecutive annual dividend increase announced in september and a total of 5 8 million of share repurchases during 2018 now moving to north america net sales were slightly down for the year volumes were flat driven by increases in specialties and gains in mexico partially offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes higher freight costs impacted price mix full year operating income in north america was 545 million down 17 from last year as we ve mentioned in prior call calls our production costs were higher due to rebalancing of inventories and starch production across our network as well as operational inflation we also continued to experience the residual impact of commodity margin pressures on our business in south america net sales were down for the year due to significant foreign currency devaluations however the team managed through multiple price increases to offset higher raw material costs due to a smaller crop in argentina and the impact of forex declines this resulted in a 13 increase in price mix full year operating income was 99 million up 18 million from the year ago period due to improved operational efficiencies and the lapping of the 2017 argentina work stoppage we continued to monitor the macroeconomic environment in argentina and are cautiously optimistic about economic growth in brazil the challenging macroeconomic environment in south america it is worth noting that for the second consecutive year our ingredion team in brazil was acknowledged for making our brazilian business one of the top 150 best workplaces in the country in asia pacific all year our team has worked to mitigate the impact of a short tapioca crop and rapid rise of tapioca costs for the year the team has been able to work with customers to partially pass through our raw material cost increases net sales show a 9 increase for the year driven by a 4 increase in price mix across the region the region delivered 104 million of operating income and although down 10 versus the prior year quarter four operating income was up 15 versus the same quarter last year finally the emea region delivered 5 net sales growth due to strong european specialty growth and a great effort by our pakistan team to manage price increases to cover higher corn costs and a devaluation of the rupee 2018 operating income was 116 million up 2 now let me hand off to jim gray who will discuss our financial performance jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jim i ll start by covering q4 s performance net sales of 1 426 billion were down slightly for the quarter gross profit margin was lower by 260 basis points driven primarily by weaker performance in north america reported and adjusted operating incomes were 158 million and 177 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 19 million the difference was due to 18 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility while the balance was attributable to our cost smart sg a initiatives our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 1 36 and 1 61 respectively q4 net sales of 1 426 billion were 11 million down from the same quarter last year unfavorable fx of 98 million was primarily attributable to currency devaluations in argentina brazil and pakistan volume increases contributed to 28 million of sales increase as well as a 59 million increase from favorable price mix in north america volume was slightly up year over year driven by gains in mexico offsetting expected lower sweetener syrup volume as we ceased operations at our stockton facility price mix in north america was down given higher freight costs and commodity margin pressures in south america foreign exchange devaluation was the largest driver of the year over year net sales decline volume was down 7 due to the impacts of the argentina recession on beverage sales and weaker brewing sales in brazil price mix was up 22 as our teams took price increases to pass through higher raw material costs and recapture some of the foreign exchange impact in argentina and brazil apac had specialty and core volume growth and price mix was up given tapioca pricing pass through emea had strong volume growth driven by specialties in europe and pakistan delivered positive net sales growth driven by price increases to offset the fourth quarter rupee devaluations for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income decreased 44 million and 32 million respectively north america operating income decreased 25 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing and lower sweetener volumes south america operating income was down 5 million driven by the impacts of the argentina recession on net sales versus the year ago period and impacts of currency devaluation on applied hyperinflation accounting asia pacific was up 4 million driven primarily by higher price mix given pricing pass through of tapioca costs and higher volumes emea was down slightly due to the impacts of unfavorable pakistan foreign exchange and higher corn costs offset partially by favorable specialty and core volume corporate costs were higher by 5 million for the quarter given further investment to optimize our global processes via our cost smart initiatives and continued investment in r d to drive specialties growth we ll wrap up the discussion of the quarter with earnings per share on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 30 per share primarily driven by a margin decline of 0 23 per share attributable to north america and partially offset by 0 07 per share in volume gains unfavorable foreign exchange was 0 15 per share moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 18 per share for the quarter largely driven by favorable tax and lower average shares outstanding partially offset by higher financing costs financing costs were a 0 03 per share decrease driven by higher debt balance as compared to a year ago period lower adjusted taxes contributed an 0 11 per share benefit primarily driven by us tax reform shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 10 a share for the full year the company delivered 5 841 billion of net sales which was up slightly from 2017 reported and adjusted operating incomes were 703 million and 767 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 64 million the difference was due to 49 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility 11 million of charges associated with cost smart sg a initiatives and 4 million of other restructuring costs our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 6 17 and 6 92 respectively as we look more closely at net sales by region you can see unfavorable foreign exchange which totaled 198 million for the year affected most prominently in south america led by the argentine peso and brazilian real devaluations volume growth for the year was positive 76 million volumes were up in asia pacific and emea in north america volume was flat with increases in mexico and specialty ingredients offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes in total the price mix increase was 131 million up 2 price mix was down slightly in north america due to higher freight costs and lower commodity values in other regions price mix was up due to pass through of raw material costs and fx full year reported and adjusted operating income decreased 133 million and 111 million respectively north america operating income decreased 109 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing lower sweetener volumes and commodity margin pressures south america operating income was up 18 million driven by our more competitive cost structure in brazil due to operational excellence initiatives and in argentina due to our new labor agreement and organizational restructuring asia pacific was down 11 million driven by higher tapioca costs emea was up 2 million with specialty and core volume growth more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds in pakistan corporate costs were higher by 11 million given the same reasons impacting the quarter moving to earnings per share operationally we saw a decrease of 1 08 per share challenges in north america costs and higher tapioca costs in asia were primary contributors to a margin decline of 1 15 per share volume increases contributed 0 34 to help offset the decline unfavorable foreign exchange of 0 29 primarily in the second half of the year was driven by currency weakness in emea and south america moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 30 per share for the year largely driven by a lower tax rate and reduced shares outstanding adjusted taxes were a 0 27 per share benefit driven by the impact of the revaluation of the mexican peso and the us dollar denominated balances in mexico a reduced valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary and us tax reform while shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 16 a share these benefits were partially offset by higher financing costs of 0 12 per share which includes the impacts of argentina s hyperinflation accounting and a higher debt balance 2018 cash provided by operations was 703 million this was lower than expected due to a decision to curtail use of customer financing programs primarily in mexico given the rising costs of these programs due to higher short term interest rates capital expenditures of 349 million were up 43 million year over year driven by capacity expansions for our specialties growth platforms that support plant based proteins and sugar reduction finally the board supported significant share repurchase programs in 2018 amounting to 657 million of expenditures turning to our outlook we anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 80 to 7 50 this excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we are expecting a flat to slightly up adjusted operating income for the year primarily due to our expectation that north america operating profit will be flat year over year although we are benefiting from approximately 20 million of one time cost impacts in 2018 we are expecting modest margin compression that can be explained by the following two circumstances coming together first the impact of us and china trade negotiations on soybean supply and inventories in the us is having a secondary impact on the cost of corn to us we sell corn byproducts which somewhat compete with soy meal protein and oil these values have been down since the first half of 2018 in effect this raises our cost of corn because we do not realize as much value from the sale of our corn byproducts to remind you co product sales are approximately 14 of our net sales second late in the contracting season we experienced competition for sweetener syrup volume and pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher net cost of corn and inflation expected in 2019 we are pleased with the retention of our west coast customer volumes as we transitioned service to other facilities in our network and we expect our utilization rates to be significantly higher in 2019 although these circumstances are impacting our 2019 north america profit growth expectations we believe our operating model still offers the opportunity for long run margin growth as we move more toward a greater weighting of specialty ingredients we anticipate that the impact of foreign exchange will be negative for 2019 and we expect significant negative currency of 25 million to 35 million during the first half of the year relative to the prior year we expect operating expenses including corporate expenses to be up year over year as we invest in global business process optimization and innovation to drive both cost savings and increased customer intimacy and growth we expect financing costs for the year to be in the range of 82 million to 87 million due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and higher debt balance our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 26 and 27 5 we expect total diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 68 million to 69 million for the year considering the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreement lastly we anticipate cumulative cost smart run rate savings of 24 million to 34 million by the end of 2019 against wage inflation of 2 5 to 3 in north america we expect net sales and volumes to be down for the full year we expect operating income to be flat to 2018 with the first half down due to the lapping of net corn costs and the second half to be up as we lap more of the one time impacts from 2018 in regards to 2019 sweetener contracting we were pleased with our volume retention especially in light of our decision to stop production at stockton however sweetener pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher expected net cost of corn and inflation which we anticipate will create slight margin pressure in our sweetener business we are pleased with the results of our starch pricing and contracting negotiations south american net sales are expect to be up versus the prior year volumes are expected to be down given argentina economic headwinds and the impact on sweetener syrup sales given the anticipated rapid pace and magnitude of fx devaluations we expect our business model requires the first half to recover so we anticipate operating income growth to be back half loaded in addition we anticipate positive economic growth for brazil we remain watchful of economic reforms inflation and impact on the upcoming election in argentina we continue to focus on business performance improvement and expect operating income improvement in the region asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be up modestly we expect weaker operating income in the first half with a stronger second half in emea we expect net sales to be up we anticipate strong specialties performance in europe and core growth in pakistan although we expect modest operating income growth we anticipate currency and raw material cost overlaps in pakistan will lead to a weaker first half versus the second half we expect cash from operations in 2019 to be in the range of 650 million to 700 million we expect to invest between 330 million and 360 million in capital expenditures around the world to support growth as well as cost and process improvements importantly we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders that brings my comments to a close now back to jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks jim in closing our leadership team remains focused on navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our core businesses in north america and argentina we are committed to driving operational improvements throughout our business and structurally lowering costs equally we are energized by our commercial excellence initiative to grow co create and win with customers we are excited by the prospects of our recent specialties growth platform investments which will provide new ingredients and formulating capabilities to deliver consumer preferred innovation to our customers we are pleased to announce that we recently have been once again named to fortune s most admired companies list for the 10th consecutive year we will be presenting at consumer analyst group of new york on february 19th and i will discuss in greater detail our new specialty strategy which includes five new specialty growth platforms which are sharply aligned with consumer trends and lastly as we have recently demonstrated we will continue to use our strong balance sheet to invest in specialties growth opportunities and pursue m a we remain committed to delivering long term shareholder value and now let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator operating instructions your first question comes from the line of robert moskow from credit suisse please go ahead robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst hi thank you hi jim and jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi rob robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst i was hoping you could help me understand the price negotiations for north america this year you said that you expect profits to be down in sweeteners but that you were pleased with the negotiations on starch to what extent are you able to still swing capacity from one to the other and i guess in the past i have heard you talk about that as a lever you can pull if you re having trouble getting pricing or if there s too much volume in the market in one of the other and then i had a follow up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i would just repeat that for sweeteners contracting basically we accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish in relationship to the stockton closure and maintaining our west coast customers so there was no loss of share that we did not plan for as it relates to how contracting went and pricing went toward the back end of contracting there seemed to be more competitive intensity for volume and therefore pricing and margin compression occurred and that s why we re indicating there s a little bit of margin compression in relationship to sweeteners we were pleased however with the starch pricing and the contracting negotiations the sweetener network for us this upcoming year is going to be operating at full capacity and our starch production and inventory rebalancings are going on throughout the year and will steadily improve throughout the year so that s basically how i would explain it rob yeah rob i mean i d add that while a lot of our infrastructure investment is around the corn receiving and the steepening and the wet mill we always are thinking about finishing lines and capex that can allow us to toggle between what we do with the slurry that comes off of the starch grind that transition takes more planning and i would say the horizon on that is kind of multiple year so that s been a journey that we have be on as we think about which plants and then which finishing lines we would like to toggle more toward our starch and or our specialty production i think a good example of that is we added some capacity for the rare sugar allulose lows at one of our mexico facilities in order to make allulose we are actually toggling on high fructose so we use high fructose we refine that down and down into a process what you derive out is the rare sugar allulose robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay and i guess my follow up here is you talked a lot about improving the mix through specialty starches and more capital being headed in that direction can you give us a sense of whether your profits in specialty starches were up or down this year i know the percentage of your sales is up but i guess i m unclear on whether just moving in the specialty direction has whether the margin structure in that part of the business has held up and what your outlook is for 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure rob i ll take that question overall just to start our specialties are about 29 of our net sales they sell at higher average price points per ton than the remainder of the business and whether it s the gross profit margin levels are much higher than the remainder of our business from year to year as we target mid single to high to single digit net sales growth in our specialty portfolio we are seeing that corresponding type of gross profit growth i think in 18 in particular really within us canada the co product values pressures that we saw do impact specialties as well as our core sweetener and industrial starch business but nonetheless i still think year over year we saw growth in our overall profit pool of specialties particularly in some markets where we re really seeing some strong specialty growth outside of us canada is where we really really see some acceleration of that portfolio james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah and i would just add that the price points have held and in fact obviously we ve been able to get the pricing up in tapioca related to the increases in raw material costs robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay thank you very much james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david driscoll from citi please go ahead david driscoll citi analyst thank you and good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hey david david driscoll citi analyst i wanted to come back to some of the points that rob was raising and try it maybe slightly different so it looks to me like your north american operations in 2018 profits were down more than 100 million however your volumes for the full year were not they were flat you closed stockton so this frame it for me guys why does it feel when you say that you re not getting the pricing that you expected like why aren t you it doesn t look like utilization rates would be down i think you said you re running at full capacity that normally would have correlated with the stronger ability or a better ability to get pricing that s not happening so there is some kind of disconnect and i was hoping you could maybe explain why and if somewhere in that answer you could kind of tell me where you think industry utilization rates are that would also be helpful and then a follow up if i can james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i m going to let jim take a shot at that and then i ll add some commentary okay james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think david when we summarized north american roll it up we do kind of break apart into two big businesses underlying mexico so mexico was seeing some volume growth i also think that within us canada we were seeing growth in necessarily in our food starches where we faced the headwind was really in our sweetener volume portfolio primarily us canada and that was from 2017 into 2018 as we alluded to on calls we really did see some unique challenges in high fructose into beverages and that business was down two times what we ve seen our historical rate to be james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah the industry data david and i m sure you re aware of this is showing that for 2018 the rate of decline of hfcs has been now 2x the rate for say the previous five to 10 years so there is absolutely a step down or increase in the rate of decline of hfcs and we felt the effects of that in 2018 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer so then as we moved to ceasing operations at stockton in november we re seeing some purposeful shed of sweetener volume high fructose volume there at the last couple of months of the year as we move into 19 we expect that sweetener volumes to be down 19 versus 18 what really occurred i think at the end of the year david was that we re moving the remainder of that west coast volume back into our existing plants and in us canada we re taking that utilization rate up significantly as we head into 19 so that should help us with fixed cost absorption versus our sweetener overall in kind of our core plants does that answer some of your questions hopefully david driscoll citi analyst it does just two quick follow ups one i think that you ve tried so hard in 2018 to recover some of this freight pricing and i want to say that that looks only to be marginally successful but would like to hear your opinion on your ability in 18 to go back to customers and recover some of that freight inflation and then my final question would just be we hear reports that there are significant unrest within the mexican sugar industry and calls for some kind of punitive action taken against us high fructose corn syrup could you just bring us up to speed and is there any risk to the high fructose operations either in mexico or the us mexican trade on high fructose given some of the disruption that s been going on in the mexican sugar industry thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay i ll take the last question and then i ll come back to the freight i am not aware of any acute near term issues that are going to be problematic in relationship to the hfcs with mexico so we will look into that and we will certainly get back to you but i m not aware of anything that s imminent in that regard as it relates to freight the freight inflation that we faced in the first quarter of last year we made significant progress against tightening up terms with customers and being able to pass through freight increases and then we ve obviously seen some moderation of those rate increases throughout the rest of the year so we feel actually very good that we ve been able to mitigate a large portion the majority portion of the freight increase that we absorbed in 18 and will benefit to some degree going into 2019 especially as it relates to dry van which you remember was the freight increase that impacted our starch shipments in the first quarter of 2018 and so that will be mitigated and improved situation as we go into 2019 david driscoll citi analyst thank you very much i ll pass it along james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you david james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow from bank of montreal please go ahead ken zaslow bmo analyst good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi ken james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi ken ken zaslow bmo analyst just one high level question you continue to talk about the commodity exposures and stuff like that but the question i have is at what level of ingredient business when you get to the mix will the impact of commodity not be a source of ups and downs of profitability or would be mitigated how do you think about that james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think as we ve talked to in terms of our specialty strategy with specialties representing about 29 of our net sales today as we look forward over the three to five years and continue to make investments to add to our portfolio i think when we get to the mid 30s as a percent of net sales for specialties that the profit contribution from that is a bigger part of our profit pool and because of the differentiation of our products and as long as it s coupled with continuing to have great customer service i think we ll be insulated a bit more from some of the ups and downs that occur in our core business how we sell our specialties and how our customers order is kind of a different process than necessarily the day to day week to week ordering of what you see in a sweetener syrup business james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i just would add to that that what we ve experienced in 2018 and what we anticipate in 2019 is obviously clearly a more challenged operating environment and there have been some significant impacts that we ve talked about in relationship to commodity margin pressures related to ethanol crush margins being at very very low levels and the net corn costs that have increased related to co product revenues just related to this china us trade dispute very unique situations that we have just not seen before that have impacted us to the order of magnitude in our core business so all that being said we ve systematically stayed very very focused and strategic in relationship to our specialties investments and growth and we are very excited by the prospects of those and again we ll be talking more about that at cagny from a standpoint of the growth rates associated with all of those platforms and the impact that those will be having over time that will then mitigate any kind of earnings volatility but what i would say is in 2018 what we saw was extraordinary in relationship to the order of magnitude of the impact to our core business related to some of those factors that i was talking about related to commodity margin pressures so i anticipate going forward we ll see less of impact in that regard because of the contribution coming from the specialties investments that we re making ken zaslow bmo analyst so my follow up questions is one you did say that your gross profit is significantly higher but you didn t talk about operating profit which quite honestly is probably more important and then the second question part of that is when you think about the earnings from the front half to the back half of the year is that a normalization of this environment or is this just and is that kind of like where you re going to be in terms of growth into 2012 as well or is this just saying hey it s just easy comps and that s just how this squishy year votes so those are my two finals thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director do you want to take the back versus the front half on the phasing james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey ken i do think that did that as you think about 19 really some of what we saw in the first half was first half of 18 was favorable net cost of corn in particular protein meal was pretty high and favorable as we went into the second half of 18 and you started to see the headwinds against soy and then candidly the soy crush margins were so attractive that you just had a lot of soy oil and lot soy meal coming off and that started to depress corn meal protein and corn oil prices and we really felt that in the second half of 18 so we re going to have that continuing as a lap into the first half of 19 so i think we just have to get that through and then we ll see and that broadly impacts kind of all of the business within the us canada and then you ll see more of the normal drivers i think that we have behind the business and that are more in our control as we move into the second half of the 19 so james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director right and forex also we re going to see significant forex headwinds continuing in the first half versus the second half so there are those two issues and just to a modest degree in asia pacific even we re going to be lapping lower corn prices in the first half in korea for example so there is this first half versus second half phasing issue that we anticipate related to the net corn costs squeeze or the co products squeeze that we have highlighted which we feel is a unique circumstance that s manifested itself in 2018 forex which will remain a headwind in the first half and then even in some of the other regions there is some unique impacts there that are phasing related to first half second half ken zaslow bmo analyst so it s more of a comp issue not a return to growth algorithm james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that s correct james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s a comp issue yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yes okay for the specialty products james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so ken i think i was trying to understand exactly your difference between gross profit and op income question ken zaslow bmo analyst you just said that the gross profit i think your comment was i don t have it written down i write sloppy unfortunately the gross profit was is higher your gross profit for specialty is higher than that and i think you gave a number of some sort is higher than that of your base business but you didn t translate that down to operating profit level which i think is more telling if that s ok james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would think that our generally we have not really commented on the differences in op income between specialty or the remainder of the portfolio that said when we think about our operating expense which is both which obviously includes sales as well as r d support generally that was pretty in line with what we thought our overall inflation would be so that would have there wasn t anything that was unusual that would imply that there was greater sg a investment i think against our specialty business versus the other lines of business in the portfolio ken zaslow bmo analyst thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of akshay jagdale from jefferies please go ahead akshay jagdale jefferies analyst hi good morning so just wanted to follow up just clarification on the gross profit commentary on specialty so you said gross profit for specialty was actually up but just as a point of clarification that excludes the impact of co product credits correct like james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer no akshay jagdale jefferies analyst no so your reported gross profit for specialty was up in 2018 despite the co product headwinds the production cost issues and whatever else correct so overall gross profit in specialty was up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think akshay we re mixing kind of scope here specifically when we re asked the overall specialty business we characterize as higher net sales growth higher price points and higher gross profit margins generally that business overall globally was still healthy okay specifically when we talk about comments upon co product values and the headwinds there that s kind of a us canada specific issue and so i just want to make sure that we re separating out the issues i would say that we still overall we re pleased with the way our specialty business performed in north america i mean there were there i think there were the challenges of co product values against all of the business in us canada but we re still pleased with how specialties has performed james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think that s where i think that s where the confusion occurred is the comment was that we did also experience some impact related to the co product revenue squeeze that would impact the specialties business as well but overall we re very pleased with the performance of the specialties business and the specialties profitability james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah akshay jagdale jefferies analyst okay and just going to the co product issue i think last quarter you gave us a nice earnings bridge about 100 million drag was the co product issue was that included in the 40 million from freight manufacturing and efficiencies in commodity margins or is this a different bucket now and can you can you just help us quantify that impact and maybe give us a sense of like can that move around if co product credits increase from here james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think when we addressed on the q3 call and we laid out the various drivers we did call out i think a bucket which was freight and emea inflation and commodity pricing pressures which had increased from our 40 million estimate that we had previously communicated i d say that s about 45 million and that s really just the step up in the co products value decrease that we were experiencing here but generally given what we had talked to in q3 the drivers were very very played out as we were trying to outline at that time akshay jagdale jefferies analyst and so just related to that so can you help us understand what the if you were to do a bridge for next for 19 you mentioned two major headwinds one was the co product credit hitting you guys and then the other was in your sweetener business margins being compressed can you give us some ballpark on those two and i mean on the co product side it s kind of out of your hands it s supply demand right but that can am i right in understanding that if spot prices move up there that will flow through your p l james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah on that last point yes and that s one of the reasons why we have set guidance where we did with such a wide range if you want to call it that because of that exact fact but i m going to let jim answer the question that you asked james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer and akshay i think maybe to help everybody on the call against our north america business what we really see is mexico modestly up i think if you look at the us canada business we would expect our food starch business to be up it s going to benefit a bit from what we would see in specialty top line growth as well as we continue to work through our starch rebalancing and our production issues those will play out all throughout 19 as we ve talked to before and we hope to be in a better position as we start into 2020 against the sweetener and industrial business you would have expected a step up as we lap the one time impacted of the argos shutdown as well as some the operational efficiencies and what we ve really seen is that combined with a relatively tight pricing market but the impact as well of lower co product values on our overall gross cost of our corn we re actually seeing that business modestly down for the year so those two kind of come together they necessarily offset and that s why we re seeing kind of a flat operating income expectation for north america i would say as well is that we are really just carrying forward an expectation that ethanol crush margins remain low again it s not a big part of our business it was something that was unexpected in 2018 as an impact but right now as we look forward to 2019 within our guidance we see that as relatively kind of staying the same to your point are there upsides if either ethanol crush margins move up or if we see some of the co product values start to increase i think that that would benefit our overall business within north america but that s not currently necessarily in our guidance akshay jagdale jefferies analyst got it and just one last one more on the specialty business long term right so obviously there s been a lot of noise operationally in the core business and margins have come down for the company but in the background it seems like you re investing pretty heavily on specialty so can you just give us a perspective on that and like what does that mean i mean should we expect you to increase at some point your long term guidance on growth for that business is that something we should expect down the road as a function of all the investments you re making thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah well i mean thank you for highlighting the investments that we ve made in specialty capacity increases specifically in china korea the us and mexico and again we re very excited we went through a strategic review in 2018 o our specialty strategy to refine it and that s led to five growth platforms that have us very clearly focused on the future investments that we will be making we will be sharing this at cagny and again those we anticipate will have above market growth rates associated with them with headroom for growth in each one of those and again we ll be weaving all of that into our both say near or mid term outlook for profitability as well as a longer term outlook for profitability and that s what we intend to talk about at cagny and it will be greatly emphasized around specialties and then obviously balanced by taking into account what we re experiencing these last two years last year and this year and taking a read on that environment that s impacting our core business if that helps akshay akshay jagdale jefferies analyst thank you i ll pass on that does help operator your next question comes from the line of heather jones from the vertical group please go ahead heather jones the vertical group analyst good morning james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning heather heather kos ingredion incorporated analyst thank you i have just a detailed question first reading the language in the press release i just wanted to clarify so it sounds like the asr you all expect that to be complete pretty soon james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct yeah heather jones the vertical group analyst okay then moving on to your operations i guess first i was wondering if you could share with us your view of what s driven the acceleration you mentioned that the decline in sweetener volumes for the us industry in general is two times the previous five or six years wondering if you could share your view of what s driving that acceleration james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think it s what we re all seeing in relationship to the concerns with sugar intake in general i think it s not just against hfcs i think also sugar itself is being formulated out of many products but it s consumer preferences really that i think are driving a lot of that demand the move toward smaller can sizes i guess for full calorie products from a standpoint of caloric intake and just a lot of the consumer trends that are driving government behavior et cetera if you look in certainly in argentina what we have experienced was just related purely we believe to macroeconomic demand destruction related to high inflation and consumers just getting squeezed in north america it s more trend related consumer trend related james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say also just add i think tactically for 2018 there were some impacts on costs to the beverage manufacturers we suspected that we would see some higher prices at retail and i think if you look at the scans ph data for the second half of the year whether it s iri or nielsen generally full calorie soda unit prices were up and i think that that led to a bit of volume headwinds in terms of consumption and obviously that leads to a bit of a volume challenge for us in our shipments of hf 55 into our beverage customers james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that was something actually then i think jim had signaled in quarter two that was likely to happen related to aluminum prices going up and related to pet prices going up and the beverage manufacturers putting through price increases and there certainly was a contributing factor to that heather jones the vertical group analyst and that makes sense so following that logic is it fair to assume then a sharp fall in acceleration not just from prior years but an acceleration in the decline as 2018 progressed into 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think what you saw was that during more of the summer months in 18 was when that change manifest itself and so that plays out in q4 for us there will be a little bit of that lap as you go into the first half of 19 but then it will be back into kind of whatever the normal year might be for how the beverage customers see the marketplace in 2019 heather jones the vertical group analyst and you mentioned as far as stockton and the closure of that facility that you kept the volume you were intending to keep but that your volumes in north america would be down do you have an estimate of what sweetener sales will be on a pro forma basis for that closure as a percentage of north american sales james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we do i mean it was generally when we looked at that facility and i won t give you specifics but we looked at that facility i think we were intending to shed probably less than about 20 of the volume at that facility and we were anticipating keeping about 80 that we could see that we could reasonably serve and source from other plants within our network heather jones the vertical group analyst okay and then my final question is on your projections for 19 was wondering if you could share with us what your assumption is as far as the whole the brexit issue i know it s not a huge proportion of your sales but it seems like it could have an impact on europe and i m just wondering if you what your assumptions are there james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i ll take a shot and then i ll let jim finish it up i think obviously if there is a hard brexit or brexit with no resolution which will be the worst case scenario it s more the impacts to the overall eu and the uk which could be problematic if there is a soft brexit with what s on the table now or some sort of resolution we don t really think the results of that are going to be material to our business really jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the two tactical things that we want to plan for is that if there is anything on a hard brexit and all of a suddenly there is new customs borders that are formed we want to make sure that we have inventory in the right place so then any of our food customers don t face any immediate outages and then second we have to deal with whatever the imposed tariff levels would be and at some point whether or not immediate or over a course of a year to year and a half those tariffs are going to play a role in increase cost of manufacture and eventually those will play through to a consumer at a shopping or a restaurant and that should actually create a bit of a headwind in terms of some volume decrease so really those two things we really kind of anticipate would be how that might move forward but it all depends upon the suddenness or the gradualness of how brexit plays out heather jones the vertical group analyst and my final question hopefully is a quick one but i know you guys don t really do brewing in the us but i question does have implications for the broader industry and thus you guys this push to get away from corn derivatives and brewing and move toward more authentic 100 barley is that just headlines at present or are you seeing in the broader industry a trend toward that that could affect the supply demand balance in the us over 19 20 james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director so we weren t seeing that in the us and i think we know why you re asking that question heather jones the vertical group analyst yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director but in relationship to our business the majority of our sales into brewing is in mexico as well as in south america and less so in the united states but jim do you want to make some additional comments james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i just think that the choice of the adjunct that the brewer uses is also very much a cost and a yield and a capacity throughput issue right so there is trade offs that our customers make but to jim s point mostly our business is primarily mexico as well as since in south america heather jones the vertical group analyst but for the end for the us industry which would impact overall supply demand and you re not seeing a big shift in the overall industry so far in the us james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director no i don t think so i think the industry is battling itself for share and they re looking for opportunities to create point of differentiation heather jones the vertical group analyst okay perfect thank you so much james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone a lot of ground has been covered so hopefully i will keep this brief just first on the cash flow and you made some comments in the prepared remarks about changing customer financing in mexico but it came in notably below where you guys were three months ago and it was both on the one time tax refund as well as the continuing ops and just little bit more color on how those two dynamics played out and what actually happened there james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think with regard to really the working capital adam i think that was probably more of the major change that we were expecting you know what as we saw as the year played out both in north america to a lesser extent in south america we have various programs where you can discount an invoice and sell it to an intermediary as you saw short term rates starting to climb significantly as you look at maybe a three month or six month libor it just became evident that in the second half of the year it made more sense to reduce or halt the sale of any of those discounted invoices and just hold onto it and then collect the revenues directly from the customer so that has an impact on your accounts receivable balance as it grows it also allows us to be a bit more in control of our accounts receivable and then we can use other means of short term financing where we think we can get a better overall cost and balance so you will see the impact in your net working capital but we might find that there s other short term debt opportunities that are actually quite more affordable for the company to go access and then your comment on the tax flows those two play back and forth in terms of as we are looking at both settlement in terms of our us and canada reviews and appeals that we ve had in place and those have played out and then also as we look forward to really getting clarity on the impact of guilty and fddi or fdii on our overall credits for taxes so we can talk more offline on that but adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful two other quick ones on north america just contracting the comments or the we getting later in the contracting season is that do you think that was is more a function of the sweetener demand side the weakness accelerating and that becoming more evident to your competitors or do you think it was a factor of ethanol margins being pretty lousy and some of the competitors having ethanol wet mill capacity that they can switch over to hfcs both or other factors james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i mean we don t really know what drove competitive actions i think both of what you ve just described are plausible explanations for what drove that behavior adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay and then last one just going back to i think it was heather s question about the use of corn derivatives in the beer industry you talked about mexico but brazil i mean is it are you seeing that pressure in brazil i know that s an important market for you and some of your bigger customers i think are facing some pressure there as you re seeing kind of the value segment of that market and malt only beers grow is that something that s more evidenced in your volume data that and just talk about that james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i would say that if there is a trend that starts to manifest itself in the united states should something manifest itself in the united states we re obviously going to be very watchful of where that may carry over but as of right now there s nothing material that s impacting our business related to that where some of this new noise or marketing positioning that s taking place that we saw on sunday last week james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yeah i wasn t talking about the super bowl specifically i was more just in brazil i mean the value segment of the market and malt only is growing a lot faster than the mainstream and i thought my understanding was it was the mainstream that uses maltose james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director what i would say is that we are very in tune to all the trends that are developing in brazil because we do supply to the brewing industry in brazil and anything that we would be anything that would be happening we would also be working with those customers from an innovation standpoint as well so but nothing that s right now any kind of a problem for us that we want to surface but we re working with those customers to evaluate trends as they develop and also work with them from a standpoint of innovation on adjuncts that they may need for the future adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay all right that s i appreciate the color excellent thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director all right and then i would just like to conclude by thanking everyone for their time today and hope to see many of you in february at the cagny conference operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your

pleased to turn the call over to jim zallie james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks heather and welcome to everyone joining us today let me start with a discussion of our fourth quarter and what was most relevant the market dynamics in north america as we have discussed in prior calls we have been strategically focused on positioning our business toward the shifts in consumer preferences and a changing customer landscape operating income in north america was down for the quarter impacted by lower sweetener demand higher supply chain costs and commodity margin pressures in response we continued to make progress against cost smart actioning 11 million of run rate savings exceeding our 5 million target for the year we successfully retained our west coast customers having reduced our us high fructose corn syrup manufacturing footprint with the cessation of operations at our stockton plant and we continued to invest in our specialties growth platforms with our decision to diversify our portfolio into plant based proteins with the announced acquisition and retrofitting of a plant to produce p protein and the formation of a new joint venture with verdient produce a range of pulse based protein ingredients in addition we enhanced our sugar reduction formulating capabilities by building new processing capacity in mexico to produce the rare sugar allulose moving outside of north america we continued to experience the effects of foreign currency devaluations primarily in brazil argentina and pakistan in response to market conditions and foreign currency devaluations we are taking a series of pricing actions to mitigate currency impacts in addition we continue to structurally reduce our cost base an example of which is the extension of our shared service capabilities into latin america to highlight the quarter four results ingredion volumes were up 2 driven by specialty growth north america and south america operating incomes were down asia pacific operating income was up given pricing actions to offset the extraordinary rise in tapioca costs that we ve experienced throughout the year emea operating income was down slightly given a lag in pricing to offset the pakistan rupee devaluation during the quarter we continued to deploy cash for shareholder value creation with nearly 4 25 million of share repurchases for the full year our volumes were up 1 driven by specialty volume growth our specialty portfolio grew to 29 of total net sales driven by continued demand for ingredients from our on trend specialty growth platforms such as clean and simple ingredients sugar reduction in specialty sweeteners and specialty texturizers i m pleased that our team is finding attractive investment opportunities to further broaden our specialty ingredient portfolio in addition to the p and pulse protein and sugar reduction investments mentioned earlier we also announced 60 million of investments in thailand and china to support additional specialties growth by expanding our modified and clean label starch capabilities in tapioca waxy corn and rice and we continued to deploy cash for shareholders with our fourth consecutive annual dividend increase announced in september and a total of 5 8 million of share repurchases during 2018 now moving to north america net sales were slightly down for the year volumes were flat driven by increases in specialties and gains in mexico partially offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes higher freight costs impacted price mix full year operating income in north america was 545 million down 17 from last year as we ve mentioned in prior call calls our production costs were higher due to rebalancing of inventories and starch production across our network as well as operational inflation we also continued to experience the residual impact of commodity margin pressures on our business in south america net sales were down for the year due to significant foreign currency devaluations however the team managed through multiple price increases to offset higher raw material costs due to a smaller crop in argentina and the impact of forex declines this resulted in a 13 increase in price mix full year operating income was 99 million up 18 million from the year ago period due to improved operational efficiencies and the lapping of the 2017 argentina work stoppage we continued to monitor the macroeconomic environment in argentina and are cautiously optimistic about economic growth in brazil the challenging macroeconomic environment in south america it is worth noting that for the second consecutive year our ingredion team in brazil was acknowledged for making our brazilian business one of the top 150 best workplaces in the country in asia pacific all year our team has worked to mitigate the impact of a short tapioca crop and rapid rise of tapioca costs for the year the team has been able to work with customers to partially pass through our raw material cost increases net sales show a 9 increase for the year driven by a 4 increase in price mix across the region the region delivered 104 million of operating income and although down 10 versus the prior year quarter four operating income was up 15 versus the same quarter last year finally the emea region delivered 5 net sales growth due to strong european specialty growth and a great effort by our pakistan team to manage price increases to cover higher corn costs and a devaluation of the rupee 2018 operating income was 116 million up 2 now let me hand off to jim gray who will discuss our financial performance jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jim i ll start by covering q4 s performance net sales of 1 426 billion were down slightly for the quarter gross profit margin was lower by 260 basis points driven primarily by weaker performance in north america reported and adjusted operating incomes were 158 million and 177 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 19 million the difference was due to 18 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility while the balance was attributable to our cost smart sg a initiatives our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 1 36 and 1 61 respectively q4 net sales of 1 426 billion were 11 million down from the same quarter last year unfavorable fx of 98 million was primarily attributable to currency devaluations in argentina brazil and pakistan volume increases contributed to 28 million of sales increase as well as a 59 million increase from favorable price mix in north america volume was slightly up year over year driven by gains in mexico offsetting expected lower sweetener syrup volume as we ceased operations at our stockton facility price mix in north america was down given higher freight costs and commodity margin pressures in south america foreign exchange devaluation was the largest driver of the year over year net sales decline volume was down 7 due to the impacts of the argentina recession on beverage sales and weaker brewing sales in brazil price mix was up 22 as our teams took price increases to pass through higher raw material costs and recapture some of the foreign exchange impact in argentina and brazil apac had specialty and core volume growth and price mix was up given tapioca pricing pass through emea had strong volume growth driven by specialties in europe and pakistan delivered positive net sales growth driven by price increases to offset the fourth quarter rupee devaluations for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income decreased 44 million and 32 million respectively north america operating income decreased 25 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing and lower sweetener volumes south america operating income was down 5 million driven by the impacts of the argentina recession on net sales versus the year ago period and impacts of currency devaluation on applied hyperinflation accounting asia pacific was up 4 million driven primarily by higher price mix given pricing pass through of tapioca costs and higher volumes emea was down slightly due to the impacts of unfavorable pakistan foreign exchange and higher corn costs offset partially by favorable specialty and core volume corporate costs were higher by 5 million for the quarter given further investment to optimize our global processes via our cost smart initiatives and continued investment in r d to drive specialties growth we ll wrap up the discussion of the quarter with earnings per share on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 30 per share primarily driven by a margin decline of 0 23 per share attributable to north america and partially offset by 0 07 per share in volume gains unfavorable foreign exchange was 0 15 per share moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 18 per share for the quarter largely driven by favorable tax and lower average shares outstanding partially offset by higher financing costs financing costs were a 0 03 per share decrease driven by higher debt balance as compared to a year ago period lower adjusted taxes contributed an 0 11 per share benefit primarily driven by us tax reform shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 10 a share for the full year the company delivered 5 841 billion of net sales which was up slightly from 2017 reported and adjusted operating incomes were 703 million and 767 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 64 million the difference was due to 49 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility 11 million of charges associated with cost smart sg a initiatives and 4 million of other restructuring costs our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 6 17 and 6 92 respectively as we look more closely at net sales by region you can see unfavorable foreign exchange which totaled 198 million for the year affected most prominently in south america led by the argentine peso and brazilian real devaluations volume growth for the year was positive 76 million volumes were up in asia pacific and emea in north america volume was flat with increases in mexico and specialty ingredients offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes in total the price mix increase was 131 million up 2 price mix was down slightly in north america due to higher freight costs and lower commodity values in other regions price mix was up due to pass through of raw material costs and fx full year reported and adjusted operating income decreased 133 million and 111 million respectively north america operating income decreased 109 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing lower sweetener volumes and commodity margin pressures south america operating income was up 18 million driven by our more competitive cost structure in brazil due to operational excellence initiatives and in argentina due to our new labor agreement and organizational restructuring asia pacific was down 11 million driven by higher tapioca costs emea was up 2 million with specialty and core volume growth more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds in pakistan corporate costs were higher by 11 million given the same reasons impacting the quarter moving to earnings per share operationally we saw a decrease of 1 08 per share challenges in north america costs and higher tapioca costs in asia were primary contributors to a margin decline of 1 15 per share volume increases contributed 0 34 to help offset the decline unfavorable foreign exchange of 0 29 primarily in the second half of the year was driven by currency weakness in emea and south america moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 30 per share for the year largely driven by a lower tax rate and reduced shares outstanding adjusted taxes were a 0 27 per share benefit driven by the impact of the revaluation of the mexican peso and the us dollar denominated balances in mexico a reduced valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary and us tax reform while shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 16 a share these benefits were partially offset by higher financing costs of 0 12 per share which includes the impacts of argentina s hyperinflation accounting and a higher debt balance 2018 cash provided by operations was 703 million this was lower than expected due to a decision to curtail use of customer financing programs primarily in mexico given the rising costs of these programs due to higher short term interest rates capital expenditures of 349 million were up 43 million year over year driven by capacity expansions for our specialties growth platforms that support plant based proteins and sugar reduction finally the board supported significant share repurchase programs in 2018 amounting to 657 million of expenditures turning to our outlook we anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 80 to 7 50 this excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we are expecting a flat to slightly up adjusted operating income for the year primarily due to our expectation that north america operating profit will be flat year over year although we are benefiting from approximately 20 million of one time cost impacts in 2018 we are expecting modest margin compression that can be explained by the following two circumstances coming together first the impact of us and china trade negotiations on soybean supply and inventories in the us is having a secondary impact on the cost of corn to us we sell corn byproducts which somewhat compete with soy meal protein and oil these values have been down since the first half of 2018 in effect this raises our cost of corn because we do not realize as much value from the sale of our corn byproducts to remind you co product sales are approximately 14 of our net sales second late in the contracting season we experienced competition for sweetener syrup volume and pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher net cost of corn and inflation expected in 2019 we are pleased with the retention of our west coast customer volumes as we transitioned service to other facilities in our network and we expect our utilization rates to be significantly higher in 2019 although these circumstances are impacting our 2019 north america profit growth expectations we believe our operating model still offers the opportunity for long run margin growth as we move more toward a greater weighting of specialty ingredients we anticipate that the impact of foreign exchange will be negative for 2019 and we expect significant negative currency of 25 million to 35 million during the first half of the year relative to the prior year we expect operating expenses including corporate expenses to be up year over year as we invest in global business process optimization and innovation to drive both cost savings and increased customer intimacy and growth we expect financing costs for the year to be in the range of 82 million to 87 million due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and higher debt balance our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 26 and 27 5 we expect total diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 68 million to 69 million for the year considering the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreement lastly we anticipate cumulative cost smart run rate savings of 24 million to 34 million by the end of 2019 against wage inflation of 2 5 to 3 in north america we expect net sales and volumes to be down for the full year we expect operating income to be flat to 2018 with the first half down due to the lapping of net corn costs and the second half to be up as we lap more of the one time impacts from 2018 in regards to 2019 sweetener contracting we were pleased with our volume retention especially in light of our decision to stop production at stockton however sweetener pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher expected net cost of corn and inflation which we anticipate will create slight margin pressure in our sweetener business we are pleased with the results of our starch pricing and contracting negotiations south american net sales are expect to be up versus the prior year volumes are expected to be down given argentina economic headwinds and the impact on sweetener syrup sales given the anticipated rapid pace and magnitude of fx devaluations we expect our business model requires the first half to recover so we anticipate operating income growth to be back half loaded in addition we anticipate positive economic growth for brazil we remain watchful of economic reforms inflation and impact on the upcoming election in argentina we continue to focus on business performance improvement and expect operating income improvement in the region asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be up modestly we expect weaker operating income in the first half with a stronger second half in emea we expect net sales to be up we anticipate strong specialties performance in europe and core growth in pakistan although we expect modest operating income growth we anticipate currency and raw material cost overlaps in pakistan will lead to a weaker first half versus the second half we expect cash from operations in 2019 to be in the range of 650 million to 700 million we expect to invest between 330 million and 360 million in capital expenditures around the world to support growth as well as cost and process improvements importantly we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders that brings my comments to a close now back to jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks jim in closing our leadership team remains focused on navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our core businesses in north america and argentina we are committed to driving operational improvements throughout our business and structurally lowering costs equally we are energized by our commercial excellence initiative to grow co create and win with customers we are excited by the prospects of our recent specialties growth platform investments which will provide new ingredients and formulating capabilities to deliver consumer preferred innovation to our customers we are pleased to announce that we recently have been once again named to fortune s most admired companies list for the 10th consecutive year we will be presenting at consumer analyst group of new york on february 19th and i will discuss in greater detail our new specialty strategy which includes five new specialty growth platforms which are sharply aligned with consumer trends and lastly as we have recently demonstrated we will continue to use our strong balance sheet to invest in specialties growth opportunities and pursue m a we remain committed to delivering long term shareholder value and now let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator operating instructions your first question comes from the line of robert moskow from credit suisse please go ahead robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst hi thank you hi jim and jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi rob robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst i was hoping you could help me understand the price negotiations for north america this year you said that you expect profits to be down in sweeteners but that you were pleased with the negotiations on starch to what extent are you able to still swing capacity from one to the other and i guess in the past i have heard you talk about that as a lever you can pull if you re having trouble getting pricing or if there s too much volume in the market in one of the other and then i had a follow up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i would just repeat that for sweeteners contracting basically we accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish in relationship to the stockton closure and maintaining our west coast customers so there was no loss of share that we did not plan for as it relates to how contracting went and pricing went toward the back end of contracting there seemed to be more competitive intensity for volume and therefore pricing and margin compression occurred and that s why we re indicating there s a little bit of margin compression in relationship to sweeteners we were pleased however with the starch pricing and the contracting negotiations the sweetener network for us this upcoming year is going to be operating at full capacity and our starch production and inventory rebalancings are going on throughout the year and will steadily improve throughout the year so that s basically how i would explain it rob yeah rob i mean i d add that while a lot of our infrastructure investment is around the corn receiving and the steepening and the wet mill we always are thinking about finishing lines and capex that can allow us to toggle between what we do with the slurry that comes off of the starch grind that transition takes more planning and i would say the horizon on that is kind of multiple year so that s been a journey that we have be on as we think about which plants and then which finishing lines we would like to toggle more toward our starch and or our specialty production i think a good example of that is we added some capacity for the rare sugar allulose lows at one of our mexico facilities in order to make allulose we are actually toggling on high fructose so we use high fructose we refine that down and down into a process what you derive out is the rare sugar allulose robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay and i guess my follow up here is you talked a lot about improving the mix through specialty starches and more capital being headed in that direction can you give us a sense of whether your profits in specialty starches were up or down this year i know the percentage of your sales is up but i guess i m unclear on whether just moving in the specialty direction has whether the margin structure in that part of the business has held up and what your outlook is for 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure rob i ll take that question overall just to start our specialties are about 29 of our net sales they sell at higher average price points per ton than the remainder of the business and whether it s the gross profit margin levels are much higher than the remainder of our business from year to year as we target mid single to high to single digit net sales growth in our specialty portfolio we are seeing that corresponding type of gross profit growth i think in 18 in particular really within us canada the co product values pressures that we saw do impact specialties as well as our core sweetener and industrial starch business but nonetheless i still think year over year we saw growth in our overall profit pool of specialties particularly in some markets where we re really seeing some strong specialty growth outside of us canada is where we really really see some acceleration of that portfolio james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah and i would just add that the price points have held and in fact obviously we ve been able to get the pricing up in tapioca related to the increases in raw material costs robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay thank you very much james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david driscoll from citi please go ahead david driscoll citi analyst thank you and good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hey david david driscoll citi analyst i wanted to come back to some of the points that rob was raising and try it maybe slightly different so it looks to me like your north american operations in 2018 profits were down more than 100 million however your volumes for the full year were not they were flat you closed stockton so this frame it for me guys why does it feel when you say that you re not getting the pricing that you expected like why aren t you it doesn t look like utilization rates would be down i think you said you re running at full capacity that normally would have correlated with the stronger ability or a better ability to get pricing that s not happening so there is some kind of disconnect and i was hoping you could maybe explain why and if somewhere in that answer you could kind of tell me where you think industry utilization rates are that would also be helpful and then a follow up if i can james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i m going to let jim take a shot at that and then i ll add some commentary okay james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think david when we summarized north american roll it up we do kind of break apart into two big businesses underlying mexico so mexico was seeing some volume growth i also think that within us canada we were seeing growth in necessarily in our food starches where we faced the headwind was really in our sweetener volume portfolio primarily us canada and that was from 2017 into 2018 as we alluded to on calls we really did see some unique challenges in high fructose into beverages and that business was down two times what we ve seen our historical rate to be james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah the industry data david and i m sure you re aware of this is showing that for 2018 the rate of decline of hfcs has been now 2x the rate for say the previous five to 10 years so there is absolutely a step down or increase in the rate of decline of hfcs and we felt the effects of that in 2018 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer so then as we moved to ceasing operations at stockton in november we re seeing some purposeful shed of sweetener volume high fructose volume there at the last couple of months of the year as we move into 19 we expect that sweetener volumes to be down 19 versus 18 what really occurred i think at the end of the year david was that we re moving the remainder of that west coast volume back into our existing plants and in us canada we re taking that utilization rate up significantly as we head into 19 so that should help us with fixed cost absorption versus our sweetener overall in kind of our core plants does that answer some of your questions hopefully david driscoll citi analyst it does just two quick follow ups one i think that you ve tried so hard in 2018 to recover some of this freight pricing and i want to say that that looks only to be marginally successful but would like to hear your opinion on your ability in 18 to go back to customers and recover some of that freight inflation and then my final question would just be we hear reports that there are significant unrest within the mexican sugar industry and calls for some kind of punitive action taken against us high fructose corn syrup could you just bring us up to speed and is there any risk to the high fructose operations either in mexico or the us mexican trade on high fructose given some of the disruption that s been going on in the mexican sugar industry thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay i ll take the last question and then i ll come back to the freight i am not aware of any acute near term issues that are going to be problematic in relationship to the hfcs with mexico so we will look into that and we will certainly get back to you but i m not aware of anything that s imminent in that regard as it relates to freight the freight inflation that we faced in the first quarter of last year we made significant progress against tightening up terms with customers and being able to pass through freight increases and then we ve obviously seen some moderation of those rate increases throughout the rest of the year so we feel actually very good that we ve been able to mitigate a large portion the majority portion of the freight increase that we absorbed in 18 and will benefit to some degree going into 2019 especially as it relates to dry van which you remember was the freight increase that impacted our starch shipments in the first quarter of 2018 and so that will be mitigated and improved situation as we go into 2019 david driscoll citi analyst thank you very much i ll pass it along james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you david james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow from bank of montreal please go ahead ken zaslow bmo analyst good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi ken james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi ken ken zaslow bmo analyst just one high level question you continue to talk about the commodity exposures and stuff like that but the question i have is at what level of ingredient business when you get to the mix will the impact of commodity not be a source of ups and downs of profitability or would be mitigated how do you think about that james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think as we ve talked to in terms of our specialty strategy with specialties representing about 29 of our net sales today as we look forward over the three to five years and continue to make investments to add to our portfolio i think when we get to the mid 30s as a percent of net sales for specialties that the profit contribution from that is a bigger part of our profit pool and because of the differentiation of our products and as long as it s coupled with continuing to have great customer service i think we ll be insulated a bit more from some of the ups and downs that occur in our core business how we sell our specialties and how our customers order is kind of a different process than necessarily the day to day week to week ordering of what you see in a sweetener syrup business james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i just would add to that that what we ve experienced in 2018 and what we anticipate in 2019 is obviously clearly a more challenged operating environment and there have been some significant impacts that we ve talked about in relationship to commodity margin pressures related to ethanol crush margins being at very very low levels and the net corn costs that have increased related to co product revenues just related to this china us trade dispute very unique situations that we have just not seen before that have impacted us to the order of magnitude in our core business so all that being said we ve systematically stayed very very focused and strategic in relationship to our specialties investments and growth and we are very excited by the prospects of those and again we ll be talking more about that at cagny from a standpoint of the growth rates associated with all of those platforms and the impact that those will be having over time that will then mitigate any kind of earnings volatility but what i would say is in 2018 what we saw was extraordinary in relationship to the order of magnitude of the impact to our core business related to some of those factors that i was talking about related to commodity margin pressures so i anticipate going forward we ll see less of impact in that regard because of the contribution coming from the specialties investments that we re making ken zaslow bmo analyst so my follow up questions is one you did say that your gross profit is significantly higher but you didn t talk about operating profit which quite honestly is probably more important and then the second question part of that is when you think about the earnings from the front half to the back half of the year is that a normalization of this environment or is this just and is that kind of like where you re going to be in terms of growth into 2012 as well or is this just saying hey it s just easy comps and that s just how this squishy year votes so those are my two finals thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director do you want to take the back versus the front half on the phasing james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey ken i do think that did that as you think about 19 really some of what we saw in the first half was first half of 18 was favorable net cost of corn in particular protein meal was pretty high and favorable as we went into the second half of 18 and you started to see the headwinds against soy and then candidly the soy crush margins were so attractive that you just had a lot of soy oil and lot soy meal coming off and that started to depress corn meal protein and corn oil prices and we really felt that in the second half of 18 so we re going to have that continuing as a lap into the first half of 19 so i think we just have to get that through and then we ll see and that broadly impacts kind of all of the business within the us canada and then you ll see more of the normal drivers i think that we have behind the business and that are more in our control as we move into the second half of the 19 so james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director right and forex also we re going to see significant forex headwinds continuing in the first half versus the second half so there are those two issues and just to a modest degree in asia pacific even we re going to be lapping lower corn prices in the first half in korea for example so there is this first half versus second half phasing issue that we anticipate related to the net corn costs squeeze or the co products squeeze that we have highlighted which we feel is a unique circumstance that s manifested itself in 2018 forex which will remain a headwind in the first half and then even in some of the other regions there is some unique impacts there that are phasing related to first half second half ken zaslow bmo analyst so it s more of a comp issue not a return to growth algorithm james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that s correct james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s a comp issue yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yes okay for the specialty products james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so ken i think i was trying to understand exactly your difference between gross profit and op income question ken zaslow bmo analyst you just said that the gross profit i think your comment was i don t have it written down i write sloppy unfortunately the gross profit was is higher your gross profit for specialty is higher than that and i think you gave a number of some sort is higher than that of your base business but you didn t translate that down to operating profit level which i think is more telling if that s ok james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would think that our generally we have not really commented on the differences in op income between specialty or the remainder of the portfolio that said when we think about our operating expense which is both which obviously includes sales as well as r d support generally that was pretty in line with what we thought our overall inflation would be so that would have there wasn t anything that was unusual that would imply that there was greater sg a investment i think against our specialty business versus the other lines of business in the portfolio ken zaslow bmo analyst thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of akshay jagdale from jefferies please go ahead akshay jagdale jefferies analyst hi good morning so just wanted to follow up just clarification on the gross profit commentary on specialty so you said gross profit for specialty was actually up but just as a point of clarification that excludes the impact of co product credits correct like james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer no akshay jagdale jefferies analyst no so your reported gross profit for specialty was up in 2018 despite the co product headwinds the production cost issues and whatever else correct so overall gross profit in specialty was up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think akshay we re mixing kind of scope here specifically when we re asked the overall specialty business we characterize as higher net sales growth higher price points and higher gross profit margins generally that business overall globally was still healthy okay specifically when we talk about comments upon co product values and the headwinds there that s kind of a us canada specific issue and so i just want to make sure that we re separating out the issues i would say that we still overall we re pleased with the way our specialty business performed in north america i mean there were there i think there were the challenges of co product values against all of the business in us canada but we re still pleased with how specialties has performed james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think that s where i think that s where the confusion occurred is the comment was that we did also experience some impact related to the co product revenue squeeze that would impact the specialties business as well but overall we re very pleased with the performance of the specialties business and the specialties profitability james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah akshay jagdale jefferies analyst okay and just going to the co product issue i think last quarter you gave us a nice earnings bridge about 100 million drag was the co product issue was that included in the 40 million from freight manufacturing and efficiencies in commodity margins or is this a different bucket now and can you can you just help us quantify that impact and maybe give us a sense of like can that move around if co product credits increase from here james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think when we addressed on the q3 call and we laid out the various drivers we did call out i think a bucket which was freight and emea inflation and commodity pricing pressures which had increased from our 40 million estimate that we had previously communicated i d say that s about 45 million and that s really just the step up in the co products value decrease that we were experiencing here but generally given what we had talked to in q3 the drivers were very very played out as we were trying to outline at that time akshay jagdale jefferies analyst and so just related to that so can you help us understand what the if you were to do a bridge for next for 19 you mentioned two major headwinds one was the co product credit hitting you guys and then the other was in your sweetener business margins being compressed can you give us some ballpark on those two and i mean on the co product side it s kind of out of your hands it s supply demand right but that can am i right in understanding that if spot prices move up there that will flow through your p l james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah on that last point yes and that s one of the reasons why we have set guidance where we did with such a wide range if you want to call it that because of that exact fact but i m going to let jim answer the question that you asked james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer and akshay i think maybe to help everybody on the call against our north america business what we really see is mexico modestly up i think if you look at the us canada business we would expect our food starch business to be up it s going to benefit a bit from what we would see in specialty top line growth as well as we continue to work through our starch rebalancing and our production issues those will play out all throughout 19 as we ve talked to before and we hope to be in a better position as we start into 2020 against the sweetener and industrial business you would have expected a step up as we lap the one time impacted of the argos shutdown as well as some the operational efficiencies and what we ve really seen is that combined with a relatively tight pricing market but the impact as well of lower co product values on our overall gross cost of our corn we re actually seeing that business modestly down for the year so those two kind of come together they necessarily offset and that s why we re seeing kind of a flat operating income expectation for north america i would say as well is that we are really just carrying forward an expectation that ethanol crush margins remain low again it s not a big part of our business it was something that was unexpected in 2018 as an impact but right now as we look forward to 2019 within our guidance we see that as relatively kind of staying the same to your point are there upsides if either ethanol crush margins move up or if we see some of the co product values start to increase i think that that would benefit our overall business within north america but that s not currently necessarily in our guidance akshay jagdale jefferies analyst got it and just one last one more on the specialty business long term right so obviously there s been a lot of noise operationally in the core business and margins have come down for the company but in the background it seems like you re investing pretty heavily on specialty so can you just give us a perspective on that and like what does that mean i mean should we expect you to increase at some point your long term guidance on growth for that business is that something we should expect down the road as a function of all the investments you re making thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah well i mean thank you for highlighting the investments that we ve made in specialty capacity increases specifically in china korea the us and mexico and again we re very excited we went through a strategic review in 2018 o our specialty strategy to refine it and that s led to five growth platforms that have us very clearly focused on the future investments that we will be making we will be sharing this at cagny and again those we anticipate will have above market growth rates associated with them with headroom for growth in each one of those and again we ll be weaving all of that into our both say near or mid term outlook for profitability as well as a longer term outlook for profitability and that s what we intend to talk about at cagny and it will be greatly emphasized around specialties and then obviously balanced by taking into account what we re experiencing these last two years last year and this year and taking a read on that environment that s impacting our core business if that helps akshay akshay jagdale jefferies analyst thank you i ll pass on that does help operator your next question comes from the line of heather jones from the vertical group please go ahead heather jones the vertical group analyst good morning james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning heather heather kos ingredion incorporated analyst thank you i have just a detailed question first reading the language in the press release i just wanted to clarify so it sounds like the asr you all expect that to be complete pretty soon james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct yeah heather jones the vertical group analyst okay then moving on to your operations i guess first i was wondering if you could share with us your view of what s driven the acceleration you mentioned that the decline in sweetener volumes for the us industry in general is two times the previous five or six years wondering if you could share your view of what s driving that acceleration james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think it s what we re all seeing in relationship to the concerns with sugar intake in general i think it s not just against hfcs i think also sugar itself is being formulated out of many products but it s consumer preferences really that i think are driving a lot of that demand the move toward smaller can sizes i guess for full calorie products from a standpoint of caloric intake and just a lot of the consumer trends that are driving government behavior et cetera if you look in certainly in argentina what we have experienced was just related purely we believe to macroeconomic demand destruction related to high inflation and consumers just getting squeezed in north america it s more trend related consumer trend related james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say also just add i think tactically for 2018 there were some impacts on costs to the beverage manufacturers we suspected that we would see some higher prices at retail and i think if you look at the scans ph data for the second half of the year whether it s iri or nielsen generally full calorie soda unit prices were up and i think that that led to a bit of volume headwinds in terms of consumption and obviously that leads to a bit of a volume challenge for us in our shipments of hf 55 into our beverage customers james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that was something actually then i think jim had signaled in quarter two that was likely to happen related to aluminum prices going up and related to pet prices going up and the beverage manufacturers putting through price increases and there certainly was a contributing factor to that heather jones the vertical group analyst and that makes sense so following that logic is it fair to assume then a sharp fall in acceleration not just from prior years but an acceleration in the decline as 2018 progressed into 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think what you saw was that during more of the summer months in 18 was when that change manifest itself and so that plays out in q4 for us there will be a little bit of that lap as you go into the first half of 19 but then it will be back into kind of whatever the normal year might be for how the beverage customers see the marketplace in 2019 heather jones the vertical group analyst and you mentioned as far as stockton and the closure of that facility that you kept the volume you were intending to keep but that your volumes in north america would be down do you have an estimate of what sweetener sales will be on a pro forma basis for that closure as a percentage of north american sales james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we do i mean it was generally when we looked at that facility and i won t give you specifics but we looked at that facility i think we were intending to shed probably less than about 20 of the volume at that facility and we were anticipating keeping about 80 that we could see that we could reasonably serve and source from other plants within our network heather jones the vertical group analyst okay and then my final question is on your projections for 19 was wondering if you could share with us what your assumption is as far as the whole the brexit issue i know it s not a huge proportion of your sales but it seems like it could have an impact on europe and i m just wondering if you what your assumptions are there james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i ll take a shot and then i ll let jim finish it up i think obviously if there is a hard brexit or brexit with no resolution which will be the worst case scenario it s more the impacts to the overall eu and the uk which could be problematic if there is a soft brexit with what s on the table now or some sort of resolution we don t really think the results of that are going to be material to our business really jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the two tactical things that we want to plan for is that if there is anything on a hard brexit and all of a suddenly there is new customs borders that are formed we want to make sure that we have inventory in the right place so then any of our food customers don t face any immediate outages and then second we have to deal with whatever the imposed tariff levels would be and at some point whether or not immediate or over a course of a year to year and a half those tariffs are going to play a role in increase cost of manufacture and eventually those will play through to a consumer at a shopping or a restaurant and that should actually create a bit of a headwind in terms of some volume decrease so really those two things we really kind of anticipate would be how that might move forward but it all depends upon the suddenness or the gradualness of how brexit plays out heather jones the vertical group analyst and my final question hopefully is a quick one but i know you guys don t really do brewing in the us but i question does have implications for the broader industry and thus you guys this push to get away from corn derivatives and brewing and move toward more authentic 100 barley is that just headlines at present or are you seeing in the broader industry a trend toward that that could affect the supply demand balance in the us over 19 20 james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director so we weren t seeing that in the us and i think we know why you re asking that question heather jones the vertical group analyst yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director but in relationship to our business the majority of our sales into brewing is in mexico as well as in south america and less so in the united states but jim do you want to make some additional comments james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i just think that the choice of the adjunct that the brewer uses is also very much a cost and a yield and a capacity throughput issue right so there is trade offs that our customers make but to jim s point mostly our business is primarily mexico as well as since in south america heather jones the vertical group analyst but for the end for the us industry which would impact overall supply demand and you re not seeing a big shift in the overall industry so far in the us james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director no i don t think so i think the industry is battling itself for share and they re looking for opportunities to create point of differentiation heather jones the vertical group analyst okay perfect thank you so much james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone a lot of ground has been covered so hopefully i will keep this brief just first on the cash flow and you made some comments in the prepared remarks about changing customer financing in mexico but it came in notably below where you guys were three months ago and it was both on the one time tax refund as well as the continuing ops and just little bit more color on how those two dynamics played out and what actually happened there james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think with regard to really the working capital adam i think that was probably more of the major change that we were expecting you know what as we saw as the year played out both in north america to a lesser extent in south america we have various programs where you can discount an invoice and sell it to an intermediary as you saw short term rates starting to climb significantly as you look at maybe a three month or six month libor it just became evident that in the second half of the year it made more sense to reduce or halt the sale of any of those discounted invoices and just hold onto it and then collect the revenues directly from the customer so that has an impact on your accounts receivable balance as it grows it also allows us to be a bit more in control of our accounts receivable and then we can use other means of short term financing where we think we can get a better overall cost and balance so you will see the impact in your net working capital but we might find that there s other short term debt opportunities that are actually quite more affordable for the company to go access and then your comment on the tax flows those two play back and forth in terms of as we are looking at both settlement in terms of our us and canada reviews and appeals that we ve had in place and those have played out and then also as we look forward to really getting clarity on the impact of guilty and fddi or fdii on our overall credits for taxes so we can talk more offline on that but adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful two other quick ones on north america just contracting the comments or the we getting later in the contracting season is that do you think that was is more a function of the sweetener demand side the weakness accelerating and that becoming more evident to your competitors or do you think it was a factor of ethanol margins being pretty lousy and some of the competitors having ethanol wet mill capacity that they can switch over to hfcs both or other factors james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i mean we don t really know what drove competitive actions i think both of what you ve just described are plausible explanations for what drove that behavior adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay and then last one just going back to i think it was heather s question about the use of corn derivatives in the beer industry you talked about mexico but brazil i mean is it are you seeing that pressure in brazil i know that s an important market for you and some of your bigger customers i think are facing some pressure there as you re seeing kind of the value segment of that market and malt only beers grow is that something that s more evidenced in your volume data that and just talk about that james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i would say that if there is a trend that starts to manifest itself in the united states should something manifest itself in the united states we re obviously going to be very watchful of where that may carry over but as of right now there s nothing material that s impacting our business related to that where some of this new noise or marketing positioning that s taking place that we saw on sunday last week james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yeah i wasn t talking about the super bowl specifically i was more just in brazil i mean the value segment of the market and malt only is growing a lot faster than the mainstream and i thought my understanding was it was the mainstream that uses maltose james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director what i would say is that we are very in tune to all the trends that are developing in brazil because we do supply to the brewing industry in brazil and anything that we would be anything that would be happening we would also be working with those customers from an innovation standpoint as well so but nothing that s right now any kind of a problem for us that we want to surface but we re working with those customers to evaluate trends as they develop and also work with them from a standpoint of innovation on adjuncts that they may need for the future adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay all right that s i appreciate the color excellent thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director all right

pleased to turn the call over to jim zallie james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks heather and welcome to everyone joining us today let me start with a discussion of our fourth quarter and what was most relevant the market dynamics in north america as we have discussed in prior calls we have been strategically focused on positioning our business toward the shifts in consumer preferences and a changing customer landscape operating income in north america was down for the quarter impacted by lower sweetener demand higher supply chain costs and commodity margin pressures in response we continued to make progress against cost smart actioning 11 million of run rate savings exceeding our 5 million target for the year we successfully retained our west coast customers having reduced our us high fructose corn syrup manufacturing footprint with the cessation of operations at our stockton plant and we continued to invest in our specialties growth platforms with our decision to diversify our portfolio into plant based proteins with the announced acquisition and retrofitting of a plant to produce p protein and the formation of a new joint venture with verdient produce a range of pulse based protein ingredients in addition we enhanced our sugar reduction formulating capabilities by building new processing capacity in mexico to produce the rare sugar allulose moving outside of north america we continued to experience the effects of foreign currency devaluations primarily in brazil argentina and pakistan in response to market conditions and foreign currency devaluations we are taking a series of pricing actions to mitigate currency impacts in addition we continue to structurally reduce our cost base an example of which is the extension of our shared service capabilities into latin america to highlight the quarter four results ingredion volumes were up 2 driven by specialty growth north america and south america operating incomes were down asia pacific operating income was up given pricing actions to offset the extraordinary rise in tapioca costs that we ve experienced throughout the year emea operating income was down slightly given a lag in pricing to offset the pakistan rupee devaluation during the quarter we continued to deploy cash for shareholder value creation with nearly 4 25 million of share repurchases for the full year our volumes were up 1 driven by specialty volume growth our specialty portfolio grew to 29 of total net sales driven by continued demand for ingredients from our on trend specialty growth platforms such as clean and simple ingredients sugar reduction in specialty sweeteners and specialty texturizers i m pleased that our team is finding attractive investment opportunities to further broaden our specialty ingredient portfolio in addition to the p and pulse protein and sugar reduction investments mentioned earlier we also announced 60 million of investments in thailand and china to support additional specialties growth by expanding our modified and clean label starch capabilities in tapioca waxy corn and rice and we continued to deploy cash for shareholders with our fourth consecutive annual dividend increase announced in september and a total of 5 8 million of share repurchases during 2018 now moving to north america net sales were slightly down for the year volumes were flat driven by increases in specialties and gains in mexico partially offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes higher freight costs impacted price mix full year operating income in north america was 545 million down 17 from last year as we ve mentioned in prior call calls our production costs were higher due to rebalancing of inventories and starch production across our network as well as operational inflation we also continued to experience the residual impact of commodity margin pressures on our business in south america net sales were down for the year due to significant foreign currency devaluations however the team managed through multiple price increases to offset higher raw material costs due to a smaller crop in argentina and the impact of forex declines this resulted in a 13 increase in price mix full year operating income was 99 million up 18 million from the year ago period due to improved operational efficiencies and the lapping of the 2017 argentina work stoppage we continued to monitor the macroeconomic environment in argentina and are cautiously optimistic about economic growth in brazil the challenging macroeconomic environment in south america it is worth noting that for the second consecutive year our ingredion team in brazil was acknowledged for making our brazilian business one of the top 150 best workplaces in the country in asia pacific all year our team has worked to mitigate the impact of a short tapioca crop and rapid rise of tapioca costs for the year the team has been able to work with customers to partially pass through our raw material cost increases net sales show a 9 increase for the year driven by a 4 increase in price mix across the region the region delivered 104 million of operating income and although down 10 versus the prior year quarter four operating income was up 15 versus the same quarter last year finally the emea region delivered 5 net sales growth due to strong european specialty growth and a great effort by our pakistan team to manage price increases to cover higher corn costs and a devaluation of the rupee 2018 operating income was 116 million up 2 now let me hand off to jim gray who will discuss our financial performance jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jim i ll start by covering q4 s performance net sales of 1 426 billion were down slightly for the quarter gross profit margin was lower by 260 basis points driven primarily by weaker performance in north america reported and adjusted operating incomes were 158 million and 177 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 19 million the difference was due to 18 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility while the balance was attributable to our cost smart sg a initiatives our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 1 36 and 1 61 respectively q4 net sales of 1 426 billion were 11 million down from the same quarter last year unfavorable fx of 98 million was primarily attributable to currency devaluations in argentina brazil and pakistan volume increases contributed to 28 million of sales increase as well as a 59 million increase from favorable price mix in north america volume was slightly up year over year driven by gains in mexico offsetting expected lower sweetener syrup volume as we ceased operations at our stockton facility price mix in north america was down given higher freight costs and commodity margin pressures in south america foreign exchange devaluation was the largest driver of the year over year net sales decline volume was down 7 due to the impacts of the argentina recession on beverage sales and weaker brewing sales in brazil price mix was up 22 as our teams took price increases to pass through higher raw material costs and recapture some of the foreign exchange impact in argentina and brazil apac had specialty and core volume growth and price mix was up given tapioca pricing pass through emea had strong volume growth driven by specialties in europe and pakistan delivered positive net sales growth driven by price increases to offset the fourth quarter rupee devaluations for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income decreased 44 million and 32 million respectively north america operating income decreased 25 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing and lower sweetener volumes south america operating income was down 5 million driven by the impacts of the argentina recession on net sales versus the year ago period and impacts of currency devaluation on applied hyperinflation accounting asia pacific was up 4 million driven primarily by higher price mix given pricing pass through of tapioca costs and higher volumes emea was down slightly due to the impacts of unfavorable pakistan foreign exchange and higher corn costs offset partially by favorable specialty and core volume corporate costs were higher by 5 million for the quarter given further investment to optimize our global processes via our cost smart initiatives and continued investment in r d to drive specialties growth we ll wrap up the discussion of the quarter with earnings per share on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 30 per share primarily driven by a margin decline of 0 23 per share attributable to north america and partially offset by 0 07 per share in volume gains unfavorable foreign exchange was 0 15 per share moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 18 per share for the quarter largely driven by favorable tax and lower average shares outstanding partially offset by higher financing costs financing costs were a 0 03 per share decrease driven by higher debt balance as compared to a year ago period lower adjusted taxes contributed an 0 11 per share benefit primarily driven by us tax reform shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 10 a share for the full year the company delivered 5 841 billion of net sales which was up slightly from 2017 reported and adjusted operating incomes were 703 million and 767 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 64 million the difference was due to 49 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility 11 million of charges associated with cost smart sg a initiatives and 4 million of other restructuring costs our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 6 17 and 6 92 respectively as we look more closely at net sales by region you can see unfavorable foreign exchange which totaled 198 million for the year affected most prominently in south america led by the argentine peso and brazilian real devaluations volume growth for the year was positive 76 million volumes were up in asia pacific and emea in north america volume was flat with increases in mexico and specialty ingredients offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes in total the price mix increase was 131 million up 2 price mix was down slightly in north america due to higher freight costs and lower commodity values in other regions price mix was up due to pass through of raw material costs and fx full year reported and adjusted operating income decreased 133 million and 111 million respectively north america operating income decreased 109 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing lower sweetener volumes and commodity margin pressures south america operating income was up 18 million driven by our more competitive cost structure in brazil due to operational excellence initiatives and in argentina due to our new labor agreement and organizational restructuring asia pacific was down 11 million driven by higher tapioca costs emea was up 2 million with specialty and core volume growth more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds in pakistan corporate costs were higher by 11 million given the same reasons impacting the quarter moving to earnings per share operationally we saw a decrease of 1 08 per share challenges in north america costs and higher tapioca costs in asia were primary contributors to a margin decline of 1 15 per share volume increases contributed 0 34 to help offset the decline unfavorable foreign exchange of 0 29 primarily in the second half of the year was driven by currency weakness in emea and south america moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 30 per share for the year largely driven by a lower tax rate and reduced shares outstanding adjusted taxes were a 0 27 per share benefit driven by the impact of the revaluation of the mexican peso and the us dollar denominated balances in mexico a reduced valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary and us tax reform while shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 16 a share these benefits were partially offset by higher financing costs of 0 12 per share which includes the impacts of argentina s hyperinflation accounting and a higher debt balance 2018 cash provided by operations was 703 million this was lower than expected due to a decision to curtail use of customer financing programs primarily in mexico given the rising costs of these programs due to higher short term interest rates capital expenditures of 349 million were up 43 million year over year driven by capacity expansions for our specialties growth platforms that support plant based proteins and sugar reduction finally the board supported significant share repurchase programs in 2018 amounting to 657 million of expenditures turning to our outlook we anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 80 to 7 50 this excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we are expecting a flat to slightly up adjusted operating income for the year primarily due to our expectation that north america operating profit will be flat year over year although we are benefiting from approximately 20 million of one time cost impacts in 2018 we are expecting modest margin compression that can be explained by the following two circumstances coming together first the impact of us and china trade negotiations on soybean supply and inventories in the us is having a secondary impact on the cost of corn to us we sell corn byproducts which somewhat compete with soy meal protein and oil these values have been down since the first half of 2018 in effect this raises our cost of corn because we do not realize as much value from the sale of our corn byproducts to remind you co product sales are approximately 14 of our net sales second late in the contracting season we experienced competition for sweetener syrup volume and pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher net cost of corn and inflation expected in 2019 we are pleased with the retention of our west coast customer volumes as we transitioned service to other facilities in our network and we expect our utilization rates to be significantly higher in 2019 although these circumstances are impacting our 2019 north america profit growth expectations we believe our operating model still offers the opportunity for long run margin growth as we move more toward a greater weighting of specialty ingredients we anticipate that the impact of foreign exchange will be negative for 2019 and we expect significant negative currency of 25 million to 35 million during the first half of the year relative to the prior year we expect operating expenses including corporate expenses to be up year over year as we invest in global business process optimization and innovation to drive both cost savings and increased customer intimacy and growth we expect financing costs for the year to be in the range of 82 million to 87 million due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and higher debt balance our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 26 and 27 5 we expect total diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 68 million to 69 million for the year considering the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreement lastly we anticipate cumulative cost smart run rate savings of 24 million to 34 million by the end of 2019 against wage inflation of 2 5 to 3 in north america we expect net sales and volumes to be down for the full year we expect operating income to be flat to 2018 with the first half down due to the lapping of net corn costs and the second half to be up as we lap more of the one time impacts from 2018 in regards to 2019 sweetener contracting we were pleased with our volume retention especially in light of our decision to stop production at stockton however sweetener pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher expected net cost of corn and inflation which we anticipate will create slight margin pressure in our sweetener business we are pleased with the results of our starch pricing and contracting negotiations south american net sales are expect to be up versus the prior year volumes are expected to be down given argentina economic headwinds and the impact on sweetener syrup sales given the anticipated rapid pace and magnitude of fx devaluations we expect our business model requires the first half to recover so we anticipate operating income growth to be back half loaded in addition we anticipate positive economic growth for brazil we remain watchful of economic reforms inflation and impact on the upcoming election in argentina we continue to focus on business performance improvement and expect operating income improvement in the region asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be up modestly we expect weaker operating income in the first half with a stronger second half in emea we expect net sales to be up we anticipate strong specialties performance in europe and core growth in pakistan although we expect modest operating income growth we anticipate currency and raw material cost overlaps in pakistan will lead to a weaker first half versus the second half we expect cash from operations in 2019 to be in the range of 650 million to 700 million we expect to invest between 330 million and 360 million in capital expenditures around the world to support growth as well as cost and process improvements importantly we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders that brings my comments to a close now back to jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks jim in closing our leadership team remains focused on navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our core businesses in north america and argentina we are committed to driving operational improvements throughout our business and structurally lowering costs equally we are energized by our commercial excellence initiative to grow co create and win with customers we are excited by the prospects of our recent specialties growth platform investments which will provide new ingredients and formulating capabilities to deliver consumer preferred innovation to our customers we are pleased to announce that we recently have been once again named to fortune s most admired companies list for the 10th consecutive year we will be presenting at consumer analyst group of new york on february 19th and i will discuss in greater detail our new specialty strategy which includes five new specialty growth platforms which are sharply aligned with consumer trends and lastly as we have recently demonstrated we will continue to use our strong balance sheet to invest in specialties growth opportunities and pursue m a we remain committed to delivering long term shareholder value and now let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator operating instructions your first question comes from the line of robert moskow from credit suisse please go ahead robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst hi thank you hi jim and jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi rob robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst i was hoping you could help me understand the price negotiations for north america this year you said that you expect profits to be down in sweeteners but that you were pleased with the negotiations on starch to what extent are you able to still swing capacity from one to the other and i guess in the past i have heard you talk about that as a lever you can pull if you re having trouble getting pricing or if there s too much volume in the market in one of the other and then i had a follow up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i would just repeat that for sweeteners contracting basically we accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish in relationship to the stockton closure and maintaining our west coast customers so there was no loss of share that we did not plan for as it relates to how contracting went and pricing went toward the back end of contracting there seemed to be more competitive intensity for volume and therefore pricing and margin compression occurred and that s why we re indicating there s a little bit of margin compression in relationship to sweeteners we were pleased however with the starch pricing and the contracting negotiations the sweetener network for us this upcoming year is going to be operating at full capacity and our starch production and inventory rebalancings are going on throughout the year and will steadily improve throughout the year so that s basically how i would explain it rob yeah rob i mean i d add that while a lot of our infrastructure investment is around the corn receiving and the steepening and the wet mill we always are thinking about finishing lines and capex that can allow us to toggle between what we do with the slurry that comes off of the starch grind that transition takes more planning and i would say the horizon on that is kind of multiple year so that s been a journey that we have be on as we think about which plants and then which finishing lines we would like to toggle more toward our starch and or our specialty production i think a good example of that is we added some capacity for the rare sugar allulose lows at one of our mexico facilities in order to make allulose we are actually toggling on high fructose so we use high fructose we refine that down and down into a process what you derive out is the rare sugar allulose robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay and i guess my follow up here is you talked a lot about improving the mix through specialty starches and more capital being headed in that direction can you give us a sense of whether your profits in specialty starches were up or down this year i know the percentage of your sales is up but i guess i m unclear on whether just moving in the specialty direction has whether the margin structure in that part of the business has held up and what your outlook is for 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure rob i ll take that question overall just to start our specialties are about 29 of our net sales they sell at higher average price points per ton than the remainder of the business and whether it s the gross profit margin levels are much higher than the remainder of our business from year to year as we target mid single to high to single digit net sales growth in our specialty portfolio we are seeing that corresponding type of gross profit growth i think in 18 in particular really within us canada the co product values pressures that we saw do impact specialties as well as our core sweetener and industrial starch business but nonetheless i still think year over year we saw growth in our overall profit pool of specialties particularly in some markets where we re really seeing some strong specialty growth outside of us canada is where we really really see some acceleration of that portfolio james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah and i would just add that the price points have held and in fact obviously we ve been able to get the pricing up in tapioca related to the increases in raw material costs robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay thank you very much james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david driscoll from citi please go ahead david driscoll citi analyst thank you and good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hey david david driscoll citi analyst i wanted to come back to some of the points that rob was raising and try it maybe slightly different so it looks to me like your north american operations in 2018 profits were down more than 100 million however your volumes for the full year were not they were flat you closed stockton so this frame it for me guys why does it feel when you say that you re not getting the pricing that you expected like why aren t you it doesn t look like utilization rates would be down i think you said you re running at full capacity that normally would have correlated with the stronger ability or a better ability to get pricing that s not happening so there is some kind of disconnect and i was hoping you could maybe explain why and if somewhere in that answer you could kind of tell me where you think industry utilization rates are that would also be helpful and then a follow up if i can james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i m going to let jim take a shot at that and then i ll add some commentary okay james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think david when we summarized north american roll it up we do kind of break apart into two big businesses underlying mexico so mexico was seeing some volume growth i also think that within us canada we were seeing growth in necessarily in our food starches where we faced the headwind was really in our sweetener volume portfolio primarily us canada and that was from 2017 into 2018 as we alluded to on calls we really did see some unique challenges in high fructose into beverages and that business was down two times what we ve seen our historical rate to be james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah the industry data david and i m sure you re aware of this is showing that for 2018 the rate of decline of hfcs has been now 2x the rate for say the previous five to 10 years so there is absolutely a step down or increase in the rate of decline of hfcs and we felt the effects of that in 2018 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer so then as we moved to ceasing operations at stockton in november we re seeing some purposeful shed of sweetener volume high fructose volume there at the last couple of months of the year as we move into 19 we expect that sweetener volumes to be down 19 versus 18 what really occurred i think at the end of the year david was that we re moving the remainder of that west coast volume back into our existing plants and in us canada we re taking that utilization rate up significantly as we head into 19 so that should help us with fixed cost absorption versus our sweetener overall in kind of our core plants does that answer some of your questions hopefully david driscoll citi analyst it does just two quick follow ups one i think that you ve tried so hard in 2018 to recover some of this freight pricing and i want to say that that looks only to be marginally successful but would like to hear your opinion on your ability in 18 to go back to customers and recover some of that freight inflation and then my final question would just be we hear reports that there are significant unrest within the mexican sugar industry and calls for some kind of punitive action taken against us high fructose corn syrup could you just bring us up to speed and is there any risk to the high fructose operations either in mexico or the us mexican trade on high fructose given some of the disruption that s been going on in the mexican sugar industry thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay i ll take the last question and then i ll come back to the freight i am not aware of any acute near term issues that are going to be problematic in relationship to the hfcs with mexico so we will look into that and we will certainly get back to you but i m not aware of anything that s imminent in that regard as it relates to freight the freight inflation that we faced in the first quarter of last year we made significant progress against tightening up terms with customers and being able to pass through freight increases and then we ve obviously seen some moderation of those rate increases throughout the rest of the year so we feel actually very good that we ve been able to mitigate a large portion the majority portion of the freight increase that we absorbed in 18 and will benefit to some degree going into 2019 especially as it relates to dry van which you remember was the freight increase that impacted our starch shipments in the first quarter of 2018 and so that will be mitigated and improved situation as we go into 2019 david driscoll citi analyst thank you very much i ll pass it along james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you david james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow from bank of montreal please go ahead ken zaslow bmo analyst good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi ken james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi ken ken zaslow bmo analyst just one high level question you continue to talk about the commodity exposures and stuff like that but the question i have is at what level of ingredient business when you get to the mix will the impact of commodity not be a source of ups and downs of profitability or would be mitigated how do you think about that james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think as we ve talked to in terms of our specialty strategy with specialties representing about 29 of our net sales today as we look forward over the three to five years and continue to make investments to add to our portfolio i think when we get to the mid 30s as a percent of net sales for specialties that the profit contribution from that is a bigger part of our profit pool and because of the differentiation of our products and as long as it s coupled with continuing to have great customer service i think we ll be insulated a bit more from some of the ups and downs that occur in our core business how we sell our specialties and how our customers order is kind of a different process than necessarily the day to day week to week ordering of what you see in a sweetener syrup business james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i just would add to that that what we ve experienced in 2018 and what we anticipate in 2019 is obviously clearly a more challenged operating environment and there have been some significant impacts that we ve talked about in relationship to commodity margin pressures related to ethanol crush margins being at very very low levels and the net corn costs that have increased related to co product revenues just related to this china us trade dispute very unique situations that we have just not seen before that have impacted us to the order of magnitude in our core business so all that being said we ve systematically stayed very very focused and strategic in relationship to our specialties investments and growth and we are very excited by the prospects of those and again we ll be talking more about that at cagny from a standpoint of the growth rates associated with all of those platforms and the impact that those will be having over time that will then mitigate any kind of earnings volatility but what i would say is in 2018 what we saw was extraordinary in relationship to the order of magnitude of the impact to our core business related to some of those factors that i was talking about related to commodity margin pressures so i anticipate going forward we ll see less of impact in that regard because of the contribution coming from the specialties investments that we re making ken zaslow bmo analyst so my follow up questions is one you did say that your gross profit is significantly higher but you didn t talk about operating profit which quite honestly is probably more important and then the second question part of that is when you think about the earnings from the front half to the back half of the year is that a normalization of this environment or is this just and is that kind of like where you re going to be in terms of growth into 2012 as well or is this just saying hey it s just easy comps and that s just how this squishy year votes so those are my two finals thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director do you want to take the back versus the front half on the phasing james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey ken i do think that did that as you think about 19 really some of what we saw in the first half was first half of 18 was favorable net cost of corn in particular protein meal was pretty high and favorable as we went into the second half of 18 and you started to see the headwinds against soy and then candidly the soy crush margins were so attractive that you just had a lot of soy oil and lot soy meal coming off and that started to depress corn meal protein and corn oil prices and we really felt that in the second half of 18 so we re going to have that continuing as a lap into the first half of 19 so i think we just have to get that through and then we ll see and that broadly impacts kind of all of the business within the us canada and then you ll see more of the normal drivers i think that we have behind the business and that are more in our control as we move into the second half of the 19 so james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director right and forex also we re going to see significant forex headwinds continuing in the first half versus the second half so there are those two issues and just to a modest degree in asia pacific even we re going to be lapping lower corn prices in the first half in korea for example so there is this first half versus second half phasing issue that we anticipate related to the net corn costs squeeze or the co products squeeze that we have highlighted which we feel is a unique circumstance that s manifested itself in 2018 forex which will remain a headwind in the first half and then even in some of the other regions there is some unique impacts there that are phasing related to first half second half ken zaslow bmo analyst so it s more of a comp issue not a return to growth algorithm james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that s correct james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s a comp issue yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yes okay for the specialty products james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so ken i think i was trying to understand exactly your difference between gross profit and op income question ken zaslow bmo analyst you just said that the gross profit i think your comment was i don t have it written down i write sloppy unfortunately the gross profit was is higher your gross profit for specialty is higher than that and i think you gave a number of some sort is higher than that of your base business but you didn t translate that down to operating profit level which i think is more telling if that s ok james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would think that our generally we have not really commented on the differences in op income between specialty or the remainder of the portfolio that said when we think about our operating expense which is both which obviously includes sales as well as r d support generally that was pretty in line with what we thought our overall inflation would be so that would have there wasn t anything that was unusual that would imply that there was greater sg a investment i think against our specialty business versus the other lines of business in the portfolio ken zaslow bmo analyst thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of akshay jagdale from jefferies please go ahead akshay jagdale jefferies analyst hi good morning so just wanted to follow up just clarification on the gross profit commentary on specialty so you said gross profit for specialty was actually up but just as a point of clarification that excludes the impact of co product credits correct like james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer no akshay jagdale jefferies analyst no so your reported gross profit for specialty was up in 2018 despite the co product headwinds the production cost issues and whatever else correct so overall gross profit in specialty was up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think akshay we re mixing kind of scope here specifically when we re asked the overall specialty business we characterize as higher net sales growth higher price points and higher gross profit margins generally that business overall globally was still healthy okay specifically when we talk about comments upon co product values and the headwinds there that s kind of a us canada specific issue and so i just want to make sure that we re separating out the issues i would say that we still overall we re pleased with the way our specialty business performed in north america i mean there were there i think there were the challenges of co product values against all of the business in us canada but we re still pleased with how specialties has performed james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think that s where i think that s where the confusion occurred is the comment was that we did also experience some impact related to the co product revenue squeeze that would impact the specialties business as well but overall we re very pleased with the performance of the specialties business and the specialties profitability james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah akshay jagdale jefferies analyst okay and just going to the co product issue i think last quarter you gave us a nice earnings bridge about 100 million drag was the co product issue was that included in the 40 million from freight manufacturing and efficiencies in commodity margins or is this a different bucket now and can you can you just help us quantify that impact and maybe give us a sense of like can that move around if co product credits increase from here james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think when we addressed on the q3 call and we laid out the various drivers we did call out i think a bucket which was freight and emea inflation and commodity pricing pressures which had increased from our 40 million estimate that we had previously communicated i d say that s about 45 million and that s really just the step up in the co products value decrease that we were experiencing here but generally given what we had talked to in q3 the drivers were very very played out as we were trying to outline at that time akshay jagdale jefferies analyst and so just related to that so can you help us understand what the if you were to do a bridge for next for 19 you mentioned two major headwinds one was the co product credit hitting you guys and then the other was in your sweetener business margins being compressed can you give us some ballpark on those two and i mean on the co product side it s kind of out of your hands it s supply demand right but that can am i right in understanding that if spot prices move up there that will flow through your p l james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah on that last point yes and that s one of the reasons why we have set guidance where we did with such a wide range if you want to call it that because of that exact fact but i m going to let jim answer the question that you asked james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer and akshay i think maybe to help everybody on the call against our north america business what we really see is mexico modestly up i think if you look at the us canada business we would expect our food starch business to be up it s going to benefit a bit from what we would see in specialty top line growth as well as we continue to work through our starch rebalancing and our production issues those will play out all throughout 19 as we ve talked to before and we hope to be in a better position as we start into 2020 against the sweetener and industrial business you would have expected a step up as we lap the one time impacted of the argos shutdown as well as some the operational efficiencies and what we ve really seen is that combined with a relatively tight pricing market but the impact as well of lower co product values on our overall gross cost of our corn we re actually seeing that business modestly down for the year so those two kind of come together they necessarily offset and that s why we re seeing kind of a flat operating income expectation for north america i would say as well is that we are really just carrying forward an expectation that ethanol crush margins remain low again it s not a big part of our business it was something that was unexpected in 2018 as an impact but right now as we look forward to 2019 within our guidance we see that as relatively kind of staying the same to your point are there upsides if either ethanol crush margins move up or if we see some of the co product values start to increase i think that that would benefit our overall business within north america but that s not currently necessarily in our guidance akshay jagdale jefferies analyst got it and just one last one more on the specialty business long term right so obviously there s been a lot of noise operationally in the core business and margins have come down for the company but in the background it seems like you re investing pretty heavily on specialty so can you just give us a perspective on that and like what does that mean i mean should we expect you to increase at some point your long term guidance on growth for that business is that something we should expect down the road as a function of all the investments you re making thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah well i mean thank you for highlighting the investments that we ve made in specialty capacity increases specifically in china korea the us and mexico and again we re very excited we went through a strategic review in 2018 o our specialty strategy to refine it and that s led to five growth platforms that have us very clearly focused on the future investments that we will be making we will be sharing this at cagny and again those we anticipate will have above market growth rates associated with them with headroom for growth in each one of those and again we ll be weaving all of that into our both say near or mid term outlook for profitability as well as a longer term outlook for profitability and that s what we intend to talk about at cagny and it will be greatly emphasized around specialties and then obviously balanced by taking into account what we re experiencing these last two years last year and this year and taking a read on that environment that s impacting our core business if that helps akshay akshay jagdale jefferies analyst thank you i ll pass on that does help operator your next question comes from the line of heather jones from the vertical group please go ahead heather jones the vertical group analyst good morning james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning heather heather kos ingredion incorporated analyst thank you i have just a detailed question first reading the language in the press release i just wanted to clarify so it sounds like the asr you all expect that to be complete pretty soon james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct yeah heather jones the vertical group analyst okay then moving on to your operations i guess first i was wondering if you could share with us your view of what s driven the acceleration you mentioned that the decline in sweetener volumes for the us industry in general is two times the previous five or six years wondering if you could share your view of what s driving that acceleration james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think it s what we re all seeing in relationship to the concerns with sugar intake in general i think it s not just against hfcs i think also sugar itself is being formulated out of many products but it s consumer preferences really that i think are driving a lot of that demand the move toward smaller can sizes i guess for full calorie products from a standpoint of caloric intake and just a lot of the consumer trends that are driving government behavior et cetera if you look in certainly in argentina what we have experienced was just related purely we believe to macroeconomic demand destruction related to high inflation and consumers just getting squeezed in north america it s more trend related consumer trend related james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say also just add i think tactically for 2018 there were some impacts on costs to the beverage manufacturers we suspected that we would see some higher prices at retail and i think if you look at the scans ph data for the second half of the year whether it s iri or nielsen generally full calorie soda unit prices were up and i think that that led to a bit of volume headwinds in terms of consumption and obviously that leads to a bit of a volume challenge for us in our shipments of hf 55 into our beverage customers james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that was something actually then i think jim had signaled in quarter two that was likely to happen related to aluminum prices going up and related to pet prices going up and the beverage manufacturers putting through price increases and there certainly was a contributing factor to that heather jones the vertical group analyst and that makes sense so following that logic is it fair to assume then a sharp fall in acceleration not just from prior years but an acceleration in the decline as 2018 progressed into 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think what you saw was that during more of the summer months in 18 was when that change manifest itself and so that plays out in q4 for us there will be a little bit of that lap as you go into the first half of 19 but then it will be back into kind of whatever the normal year might be for how the beverage customers see the marketplace in 2019 heather jones the vertical group analyst and you mentioned as far as stockton and the closure of that facility that you kept the volume you were intending to keep but that your volumes in north america would be down do you have an estimate of what sweetener sales will be on a pro forma basis for that closure as a percentage of north american sales james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we do i mean it was generally when we looked at that facility and i won t give you specifics but we looked at that facility i think we were intending to shed probably less than about 20 of the volume at that facility and we were anticipating keeping about 80 that we could see that we could reasonably serve and source from other plants within our network heather jones the vertical group analyst okay and then my final question is on your projections for 19 was wondering if you could share with us what your assumption is as far as the whole the brexit issue i know it s not a huge proportion of your sales but it seems like it could have an impact on europe and i m just wondering if you what your assumptions are there james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i ll take a shot and then i ll let jim finish it up i think obviously if there is a hard brexit or brexit with no resolution which will be the worst case scenario it s more the impacts to the overall eu and the uk which could be problematic if there is a soft brexit with what s on the table now or some sort of resolution we don t really think the results of that are going to be material to our business really jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the two tactical things that we want to plan for is that if there is anything on a hard brexit and all of a suddenly there is new customs borders that are formed we want to make sure that we have inventory in the right place so then any of our food customers don t face any immediate outages and then second we have to deal with whatever the imposed tariff levels would be and at some point whether or not immediate or over a course of a year to year and a half those tariffs are going to play a role in increase cost of manufacture and eventually those will play through to a consumer at a shopping or a restaurant and that should actually create a bit of a headwind in terms of some volume decrease so really those two things we really kind of anticipate would be how that might move forward but it all depends upon the suddenness or the gradualness of how brexit plays out heather jones the vertical group analyst and my final question hopefully is a quick one but i know you guys don t really do brewing in the us but i question does have implications for the broader industry and thus you guys this push to get away from corn derivatives and brewing and move toward more authentic 100 barley is that just headlines at present or are you seeing in the broader industry a trend toward that that could affect the supply demand balance in the us over 19 20 james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director so we weren t seeing that in the us and i think we know why you re asking that question heather jones the vertical group analyst yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director but in relationship to our business the majority of our sales into brewing is in mexico as well as in south america and less so in the united states but jim do you want to make some additional comments james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i just think that the choice of the adjunct that the brewer uses is also very much a cost and a yield and a capacity throughput issue right so there is trade offs that our customers make but to jim s point mostly our business is primarily mexico as well as since in south america heather jones the vertical group analyst but for the end for the us industry which would impact overall supply demand and you re not seeing a big shift in the overall industry so far in the us james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director no i don t think so i think the industry is battling itself for share and they re looking for opportunities to create point of differentiation heather jones the vertical group analyst okay perfect thank you so much james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone a lot of ground has been covered so hopefully i will keep this brief just first on the cash flow and you made some comments in the prepared remarks about changing customer financing in mexico but it came in notably below where you guys were three months ago and it was both on the one time tax refund as well as the continuing ops and just little bit more color on how those two dynamics played out and what actually happened there james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think with regard to really the working capital adam i think that was probably more of the major change that we were expecting you know what as we saw as the year played out both in north america to a lesser extent in south america we have various programs where you can discount an invoice and sell it to an intermediary as you saw short term rates starting to climb significantly as you look at maybe a three month or six month libor it just became evident that in the second half of the year it made more sense to reduce or halt the sale of any of those discounted invoices and just hold onto it and then collect the revenues directly from the customer so that has an impact on your accounts receivable balance as it grows it also allows us to be a bit more in control of our accounts receivable and then we can use other means of short term financing where we think we can get a better overall cost and balance so you will see the impact in your net working capital but we might find that there s other short term debt opportunities that are actually quite more affordable for the company to go access and then your comment on the tax flows those two play back and forth in terms of as we are looking at both settlement in terms of our us and canada reviews and appeals that we ve had in place and those have played out and then also as we look forward to really getting clarity on the impact of guilty and fddi or fdii on our overall credits for taxes so we can talk more offline on that but adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful two other quick ones on north america just contracting the comments or the we getting later in the contracting season is that do you think that was is more a function of the sweetener demand side the weakness accelerating and that becoming more evident to your competitors or do you think it was a factor of ethanol margins being pretty lousy and some of the competitors having ethanol wet mill capacity that they can switch over to hfcs both or other factors james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i mean we don t really know what drove competitive actions i think both of what you ve just described are plausible explanations for what drove that behavior adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay and then last one just going back to i think it was heather s question about the use of corn derivatives in the beer industry you talked about mexico but brazil i mean is it are you seeing that pressure in brazil i know that s an important market for you and some of your bigger customers i think are facing some pressure there as you re seeing kind of the value segment of that market and malt only beers grow is that something that s more evidenced in your volume data that and just talk about that james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i would say that if there is a trend that starts to manifest itself in the united states should something manifest itself in the united states we re obviously going to be very watchful of where that may carry over but as of right now there s nothing material that s impacting our business related to that where some of this new noise or marketing positioning that s taking place that we saw on sunday last week james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yeah i wasn t talking about the super bowl specifically i was more just in brazil i mean the value segment of the market and malt only is growing a lot faster than the mainstream and i thought my understanding was it was the mainstream that uses maltose james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director what i would say is that we are very in tune to all the trends that are developing in brazil because we do supply to the brewing industry in brazil and anything that we would be anything that would be happening we would also be working with those customers from an innovation standpoint as well so but nothing that s right now any kind of a problem for us that we want to surface but we re working with those customers to evaluate trends as they develop and also work with them from a standpoint of innovation on adjuncts that they may need for the future adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay all right that s i appreciate the color excellent thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director all right and then i would just like to conclude by thanking everyone for their time today and hope to see many of you in february at the cagny conference operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your

everyone joining us today let me start with a discussion of our fourth quarter and what was most relevant the market dynamics in north america as we have discussed in prior calls we have been strategically focused on positioning our business toward the shifts in consumer preferences and a changing customer landscape operating income in north america was down for the quarter impacted by lower sweetener demand higher supply chain costs and commodity margin pressures in response we continued to make progress against cost smart actioning 11 million of run rate savings exceeding our 5 million target for the year we successfully retained our west coast customers having reduced our us high fructose corn syrup manufacturing footprint with the cessation of operations at our stockton plant and we continued to invest in our specialties growth platforms with our decision to diversify our portfolio into plant based proteins with the announced acquisition and retrofitting of a plant to produce p protein and the formation of a new joint venture with verdient produce a range of pulse based protein ingredients in addition we enhanced our sugar reduction formulating capabilities by building new processing capacity in mexico to produce the rare sugar allulose moving outside of north america we continued to experience the effects of foreign currency devaluations primarily in brazil argentina and pakistan in response to market conditions and foreign currency devaluations we are taking a series of pricing actions to mitigate currency impacts in addition we continue to structurally reduce our cost base an example of which is the extension of our shared service capabilities into latin america advertisement advertisement to highlight the quarter four results ingredion volumes were up 2 driven by specialty growth north america and south america operating incomes were down asia pacific operating income was up given pricing actions to offset the extraordinary rise in tapioca costs that we ve experienced throughout the year emea operating income was down slightly given a lag in pricing to offset the pakistan rupee devaluation during the quarter we continued to deploy cash for shareholder value creation with nearly 4 25 million of share repurchases for the full year our volumes were up 1 driven by specialty volume growth our specialty portfolio grew to 29 of total net sales driven by continued demand for ingredients from our on trend specialty growth platforms such as clean and simple ingredients sugar reduction in specialty sweeteners and specialty texturizers i m pleased that our team is finding attractive investment opportunities to further broaden our specialty ingredient portfolio in addition to the p and pulse protein and sugar reduction investments mentioned earlier we also announced 60 million of investments in thailand and china to support additional specialties growth by expanding our modified and clean label starch capabilities in tapioca waxy corn and rice and we continued to deploy cash for shareholders with our fourth consecutive annual dividend increase announced in september and a total of 5 8 million of share repurchases during 2018 advertisement advertisement now moving to north america net sales were slightly down for the year volumes were flat driven by increases in specialties and gains in mexico partially offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes higher freight costs impacted price mix full year operating income in north america was 545 million down 17 from last year as we ve mentioned in prior call calls our production costs were higher due to rebalancing of inventories and starch production across our network as well as operational inflation we also continued to experience the residual impact of commodity margin pressures on our business in south america net sales were down for the year due to significant foreign currency devaluations however the team managed through multiple price increases to offset higher raw material costs due to a smaller crop in argentina and the impact of forex declines this resulted in a 13 increase in price mix full year operating income was 99 million up 18 million from the year ago period due to improved operational efficiencies and the lapping of the 2017 argentina work stoppage we continued to monitor the macroeconomic environment in argentina and are cautiously optimistic about economic growth in brazil the challenging macroeconomic environment in south america it is worth noting that for the second consecutive year our ingredion team in brazil was acknowledged for making our brazilian business one of the top 150 best workplaces in the country in asia pacific all year our team has worked to mitigate the impact of a short tapioca crop and rapid rise of tapioca costs for the year the team has been able to work with customers to partially pass through our raw material cost increases net sales show a 9 increase for the year driven by a 4 increase in price mix across the region the region delivered 104 million of operating income and although down 10 versus the prior year quarter four operating income was up 15 versus the same quarter last year advertisement advertisement finally the emea region delivered 5 net sales growth due to strong european specialty growth and a great effort by our pakistan team to manage price increases to cover higher corn costs and a devaluation of the rupee 2018 operating income was 116 million up 2 now let me hand off to jim gray who will discuss our financial performance jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jim i ll start by covering q4 s performance net sales of 1 426 billion were down slightly for the quarter gross profit margin was lower by 260 basis points driven primarily by weaker performance in north america reported and adjusted operating incomes were 158 million and 177 million respectively advertisement advertisement reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 19 million the difference was due to 18 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility while the balance was attributable to our cost smart sg a initiatives our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 1 36 and 1 61 respectively q4 net sales of 1 426 billion were 11 million down from the same quarter last year unfavorable fx of 98 million was primarily attributable to currency devaluations in argentina brazil and pakistan volume increases contributed to 28 million of sales increase as well as a 59 million increase from favorable price mix in north america volume was slightly up year over year driven by gains in mexico offsetting expected lower sweetener syrup volume as we ceased operations at our stockton facility price mix in north america was down given higher freight costs and commodity margin pressures in south america foreign exchange devaluation was the largest driver of the year over year net sales decline volume was down 7 due to the impacts of the argentina recession on beverage sales and weaker brewing sales in brazil price mix was up 22 as our teams took price increases to pass through higher raw material costs and recapture some of the foreign exchange impact in argentina and brazil apac had specialty and core volume growth and price mix was up given tapioca pricing pass through emea had strong volume growth driven by specialties in europe and pakistan delivered positive net sales growth driven by price increases to offset the fourth quarter rupee devaluations advertisement advertisement for the quarter reported and adjusted operating income decreased 44 million and 32 million respectively north america operating income decreased 25 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing and lower sweetener volumes south america operating income was down 5 million driven by the impacts of the argentina recession on net sales versus the year ago period and impacts of currency devaluation on applied hyperinflation accounting asia pacific was up 4 million driven primarily by higher price mix given pricing pass through of tapioca costs and higher volumes emea was down slightly due to the impacts of unfavorable pakistan foreign exchange and higher corn costs offset partially by favorable specialty and core volume corporate costs were higher by 5 million for the quarter given further investment to optimize our global processes via our cost smart initiatives and continued investment in r d to drive specialties growth we ll wrap up the discussion of the quarter with earnings per share on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 30 per share primarily driven by a margin decline of 0 23 per share attributable to north america and partially offset by 0 07 per share in volume gains unfavorable foreign exchange was 0 15 per share moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 18 per share for the quarter largely driven by favorable tax and lower average shares outstanding partially offset by higher financing costs financing costs were a 0 03 per share decrease driven by higher debt balance as compared to a year ago period lower adjusted taxes contributed an 0 11 per share benefit primarily driven by us tax reform shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 10 a share advertisement advertisement for the full year the company delivered 5 841 billion of net sales which was up slightly from 2017 reported and adjusted operating incomes were 703 million and 767 million respectively reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income by 64 million the difference was due to 49 million of restructuring charges associated with our stockton california facility 11 million of charges associated with cost smart sg a initiatives and 4 million of other restructuring costs our reported and adjusted earnings per share were 6 17 and 6 92 respectively as we look more closely at net sales by region you can see unfavorable foreign exchange which totaled 198 million for the year affected most prominently in south america led by the argentine peso and brazilian real devaluations volume growth for the year was positive 76 million volumes were up in asia pacific and emea in north america volume was flat with increases in mexico and specialty ingredients offset by lower us canada sweetener volumes in total the price mix increase was 131 million up 2 price mix was down slightly in north america due to higher freight costs and lower commodity values in other regions price mix was up due to pass through of raw material costs and fx full year reported and adjusted operating income decreased 133 million and 111 million respectively north america operating income decreased 109 million due to higher supply chain costs continued starch inventory rebalancing lower sweetener volumes and commodity margin pressures south america operating income was up 18 million driven by our more competitive cost structure in brazil due to operational excellence initiatives and in argentina due to our new labor agreement and organizational restructuring asia pacific was down 11 million driven by higher tapioca costs emea was up 2 million with specialty and core volume growth more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds in pakistan corporate costs were higher by 11 million given the same reasons impacting the quarter moving to earnings per share operationally we saw a decrease of 1 08 per share challenges in north america costs and higher tapioca costs in asia were primary contributors to a margin decline of 1 15 per share volume increases contributed 0 34 to help offset the decline unfavorable foreign exchange of 0 29 primarily in the second half of the year was driven by currency weakness in emea and south america moving to our non operational items we saw an increase of 0 30 per share for the year largely driven by a lower tax rate and reduced shares outstanding adjusted taxes were a 0 27 per share benefit driven by the impact of the revaluation of the mexican peso and the us dollar denominated balances in mexico a reduced valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary and us tax reform while shares outstanding contributed a benefit of 0 16 a share these benefits were partially offset by higher financing costs of 0 12 per share which includes the impacts of argentina s hyperinflation accounting and a higher debt balance 2018 cash provided by operations was 703 million this was lower than expected due to a decision to curtail use of customer financing programs primarily in mexico given the rising costs of these programs due to higher short term interest rates capital expenditures of 349 million were up 43 million year over year driven by capacity expansions for our specialties growth platforms that support plant based proteins and sugar reduction finally the board supported significant share repurchase programs in 2018 amounting to 657 million of expenditures turning to our outlook we anticipate 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of 6 80 to 7 50 this excludes acquisition related integration and restructuring costs as well as any potential impairment costs we are expecting a flat to slightly up adjusted operating income for the year primarily due to our expectation that north america operating profit will be flat year over year although we are benefiting from approximately 20 million of one time cost impacts in 2018 we are expecting modest margin compression that can be explained by the following two circumstances coming together first the impact of us and china trade negotiations on soybean supply and inventories in the us is having a secondary impact on the cost of corn to us we sell corn byproducts which somewhat compete with soy meal protein and oil these values have been down since the first half of 2018 in effect this raises our cost of corn because we do not realize as much value from the sale of our corn byproducts to remind you co product sales are approximately 14 of our net sales second late in the contracting season we experienced competition for sweetener syrup volume and pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher net cost of corn and inflation expected in 2019 we are pleased with the retention of our west coast customer volumes as we transitioned service to other facilities in our network and we expect our utilization rates to be significantly higher in 2019 although these circumstances are impacting our 2019 north america profit growth expectations we believe our operating model still offers the opportunity for long run margin growth as we move more toward a greater weighting of specialty ingredients we anticipate that the impact of foreign exchange will be negative for 2019 and we expect significant negative currency of 25 million to 35 million during the first half of the year relative to the prior year we expect operating expenses including corporate expenses to be up year over year as we invest in global business process optimization and innovation to drive both cost savings and increased customer intimacy and growth we expect financing costs for the year to be in the range of 82 million to 87 million due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt and higher debt balance our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 26 and 27 5 we expect total diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 68 million to 69 million for the year considering the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreement lastly we anticipate cumulative cost smart run rate savings of 24 million to 34 million by the end of 2019 against wage inflation of 2 5 to 3 in north america we expect net sales and volumes to be down for the full year we expect operating income to be flat to 2018 with the first half down due to the lapping of net corn costs and the second half to be up as we lap more of the one time impacts from 2018 in regards to 2019 sweetener contracting we were pleased with our volume retention especially in light of our decision to stop production at stockton however sweetener pricing gains were not enough to sufficiently offset the higher expected net cost of corn and inflation which we anticipate will create slight margin pressure in our sweetener business we are pleased with the results of our starch pricing and contracting negotiations south american net sales are expect to be up versus the prior year volumes are expected to be down given argentina economic headwinds and the impact on sweetener syrup sales given the anticipated rapid pace and magnitude of fx devaluations we expect our business model requires the first half to recover so we anticipate operating income growth to be back half loaded in addition we anticipate positive economic growth for brazil we remain watchful of economic reforms inflation and impact on the upcoming election in argentina we continue to focus on business performance improvement and expect operating income improvement in the region asia pacific net sales are expected to be up and operating income is expected to be up modestly we expect weaker operating income in the first half with a stronger second half in emea we expect net sales to be up we anticipate strong specialties performance in europe and core growth in pakistan although we expect modest operating income growth we anticipate currency and raw material cost overlaps in pakistan will lead to a weaker first half versus the second half we expect cash from operations in 2019 to be in the range of 650 million to 700 million we expect to invest between 330 million and 360 million in capital expenditures around the world to support growth as well as cost and process improvements importantly we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders that brings my comments to a close now back to jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks jim in closing our leadership team remains focused on navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting our core businesses in north america and argentina we are committed to driving operational improvements throughout our business and structurally lowering costs equally we are energized by our commercial excellence initiative to grow co create and win with customers we are excited by the prospects of our recent specialties growth platform investments which will provide new ingredients and formulating capabilities to deliver consumer preferred innovation to our customers we are pleased to announce that we recently have been once again named to fortune s most admired companies list for the 10th consecutive year we will be presenting at consumer analyst group of new york on february 19th and i will discuss in greater detail our new specialty strategy which includes five new specialty growth platforms which are sharply aligned with consumer trends and lastly as we have recently demonstrated we will continue to use our strong balance sheet to invest in specialties growth opportunities and pursue m a we remain committed to delivering long term shareholder value and now let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator operating instructions your first question comes from the line of robert moskow from credit suisse please go ahead robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst hi thank you hi jim and jim james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi rob robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst i was hoping you could help me understand the price negotiations for north america this year you said that you expect profits to be down in sweeteners but that you were pleased with the negotiations on starch to what extent are you able to still swing capacity from one to the other and i guess in the past i have heard you talk about that as a lever you can pull if you re having trouble getting pricing or if there s too much volume in the market in one of the other and then i had a follow up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i would just repeat that for sweeteners contracting basically we accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish in relationship to the stockton closure and maintaining our west coast customers so there was no loss of share that we did not plan for as it relates to how contracting went and pricing went toward the back end of contracting there seemed to be more competitive intensity for volume and therefore pricing and margin compression occurred and that s why we re indicating there s a little bit of margin compression in relationship to sweeteners we were pleased however with the starch pricing and the contracting negotiations the sweetener network for us this upcoming year is going to be operating at full capacity and our starch production and inventory rebalancings are going on throughout the year and will steadily improve throughout the year so that s basically how i would explain it rob yeah rob i mean i d add that while a lot of our infrastructure investment is around the corn receiving and the steepening and the wet mill we always are thinking about finishing lines and capex that can allow us to toggle between what we do with the slurry that comes off of the starch grind that transition takes more planning and i would say the horizon on that is kind of multiple year so that s been a journey that we have be on as we think about which plants and then which finishing lines we would like to toggle more toward our starch and or our specialty production i think a good example of that is we added some capacity for the rare sugar allulose lows at one of our mexico facilities in order to make allulose we are actually toggling on high fructose so we use high fructose we refine that down and down into a process what you derive out is the rare sugar allulose robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay and i guess my follow up here is you talked a lot about improving the mix through specialty starches and more capital being headed in that direction can you give us a sense of whether your profits in specialty starches were up or down this year i know the percentage of your sales is up but i guess i m unclear on whether just moving in the specialty direction has whether the margin structure in that part of the business has held up and what your outlook is for 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah sure rob i ll take that question overall just to start our specialties are about 29 of our net sales they sell at higher average price points per ton than the remainder of the business and whether it s the gross profit margin levels are much higher than the remainder of our business from year to year as we target mid single to high to single digit net sales growth in our specialty portfolio we are seeing that corresponding type of gross profit growth i think in 18 in particular really within us canada the co product values pressures that we saw do impact specialties as well as our core sweetener and industrial starch business but nonetheless i still think year over year we saw growth in our overall profit pool of specialties particularly in some markets where we re really seeing some strong specialty growth outside of us canada is where we really really see some acceleration of that portfolio james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah and i would just add that the price points have held and in fact obviously we ve been able to get the pricing up in tapioca related to the increases in raw material costs robert moskow ingredion incorporated analyst okay thank you very much james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thanks rob james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david driscoll from citi please go ahead david driscoll citi analyst thank you and good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hey david david driscoll citi analyst i wanted to come back to some of the points that rob was raising and try it maybe slightly different so it looks to me like your north american operations in 2018 profits were down more than 100 million however your volumes for the full year were not they were flat you closed stockton so this frame it for me guys why does it feel when you say that you re not getting the pricing that you expected like why aren t you it doesn t look like utilization rates would be down i think you said you re running at full capacity that normally would have correlated with the stronger ability or a better ability to get pricing that s not happening so there is some kind of disconnect and i was hoping you could maybe explain why and if somewhere in that answer you could kind of tell me where you think industry utilization rates are that would also be helpful and then a follow up if i can james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i m going to let jim take a shot at that and then i ll add some commentary okay james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think david when we summarized north american roll it up we do kind of break apart into two big businesses underlying mexico so mexico was seeing some volume growth i also think that within us canada we were seeing growth in necessarily in our food starches where we faced the headwind was really in our sweetener volume portfolio primarily us canada and that was from 2017 into 2018 as we alluded to on calls we really did see some unique challenges in high fructose into beverages and that business was down two times what we ve seen our historical rate to be james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah the industry data david and i m sure you re aware of this is showing that for 2018 the rate of decline of hfcs has been now 2x the rate for say the previous five to 10 years so there is absolutely a step down or increase in the rate of decline of hfcs and we felt the effects of that in 2018 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer so then as we moved to ceasing operations at stockton in november we re seeing some purposeful shed of sweetener volume high fructose volume there at the last couple of months of the year as we move into 19 we expect that sweetener volumes to be down 19 versus 18 what really occurred i think at the end of the year david was that we re moving the remainder of that west coast volume back into our existing plants and in us canada we re taking that utilization rate up significantly as we head into 19 so that should help us with fixed cost absorption versus our sweetener overall in kind of our core plants does that answer some of your questions hopefully david driscoll citi analyst it does just two quick follow ups one i think that you ve tried so hard in 2018 to recover some of this freight pricing and i want to say that that looks only to be marginally successful but would like to hear your opinion on your ability in 18 to go back to customers and recover some of that freight inflation and then my final question would just be we hear reports that there are significant unrest within the mexican sugar industry and calls for some kind of punitive action taken against us high fructose corn syrup could you just bring us up to speed and is there any risk to the high fructose operations either in mexico or the us mexican trade on high fructose given some of the disruption that s been going on in the mexican sugar industry thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay i ll take the last question and then i ll come back to the freight i am not aware of any acute near term issues that are going to be problematic in relationship to the hfcs with mexico so we will look into that and we will certainly get back to you but i m not aware of anything that s imminent in that regard as it relates to freight the freight inflation that we faced in the first quarter of last year we made significant progress against tightening up terms with customers and being able to pass through freight increases and then we ve obviously seen some moderation of those rate increases throughout the rest of the year so we feel actually very good that we ve been able to mitigate a large portion the majority portion of the freight increase that we absorbed in 18 and will benefit to some degree going into 2019 especially as it relates to dry van which you remember was the freight increase that impacted our starch shipments in the first quarter of 2018 and so that will be mitigated and improved situation as we go into 2019 david driscoll citi analyst thank you very much i ll pass it along james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you david james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow from bank of montreal please go ahead ken zaslow bmo analyst good morning everyone james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director hi ken james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer hi ken ken zaslow bmo analyst just one high level question you continue to talk about the commodity exposures and stuff like that but the question i have is at what level of ingredient business when you get to the mix will the impact of commodity not be a source of ups and downs of profitability or would be mitigated how do you think about that james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think as we ve talked to in terms of our specialty strategy with specialties representing about 29 of our net sales today as we look forward over the three to five years and continue to make investments to add to our portfolio i think when we get to the mid 30s as a percent of net sales for specialties that the profit contribution from that is a bigger part of our profit pool and because of the differentiation of our products and as long as it s coupled with continuing to have great customer service i think we ll be insulated a bit more from some of the ups and downs that occur in our core business how we sell our specialties and how our customers order is kind of a different process than necessarily the day to day week to week ordering of what you see in a sweetener syrup business james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i just would add to that that what we ve experienced in 2018 and what we anticipate in 2019 is obviously clearly a more challenged operating environment and there have been some significant impacts that we ve talked about in relationship to commodity margin pressures related to ethanol crush margins being at very very low levels and the net corn costs that have increased related to co product revenues just related to this china us trade dispute very unique situations that we have just not seen before that have impacted us to the order of magnitude in our core business so all that being said we ve systematically stayed very very focused and strategic in relationship to our specialties investments and growth and we are very excited by the prospects of those and again we ll be talking more about that at cagny from a standpoint of the growth rates associated with all of those platforms and the impact that those will be having over time that will then mitigate any kind of earnings volatility but what i would say is in 2018 what we saw was extraordinary in relationship to the order of magnitude of the impact to our core business related to some of those factors that i was talking about related to commodity margin pressures so i anticipate going forward we ll see less of impact in that regard because of the contribution coming from the specialties investments that we re making ken zaslow bmo analyst so my follow up questions is one you did say that your gross profit is significantly higher but you didn t talk about operating profit which quite honestly is probably more important and then the second question part of that is when you think about the earnings from the front half to the back half of the year is that a normalization of this environment or is this just and is that kind of like where you re going to be in terms of growth into 2012 as well or is this just saying hey it s just easy comps and that s just how this squishy year votes so those are my two finals thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director do you want to take the back versus the front half on the phasing james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hey ken i do think that did that as you think about 19 really some of what we saw in the first half was first half of 18 was favorable net cost of corn in particular protein meal was pretty high and favorable as we went into the second half of 18 and you started to see the headwinds against soy and then candidly the soy crush margins were so attractive that you just had a lot of soy oil and lot soy meal coming off and that started to depress corn meal protein and corn oil prices and we really felt that in the second half of 18 so we re going to have that continuing as a lap into the first half of 19 so i think we just have to get that through and then we ll see and that broadly impacts kind of all of the business within the us canada and then you ll see more of the normal drivers i think that we have behind the business and that are more in our control as we move into the second half of the 19 so james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director right and forex also we re going to see significant forex headwinds continuing in the first half versus the second half so there are those two issues and just to a modest degree in asia pacific even we re going to be lapping lower corn prices in the first half in korea for example so there is this first half versus second half phasing issue that we anticipate related to the net corn costs squeeze or the co products squeeze that we have highlighted which we feel is a unique circumstance that s manifested itself in 2018 forex which will remain a headwind in the first half and then even in some of the other regions there is some unique impacts there that are phasing related to first half second half ken zaslow bmo analyst so it s more of a comp issue not a return to growth algorithm james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that s correct james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s a comp issue yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yes okay for the specialty products james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so ken i think i was trying to understand exactly your difference between gross profit and op income question ken zaslow bmo analyst you just said that the gross profit i think your comment was i don t have it written down i write sloppy unfortunately the gross profit was is higher your gross profit for specialty is higher than that and i think you gave a number of some sort is higher than that of your base business but you didn t translate that down to operating profit level which i think is more telling if that s ok james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would think that our generally we have not really commented on the differences in op income between specialty or the remainder of the portfolio that said when we think about our operating expense which is both which obviously includes sales as well as r d support generally that was pretty in line with what we thought our overall inflation would be so that would have there wasn t anything that was unusual that would imply that there was greater sg a investment i think against our specialty business versus the other lines of business in the portfolio ken zaslow bmo analyst thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director okay thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of akshay jagdale from jefferies please go ahead akshay jagdale jefferies analyst hi good morning so just wanted to follow up just clarification on the gross profit commentary on specialty so you said gross profit for specialty was actually up but just as a point of clarification that excludes the impact of co product credits correct like james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer no akshay jagdale jefferies analyst no so your reported gross profit for specialty was up in 2018 despite the co product headwinds the production cost issues and whatever else correct so overall gross profit in specialty was up james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think akshay we re mixing kind of scope here specifically when we re asked the overall specialty business we characterize as higher net sales growth higher price points and higher gross profit margins generally that business overall globally was still healthy okay specifically when we talk about comments upon co product values and the headwinds there that s kind of a us canada specific issue and so i just want to make sure that we re separating out the issues i would say that we still overall we re pleased with the way our specialty business performed in north america i mean there were there i think there were the challenges of co product values against all of the business in us canada but we re still pleased with how specialties has performed james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think that s where i think that s where the confusion occurred is the comment was that we did also experience some impact related to the co product revenue squeeze that would impact the specialties business as well but overall we re very pleased with the performance of the specialties business and the specialties profitability james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah akshay jagdale jefferies analyst okay and just going to the co product issue i think last quarter you gave us a nice earnings bridge about 100 million drag was the co product issue was that included in the 40 million from freight manufacturing and efficiencies in commodity margins or is this a different bucket now and can you can you just help us quantify that impact and maybe give us a sense of like can that move around if co product credits increase from here james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think when we addressed on the q3 call and we laid out the various drivers we did call out i think a bucket which was freight and emea inflation and commodity pricing pressures which had increased from our 40 million estimate that we had previously communicated i d say that s about 45 million and that s really just the step up in the co products value decrease that we were experiencing here but generally given what we had talked to in q3 the drivers were very very played out as we were trying to outline at that time akshay jagdale jefferies analyst and so just related to that so can you help us understand what the if you were to do a bridge for next for 19 you mentioned two major headwinds one was the co product credit hitting you guys and then the other was in your sweetener business margins being compressed can you give us some ballpark on those two and i mean on the co product side it s kind of out of your hands it s supply demand right but that can am i right in understanding that if spot prices move up there that will flow through your p l james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah on that last point yes and that s one of the reasons why we have set guidance where we did with such a wide range if you want to call it that because of that exact fact but i m going to let jim answer the question that you asked james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer and akshay i think maybe to help everybody on the call against our north america business what we really see is mexico modestly up i think if you look at the us canada business we would expect our food starch business to be up it s going to benefit a bit from what we would see in specialty top line growth as well as we continue to work through our starch rebalancing and our production issues those will play out all throughout 19 as we ve talked to before and we hope to be in a better position as we start into 2020 against the sweetener and industrial business you would have expected a step up as we lap the one time impacted of the argos shutdown as well as some the operational efficiencies and what we ve really seen is that combined with a relatively tight pricing market but the impact as well of lower co product values on our overall gross cost of our corn we re actually seeing that business modestly down for the year so those two kind of come together they necessarily offset and that s why we re seeing kind of a flat operating income expectation for north america i would say as well is that we are really just carrying forward an expectation that ethanol crush margins remain low again it s not a big part of our business it was something that was unexpected in 2018 as an impact but right now as we look forward to 2019 within our guidance we see that as relatively kind of staying the same to your point are there upsides if either ethanol crush margins move up or if we see some of the co product values start to increase i think that that would benefit our overall business within north america but that s not currently necessarily in our guidance akshay jagdale jefferies analyst got it and just one last one more on the specialty business long term right so obviously there s been a lot of noise operationally in the core business and margins have come down for the company but in the background it seems like you re investing pretty heavily on specialty so can you just give us a perspective on that and like what does that mean i mean should we expect you to increase at some point your long term guidance on growth for that business is that something we should expect down the road as a function of all the investments you re making thank you james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah well i mean thank you for highlighting the investments that we ve made in specialty capacity increases specifically in china korea the us and mexico and again we re very excited we went through a strategic review in 2018 o our specialty strategy to refine it and that s led to five growth platforms that have us very clearly focused on the future investments that we will be making we will be sharing this at cagny and again those we anticipate will have above market growth rates associated with them with headroom for growth in each one of those and again we ll be weaving all of that into our both say near or mid term outlook for profitability as well as a longer term outlook for profitability and that s what we intend to talk about at cagny and it will be greatly emphasized around specialties and then obviously balanced by taking into account what we re experiencing these last two years last year and this year and taking a read on that environment that s impacting our core business if that helps akshay akshay jagdale jefferies analyst thank you i ll pass on that does help operator your next question comes from the line of heather jones from the vertical group please go ahead heather jones the vertical group analyst good morning james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning heather heather kos ingredion incorporated analyst thank you i have just a detailed question first reading the language in the press release i just wanted to clarify so it sounds like the asr you all expect that to be complete pretty soon james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct yeah heather jones the vertical group analyst okay then moving on to your operations i guess first i was wondering if you could share with us your view of what s driven the acceleration you mentioned that the decline in sweetener volumes for the us industry in general is two times the previous five or six years wondering if you could share your view of what s driving that acceleration james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i think it s what we re all seeing in relationship to the concerns with sugar intake in general i think it s not just against hfcs i think also sugar itself is being formulated out of many products but it s consumer preferences really that i think are driving a lot of that demand the move toward smaller can sizes i guess for full calorie products from a standpoint of caloric intake and just a lot of the consumer trends that are driving government behavior et cetera if you look in certainly in argentina what we have experienced was just related purely we believe to macroeconomic demand destruction related to high inflation and consumers just getting squeezed in north america it s more trend related consumer trend related james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say also just add i think tactically for 2018 there were some impacts on costs to the beverage manufacturers we suspected that we would see some higher prices at retail and i think if you look at the scans ph data for the second half of the year whether it s iri or nielsen generally full calorie soda unit prices were up and i think that that led to a bit of volume headwinds in terms of consumption and obviously that leads to a bit of a volume challenge for us in our shipments of hf 55 into our beverage customers james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director that was something actually then i think jim had signaled in quarter two that was likely to happen related to aluminum prices going up and related to pet prices going up and the beverage manufacturers putting through price increases and there certainly was a contributing factor to that heather jones the vertical group analyst and that makes sense so following that logic is it fair to assume then a sharp fall in acceleration not just from prior years but an acceleration in the decline as 2018 progressed into 2019 james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think what you saw was that during more of the summer months in 18 was when that change manifest itself and so that plays out in q4 for us there will be a little bit of that lap as you go into the first half of 19 but then it will be back into kind of whatever the normal year might be for how the beverage customers see the marketplace in 2019 heather jones the vertical group analyst and you mentioned as far as stockton and the closure of that facility that you kept the volume you were intending to keep but that your volumes in north america would be down do you have an estimate of what sweetener sales will be on a pro forma basis for that closure as a percentage of north american sales james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we do i mean it was generally when we looked at that facility and i won t give you specifics but we looked at that facility i think we were intending to shed probably less than about 20 of the volume at that facility and we were anticipating keeping about 80 that we could see that we could reasonably serve and source from other plants within our network heather jones the vertical group analyst okay and then my final question is on your projections for 19 was wondering if you could share with us what your assumption is as far as the whole the brexit issue i know it s not a huge proportion of your sales but it seems like it could have an impact on europe and i m just wondering if you what your assumptions are there james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i ll take a shot and then i ll let jim finish it up i think obviously if there is a hard brexit or brexit with no resolution which will be the worst case scenario it s more the impacts to the overall eu and the uk which could be problematic if there is a soft brexit with what s on the table now or some sort of resolution we don t really think the results of that are going to be material to our business really jim james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the two tactical things that we want to plan for is that if there is anything on a hard brexit and all of a suddenly there is new customs borders that are formed we want to make sure that we have inventory in the right place so then any of our food customers don t face any immediate outages and then second we have to deal with whatever the imposed tariff levels would be and at some point whether or not immediate or over a course of a year to year and a half those tariffs are going to play a role in increase cost of manufacture and eventually those will play through to a consumer at a shopping or a restaurant and that should actually create a bit of a headwind in terms of some volume decrease so really those two things we really kind of anticipate would be how that might move forward but it all depends upon the suddenness or the gradualness of how brexit plays out heather jones the vertical group analyst and my final question hopefully is a quick one but i know you guys don t really do brewing in the us but i question does have implications for the broader industry and thus you guys this push to get away from corn derivatives and brewing and move toward more authentic 100 barley is that just headlines at present or are you seeing in the broader industry a trend toward that that could affect the supply demand balance in the us over 19 20 james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director so we weren t seeing that in the us and i think we know why you re asking that question heather jones the vertical group analyst yeah james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director but in relationship to our business the majority of our sales into brewing is in mexico as well as in south america and less so in the united states but jim do you want to make some additional comments james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer well i just think that the choice of the adjunct that the brewer uses is also very much a cost and a yield and a capacity throughput issue right so there is trade offs that our customers make but to jim s point mostly our business is primarily mexico as well as since in south america heather jones the vertical group analyst but for the end for the us industry which would impact overall supply demand and you re not seeing a big shift in the overall industry so far in the us james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director no i don t think so i think the industry is battling itself for share and they re looking for opportunities to create point of differentiation heather jones the vertical group analyst okay perfect thank you so much james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of adam samuelson from goldman sachs please go ahead adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone a lot of ground has been covered so hopefully i will keep this brief just first on the cash flow and you made some comments in the prepared remarks about changing customer financing in mexico but it came in notably below where you guys were three months ago and it was both on the one time tax refund as well as the continuing ops and just little bit more color on how those two dynamics played out and what actually happened there james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think with regard to really the working capital adam i think that was probably more of the major change that we were expecting you know what as we saw as the year played out both in north america to a lesser extent in south america we have various programs where you can discount an invoice and sell it to an intermediary as you saw short term rates starting to climb significantly as you look at maybe a three month or six month libor it just became evident that in the second half of the year it made more sense to reduce or halt the sale of any of those discounted invoices and just hold onto it and then collect the revenues directly from the customer so that has an impact on your accounts receivable balance as it grows it also allows us to be a bit more in control of our accounts receivable and then we can use other means of short term financing where we think we can get a better overall cost and balance so you will see the impact in your net working capital but we might find that there s other short term debt opportunities that are actually quite more affordable for the company to go access and then your comment on the tax flows those two play back and forth in terms of as we are looking at both settlement in terms of our us and canada reviews and appeals that we ve had in place and those have played out and then also as we look forward to really getting clarity on the impact of guilty and fddi or fdii on our overall credits for taxes so we can talk more offline on that but adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful two other quick ones on north america just contracting the comments or the we getting later in the contracting season is that do you think that was is more a function of the sweetener demand side the weakness accelerating and that becoming more evident to your competitors or do you think it was a factor of ethanol margins being pretty lousy and some of the competitors having ethanol wet mill capacity that they can switch over to hfcs both or other factors james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director yeah i mean we don t really know what drove competitive actions i think both of what you ve just described are plausible explanations for what drove that behavior adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay and then last one just going back to i think it was heather s question about the use of corn derivatives in the beer industry you talked about mexico but brazil i mean is it are you seeing that pressure in brazil i know that s an important market for you and some of your bigger customers i think are facing some pressure there as you re seeing kind of the value segment of that market and malt only beers grow is that something that s more evidenced in your volume data that and just talk about that james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director i would say that if there is a trend that starts to manifest itself in the united states should something manifest itself in the united states we re obviously going to be very watchful of where that may carry over but as of right now there s nothing material that s impacting our business related to that where some of this new noise or marketing positioning that s taking place that we saw on sunday last week james d gray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yeah i wasn t talking about the super bowl specifically i was more just in brazil i mean the value segment of the market and malt only is growing a lot faster than the mainstream and i thought my understanding was it was the mainstream that uses maltose james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director what i would say is that we are very in tune to all the trends that are developing in brazil because we do supply to the brewing industry in brazil and anything that we would be anything that would be happening we would also be working with those customers from an innovation standpoint as well so but nothing that s right now any kind of a problem for us that we want to surface but we re working with those customers to evaluate trends as they develop and also work with them from a standpoint of innovation on adjuncts that they may need for the future adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay all right that s i appreciate the color excellent thanks james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions james p zallie president and chief executive officer and director all right

officer director thank you jason and good morning everyone we delivered outstanding third quarter top line performance of 17 net sales growth this reflected well managed sales execution to meet strong customer demand in every region we achieved double digit sales growth by managing price mix and partnering with customers to meet changing demand requirements as a result of global supply chain constraints in a challenging environment and against previously anticipated high double digit corn cost inflation we kept pace with higher input costs to deliver adjusted operating income down 9 as you recall in the first half of this year we delivered significant year over year eps growth absorbing higher gross corn costs while benefiting from higher co product values taken together as we balance first half favorability with higher net corn costs in the second half we are still on track to deliver significant operating income growth for the full year now id like to highlight a few of our sales achievements as mentioned we grew net sales by double digits across all regions driven by strong specialty demand and actively managing the terms of our customer contracts including the pass through of higher margin corn and freight costs emea led our growth this quarter with strong specialty demand in europe and the positive impact of the katech acquisition asia pacific also performed exceptionally well driven by contributions from purecircle and strong overall specialty demand south america and north america benefited from strong customer demand and the pass through of higher corn and freight costs now id like to comment on the current supply chain environment that were all reading about as everyone knows supply chains globally are currently constrained by ocean container availability rail congestion labor shortages and continuing impacts of the pandemic in addition as economies continue to open strong international consumer demand has made the current supply situation very challenging to put the impact of the supply chain challenges into perspective on our business as a reminder the majority of our volume is sourced locally and delivered locally within region however for a portion of our specialty food starch business we have an interregional supply chain for example about 5 of our u s sales are imported from asia pacific of which most are specialty food starches therefore in the first half of this year we resourced our global supply chain center of excellence to actively manage interregional sourcing and work closely with customers to identify opportunities to best service their needs in some special circumstances weve had to exercise agility to meet customer demand for tapioca and rice based starches by air freighting product to meet new product launches or assist with product reformulations we anticipate the supply chain to remain constrained through the end of this year now moving on to our strategic pillars we continue to make solid progress against each of our strategic pillars throughout the quarter executing on key initiatives to advance our strategy our specialty ingredients platforms continue to be a catalyst for significant growth achieving high teens net sales growth for the quarter and exceeding the companys net sales growth among the highlights our sugar reduction and specialty sweeteners growth platform contributed the most sales dollar growth in the quarter additionally consumers heightened focus on nutrition and wellness underpin the robust demand in q3 for our clean and simple texture and plant based protein solutions moving to commercial excellence our sales teams around the world responded early in the quarter to the challenge of increasing input costs through pricing actions and by managing commercial terms which helped us mitigate inflationary impacts to our business while margins were pressured on a dollar basis we recovered nearly all of the cost inflation that we faced in the quarter cost smart continues to deliver benefits and have a transformational effect across our company as we continue to find ways to reinvent how we work and deliver increased efficiencies and savings this quarter we extended our shared service capabilities implementing a major change management program within our global human resources function that will provide better and more cost efficient hr services overall we remain on track to deliver against our 3 year cost smart savings program of 170 million which weve increased twice since it was introduced in 2018 all of this progress is underpinned by our purpose and values driven people centric culture as ill speak about in more detail shortly this quarter we are particularly proud to have released our first diversity equity and inclusion report where we shared our dei progress to date and our commitments for the future before discussing this let me first provide some important updates on the progress were making in our specialties portfolio first turning to sugar reduction purecircle continues to be a catalyst for growth in our sugar reduction and specialty sweeteners platform during the quarter purecircle net sales were up more than 200 year over year and operating losses decreased by 60 with both metrics well ahead of our integration plan additionally im happy to share that the acquisition is now cash accretive with a number of recent customer wins and a robust new project pipeline our sugar reduction and specialty sweeteners team is energized about future growth prospects now moving on to plant based proteins we continue to see strong demand for plant based protein innovation from both existing and new customers and albeit off a small base our net sales doubled for the second consecutive quarter and our project pipeline remains robust we are intensively focused on increasing supply and ramping up our facilities in south sioux city nebraska and vanscoy canada our dry milling production in vanscoy has reached new monthly production records and weve just commissioned our specialty concentrates production line in september which will increase our available supply of these differentiated products by year end in south sioux city our start up continues to make steady progress with production advancing and increases in batch size and consistency we estimate we are 2 3 through commissioning and process stabilization and are targeting a steady state process that is able to meet a ramp up in customer demand early next year we are laser focused on beginning to load this facility and absorbing the costs associated with a new plant start up our team is also actively managing yellow pea costs and availability as the drought in canada has negatively impacted crop size and prices we are confident we have secured our yellow pea requirements for next year and are assessing the impact of increased raw material costs on next years financial projections before i hand it over to jim i want to spend a moment discussing our diversity equity and inclusion agenda we view our purpose and values driven people centric culture as an important growth enabler at the heart of this is a deep commitment to diversity equity and inclusion our inaugural report entitled everyone belongs in recognition of one of our five values not only celebrates the accomplishments weve made on our dei journey thus far but sets new goals like achieving 100 on hrcs corporate equality index reaching industry benchmarks for inclusion and belonging improving representation of women in management positions to 50 by 2030 and improving representation of black indigenous and people of color at the management level with these goals we are intensifying our commitment to creating an environment where diversity is celebrated and inclusion is embraced we know how important this is for us to attract the most talented employees and foster an inclusive and innovative culture that delivers sustainable growth for shareholders weve included a link in our earnings presentation where you can download our new dei report and it is also available on our website now let me hand it off to jim gray who will provide a financial review of the quarter james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning to everyone starting first with our q3 regional performance north america net sales were up significantly when compared to the prior year north america operating income was 120 million down 9 versus the prior year the decrease was driven by higher corn and input costs as well as cost absorption related to the ramp up of operations in our plant based protein facilities south america net sales were up 16 versus prior year the increase was driven by favorable price mix including active contract management to reflect higher corn costs partially offset by a volume decline due to the contribution of our argentina operations to the arcor joint venture in august south america operating income was 35 million up 21 versus prior year as favorable price mix more than offset higher corn costs excluding foreign exchange impacts adjusted operating income was up 20 in the quarter moving to asia pacific net sales were up 18 in the quarter the increase was driven by favorable price mix and higher volumes primarily from purecircle asia pacific operating income was 21 million up 17 versus prior year as higher volumes from purecircle and better price mix were partially offset by higher corn freight and input costs in the region in emea net sales increased 22 for the quarter the increase was due to higher volumes including our katech acquisition as well as favorable price mix absent foreign exchange sales were up 20 emea operating income was 23 million down 8 for the quarter the decrease was driven by higher corn and energy costs in pakistan that more than offset higher volumes moving to our income statement net sales of 1 763 billion were up 17 for the quarter versus prior year gross profit dollars were relatively flat year over year while gross margin was 18 3 down 340 basis points due to increased revenue reflecting the pass through of higher corn costs reported operating income was 172 million and adjusted operating income was 163 million reported operating income was higher than adjusted operating income primarily due to a favorable final adjustment to the net asset impairment related to the contribution of argentina assets to the arcor joint venture partially offset by restructuring costs related to cost smart our third quarter reported earnings per share was 1 75 and adjusted earnings per share was 1 67 turning to our q3 net sales bridge strong price mix of 212 million was largely attributable to the pass through of higher corn costs in north america and active contract management in south america the sales volume increase of 39 million was driven by higher volumes in emea and asia pacific including the sales volume impact of purecircle and katech partially offset by the contribution of our argentina operations to the arcor joint venture turning to net sales variance by region in north america net sales were up 17 versus prior year driven by favorable price mix as well as higher specialty ingredient mix south america net sales were up 16 driven by strong price mix primarily due to active contract management to address higher corn costs which was partially offset by a decline in volume from the contribution of our argentina operations to the arcor joint venture in asia pacific net sales were up 18 driven by favorable price mix and higher volumes primarily from purecircle emea net sales were up 22 driven by higher volumes as demand in europe for specialty ingredients was robust sales volume also includes katech which contributed eight points of net sales growth in the quarter for the quarter reported operating income increased 19 million while adjusted operating income decreased 16 million the increase in reported operating income versus adjusted operating income is primarily due to the finalization and completion of the arcor joint venture net asset impairment partially offset by restructuring costs related to cost smart corporate costs for the company were up for the quarter versus last year driven by investments in global capabilities and centers of excellence turning to our earnings bridge on the left side of the page you can see the reconciliation from reported to adjusted earnings per share on the right side operationally we saw a decrease of 0 18 per share for the quarter the decrease was primarily driven by operating margin decline of 0 26 partially offset by higher volumes of 0 07 and favorable foreign exchange of 0 02 per share moving to our nonoperational items we saw an increase of 0 08 per share for the quarter primarily driven by the impact of lower adjusted effective tax rate of 0 12 per share partially offset by higher financing costs of 0 05 per share for our year to date income statement the company delivered net sales of 5 139 billion up 17 versus prior year gross profit margin was 20 3 down 60 basis points year to date reported operating income was 224 million and adjusted operating income was at 572 million reported operating income was lower than adjusted operating income due to the completion and finalization of the arcor joint venture net asset impairments and restructuring costs related to cost smart partially offset by income related to the favorable decision from the brazilian supreme court related to indirect taxes collected from 2015 to 2018 our year to date reported earnings per share was 0 74 and adjusted earnings per share was 5 58 turning to our year to date net sales bridge we see that all drivers of revenue contributed to growth favorable price mix of 433 million was largely attributable to the pass through of higher corn costs in north america and south america sales volume increase of 261 million was driven by higher volumes in asia pacific north america and emea including the additions of purecircle and katech these increases were partially offset by a decrease in south america sales resulting from the completion of the arcor joint venture our year to date operating income bridge reported operating income decreased 195 million while adjusted operating income increased 99 million versus prior year the decrease in year to date reported operating income versus adjusted operating income is primarily due to the net asset impairment charge related to the arcor joint venture in argentina operating income was up in all four regions year to date corporate costs for the company were up versus last year driven by investments in global capabilities and centers of excellence turning to our year to date earnings bridge on the left side of the page we show the reconciliation from reported to adjusted on the right side operationally we saw an increase of 1 07 per share year to date the increase was driven by margin improvement of 0 47 higher volumes of 0 44 foreign exchange of 0 10 and other income of 0 06 per share moving to our nonoperational items we saw an increase of 0 01 per share year to date moving to cash flow year to date cash provided by operations was 259 million cash provided by operations decreased versus prior year driven by the impact of higher net sales including higher corn costs on accounts receivable and inventory values capital expenditures were 186 million down 64 million from the prior year period due to the timing of spend during the quarter we repurchased 44 million of outstanding shares increasing our total year to date share repurchase to 68 million with more clarity regarding how demand pricing and input cost inflation are playing out for the second half of 2021 we are increasing our full year 2021 adjusted eps range to 6 65 to 7 per share up from the previously provided full year outlook of 6 45 to 6 85 we expect net sales to be up low double digits driven by the pass through of higher corn costs strong price mix and volume recovery we expect full year adjusted operating income to be up high single digits versus last year we expect corporate costs to be up low single digits 2021 financing costs are expected to be in the range of 78 million to 83 million our adjusted effective annual tax rate is expected to be between 25 5 and 27 cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of 450 million to 550 million which includes an increase in expected working capital due to the impact of higher net sales as well as the impact of higher corn costs on accounts receivables and inventories capital investment commitments are expected to be between 320 million and 350 million of which more than 100 million is being invested to drive specialty growth we expect total diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 67 5 million to 68 million for the year in terms of our regional outlook north american net sales are expected to be up 10 to 15 operating income is expected to be up low single digits to mid single digits driven by higher volumes and lower operating expenses for south america we assume the deconsolidation and contribution of our argentina operations for five months of the year we expect net sales to be up 10 to 15 and operating income to be up 20 to 25 in asia pacific we anticipate net sales to be up 20 to 25 versus the prior year including purecircle we expect operating income to be up high single digits driven by higher volumes for emea we expect net sales to be up 15 to 20 and operating income to be up high single digits driven by higher volumes which will be partially offset by higher input costs that concludes my comments and ill hand it back to jim james p zallie president chief executive officer director thanks jim overall we are very pleased with both the financial performance in the quarter as well as the strategic progress we continue to make to strengthen our portfolio right now we are focused on supporting our customers as we manage through complex supply chain bottlenecks which are impacting the entire food supply chain and just as importantly we are leveraging the expertise developed in our pricing centers of excellence that were built up over the last two years as we work to offset input cost inflation for the remainder of this year and next year we will continue to shape our portfolio toward specialties and look for opportunities to invest in new capabilities and businesses that will strengthen the value propositions inherent in each of our on trend consumer focused growth platforms lastly we will continue to bring the potential of people nature and technology together to make life better for all stakeholders now lets open the call for questions questions and answers operator and our first question coming from the line of ben bienvenu with stephens inc your line is open ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst hey thanks good morning everybody james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer good morning ben james p zallie president chief executive officer director hey ben ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst i want to ask and focus on the specialty business you noted the global specialties contributed high teen sales growth continuing to drive strong growth across a lot of your products within that segment of your business you also talked about improvement in the integration of purecircle could you provide some color on what sort of ebit contribution were seeing from specialties relative to that sales growth that were seeing and what you think the maturation of that contribution will look like over the next year or so as that portfolio continues to mature james p zallie president chief executive officer director sure jim do you want to take that james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer hey ben maybe ill lead on that weve characterized our specialty ingredients portfolio both from a gross margin and from an operating income margin perspective as being greater than the remainder of our portfolio traditionally we see specialty margins in our products in the 30 plus range and it can be for some niche products it can be significantly more than that on a gross margin basis and generally what were seeing is that as we have moved through this year in terms of various input costs they generally have less of an impact on our specialties because the raw material is a lower portion of our cost of sales and so as specialty continues to grow both on a volume basis on a market share gain basis and therefore on a revenue basis were seeing that ebit growth is somewhat in line with how we talk to the top line growth james p zallie president chief executive officer director yes i think in our strategic plan for example the majority of our gross profit increase over that time period is coming from specialties and i think when you saw the most recent four year outlook that we had provided that the percentage of operating income coming from specialties is projected to increase about four percentage points i think over that period from the standpoint of the weight of the overall portfolio the other thing james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer the total mix the total mix yes james p zallie president chief executive officer director the other thing that i would add is part of our strategy is to continue to invest in one of our five growth platforms which is called food systems which is leveraging the ingredients that are in those other four platforms starch based texturizers the clean and simple ingredients sugar reduction and plant based proteins from a formulation capability standpoint to develop more complete systems for our customers which typically are higher gross margin and those we have projected that those will grow at a higher rate as well ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst okay i see thats great thank you and secondly id like to ask about just capital allocation you look like based on the way things are going youll probably continue to build cash on the balance sheet even as youve accelerated to some extent your buyback activity youve got a steady dividend at a nice yield youre further along in integrating purecircle you noted that the pipeline is interesting and attractive could you talk about when we think about rank ordering your use of cash over the next year or so what are the most versus least likely outlets to deploy that cash into james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer sure yes ben ill tie your first question to your second question right which is that as we grow the specialty portfolio were really looking for that contribution in terms of operating income growth so how can we get operating income growth mid single digits to high single digits we do that by looking around the globe at where we have capital investments organic capital investments that our team identifies and thats really one of our first priorities in terms of capital investment after what i would call our stay in business capital and the reason why is that those opportunities are theyre near and theyre adjacent theyre strategic and our whole team can really operate on our value chain and on the go to market opportunity so for example were investing in a modified food starch expansion in china and china is a tremendously underserved market for modified starches and we can bring great differentiated product thats sourced locally and made locally and sold into a massive market so thats the type of opportunities where we first prioritize i think secondarily then were really looking at were very conscious about the dividend and dividend growth weve raised the dividend seven years in a row and then third we still have excess cash to deploy strategically and really its a choice between what m a is there available to us that we think we can prudently go after and do so with a disciplined approach toward roic i think weve proven that we can get synergies out of the acquisitions that weve executed in the past still some of that evidence is for us to show i mean we highlighted here on the call purecircle and the progress were making on purecircle going into next year so m a tuck in m a m a in general is very much a focus for us and if not then well go after some share repurchase and be very disciplined about total shareholder return ben bienvenu stephens inc analyst great thanks jim jim good luck with the rest of the year james p zallie president chief executive officer director thank you jim james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer thanks jim operator and our next question coming from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse your line is open robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi a couple of questions one is on in asia pac it looks like you lowered your sales guidance for the year is that related to purecircle or is that related to just the challenge of global trade in a tight supply chain environment and then also can you elaborate a little more on the yellow pea crop and what that means for your operations what was your whats your going in assumption for profitability of that new pea protein business for 2022 and what do you think the potential outcomes are if the crop turns out to be much more expensive james p zallie president chief executive officer director yes ill let jim take asia pac and ill take the yellow pea question james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer yes hey rob on with regard to asia pac really as we looked at what we thought the recovery was in from last year in terms of volume really if you look at q3 south southern asia right whether its thailand and asiani type of regions or even china with its kind of intermittent lockdowns theres just been kind of some ups and downs in terms of the volume growth as weve had just starts and stops in various food supply chains as well as kind of ins and outs on foodservice so i think that thats now were see that we see covid rates coming down we see consumer mobility up thinking a bit more positively on asia pac for q4 so really when we just take kind of q3 and what maybe that slight pause had into effect i think thats impacting our full year outlook and its it really has nothing to do with purecircle purecircle growth is still strong double digits james p zallie president chief executive officer director and as far as the plant based protein investment in yellow pea we continue to remain very bullish on the growth prospects from both south sioux city and the vanscoy investments we absolutely believe that plant based proteins are going to represent a sizable portion of our specialty portfolio over the next three four five years were very encouraged by the progress our manufacturing and engineering teams have made to commission two entirely new production facilities in a completely new ingredient category to ingredion and the vanscoy facility as we indicated continues to produce at record rates in comparison to previous months right now the focus is on south sioux city completing that process stabilization and ramping up that supply to meet customer demand our plant based protein sales in 2021 will be two to three times what they were last year that said they will be behind our first year forecast and thats why were laser focused on loading the facility and absorbing the costs associated with the new plant start up so while this will result in a larger operating loss than we had projected this particular year were confident in the long term prospects for the category and for the return on those investments james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer yes and generally rob i mean to add as we see yellow pea cost or the cost of the raw material going up the first indications are is that its such a value added product that raw material pricing can be put through on the higher end protein isolates in the marketplace robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay so when you say that the loss is larger than expected is that because the crop is weak or is it because of other types of delays james p zallie president chief executive officer director no no no so again we are just commissioning these facilities this calendar year so the yellow pea cost is not related to that at all so its just related to the merging of the commercial ramp up of the facilities tied to sales in the first year literally of commissioning both facilities robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay is it easy to catch up in year two then jim like as far as james p zallie president chief executive officer director weve got a very strong customer pipeline were having very strategic discussions with some of the largest users and projected users of for example pea protein isolate and pulse based concentrates across food and other applications and so were feeling very good about the prospect going into 2022 james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer yes rob maybe just to help on south sioux city theres just more fixed costs with that facility just given the complexity of the process and so the more volume you get through you absorb the fixed costs and then you get right back on plan robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay last question in the quarter gross profit margin was below consensus was it in line with what you thought internally or was a little light james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer no i think it was in line with what we were expecting recognizing look in our business quite a bit of it is in terms of as we mentioned in north america a portion is variable price so its a fee type contract revenue is going to go up as the course the cost of corn goes up and were really securing kind of our dollar profit per ton for the value add service that we provide so i think in terms of gross profit dollars looking at the various corn cost inflation which was probably 3 4 of our change in our cost of sales for the quarter that was very in line with expectations robert moskow credit suisse analyst got it okay thanks operator now our next question coming from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs your line is open adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst hi yes thank you good morning everyone james p zallie president chief executive officer director hey adam james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer hi adam adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst so first question maybe just to clarify just as we think about the layout for the fourth quarter i think the full year guidance implies that adjusted operating profit in 4q is down 20 plus year over year and then maybe just help us with where the incremental year on year pressures are coming through in 4q relative to where you were in the third quarter and i know corn costs are more burdensome in the second half of the year broadly but it does seem to imply a bigger step down sequentially and im just trying to make sure were clear on the drivers james p zallie president chief executive officer director sure thanks adam so in the first first i just want to bring us back to the first nine months of the year gross corn costs were in line with our business plan and we benefited from higher co product values in addition volumes particularly specialties were stronger than anticipated due to the snapback of the global economies opening up inclusive of really very strong foodservice sales and in the third quarter we kept pace with higher input costs to deliver operating income in line with our expectations against again previously anticipated high double digit corn cost inflation and we also delivered very strong price mix in quarter four were anticipating further inflationary cost increases and some supply chain constraints limiting volume upside and were obviously imposing price surcharges in year which is what weve been doing and they will just lag some of the increase in input costs but were taking all that into account as we go into our contracting and pricing for next year with momentum on the pricing side james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer yes and adam just to remind right q3 is usually a bigger quarter than q4 and that as we had previously discussed and as jim just mentioned just still managing through higher corn costs year over year i mean thats the primary impact that were seeing in terms of q4 adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst okay all right thats yes thats helpful and then follow up question and you kind of alluded to it a little bit in that answer just now jim but also throughout the call today you made several allusions to actively managing customer contracts and pricing and being considerably more proactive on that than maybe ingredion had been historically id love to hear you reflect a little bit about what youre actually doing with the on the pricing side to really make sure youre getting that inflation recovery and is that both in the more in the base commodity business than specialty is it both if its commodity is that a better supply environment with volumes improving or just help me think about how maybe ingredions kind of pricing discipline is maybe different today than it might have been a couple of years ago james p zallie president chief executive officer director yes weve been emphasizing our what we call pricing centers of excellence for the last year plus and the best evidence of that is in south america so south america has developed very strong pricing muscles that have been demonstrated in relationship to the magnitude of price mix vis a vis forex devaluation over each successive quarter over the last two years so much so that i think it was last quarter and this quarter its almost a complete neutralization without even the lag thats one example so weve shared best practices across the globe and staffed and were fortunate we did so prior to inflation rearing its head thats why were feeling very good and this particular year as it relates to extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures when youre living through inflation in year even though were contracted were looking at each and every contract where possible where we can in year exercise the terms that are in those contracts to put through freight increases of an order of magnitude that offsets those cost increases surcharges where necessary and any other inflationary increases so were doing that in each region based on those pricing centers of excellence and just if i could comment a little bit just on pricing as it relates to the go forward the increased economic activity and increased industry capacity utilization we believe will be favorable to pricing next year corn prices are as we all know trending in the mid 5 range for next year which would imply substantial increases in corn costs and the industry is contending with the increases in chemicals packaging fuel freight and all of thats going to need to be offset by pricing and consistent with our operating model we expect to pass through higher corn freight input cost to our customers and thats really been the primary focus to our customers since early summer and equally the pace of contracting is likely to be impacted by customers concern for supply as well as the uncertainty around continued inflationary pressures and i can say for those customers who we have agreed to 2022 commitments at this time were seeing substantial price increases year over year and well provide a readout on 2022 contracting during our year end earnings call in february adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst all right great that was really helpful ill pass it on thanks operator our next question coming from the line of ken zaslow with bmo capital markets your line is open ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning everyone james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer hi ken james p zallie president chief executive officer director hi ken ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst just one bigger picture question your cash flow from your cash flow guidance came down a little bit but youre obviously taking up expectations and your capex is going down what is that in reference to just kind of giving that a little color thatd be helpful james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer sure hey ken just as you have higher corn and raw materials just working from the raw material to the wip to the finished goods and then were selling those to customers so your volume may be up low single mid single digits the price on that ton is benefiting from the pass through of that higher corn cost and so therefore the invoice that goes to the customer is more and then as you just work through the various terms with the customers in terms of their payables as sales grow we have to put a little bit more money into accounts receivable and then as that higher raw material cost is passing through our inventory be it wip or finished goods and were holding it while the number of units may be similar or even slightly more constrained or down year over year due to demand the value per unit the value per ton is up and so thats just reflecting in our balance sheet i really think this is as this globally higher corn cost has moved through the balance sheet in 2021 well be back to kind of a more normalized investment in working capital in 2022 and beyond ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst okay and then in terms of europe and the energy costs how transient is that and do you expect to be able to start passing it through that we would start to see a different trajectory in 2022 james p zallie president chief executive officer director yes i mean and one significant item as it relates to input costs that we are putting through as far as price increases go europe accounts for 55 of our sales in emea and in accordance with our risk management strategy we hedge for europe our natural gas needs and were covered well into next year so were monitoring the situation and we are intending to put through increases to offset the inflationary increases with energy as well as other raw materials and other input costs for contracting for next year in europe ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst okay and my final question and weve all kind of beat around the bush on this im just going to go right after it have you finished contracting in the u s and do you expect your prices to offset the corn prices going forward and then ill leave it there and i james p zallie president chief executive officer director its just too early were in the midst of contracting as we always are at this point in time but what i would repeat is that the market given how tight supply demand is related to very strong demand so thats what were seeing very strong demand and we could sell everything that we make and our plants are up are running very hard and theres acknowledgment if not acceptance in relationship to the need for price increases to offset inflationary increases and were seeing that receptivity and its just too early to say how its all going to net out but right now where we sit were feeling good about the markets understanding and the receptivity for price increases to offset inflationary increases james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer yes yes i think ken just to add its november were about 1 3 of the way through i think our kind of flat contracting and on that we have seen substantial price increases year over year so to jims comment right theres still 2 3 of our customers out there who are looking at their contracts and i think honestly i think customers are working through budgeting for next year and theyre working through how does that fit into what their overall price increases need to be on their goods so we expect it to pick up this should be the time of the year when it should be really kind of closing out prior to thanksgiving and then the holidays james p zallie president chief executive officer director and that percentage that jim cited is totally in line historical so its not anything thats unusual ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst great i really appreciate it guys thanks james derek gray principal accounting officer executive vice president chief financial officer thank you ken operator im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference call back over to mr jim zallie for any closing remarks james p zallie president chief executive officer director thank you for joining us this morning everyone we look forward to a time when we can see each of you again in person please note that we are targeting our investor day for the first half of 2022 when we expect to be able to accommodate in person gatherings and until then we want to thank you for your

by chris hedges february 04 2019 information clearing house the inept and corrupt presidency of donald trump has unwittingly triggered the fatal blow to the american empire the abandonment of the dollar as the world s principal reserve currency nations around the globe especially in europe have lost confidence in the united states to act rationally much less lead in issues of international finance trade diplomacy and war these nations are quietly dismantling the seven decade old alliance with the united states and building alternative systems of bilateral trade this reconfiguring of the world s financial system will be fatal to the american empire as the historian alfred mccoy and the economist michael hudson have long pointed out it will trigger an economic death spiral including high inflation which will necessitate a massive military contraction overseas and plunge the united states into a prolonged depression trump rather than make america great again has turned out unwittingly to be the empire s most aggressive gravedigger the trump administration has capriciously sabotaged the global institutions including nato the european union the united nations the world bank and the imf which provide cover and lend legitimacy to american imperialism and global economic hegemony the american empire as mccoy points out was always a hybrid of past empires it developed he writes a distinctive form of global governance that incorporated aspects of antecedent empires ancient and modern this unique u s imperium was athenian in its ability to forge coalitions among allies roman in its reliance on legions that occupied military bases across most of the known world and british in its aspiration to merge culture commerce and alliances into a comprehensive system that covered the globe when george w bush unilaterally invaded iraq defying with his doctrine of preemptive war international law and dismissing protests from traditional allies he began the rupture but trump has deepened the fissures the trump administration s withdrawal from the 2015 iranian nuclear agreement although iran had abided by the agreement and demand that european nations also withdraw or endure u s sanctions saw european nations defect and establish an alternative monetary exchange system that excludes the united states iran no longer accepts the dollar for oil on international markets and has replaced it with the euro not a small factor in washington s deep animus to teheran turkey is also abandoning the dollar the u s demand that germany and other european states halt the importation of russian gas likewise saw the europeans ignore washington china and russia traditionally antagonistic are now working in tandem to free themselves from the dollar moscow has transferred 100 billion of its reserves into chinese yuan japanese yen and euros and as ominously foreign governments since 2014 are no longer storing their gold reserves in the united states or as with germany removing them from the federal reserve germany has repatriated its 300 tons of gold ingots the netherlands repatriated its 100 tons are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter the u s intervention in venezuela the potential trade war with china the withdrawal from international climate accords leaving the intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty the paralysis in washington and disruptive government shutdown and increased hostilities with iran bode ill for america american foreign and financial policy is hostage to the bizarre whims of stunted ideologues such as mike pompeo john bolton and elliott abrams this ensures more global chaos as well as increased efforts by nations around the globe to free themselves from the economic stranglehold the united states effectively set in place following world war ii it is only a question of when not if the dollar will be sidelined that it was trump along with his fellow ideologues of the extreme right who destroyed the international structures put in place by global capitalists rather than socialists these capitalists invested tremendous resources to crush is grimly ironic the historian ronald robinson argued that british imperial rule died when colonial rulers had run out of indigenous collaborators the result he noted was that the inversion of collaboration into noncooperation largely determined the timing of the decolonization this process of alienating traditional u s allies and collaborators will have the same effect as mccoy points out all modern empires have relied on dependable surrogates to translate their global power into local control and for most of them the moment when those elites began to stir talk back and assert their own agendas was also the moment when you knew that imperial collapse was in the cards the dollar because of astronomical government debt now at 21 trillion a debt that will be augmented by trump s tax cuts costing the u s treasury 1 5 trillion over the next decade is becoming less and less trustworthy the debt to gdp ratio is now more than 100 percent a flashing red light for economists our massive trade deficit depends on selling treasury bonds abroad once those bonds decline in value and are no longer considered a stable investment the dollar will suffer a huge devaluation there are signs this process is underway central bank reserves hold fewer dollars than they did in 2004 there are fewer swift payments the exchange for interbank fund transfers in dollars than in 2015 half of international trade is invoiced in dollars although the u s share of international trade is only 10 percent ultimately we will have reserve currencies other than the u s dollar the bank of england gov mark carney announced last month sixty one percent of foreign currency reserves are in dollars as these dollar currency reserves are replaced by other currencies the retreat from the dollar will accelerate the recklessness of america s financial policies will only exacerbate the crisis if unlimited borrowing financed by printing money were a path to prosperity irwin m stelzer of the hudson institute said recently then venezuela and zimbabwe would be top of the growth tables mccoy explains what a world financial order untethered from the dollar would look like for the majority of americans the 2020s will likely be remembered as a demoralizing decade of rising prices stagnant wages and fading international competitiveness after years of swelling deficits fed by incessant warfare in distant lands in 2030 the u s dollar eventually loses its special status as the world s dominant reserve currency suddenly there are punitive price increases for american imports ranging from clothing to computers and the costs for all overseas activity surges as well making travel for both tourists and troops prohibitive unable to pay for swelling deficits by selling now devalued treasury notes abroad washington is finally forced to slash its bloated military budget under pressure at home and abroad its forces begin to pull back from hundreds of overseas bases to a continental perimeter such a desperate move however comes too late faced with a fading superpower incapable of paying its bills china india iran russia and other powers provocatively challenge u s dominion over the oceans space and cyberspace the collapse of the dollar will mean mccoy writes soaring prices ever rising unemployment and a continuing decline in real wages throughout the 2020s domestic divisions widen into violent clashes and divisive debates often over symbolic insubstantial issues the deep disillusionment and widespread rage will give an opening to trump or a trump like demagogue to lash out perhaps by inciting violence against scapegoats at home and abroad but by then the u s empire will be so diminished its threats will be at least to those outside its borders largely meaningless it is impossible to predict when this flight from the dollar will take place by the second half of the 19th century the u s economy had overtaken britain but it was not until the middle of the 20th century that the dollar replaced the pound sterling to become the dominant currency in international trade the pound sterling s share of currency reserves among international central banks fell from around 60 percent in the early 1950s to less than 5 percent by the 1970s its value declined from more than 4 dollars per pound at the end of wwii to near parity with the dollar the british economy went into a tailspin and that economic jolt marked for the british as it will for us the end of an empire chris hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in central america the middle east africa and the balkans

101 tells us high public debt is bad but what if the textbooks need updating photo by david kawai bloomberg article content andrew scheer keeps saying that a vote for justin trudeau this autumn will be a vote for higher taxes that s a reasonable deduction the budget deficit has increased to about 20 billion from zero in 2015 so the debt is growing that s bad according to most economics textbooks government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates and it crowds out private capital because investors prefer risk free government bonds to risky bets on entrepreneurs the situation can t be allowed to persist and since trudeau appears allergic to spending cuts debt dynamics will force him to raise taxes we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our

blanchard who now is a professor emeritus at massachusetts institute of technology and a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics presented a paper that shows such a relationship tends to be the norm in major developed economies therefore a country such as the u s could reduce its debt burden simply by rolling over existing bonds because nominal growth will exceed the interest rate in a way there is no fiscal cost blanchard said in a lecture on jan 4 we can discuss the semantics but you can see what i have in mind you don t need to raise taxes to finance the additional debt you don t need to raise taxes to finance the additional debt olivier blanchard economist the trudeau government has been applying a variation of this theory since it decided to ditch its promise to run only small deficits for a few years the deficit is the equivalent of about one per cent of gdp which is still pretty small by most standards in canada nominal growth will average 3 9 per cent between 2018 and 2022 and the yield on the 10 year bond will average 2 9 per cent according to the mean estimate of the 14 outside economists who advised finance on the fall economic update the debt is on track to shrink as a share of gdp which matters more than the absolute level no tax increases required advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content nevertheless scheer appears to think that trudeau is vulnerable on debt and taxes on jan 29 the opposition forced the liberals to defeat a motion that called on the government to promise that it wouldn t raise taxes in the future it s a tweak of scheer s pre christmas assault which focused simply on the deficit as you evaluate the new critique keep in mind that the theory on which it is based hasn t really been updated for the post crisis low interest rate age in which we live for example jonathan ostry the canadian economist who is the deputy director of the international monetary fund s research department showed in 2015 that countries that can borrow relatively cheaply are better off living with their debts than adopting austerity for austerity s sake in 2016 stephen poloz the bank of canada governor published a paper that suggests the harper government s decision to balance the budget contributed to the surge in household debt a better policy mix would have allowed the central bank to raise interest rates avoiding the credit bubble and last month jason furman and lawrence summers harvard university economists who served in president barack obama s administration published an article in foreign affairs that calls on american politicians to get over their debt obsession advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content no one seriously argues that the cost of capital is holding back businesses from investing cutting the deficit then is unlikely to spur much private investment jason furman and lawrence summers harvard economists textbook economic theory holds that high levels of government debt make it more expensive for companies to

seriously argues that the cost of capital is holding back businesses from investing cutting the deficit then is unlikely to spur much private investment that s a lot of brainpower amassed against the conservatives contention that trudeau s fiscal policy inevitably leads to higher taxes still team trudeau shouldn t feel smug blanchard said his research shouldn t be used as an excuse to pile on debt and furman and summers raised an important political economy concern the debt to gdp ratio that trudeau favours might be the right gauge but it s nuanced and nuance doesn t sell to keep the fiscal prudes from winning the political argument the former obama economists advise american policymakers to match new spending with program cuts or extra revenue except during recessions if something is truly worth doing it should be worth paying for they wrote dozens of countries use budget rules as a check on spending trudeau scrapped the one that harper had put in place if he wants to win the debt

on december 1st thousands of people took to the streets of mexico city to celebrate the inauguration of andres manuel lopez obrador as the new president of the mexican republic this took place after one of the longest transitions in recent history for 6 months after the june 1 election two governments existed that of enrique pena nieto and that of lopez obrador a complex environment for the transition because financialized capitalism is structurally unstable daily governance hangs by a thread on the risk rating agencies if the government doesn t control inflation ensure financial stability and maintain fiscal balance and budgetary discipline it will not pass the confidence test of bankers and international investors as a result bankers and investors can slowly or rapidly undermine the credibility of any alternative government and sink any plans for change the transition from pena nieto to lopez obrador saw the hasty signing of the mexican us canada treaty a new name for nafta this new agreement repeats all the socially discredited aspects of nafta and imposes new and substantial restrictions on the new government and on mexican american and canadian workers also during this transition from one government to the next mexicans lived through the conflict ridden exodus of central american migrants hondurans salvadorans and guatemalans to the united states this exodus created a crisis at mexico s southern border and temporarily militarized the us mexican border in cities like tijuana the conflict produced the same expressions of racism xenophobia and intolerance that are the basic ingredients of donald trump s policies furthermore during the transition there were sudden drops in the stock market and a devaluation of the peso against the dollar this was due to the announcement of the cancellation of a project to construct a new luxury airport above an aquifer northeast of mexico city along with revisions to the commissions that banks charge in mexico charges that are double the ones imposed by the same banks in their home countries all of this was taking place coincidentally with the us china trade war and a slowdown in the global economy business interests used the media to attack the new government s alleged intention to change management rules for pension funds along with attacks by parties displaced from power all trying to recover ground they lost in the june election in the state of guanajuato one of the most conservative regions of the country controlled by the right wing pan party a limit was placed on the supply of gasoline guanajuato was the first state to open their gas stations to transnational corporations in 2018 this new limit on gasoline supply created bewilderment and anger among automobile drivers corruption and the neoliberal model during the official inauguration in front of members of the house and senate governors and special guests while ex president pena nieto sat by his side lopez obrador castigated neo liberalism with its economics of inequality its poverty and marginalization its impunity and cynical respect for the corruption that flourished in mexico under previous governments as a true disaster for mexico lopez obrador made clear that he is not only initiating a new government but also a change in the politics of the regime itself his changes will be peaceful and orderly yet at the same time radical and profound because they will end corruption and impunity he reiterated that the neo liberal economic model is both a foreign idea and one that leads to de nationalization because it concedes territory businesses and public benefits to private and foreign businessmen he denounced corruption as the principal tool of political power and noted the importance of separating economic and political power but he stressed all this right after announcing his advisory board made up almost entirely of the great men of mexican business he did this to calm the jitters of businessmen worried about the cancellation of the new airport it was not surprising to see that upon taking office lopez obrador reiterated that he will not raise the price of gasoline nor increase the public debt he will respect the signed contracts made by the previous government and the autonomy of the central bank of mexico a choice to rely on the military what was a surprise it was to see him announce the formation of a national guard constitutionally armed or not made up of the army marines and federal police which will continue the militarized strategy to combat drugs this also implies that lopez obrador is placing the guarantee of democratic rights and freedoms in military structures in the past this policy has created a colossal humanitarian crisis throughout the entire country what happened to the demand for an immediate peace that was the key factor that motivated millions of people to vote for lopez obrador lopez obrador said he would live in his own home and that los pinos the official residence of mexican presidents will be opened to the public this will allow people to see how ex presidents led a luxurious life equivalent to the sheiks of the middle east while most of the country lacked basic needs a question of representation after the inauguration lopez obrador attended a massive gathering in the capital s zocalo where representatives of sixty eight indigenous communities awarded him the baston de mando as he took this baton of command lopez obrador exhorted the people who filled the zocalo not to leave me alone without you i am worthless or almost worthless after the festivities this celebratory act became controversial first it was criticized as too folkloric with the burning of incense prayers and invocations to the four cardinal points second and above all it was controversial because the gathering that gave the baston de mando did not represent the indigenous people leaders should not have spoken in the name of the indigenous movement as this act appeared to suggest that they were the main interlocutors with the government of lopez obrador the question of representation of this group is not a minor matter lopez obrador has ratified three large projects as part of his development plan the multi modal trans isthmus corridor from the pacific to the gulf of mexico the maya train and a refinery in tabasco he said he would expand the existing airport by adding two runways in sum lopez obrador is proposing some old mega projects in indigenous territories without the detailed consultation that is clearly required by convention 169 of the international labor organization it s also important to point out that it was the neoliberal government of vicente fox 2000 2006 that proposed the trans isthmus corridor as part of the plan puebla panama will there be an end to the neoliberal project with regard to these projects numerous experts have pointed out that predatory modernity has already left its effect on merida cancun campeche and chetumal in these cities tourism commerce and real estate development have destroyed biocultural patrimony and generated progress that is unjust unstable and destructive this has occurred because there has been no joint action between governments at the federal state and municipal level with local communities peoples and indigenous groups for this reason these experts argue publicly for the construction of an ecological social and solidarity economy guided by a deep biocultural respect and the defense of life in all its forms lopez obrador has also stated his intention to cancel neoliberal education reform to offer free medical care in marginalized zones to construct a truth commission to punish the abuse of authority and to deal with the case of the forty three disappeared youth from the town of ayotzinapa he announced that he will pay attention to mexico s fifty four million poor people give ten million scholarships to young people and double economic support to older adults and those with disabilities without a doubt he is listening to some of the popular demands for fundamental change the hard task of converting hope into reality and finally in a controversial move lopez obrador announced that he was not thinking of prosecuting functionaries from previous governments because he is not motivated by vengeance rather he is in favor of forgiveness and forbearance given the flagrant cases of corruption by public officials at all levels of government under enrique pena this announcement could violate the rule of law and perpetuate impunity it cannot be an option for an individual president to say i pardon you and forget it he must act within existing law against corrupt functionaries otherwise their crimes will go unpunished and thus perpetuate impunity in all of andres manuel lopez obrador s actions from his inauguration to the zocalo mobilization to the popular festivals with the hope for a changed mexico everyone is aware that change will not occur from one day to the next but at least there is light at the end of the tunnel if achieving this change was hard it will be even harder to convert this hope into reality the discourse versus the reality demonstrates the path that we are walking alejandro alvarez bejar is a professor of economics at the national autonomous university of mexico unam a member of the trinational coalition for the defense of public education and a honorary commander of the heroico batallon de san patricio translation by dan leahy thanks to

the u s dollar is expected to rise against other major currencies in the first half of the year before losing ground in the second half analysts said as a combination of slower u s growth expectations for 2019 and federal reserve s more gradual approach toward interest rate hikes will weigh on the currency in a poll conducted by international business times the median forecast from 10 analysts suggests the dollar will fall to 1 1843 against the euro by year end and will weaken to 106 56 against the japanese yen during the same period one analyst did not give forecasts analysts said uncertainties including the u s china trade war and politics in the euro area have the potential to push the u s dollar higher but only in the short term in the second half of 2019 the u s dollar will slip against major currencies as the growth differentials between global economies start to converge u s china trade tensions brexit and euro area politics remain key event risks however each having the potential to push the u s dollar higher over the shorter term bank of america said in its note the impact of a hard brexit will see a sharp depreciation in the pound against the majors michael ferlez economist at moody s analytics said if the trade war with china exacerbates this could signal weaker global demand and could lead to appreciation in safe haven currencies such as the usd and jpy this would also lead to depreciation of currencies that depend on trade with china such as the aud he added the fed whose tightening cycle analysts attribute to being one of the key drivers for the u s dollar s strength in 2018 is largely expected to reduce the number of rate increases this year according to an earlier poll by ibt scott brown chief economist at raymond james said fed tightening lifted the u s dollar in 2018 the fed is expected to be more gradual in raising rates in 2019 and the economy should support a further normalization but the risks to the growth outlook are tilted toward the downside accordingly the u s dollar is likely to be about steady in the first half of the year but may soften in the second half brown did not give any forecasts repricing of the 2019 fed tightening cycle has weighed on the trade weighted u s dollar analysts said the trade weighted u s dollar index is about 1 5 percent lower from its highs in december it was last reported at 126 8701 on tuesday and touched a high of 128 7636 on dec 19 presidential pressure on the fed a stock market sell off and the fed themselves shifting toward a data dependent approach have all contributed to the move ing said analysts also said the u s economic growth is widely expected to decelerate from current levels implying a growth convergence among economies bank of america said in its note by the end of the year the euro zone and the u s will be growing at potential and monetary policies will start converging u s data has already started weakening after growth peaked in q2 last year euro zone data remains weak but we believe that the bottom was in q4 last year we also expect a u s china trade deal in q1 this year which will also be good news for the euro zone economy we expect the combination of shifting growth and interest rate differentials key factors that supported the u s dollar in 2018 to work against it in 2019 the bank said usd versus other majors analysts said the u s dollar will not sustain its 2018 rate of appreciation against most g10 currencies the u s dollar has outperformed other major currencies in 2018 the wsj dollar index that measures the greenback s performance against 16 other currencies gained 4 3 percent in 2018 the safe haven japanese yen was the only other currency to end the year positive gaining 2 percent in 2019 we will see a broad but shallow retracement against the majors due to the fading effects of the tax legislation on repatriation by u s multinationals and more significantly the potential for a pause in u s rate increases by the federal reserve ferlez said in the short term oxford economics expects the eur usd to face more downside risk amid continuing euro zone growth underperformance the research house remains positive on the sterling in the medium term however a hard brexit will weigh on the sterling amid the uncertainties the japanese yen is expected to gain the yen is likely to be the winner in this environment as both higher volatility and slower u s growth will likely encourage repatriation flows oxford economics noted the usd cad will continue to be influenced by oil prices global risk appetite trade policy developments and the broader u s dollar we think these risks are skewed in favor of usd cad correcting lower over a short to medium term horizon bank of america said in its note political uncertainty in australia ahead of new elections will weigh on the australian dollar in the medium term analysts said especially if it continues to be a drag on business and consumer confidence however analysts said they expect the aussie dollar to rise against the greenback around mid year as the fed is expected to restart its tightening cycle in the second half of 2019 yet the aud decline should be temporary as usd will reach its peak embark on the bear cycle from 2h19 onwards and in turn lift aud usd higher ing said
the u s china trade war isn t actually about soybeans and steel washington fears its iron grip over the post soviet world is waning thanks to china s new global initiatives by kei pritsker and sheng zhang february 04 2019 information clearing house meng wanzhou the chief financial officer of chinese telecommunications titan huawei appeared in canadian court on tuesday to fight her extradition to the united states if she is extradited she will face fresh charges issued by the u s justice department doj accusing meng and huawei of engaging in bank fraud and trade theft as well as violating u s sanctions against iran the doj s indictments come just two days before scheduled talks between the u s and china to negotiate an end to the trump administration s multi billion dollar trade war these new accusations which meng and huawei flatly deny will undoubtedly strain trade talks and u s china relations just a year ago huawei was scarcely an issue on americans minds americans happily bought goods with the familiar made in china mark huawei and china s alleged wrongdoings were thrust forward into the public discourse when u s president donald trump announced a 30 percent tariff on solar panel imports china being the u s s biggest source of imported solar panels launching what we now know as the u s china trade war what followed was intense scrutiny of all things chinese including products like huawei phones and telecommunications hardware since the beginning of his presidential campaign trump has railed against the u s trade deficit with china he claimed china was ripping off the united states and tariffs were the only thing that would make china trade fairly the deficit since the u s and china began trading is nearing 420 billion this is no small number but when compared with american student loan debt nearing 1 6 trillion and credit card debt over 1 05 trillion the china trade deficit becomes less significant furthermore most economists agree that trade deficits aren t inherently good or bad while chinese companies saw an increase in sales many don t see the benefits u s consumers see in the form of lower prices is trump actually waging a trade war to protect american consumers from unfair trade practices if trump cared about struggling people in this country he would not have backed the 2017 tax cut plan that eliminates the federal estate tax and the alternative minimum tax which are only paid by the super rich is trump a deficit hawk trying to limit waste and excess spending wherever possible including trade no trump reversed the course of the budget deficit since assuming office taking it to six year highs trump s cabinet is one of the wealthiest in recent memory filled with plutocrats hailing from goldman sachs private equity firms and good old inheritance wealth leaving no doubt the interests of average americans will go unrepresented are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter so what is it about china and huawei that has the trump administration endlessly obsessed if not an economic dispute and why is this conflict unfolding now china s peaceful rise after sino soviet relations collapsed over ideological and diplomatic disagreements in 1966 the strength of the world socialist movement had been split in half washington s diplomats sought to drive a wedge even further between their two enemies through a series of diplomatic trips first to china then to the soviet union in 1972 henry kissinger president richard nixon s secretary of state explained the american strategy dubbed triangular diplomacy very plainly in his book diplomacy america s bargaining position would be strongest when america was closer to both communist giants than either was to the other in other words kissinger wanted the soviet union and china to fight over the u s s diplomatic attention to be recognized as the capital of the world communist movement delegitimizing and eventually destroying each other in the process the inevitable outcome was that two sides of the triangle would ice out the third and cause it to lose power unable to trade with its industrialized former ally china was forced to confront its own underdevelopment while the 1949 revolution abolished feudal exploitation overthrew foreign control of china slashed illiteracy and nearly doubled life expectancy the country was still mostly agrarian and poor with the population growing so rapidly chinese leader deng xiaoping foresaw china s inability to provide an adequate standard of living and introduced a reform policy to industrialize the country deng explained his theory of socialism as follows if we don t do everything possible to increase production how can we expand the economy how can we demonstrate the superiority of socialism and communism we have been making revolution for several decades and have been building socialism for more than three nevertheless by 1978 the average monthly salary for our workers was still only 45 yuan and most of our rural areas were still mired in poverty can this be called the superiority of socialism that is why i insisted that the focus of our work should be rapidly shifted to economic development in short while it was crucial to create a more egalitarian society especially for women poor people and ethnic minorities equality was less meaningful if it meant sharing poverty equally the reforms opened up china to foreign investment capital to take advantage of the international market economy while being careful not to allow foreign capital to dictate the direction of the government this became known as socialism with chinese characteristics in order to reach this goal deng enacted a policy of technology transfers when china opened up diplomatic relations with a country it usually ushered in that relationship with a science and technology cooperation treaty for example the 1979 u s china science and technology cooperation agreement these agreements gave foreign capital and corporations access to china s vast market in return chinese companies would not need to expend capital reinventing technologies that had already been invented china has signed cooperation agreements with over one hundred countries through the china association for science and technology bringing rapid growth to china s tech sector the opening up policy brought heavy industry to china elevating china to the status of world superpower in 2010 china surpassed japan as the world s second largest economy with a gross domestic product of 5 trillion since then china s gdp has more than doubled to 12 trillion only 7 trillion behind the u s in accordance with deng s vision china s growth helped bring about the largest poverty reduction campaign in human history according to the world bank china has lifted over 800 million people out of poverty since 1978 reaching all of its millennium development goals and serves as a shining model for poverty reduction in developing countries united nations development program officials believe china will end rural poverty in 2020 china is also becoming the world s leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the city of shenzhen china is creating the world s first city with completely electric powered transportation shenzhen already has more electric buses than any american city has diesel buses and the model will soon be expanded across the country china spends more on improving its infrastructure than the u s and europe combined even trump compared u s infrastructure to that of a third world country making his constant china bashing difficult to understand the belt and road initiative and the made in china 2025 plan for the longest time the u s treated china as a subordinate country china was the butt of many jokes and treated like america s personal factory ironically henry kissinger s diplomatic maneuvers succeeded in accelerating the dissolution of the soviet union but planted the seeds for an independent china in the process china s domestic achievements have proved to the world that it doesn t need to submit to the u s s neoliberal model to prosper to many developing nations china s rise represents the first possibility of a multipolar world since the fall of the soviet union likewise in washington the realization that china poses a real threat to the u s dominated unipolar world order has set in its response an all out attack on china s belt and road initiative and made in china 2025 plan labeling china as a revisionist power under the guise of unfair trade practices and chinese cyber crime through decades of hard work the chinese people have made china the world s manufacturing hub recognizing china s unprecedented accomplishments in poverty reduction and sustainable development the developing world has logically turned to china not the u s to overcome their own challenges likewise china is now strong enough to forge an independent path whereas it once faced the threat of u s reprisal if it pursued its own national interest against the interests of foreign capital enter the belt and road initiative bri in 2013 chinese president xi jinping announced the project which has been described as one of the most ambitious engineering projects in human history the project aims to build infrastructure such as bridges highways railways and waterways across the world in order to increase economic cooperation investment and trade bri will involve 65 countries 62 percent of the world s population and 30 percent of world gdp despite its being in a very early stage western media has already tried to portray bri as china s attempt to conquer the world or gain leverage over small countries it seeks to exploit these accusations are impossible to disprove as the project is nowhere close to being finished what we can observe however is that the number of participants eager to join the project has steadily grown and investments continue to pour in it is clear that china s diplomatic approach has earned it respect and international legitimacy on the other hand with military might as its major means to project influence the u s empire has expanded primarily through military occupation and covert regime change since world war ii american expansionism has given us 20 30 million corpses through assaults on 37 different countries compare that to the people s liberation army which has deployed 60 000 soldiers to plant trees in an area roughly the size of ireland take your pick when the united states kills 30 muslims for every american killed in combat according to conservative estimates it makes sense that the arab league was enthusiastic about joining bri but not the iraq war unfortunately for washington china s military is too powerful for the u s military to invade the country or attempt a covert coup of the chinese communist party the trade war allows the united states to complicate china s foreign policy objectives for seemingly legitimate reasons trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum are intended to hurt chinese steel and aluminum producers companies crucial to china s ability to construct infrastructure necessary to build the new silk roads even more threatening to u s hegemony is the made in china 2025 plan announced by chinese premier li keqiang in 2015 made in china 2025 aims to promote the competitiveness of chinese companies in the fields of advanced industries the plan has the potential to challenge the american monopoly over core internet technologies especially the upcoming 5g wireless network which china is on track to complete before the u s through secret meetings the u s successfully lobbied australia and new zealand to ban huawei from their future 5g networks japan also agreed to ban huawei and the u s is lobbying italy the u k and germany to do the same the made in china 2025 plan goes hand in hand with bri bri participants expect to import state of the art chinese technology as well as export their own indigenous technology a sensible alternative to being forced to take in one of over 800 u s military bases in foreign countries the fundamental goal of the trade war is preserving u s hegemony and monopoly on advanced industries and to force china to sign a new version of the plaza accord an economic agreement which the u s pressured japan to sign on and caused japan s lost decade doing so prevents developing nations from leaving the u s s orbit so much for the free market and competition it still sounds like huawei is up to no good with all of the headlines using the words huawei spying and stealing in the same sentence many believe huawei must be up to something sinister even if it s not everything they ve been charged with however since the u s house intelligence committee published a report in 2012 advocating a u s ban on huawei and zte products asserting they pose a threat to national security the evidence to support the claim that huawei products are chinese spying devices simply isn t there after the government designated the chinese telecommunications companies as threats the u k government conducted its own investigation into the matter the u k cabinet office countered the u s s claims saying it had no concerns about huawei and zte s presence in the u k only 10 days after the house committee published its report the classified investigation into huawei and zte was leaked to reuters and showed no evidence to back up the claims of the report one of the whistleblowers even told reuters we knew certain parts of government really wanted evidence of active spying we would have found it if it were there only a month ago the german federal office for information security bsi conducted an investigation into the huawei spying claims facing pressure from the u s to follow its lead in banning huawei from the country the president of the bsi arne schönbohm told german media that there was no evidence to demonstrate a security risk posed by huawei how did the u s security apparatus counter this investigation by saying it doesn t need to provide evidence that huawei poses a security threat because the chinese government can potentially demand information from huawei at any time the most egregious aspect of the war on huawei is that amidst america s repeated failures to produce a shred of evidence that huawei is a front for chinese espionage there is documented proof that the u s government hacked into huawei s servers and monitored its communications as far back as 2007 the national security agency hacked into huawei s servers to find connections between huawei and the chinese government according to documents leaked by nsa whistleblower edward snowden you would think that if the world s most powerful intelligence apparatus had access to huawei s internal communications they would have found treasure troves of evidence proving an internal plot to spy on americans enough to ban huawei from every corner of the earth but no the 2007 nsa operation came up empty handed even more insulting is that it is more or less common knowledge in the united states thanks to edward snowden s nsa leaks that the u s government collects virtually all digital communications made by americans without a warrant so why isn t trump calling for an end to warrantless surveillance while all of this may come as a surprise to some with an understanding that the u s is trying to slander and stifle china s growth in front of the international community to preserve its global dominance it becomes clear that the u s doesn t need evidence it just needs to repeat falsehoods enough to get the world to believe it evolving war propaganda when the russian hacking hysteria reached its fever pitch russiagaters spent no time proving an individual or organization s documented ties to russia they chose to debate whether one s rhetoric was strong on russia or something a russian bot would say it did not matter whether the russian hacking accusations had any legitimacy because the intention was simply to associate all things russian with hacking malicious intent and anti american sentiment warhawks and deep state agents used this well cultivated xenophobia to pass off their empire building in syria and eastern europe as being tough on putin in almost the exact same fashion the u s china trade war has created a political environment in which it has become acceptable for the government and its adoring fans in the media to say whatever they wanted about china as long as it makes the audience uncomfortable about china virtually copying the russiagate story trump accused china of hacking the u s election only to tweet to the world that he was choosing to interfere in venezuelan politics by declaring opposition member juan guaido president of venezuela just two months later the level of sinophobia in american society is the highest it has been since 1972 and the most terrifying part is that this type of sinophobia is accepted by the u s government and the corporate media as political correctness rather than a racist bias that needs to be corrected and combated even today long after the supposed end of yellow peril chinese people are still portrayed as sneaky cunning spies hackers or technology thieves chinese products from the 5g project to huawei phones are portrayed as vehicles of chinese infiltration an article in the washington post even claimed that metro cars made in china can spy on the american public the aforementioned demonization of china not only distorts the american public s perception of china but it also serves as extremely destructive war propaganda the sinophobic propaganda misleads the american public to believe the economic problems in the u s are not caused by an economic system structured to siphon wealth from the poor to the rich but by chinese economic aggression the white house portrayed china as threatening the united states and the world in its report serving as the declaration of the trade war the u s department of defense similarly accused the chinese manufacturing industry and the supply chain as a national threat it is clear that if you are siding against huawei you are siding with institutions that have never had the good of the people or the truth in mind this narrative must be countered as it is being used prolong the ongoing trade war a war on china and the future of the developing world which severely undermines the interests of the american public especially the american working class update some glad talk both the chinese and u s delegations reported feeling positive about thursday s trade talks china has agreed to buy an additional 5 million soybeans from the u s this development is certainly a good sign but it is important to remember that no deal came out of this meeting only a single concession from china what s important is that the more sensitive issues of intellectual property and technology transfers are still unresolved which include the issues pertaining to huawei 5g and meng wanzhou u s tariffs on china are set to increase by 25 percent on march 1st if this deadline is missed it could set trade progress back even further than it is today while president trump is currently celebrating the progress on twitter keep in mind he considers unpredictability a part of his strategy china s top trade negotiators are in the u s meeting with our representatives meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides china does not want an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal they are correct i will be donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 31 2019 in june the chinese ministry of commerce lamented over the trump administration s use of tariffs as a means of forcing trade negotiations forward clearly flip flopping his stance and complicating trade negotiations similarly trump praised the outcome of the singapore u s dprk summit in june promising full north korean nuclear disarmament three months later north korea released a statement saying it would not unilaterally disarm because it did not trust that the united states and the trump administration would follow through on its end of the deal when negotiating with trump a lot can happen in a month in addition to the conflict between the two sides over technological issues both sides would face an even larger disagreement when discussing the so called structural issues the role of subsidies and state owned enterprises in the chinese economy as u s vice president mike pence declared in his speech the u s insists that china s state owned enterprises and subsidies are unfair threats to the u s and demands china to reform its economic structure but from china s perspective such a demand is not acceptable ideologically the existence of state owned enterprises is a crucial foundation of socialism with chinese characteristics and politically the economic structure of china is a non negotiable part of chinese sovereignty the chinese people would never accept having their own domestic development model dictated by foreign powers such a huge difference remains a very formidable challenge to the ongoing negotiation this article was originally published by mpm do you agree or disagree post your

periods this percentage equals invested capital divided by committed capital invested capital for this purpose is the sum of capital drawn from fund investors plus net borrowings outstanding under a fund level credit facility if any where such borrowings were made in lieu of drawing capital from fund investors 2 represents capital drawn from fund investors net of distributions to such investors of uninvested capital divided by committed capital the aggregate change in drawn capital for the three months ended december 31 2018 was 3 6 billion 3 accrued incentives fund level exclude non gaap incentive income previously recognized 4 unreturned drawn capital plus accrued preferred return reflects the amount the fund needs to distribute to its investors as a return of capital and a preferred return as applicable before oaktree is entitled to receive incentive income other than tax distributions from the fund 5 the internal rate of return irr is the annualized implied discount rate calculated from a series of cash flows it is the return that equates the present value of all capital invested in an investment to the present value of all returns of capital or the discount rate that will provide a net present value of all cash flows equal to zero fund level irrs are calculated based upon the actual timing of cash contributions distributions to investors and the residual value of such investor s capital accounts at the end of the applicable period being measured gross irrs reflect returns before allocation of management fees expenses and any incentive allocation to the fund s general partner to the extent material gross returns include certain transaction advisory directors or other ancillary fees fee income paid directly to us in connection with our funds activities we credit all such fee income back to the respective fund s so that our funds investors share pro rata in the fee income s economic benefit net irrs reflect returns to non affiliated investors after allocation of management fees expenses and any incentive allocation to the fund s general partner 6 multiple of drawn capital is calculated as drawn capital plus gross income and if applicable fee income before fees and expenses divided by drawn capital 7 fund data include the performance of the main fund and any associated fund of one accounts except the gross and net irrs presented reflect only the performance of the main fund certain fund of one accounts pay management fees based on cost basis rather than committed capital 8 legacy funds represent certain predecessor funds within the relevant strategy or product that have substantially or completely liquidated their assets including funds managed by certain oaktree investment professionals while employed at the trust company of the west prior to oaktree s founding in 1995 when these employees joined oaktree upon or shortly after its founding they continued to manage the fund through the end of its term pursuant to a sub advisory relationship between the trust company of the west and oaktree 9 management fees during the investment period are calculated on drawn capital or cost basis rather than committed capital as a result as of december 31 2018 management fee generating aum included only that portion of committed capital that had been drawn 10 aggregate irrs or totals are based on the conversion of cash flows or amounts respectively from euros to usd using the december 31 2018 spot rate of 1 14 11 the fund s partnership interests are divided into class a and class b interests with the class a interests having priority with respect to the distribution of current income and disposition proceeds the net irr for class a interests was 10 4 and class b interests was 9 2 the combined net irr for class a and class b interests was 9 8 12 the fund s partnership interests are divided into class a and class b interests with the class a interests having priority with respect to the distribution of current income and disposition proceeds the net irr for class a interests was 10 8 and class b interests was 10 5 the combined net irr for the class a and class b interests was 10 6 13 the irr is not considered

underwriting results for the year were positive despite significant catastrophe losses in 2018 comprehensive loss to shareholders and book value per share were impacted by declines in both our fixed income and equity portfolios driven by an increase in interest rates and unfavorable movements in the equity markets during 2018 our results were also impacted by a goodwill and intangible asset

loss estimates on the 2018 and 2017 catastrophes as of december 31 2018 represent our best estimate of losses based upon information currently available our estimates for these losses are based on claims received to date and detailed policy level reviews industry loss estimates output from both industry and proprietary models as well as a review of in force contracts these estimates are dependent on broad assumptions about coverage liability and reinsurance while we believe our reserves for the 2018 and 2017 catastrophes as of december 31 2018 are adequate we continue to closely monitor reported claims and will adjust our estimates of gross and net losses as new information becomes available the net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the 2018 and 2017 catastrophes were within our risk tolerance for events of this magnitude insurance segment the combined ratio for the insurance segment in 2018 was 94 including three points for the underwriting loss on the 2018 catastrophes compared to 97 including eight points for the underwriting loss on the 2017 catastrophes in 2017 the decrease in the 2018 combined ratio was driven by lower catastrophe losses partially offset by a less favorable prior accident years loss ratio although favorable development on prior years loss reserves in 2018 was comparable to 2017 the benefit to our prior years loss ratio was reduced given the impact of higher earned premiums in 2018 compared to 2017 the insurance segment s 2018 combined ratio included 502 3 million of favorable development on prior years loss reserves compared to 500 6 million in 2017 more favorable development on our workers compensation and marine and energy product lines was offset by less favorable development on our professional liability and property product lines the increase in favorable development on the marine and energy product lines was largely attributable to favorable development in 2018 related to the 2017 catastrophes in both 2018 and 2017 favorable development on prior years loss reserves occurred across several product lines but was most significant on our general liability workers compensation marine and energy and professional liability product lines reinsurance segment the combined ratio for the reinsurance segment in 2018 was 113 including 19 points for the underwriting loss on the 2018 catastrophes compared to 132 including 32 points for the underwriting loss on the 2017 catastrophes in 2017 the decrease in the 2018 combined ratio was driven by lower catastrophe losses and favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves in 2018 compared to adverse development in 2017 these decreases were partially offset by a higher expense ratio in 2018 compared to 2017 excluding the impact of underwriting losses related to the 2018 and 2017 catastrophes described above the current accident year loss ratio decreased primarily due to net favorable premium adjustments in 2018 compared to net unfavorable premium adjustments in 2017 the increase in the expense ratio was driven by the impact of lower assumed reinstatement premiums related to the 2018 catastrophes compared to the 2017 catastrophes and a lower benefit from ceding commissions partially offset by lower profit sharing expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 the reinsurance segment s 2018 combined ratio included 43 0 million of favorable development on prior years loss reserves compared to 7 8 million of adverse development on prior years loss reserves in 2017 in 2017 prior years loss reserves included 85 0 million of adverse development or nine points on the 2017 reinsurance segment combined ratio related to the decrease in the discount rate known as the ogden rate used to calculate lump sum awards in united kingdom u k bodily injury cases excluding the impact of the 2017 change in the ogden rate favorable development on prior years loss reserves decreased compared to 2017 due to less favorable development on our property product lines in 2018 including adverse development related to the 2017 catastrophes favorable development in 2018 was most significant on our marine and energy and surety product lines partially offsetting this favorable development was adverse development on our professional liability product lines in 2018 in 2017 adverse development resulting from the ogden rate

gross premium volume in our underwriting segments increased 10 in 2018 compared to 2017 the increase in gross premium volume was attributable to an increase in gross premium volume in our insurance segment partially offset by a decrease in gross premium volume in our reinsurance segment also impacting consolidated gross premium volume was 2 1 billion of gross premium written through our program services business acquired as part of the state national transaction which is not included in our underwriting segments substantially all gross premium written in our program services business was ceded to third parties in 2018 and 2017 gross premium volume in our insurance segment increased 15 in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by increased premiums from our new surety and collateral protection businesses both of which were acquired in 2017 as well as growth within our general and professional liability product lines and personal lines business gross premium volume in our reinsurance segment decreased 6 in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a large specialty quota share treaty entered into in the first quarter of 2017 that did not renew in 2018 as well as lower gross premium volume in our property product lines primarily due to contracts that did not renew these decreases were partially offset by growth in our surety product lines as well as higher gross premium volume in our general liability professional liability and worker s compensation product lines resulting from favorable premium adjustments and timing of renewals significant variability in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to individually significant contracts and multi year contracts net retention net retention of gross premium volume for our underwriting operations was 83 in 2018 and 84 in 2017 the decrease in net retention in 2018 was primarily driven by lower retention on our personal lines business within the insurance segment and an increase in property catastrophe reinsurance coverage purchases in 2018 compared to 2017 within our underwriting operations we purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance in order to manage our net retention on individual risks and enable us to write policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs earned premiums earned premiums for 2018 increased 11 compared to 2017 the increase in earned premiums was attributable to higher earned premiums in our insurance segment primarily driven by growth in gross premium volume in our general liability professional liability and marine and energy product lines the increase was also attributable to earned premiums within our new surety and collateral protection product lines acquired in 2017 these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower assumed reinstatement premiums related to the 2018 catastrophes compared to the 2017 catastrophes investing results net investment income for 2018 was 434 2 million compared to 405 7 million in 2017 the increase in 2018 was driven by an increase in short term investment income primarily due to higher short term interest rates and higher dividend income due to increased equity holdings net investment losses for 2018 were 437 6 million compared to 5 3 million in 2017 net investment losses in 2018 were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of equity securities of 425 6 million in 2018 which was attributable to unfavorable market value movements and a decline in the fair value of our investments in insurance linked securities funds ils funds which are managed by markel catco investment management ltd markel catco net investment losses in 2018 and 2017 included losses of 124 6 million and 52 0 million respectively on our investment in the ils funds these losses primarily resulted from decreases in the net asset value of the ils funds which were driven by the impact of losses from hurricanes harvey irma and maria and the 2017 wildfires in california on the underlying reinsurance contracts in which the ils funds are invested at december 31 2018 and 2017 the fair value of our investments in the ils funds was 58 2 million and 189 3 million respectively markel ventures we report the results of our markel ventures operations in our markel ventures segment this segment includes a diverse portfolio of businesses from different industries that offer various types of products and services to businesses and consumers the following table summarizes the results from our markel ventures segment years ended december 31 dollars in thousands 2018 2017

income to markel ventures earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda the increase in revenues from our markel ventures segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of costa farms in the third quarter of 2017 and brahmin in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was also attributable to higher sales volumes from certain of our products and services businesses operating income and ebitda from our markel ventures segment decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to 33 5 million of expense related to an internal investigation and remediation associated with the manufacture of products at one of our businesses and an impairment charge of 14 9 million related to intangible assets at this business both of which were recorded in the second quarter of 2018 additionally 2017 included insurance recoveries in excess of 2017 storm losses totaling 44 4 million related to hurricane irma partially offset by an increase in our estimate of contingent consideration payments in 2017 of 19 0 million net income to shareholders from our markel ventures segment decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of decreased operating income the impact of recording a one time tax benefit of 37 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 following the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja and as a result of higher interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 see income taxes below for a discussion of the tcja after considering the impact of the items discussed above operating income net income to shareholders and ebitda increased in 2018 as a result of having a full year of costa farms operations and higher sales volumes from certain of our businesses in 2018 compared to 2017 markel catco effective january 18 2019 as previously announced two senior executives of markel catco are no longer with the company we had accrued 64 3 million of incentive and retention compensation for the two individuals as of september 30 2018 of which 34 9 million was accrued as of december 31 2017 this accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and was reflected as a reduction to services and other expenses in our consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss also in the fourth quarter of 2018 we reduced the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets of the markel catco reporting unit to zero which resulted in an impairment charge of 179 0 million in light of governmental inquiries into loss reserves recorded in late 2017 and early 2018 at an entity managed by markel catco and taking into consideration the departure of two senior executives and certain redemption rights that are now being offered to investors in ils funds managed by markel catco markel catco s ability to maintain or raise capital has been adversely impacted as a result we performed an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets at the markel catco reporting unit as of december 31 2018 and determined this impairment charge was necessary interest expense and income taxes interest expense interest expense was 154 2 million in 2018 compared to 132 5 million in 2017 the increase in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to interest associated with our 4 30 unsecured senior notes and our 3 50 unsecured senior notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by the repayment of our 7 20 unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2017 income taxes the effective tax rate for 2018 is not meaningful due to the small pre tax loss for the year and a large non recurring item the effective tax rate for 2017 is also not meaningful due to a large non recurring item income tax expense was 122 5 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of 313 5 million in 2017 in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the tcja we recorded a one time tax benefit of 339 9 million this one time benefit from the tcja was attributable to the remeasurement of our u s deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases at the lower enacted u s corporate tax rate offset in part by the tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings during 2018 we decided to treat our most significant u k subsidiaries as domestic corporations for u s tax purposes as a result the earnings and profits from those subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested and we recorded a one time deferred tax charge of 103 3 million related to the book and tax basis differences attributable to those subsidiaries in addition to the large non recurring item mentioned above our income tax expense in 2018 differs from the tax benefit calculated at the statutory rate of 21 primarily as a result of nondeductible losses of 124 6 million on our investment in markel catco managed ils funds in 2018 partially offset by the impact of tax exempt investment income see investing results above for a discussion of these investment losses financial condition invested assets were 19 2 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 20 6 billion at december 31 2017 during 2018 we increased our holdings of fixed maturities and equity securities and reduced our holdings of short term investments and cash and cash equivalents equity securities comprised 30 of invested assets at december 31 2018 compared to 29 of invested assets at december 31 2017 fixed maturities represented 52 of our invested assets at december 31 2018 compared to 48 at december 31

securities of 2 6 billion net of deferred income taxes of 684 4 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings at december 31 2018 we held available for sale securities with gross unrealized losses of 134 0 million or less than 1 of invested assets at december 31 2018 our holding company held 2 6 billion of invested assets compared to 2 7 billion of invested assets at december 31 2017 the decrease in holding company invested assets is primarily due to cash used for acquisitions interest payments associated with our unsecured senior notes and loans and capital contributions made to our subsidiaries partially offset by dividends received from our subsidiaries net cash provided by operating activities was 892 9 million in 2018 compared to 858 5 million in 2017 net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 reflected higher net premiums collections in the insurance segment and lower payments for employee profit sharing compared to 2017 also reflected in net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was higher claims settlement activity in both of our underwriting segments compared to 2017 due in

competition on market trends and pricing the frequency and severity of man made and natural catastrophes including earthquakes fires and weather related catastrophes may exceed expectations are unpredictable and in the case of fires and weather related catastrophes may be exacerbated if as many forecast conditions in the oceans and atmosphere result in increased hurricane flood drought or other adverse weather related activity we offer insurance and reinsurance coverage against terrorist acts in connection with some of our programs and in other instances we are legally required to offer terrorism insurance in both circumstances we actively manage our exposure but if there is a covered terrorist attack we could sustain material losses emerging claim and coverage issues changing legal and social trends and inherent uncertainties in the loss estimation process can adversely impact the adequacy of our loss reserves and our allowance for reinsurance recoverables reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves primarily because of reliance upon the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies and the longer lapse of time from the occurrence of loss events to their reporting to the reinsurer for ultimate resolution changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book which is in runoff for example changes in assumptions and estimates of mortality longevity morbidity and interest rates could result in material increases in our estimated loss reserves for such business adverse developments in insurance coverage litigation or other legal or administrative proceedings could result in material increases in our estimates of loss reserves changes in the availability costs and quality of reinsurance coverage which may impact our ability to write or continue to write certain lines of business the ability or willingness of reinsurers to pay balances due may be adversely affected by industry and economic conditions deterioration in reinsurer credit quality and coverage disputes and collateral we hold may not be sufficient to cover a reinsurer s obligation to us after the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts any subsequent adverse development in the re assumed loss reserves will result in a charge to earnings regulatory actions can

capital markets and other factors economic conditions actual or potential defaults in municipal bonds or sovereign debt obligations volatility in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in market value of concentrated investments can have a significant impact on the fair value of our fixed maturity and equity securities as well as the carrying value of our other assets and liabilities and this impact may be heightened by market volatility economic conditions may adversely affect our access to capital and credit markets the effects of government intervention including material changes in the monetary policies of central banks to address financial downturns and economic and currency concerns the impacts that political and civil unrest and regional conflicts may have

adversely impact us including our ability to attract and retain business the amount of capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold and the availability and cost of capital changes in the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold which can vary significantly and is based on many factors outside our control losses from litigation and regulatory investigations and actions and a number of additional factors may adversely affect our markel ventures operations and the markets they serve and negatively impact their revenues and profitability including among others adverse weather conditions plant disease and other contaminants changes in government support for education healthcare and infrastructure projects changes in capital spending levels changes in the housing market liability for environmental matters volatility in the market prices for their products and volatility in commodity prices and interest and foreign currency exchange rates our premium

previously announced developments at markel catco the pending governmental inquiries into loss reserves recorded at an entity managed by markel catco in late 2017 and early 2018 the markel catco

gov j b pritzker inherited a 2 8 billion budget deficit the moment he stepped into office next year that deficit is projected to be 3 4 billion1 it s the same story every budget season but illinois budget crises could be a thing of the past if the state would adopt pension reform right size its union contracts and focus education spending on classrooms instead of on administrative bloat addressing these main cost drivers now could turn the state s perpetual deficits into surpluses in just five years creating the opportunity to pay off debt cut taxes and stimulate economic growth in fact if this plan had been implemented four years ago in fiscal year 2016 it might have protected taxpayers and services from the budget impasse over four years these structural spending reforms would have saved a total of 12 6 billion the bill backlog would be 4 billion lower than it is today which would have made it possible to pay off illinois bills entirely next year and cut the income tax the year after that without adding to the deficit in his first budget address pritzker has the chance to make structural spending reforms that will balance the state budget and put illinois on a path toward completely eliminating its debt with these structural spending changes illinois lawmakers could join the rescue and provide a deficit neutral tax cut as early as fiscal year 2024 or use surpluses to shore up the state s rainy day fund in other words illinois elected leaders can set themselves apart from decades of failed political leadership by stepping up to take heroic action they can be the champions who save illinois and do it in five years to effectively confront illinois fiscal crisis pritzker must address the cost drivers of illinois budget problems a clear eyed analysis of the math reveals which programs are driving overspending in illinois since fiscal year 2000 state spending on pensions has grown more than 677 percent while total state spending has risen by 68 percent pensions and government worker health insurance are growing faster than everything else preventing the state from making investments in programs residents value such as higher education k 12 education mental health services the social safety net and more by embracing commonsense solutions many of which have drawn bipartisan support in the past and could again pritzker and state leaders can accomplish what pessimistic illinoisans might have thought impossible the solutions are as follows 1 real lasting pension reform savings of 12 2 billion over five years a amend the state constitution so that it still protects earned benefits but allows changes in future benefit accruals then reintroduce reforms similar to those passed through the democratic supermajority controlled general assembly and signed by a democratic governor in 2013 b align responsibility for setting benefits with accountability for paying benefits at schools and universities 2 invest in classrooms over bureaucracy savings of 2 9 billion over five years a invest more money in classrooms students and teachers by reducing administrative bloat through school district consolidation b increase education funding to keep pace with inflation rather than the 350 million annual increases envisioned in the state s new evidence based education funding formula 3 ask government unions to play fair at the bargaining table savings of 4 2 billion over five years a limit automatic pay raises for some of the nation s highest paid state workers b right size group health insurance costs while maintaining quality care introduction illinois has achieved national notoriety for its decades of fiscal mismanagement and bad budgeting the mercatus center at george mason university recently released a report finding illinois fiscal health to be the worst in the nation 2 the state s 736 day budget impasse made national headlines and set a record for the longest a state has ever gone without passing a budget 3 for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 the state never enacted a full year comprehensive budget during this budget impasse illinois already worst in the nation credit rating dropped even farther 4 recently s p global ratings blamed the state s persistent crisis like budget environment for rating illinois bonds just one notch above junk 5 the fiscal and economic problems plaguing the prairie state are numerous and have built up over decades from bad public policy the largest single contributing factor to illinois problems though is a broken pension system and massive unfunded liability that recently set a record for the highest pension debt to revenue ratio on record for any u s state at 601 percent 6 a variety of factors contribute to illinois fiscal and economic problems such as massive outmigration and crushing property taxes but these crises can be traced back to the state s 133 billion in unfunded pension liabilities 7 meaningful pension reform is a necessary first step to solving other challenges facing illinoisans much like a family making a budget around their kitchen table putting illinois on a path to long term fiscal health requires addressing the structural cost drivers of the state s overspending the average american household spends just over 25 percent of their annual income on housing and just under 10 percent on food 8 imagine instead a young couple spending 50 percent of their annual income on housing and 20 percent on food because they rent an apartment they cannot afford and enjoy eating out at fine restaurants multiple times each week their remaining income would not be enough to cover their other expenses over time they would probably rack up credit card debt and would have trouble paying their bills putting their credit health at risk illinois is already there now imagine that same couple trying to balance their budget and pay off their debts without reducing their spending on fine dining or looking for a more affordable home they would be fooling themselves much like a family illinois cannot solve budget problems when politicians refuse to clearly look at the main causes of the state s poor fiscal health rapidly rising costs for pensions and government worker health insurance according to data from the national association of state retirement administrators illinois state and local governments spend nearly double the national average on pensions measured as a percentage of all state and local spending 9 this makes illinois government spending on pensions the highest in the nation 10 similarly a recent report from an analyst at j p morgan found illinois spends more than any other state on pensions retiree health care and interest on debt at 26 percent of revenue 11 worse the report found that to fully fund pensions and retiree health care at current benefit levels the state would need to increase spending on those items to 50 percent of all revenues 12 a clear eyed analysis of the math makes it clear which programs are driving overspending in illinois since fiscal year 2000 state spending on pensions has grown more than 677 percent and spending on government worker health insurance has grown nearly 244 percent meanwhile spending on k 12 education often touted as a top priority by illinois politicians is up slightly less than 73 percent all other spending including social services for the disadvantaged is up just over 18 percent total spending has risen by nearly 68 percent a clear line can be drawn between these structural cost drivers and the fact that since 2001 illinois has not had a truly balanced budget one in which annual revenues met or exceeded annual expenditures as a result of this long history of the state spending beyond its means the governor s office of management and budget or gomb predicts the state will end the year with more than 7 8 billion in unpaid bills which come with high interest penalties that must ultimately be paid by taxpayers 13 and yet the good news is the state s problems are solvable if policymakers can summon the will and the courage to realistically address the current situation and pursue commonsense solutions a good budget for illinois will create structural balance between revenue and expenditures in both the short run and long run create short term surpluses that can be used to pay off the state s bill backlog protect core government services such as education and social services put illinois on a path to make deposits to a rainy day reserve fund and provide tax relief to struggling residents all of this can be accomplished in five years by fiscal year 2024 with spending reforms that should be embraced by lawmakers from across the political spectrum these critical spending reforms are 1 real lasting pension reform a amend the state constitution so it still protects already earned benefits but allows changes in future benefit accruals then reintroduce reforms similar to those passed through the democratic supermajority controlled general assembly and signed into law by a democratic governor in 2013 b align responsibility for setting benefits with accountability for paying benefits at schools and universities 2 invest in classrooms over bureaucracy a invest more money in classrooms students and teachers by reducing administrative bloat through school district consolidation b increase education funding to keep pace with inflation rather than the 350 million annual increases envisioned in the state s new evidence based education funding formula 3 ask government unions to play fair at the bargaining table a limit automatic pay raises for some of the nation s highest paid state workers b right size group health insurance costs while maintaining quality care if these structural spending reforms are implemented illinois can eliminate its bill backlog by fiscal year 2024 and begin talking about reducing income taxes without having to cut social services curb education or create a budget deficit along with the first year bill backlog projection the baseline spending and revenue numbers above are from gomb s most recent five year projection the report notes that the u s is in the 10th year of one of the longest economic expansions in american history and that a yield curve inversion when the return on investment of short term bonds is higher than the yield on longer term bonds appears imminent both indicators seem to predict a national recession in the near term and gomb s revenue forecast therefore assumes a mild recession lasting from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 14 thus if the economy does not enter a recession annual budget surpluses will be even higher than shown here and tax relief can come sooner marijuana revenue is included in the projections because pritzker and illinois house speaker mike madigan have both said legalizing recreational marijuana is a priority 15 although pritzker has said he believes recreational marijuana revenues could be as high as 1 billion annually 16 the highest estimate from the marijuana policy project assuming taxation similar to colorado s and to provisions in a bill introduced in the illinois senate in 2017 is 700 million annually 17 marijuana revenues are then assumed to grow at 2 percent annually which is the long range inflation target of the federal reserve and the expectation of the econometrics firm ihs markit used by gomb for revenue projections 18 to achieve these budgetary savings and improve illinois foundational budget making procedures pritzker must realistically assess the state budget and break with illinois status quo of deferring payment and kowtowing to special interest groups real lasting pension reform 12 2 billion over 5 years the most critical single aspect of any good budget plan in illinois is meaningful pension reform to put the state on a trajectory where pension contributions are significantly lower in the short term but also sufficient to eliminate the state s unfunded liability more quickly than planned under current law the state has at least 133 billion in pension debt across the five state systems which doesn t even include local government pension debt pensions as a share of the general revenue budget have been dramatically increasing for decades and will continue to take up more than a quarter of the state budget even if the state s optimistic assumptions such as high investment returns and low growth in salaries and life expectancy hold true due to a 2015 illinois supreme court decision declaring unchangeable all past and future pension benefits under the contract in effect at the start of a worker s employment the only realistic path forward on pension reform starts with a constitutional amendment 19 a constitutional amendment must be approved by three fifths majorities of both houses of the illinois general assembly and then be approved by voters in the next general election in november 2020 the governor does not need to sign resolutions for constitutional amendments 20 but pritzker s support for such an amendment could be critical in getting the legislature to act fortunately the general assembly does not need to wait until a pension amendment is approved by voters to start saving taxpayers money constitutional amendment protecting both taxpayers and retirees changes to slow the growth in future pension benefits require a constitutional amendment however the general assembly maintains the legal authority to reduce annual contributions to the pension system and has done so in the past in other words state lawmakers could pass a budget that funds the pension systems at levels sufficient to reach full funding under the system that would be put in place following a successful amendment pursuing pension savings in this way would allow immediate savings and also inform future voters about the consequences of approving or not approving a constitutional amendment this would help voters make an informed choice and make passage of the amendment more likely lawmakers should look to the reform effort in 2013 encapsulated in senate bill 1 for examples of benefit changes that could solve the state s pension problem 21 the plan was passed through a supermajority democrat controlled general assembly and signed by democratic former gov pat quinn five years ago under that reform bill no current worker would have received less than she is currently promised and no retiree would have seen her monthly check decrease the reform concepts modifying cost of living adjustments increasing retirement ages for younger workers and capping the maximum pensionable salary would have only affected the rate of future benefit accruals several states already create a legal distinction wherein earned pension benefits are protected but future accruals remain open to change including louisiana hawaii and michigan the 2013 reforms were imperfect mostly because they did not create a sustainable and affordable retirement system in which new hires would be required to participate under new rules the bill had other technical flaws as well still sb 1 would have had dramatic and positive effects on the state budget if the illinois supreme court had not struck down sb 1 the state would have saved between 1 1 billion and 1 4 billion per year from fiscal year 2016 to 2019 the four budget years under former illinois gov bruce rauner savings of this magnitude could have prevented the budget impasse between rauner and madigan thereby also preventing the resulting automatic cuts to higher education and social services a new pension contribution schedule should be built on the following concepts which are similar to those in sb 1 increasing the retirement age for younger workers to bring them in line with private sector retirement ages capping maximum pensionable salaries to limit excessive pensions replacing permanent compounding benefit increases with true cost of living adjustments or colas implementing cola holidays to allow inflation to catch up to past benefit increases ensuring government worker retirements are predictable and sustainable going forward to achieve that all newly hired employees should be automatically enrolled in defined contribution retirement plans similar to what s overwhelmingly used in the private sector and what is already offered to state university employees these changes would apply to existing workers and retirees but only to future benefits the state already implemented a tier 2 pension system for workers hired after jan 1 2011 tier 2 pensioners have more reasonable retirement ages higher employee contributions a cap on maximum pensionable salary and a cola indexed to inflation 22 the state should move to treat everyone equally putting all current plan participants on the same benefits package with certain changes such as requiring cola holidays for those who have gained the most from years of benefit increases in excess of inflation a contribution schedule based on these reforms could save more than 1 1 billion during each of the next four years according to actuarial projections at the time savings would fall below 1 billion for the next four fiscal years but then rise again and continue to rise thereafter the temporary decrease in savings still leaves the state saving between 715 million and 981 million for those years the cause of the decrease is that sb 1 also increased the funding target to 100 percent from 90 percent and used an actuarial funding method that is in line with best practices set by the actuarial standards board which publishes uniform actuarial standards of practice 23 the illinois state actuary part of the office of the auditor general has consistently recommended adopting a funding plan in line with generally accepted actuarial principles specifically the recommendation is for the state to move toward a repayment schedule that targets 100 percent funding during a period of no more than 20 years 24 according to the state actuary current funding practices violate actuarial standard of practice no 4 measuring pension obligations and determining pension plan costs or contributions 25 sb 1 would have fixed that deficiency between fiscal years 2016 and 2045 sb 1 would have reduced total contributions by 145 billion without taking away a penny from any retired worker or reducing the annuity of any current worker aligning responsibility with accountability a second way illinois can see immediate pension savings would be to realign the cost of paying for normal costs the pension cost of an additional year of work so that the one responsible for setting benefit levels is accountable for paying the bill under the status quo k 12 and state university administrators negotiate salary and health benefits which form the basis for pension payments and retiree health costs but the state pays the bill that creates a misalignment between responsibility and accountability reducing pressure to keep compensation affordable for taxpayers in other words realigning future pension costs for schools and universities would save money for the state and encourage administrators to control the costs of pensions in the long run through more responsible collective bargaining rauner proposed this idea in each of his budget addresses 26 madigan also supported the idea in 2012 27 and said the change was inevitable as recently as 2013 28 if phased in over four years to allow schools and universities time to adjust pension savings would be 480 million in the first year and rise to nearly 2 billion by the fourth year realigning responsibility to pay for pension benefits in this way would only increase each district s payroll costs by about 2 5 percent per year on average 29 the state would remain responsible for making payments on the unfunded portion of the pension liability so schools would be paying only the new annual cost of pensions still school districts should be empowered to balance their own budgets more easily through relief from unfunded mandates 30 school district consolidation and some local sharing of recreational marijuana revenues as has been done in colorado 31 pritzker has also endorsed a gambling expansion in the state the commission on government forecasting and accountability or cogfa estimates that more gaming could generate between 75 million and 200 million in additional revenue 32 nearly all of that new revenue would go to local sources with only 12 million going to the state according to cogfa testimony about a gambling expansion bill in spring 2018 33 finally schools can find savings to help absorb the new cost by ending the practice of teacher pension pick ups an analysis of the most recent teacher salary study from the illinois state board of education or isbe shows that 514 of 860 school districts that responded to isbe s most recent teacher salary survey or 59 percent picked up some or all of the employee share of pension contributions 34 in 21 illinois school districts teachers contribute nothing at all to their own retirement taxpayers simply cannot afford to offer this perk any longer additional savings of 238 million in year 1 can be found by asking schools and universities to pay the cost of another special perk for public education employees retiree health care for life this figure is obtained by taking the 234 million of savings proposed in rauner s fiscal year 2019 budget and assuming 2 percent inflation 35 an analysis from mercer a human resources consulting firm found in 2011 that offering retiree health care for life is rare in both the public and private sectors with fewer than 25 percent of large employers offering the perk and very few small employers and that the prevalence of the perk is declining 36 as with pension benefits schools and universities should be accountable for costs they create if they want to provide retiree health care for life investing in classrooms over bureaucracy 2 9 billion over 5 years pritzker has made clear his intention to spend more money on k 12 education 37 trying to improve educational outcomes and the education system in illinois is a valuable goal getting more money into classrooms is part of the answer for achieving this goal money spent on instruction investing in high quality teachers and classroom supplies could enable students to learn more and be better prepared for college and careers however there are better ways to put more money into classrooms than spending inordinate amounts of new money on k 12 education in absolute terms redirecting a significant amount of education spending to classrooms from administration is one of the chief ways illinois could help children and support teachers more directly by combining school district consolidation with technical changes to the state s new funding formula the state could make significant additional investments in classrooms by growing state spending at the rate of inflation rather than the 350 million envisioned under current law 38 in 2017 rauner signed into law a new funding formula for state spending on k 12 education 39 the formula is intended to make the distribution of state education dollars to school districts more equitable with most new money going to districts with high rates of poverty low local property wealth and high numbers of at risk students the formula works by first assigning a unique adequacy target to each school district the adequacy target is the amount of money the formula envisions is needed to provide a quality education given the characteristics of the school district factors include the percentage of students in a district who are poor or learning disabled because such students often require additional attention and resources next the formula assigns each school a local capacity target value which is supposed to represent the amount of money available from local revenue sources given the property wealth of the district 40 finally while no district gets less than it did prior to the bill s passage each school is assigned to a funding tier from 1 to 4 tier 1 schools get the vast majority of new education dollars no district gets less than they got prior to the bill s passage and tier 4 districts get the least 41 an analysis of the first year of data made available by isbe shows that 37 percent of illinois districts were classified as tier 1 41 percent tier 2 6 percent tier 3 and 17 percent tier 4 42 the formula also envisions increasing total k 12 education spending by 350 million per year 43 illinois administrative waste in k 12 education while the goal of increased education spending is good pouring more money into the state s education system as it exists today will mean a poor return on investment for students and taxpayers alike instead pritzker should support reforms such as school district consolidation not consolidating any schools themselves but the top layer of administrative overhead at the district level in order to reduce the amount of bureaucratic bloat and waste in education spending if coupled with meaningful school district consolidation lawmakers can make significant additional investments in classrooms students and teachers without increasing the burden on the state budget or taxpayers by growing k 12 spending at 2 percent per year the long run expected rate of inflation instead of the 350 million envisioned under current law pritzker can save 2 9 billion in five years while improving educational outcomes for students and increasing teacher pay illinois currently spends more per student than any of its neighboring states or the national average but achieves outcomes that are middling at best and well below what neighboring states achieve with less spending per student if illinois reduced its spending to the estimated national average of 11 989 per student in fiscal year 2017 it would have spent roughly 8 5 billion less 44 meanwhile neighboring states are spending between 2 380 and 4 125 less per pupil to achieve overall better results for their students a major reason for this disconnect between per student spending and educational outcomes is that illinois spends too much on general administration and employee benefits much of which goes to high salary administrators according to u s census bureau definitions 45 general administration costs are those for the board of education and executive administration meaning superintendents along with their staffs and expenses this spending category is distinct from school administration or spending for the principal and administrative staff within the school employee benefit expenditures are for money spent on compensation other than salaries or wages such as retirement coverage and health insurance costs illinois spends too much money on school district bureaucracy which rarely interacts with students and parents and which performs duties that could be consolidated or picked up by teachers and administrators within the schools themselves much of this bureaucracy would be unnecessary but for the numerous unfunded mandates placed on schools which were mentioned earlier as an opportunity for local schools to save money in fact illinois serves far fewer students per school district compared to other large states those with student populations greater than 1 million as well as compared to the national average 46 studies taking into account multiple variables show better outcomes from leaner top down administration measured by the number of students served per school district likely because it means more money is making it to the classroom 47 illinois has far too many small school districts serving too few students the state also has too many separate high school and elementary districts considering that unit districts are the most efficient as measured by per student spending to solve this problem pritzker should lobby for a school district consolidation commission the commission should be given a goal such as consolidating districts in a way to reach the same number of students served per district on average as virginia or as the national average the goal would be to reach a statewide average not a mandate on each district and local educators and parents should have their voices heard by the commission then once the commission has finalized recommendations those recommendations should go directly to voters for approval on a ballot referendum the exact savings from school district consolidation will depend on how aggressive a target is set for the commission if the target is 210 districts per the virginia model the elimination of 642 districts would mean a 75 percent reduction in administrative overhead an analysis of isbe s educator employment information database for 2017 shows that the state has 1 063 administrators with the word superintendent in their title a category including assistant regional superintendents assistant associate district superintendents district superintendents and regional superintendents there are another 1 007 k 12 education employees with the title general administrator or general supervisor 48 reporting of salary and especially benefits for these individuals is incomplete in the database but isbe data show the total cost of employing these general administrators is at least 277 4 million annually given available data a 75 percent reduction in these costs would mean 208 million more in education dollars for classrooms annually as a rough estimate of potential savings resulting from reducing administrative bloat 49 final savings would likely be even higher as schools could sell excess property from former district buildings as well as collect property taxes on those now private sector lots it is worth noting that democratic former gov pat quinn supported school district consolidation 50 promoting equity in the funding formula along with pushing for significant school district consolidation pritzker should fix certain technical flaws of the education funding formula that run contrary to its purpose of sending more education dollars to the schools most in need two reforms in particular are required first the education formula adds 742 of central office investments per k 12 student to each school district s adequacy target 51 this incentivizes more spending on administration regardless of need and discourages local districts from finding ways to be more efficient by spending less on administration per student in 2017 there were over 9 000 school administrators in illinois who made 100 000 or more per year each of these administrators is expected to receive 3 million or more during the course of her retirement due to generous taxpayer funded pensions 52 the growth of these administrative positions has far exceeded the growth in the student population from 1992 to 2015 nonteaching and administrative staff in illinois grew by 49 percent this was almost 4 5 times as fast as the growth in the k 12 student body population which grew by only 11 percent during that same period if the growth in nonteaching and administrative staff had been the same as student growth illinois would have saved 750 million annually from 1992 to 2009 taxpayers would have needed to support 33 000 fewer such employees and their pensions 53 reducing the number of school districts to a level more closely resembling similarly sized states would help reduce the number of these expensive administrative positions but schools also should not be awarded additional taxpayer dollars that encourage adding unnecessary administrative positions second pritzker should ask the general assembly to delete a trigger provision that was added to the funding formula the provision states if at any time the responsibility for funding the employer normal cost of teacher pensions is assigned to school districts then that amount shall be added to the calculation of the district s adequacy target 54 this provision undermines the purpose of the funding formula by potentially prioritizing education dollars for the wealthiest school districts which tend to have the highest salaries and therefore the highest pension benefits 55 in other words if the state ever properly aligns accountability and responsibility to pay for pensions without removing the trigger provision wealthy districts would be moved up the funding tier as the normal cost of their pensions inflated their adequacy target by making these technical fixes in the state s funding formula and pursuing significant school district consolidation pritzker can increase spending on k 12 education by less than current law assumes while still improving education outcomes sending proportionally more money to classrooms would increase the value obtained for students and teachers more than merely dumping money into the existing bureaucracy heavy system asking government unions to play fair at the bargaining table 4 2 billion over 5 years while pritzker received the endorsement of the american federation of state county and municipal employees during his campaign for governor 56 he nevertheless must ask the union for changes to make the next contract more affordable than the last one this is essential to balance the budget and put illinois on a path toward long term fiscal health right sizing group health insurance costs illinois state workers receive platinum level health insurance according to classifications from the state s health care exchange 57 at relatively little cost to themselves under benefits provided in the now expired contract with the state as of 2016 the average afscme worker paid just 23 percent of their total annual health care costs while taxpayers subsidized the remaining 77 percent as of 2015 when the state contract expired and under which the state still operates until a new contract is signed state workers on average paid 2 904 in annual premiums and 1 548 for out of pocket expenses such as deductibles and co pays while the state paid 14 880 per worker 58 afscme workers paid just 16 percent of the annual premium costs as of 2016 59 while private sector employees with employer sponsored health benefits pay on average 31 percent of premium costs for family plans not even including out of pocket costs according to a 2017 study by the henry j kaiser family foundation 60 workers in private sector firms with many low wage workers pay even more an average of 37 percent of their family coverage premiums 61 a previously proposed plan would have right sized group employee health insurance costs by bringing them more in line with the private sector 62 the plan would have created three tiers of insurance one with higher premiums one with higher out of pocket costs and a mixed plan each of the plans would have increased the employee share to 40 percent on average 63 if pritzker were to revive this offer to right size health insurance costs for state workers he could save taxpayers 477 million in year 1 and 2 5 billion during the course of five years one option to achieve these savings would be to simply negotiate them with afscme but the general assembly also has the power to implement the change a bill proposed last year senate bill 2680 would have removed health care coverage from the subjects of collective bargaining as long as average employee costs remained below 40 percent annually 64 the bill died in the senate but could be revived in the upcoming legislative session to make sure health care costs are controlled regardless of who occupies the governor s office 65 limiting automatic raises for some of the nation s highest paid government workers illinois state workers are now the second highest paid in the nation adjusting for cost of living and their wages have risen 43 percent from 2005 to 2015 compared to just 11 percent for private sector illinoisans according to wirepoints 66 a study by the pew charitable trusts in 2018 found that overall personal income growth in the land of lincoln is tied for second worst in the nation since the great recession 67 a major reason for this poor private sector income growth is income tax increases in illinois in 2011 and 2017 68 which have been used to prop up the state s overspending including on public employee compensation just two years ago in 2016 illinois state workers were the highest paid in the nation adjusted for cost of living 69 it s possible that would still be the case if not for a contract dispute between rauner and afscme 70 as a result of that dispute afscme has not been receiving automatic raises or step increases since their last contract expired on june 30 2015 71 unfortunately for taxpayers the union has been able to use legal mechanisms to delay the implementation of a new contract for rauner s entire term if pritzker gives in to the union s entire list of demands it presented to rauner s team it would cost taxpayers an additional 3 billion over the course of the contract 72 just one aspect of their contract demands the resumption of automatic pay raises would cost 1 6 billion over the next five years 73 the cost is highest in the first year when workers could be paid for past step increases despite the lack of a contract under rauner for one of his first official acts in office pritzker announced jan 15 that he will grant automatic pay raises also known as step increases to illinois state workers for the second half of fiscal year 2019 his move will likely cost state taxpayers around 100 million based on previous gomb projections 74 however the move is prospective only because it does not address the dispute over potential backpay during rauner s term as governor pritzker can still achieve significant savings by continuing to fight the backpay issue and by negotiating a new contract that does not include automatic raises 75 the costs of automatic pay raises and cadillac health insurance do not even include other benefits demanded by afscme such as overtime starting at 37 5 hours worked weekly 76 although the union endorsed pritzker illinois new governor must ask afscme to play fairly at the bargaining table and not revive automatic raises instead pritzker should offer afscme a benefit that is affordable and encourages hard work such as merit pay and incentive bonuses 77 democratic former gov pat quinn also supported changes to control the state s group health insurance costs as well as a wage freeze 78 pritzker can deliver a more reasonable and cost effective contract for taxpayers by starting with these two commonsense savings ideas without even going after other perks such as accelerated overtime pay and time off for union work 79 budget process reform to keep illinois on the right track aside from the dollars and cents of budget making illinois should also look to reform its broken budget process that has contributed to such bad budgeting outcomes for taxpayers 80 this will ensure spending restraint is maintained in the long term and will prevent problems from recurring in coming decades it is easy to blame elected leaders for the state s fiscal health and that blame is not misplaced historically illinois lawmakers have shown a policy preference for overspending and fiscal irresponsibility however there is a less well known culprit that is equally important and potentially more pernicious the budget process itself expert literature shows the budget process is an important contributor to budget substance 81 states with different laws and procedures around budget making have been able to enforce fiscal discipline on their lawmakers and avoid many of the issues plaguing illinois 82 these problems include the worst funded public pension system in the nation billions of dollars of unpaid bills the nation s lowest municipal bond rating a tax burden that is crippling the state economy and a years long outmigration crisis the following aspects of illinois budget system are particularly problematic 1 inherently unreliable revenue estimates which are a source of political conflict and undermine the starting point of budget negotiations 83 2 poor savings habits and the lack of a sufficient rainy day fund make illinois vulnerable to fiscal shocks 84 3 reliance on short term borrowing and fund sweeps for annual operating needs undermines the long term sustainability of government spending 85 4 bad accounting practices for the budget process deny taxpayers transparency and lawmakers the information they need to make good decisions by using cash based accounting rather than full accruals or generally accepted accounting principles or gaap accounting the state is able to keep spending off the books until a bill is actually paid rather than when a cost is incurred 86 these issues are interconnected and mutually reinforcing by demanding change in the budget process taxpayers can put illinois on a path to fiscal discipline for decades to come lawmakers should immediately enact the following reforms to fix the four key issues with the budget process 1 replace faulty revenue estimates with a reliable starting point a adopt a spending cap tying annual growth in spending to a 10 year average of economic growth this would improve the accuracy of budget planning and reduce political conflict in negotiations rather than relying on imperfect revenue estimates to plan spending the five year plan presented above would spend within the means imposed by such a cap b revenue estimates should still be required and should statutorily require automatic averaging between cogfa and gomb estimates rather than relying on the general assembly to pass a resolution 2 to address the paltry rainy day fund and volatile taxes surpluses resulting from the spending cap should be used to do the following a pay down the backlog of unpaid bills b rebuild the budget stabilization fund to at least 5 percent of annual expenditures simultaneously lawmakers should strengthen restrictions on when funds can be withdrawn c cut income tax rates to provide tax relief and improve the predictability of illinois tax portfolio 87 3 avoid one time revenue infusions by limiting lawmakers ability to rely on spending gimmicks without creating a patchwork of constitutional carveouts a redefine revenue to exclude debt refinancing and fund sweeps b avoid issuing bonds to pay for yearly operations or pension costs 4 end bad accounting practices that hide the true size of deficits a adopt accruals based budgeting so that budget balance is defined by including the present value of assets and the long term cost of liabilities b strengthen the balanced budget provision of the illinois constitution to require end of year balance rather than just prospective balance expert literature shows that this is the most effective spending constraint among state budget processes 88 if pritzker and the general assembly adopted these comprehensive solutions they could fix illinois broken budget process and put the state on a path to a more stable financially responsible and secure future conclusion pritzker has an opportunity to fix illinois finances eliminate its debt and deliver tax relief to overburdened taxpayers doing so requires only political courage and a realistic assessment of the status quo if one examines the math of illinois budget the path to reform becomes clear spending on pension benefits and government worker health insurance is crowding out other priorities money spent on k 12 education is being siphoned away from the classroom to a top heavy bureaucracy and demands by afscme would make the state s contract with its employees unaffordable fortunately solutions exist to each of these problems the cost drivers of illinois debt and deficits can be reined in through fair and thoughtful reforms that warrant bipartisan support taxpayers in illinois are overburdened they deserve certainty and relief it s up to pritzker and the general assembly to face the crisis and deliver on the opportunities

there they go again and now they re back note on august 5 2011 one month after i started blogging i wrote the following post responding to an op ed in the wall street journal by david malpass an op ed remarkable for its garbled syntax analytical incoherence and factual misrepresentations all in all quite a performance today exactly seven and a half years later we learn that the estimable mr malpass currently serving as undersecretary for international affairs in the u s treasury department is about to be nominated to become the next president of the world bank in today s wall street journal david malpass who according to the bio used to be a deputy assistant undersecretary of the treasury in the reagan administration and is now president of something called encima global llc his position as chief economist at bear stearns was somehow omitted carries on about the terrible damage inflicted by the fed on the american economy the u s is practically alone in the world in pursuing a near zero interest rate and letting its central bank leverage to the hilt to buy up the national debt by choosing to pay savers nearly nothing the fed s policy discourages thrift and is directly connected to the weakness in personal income where mr malpass gets his information i haven t a clue but looking at the table of financial and trade statistics on the back page of the july 16 edition of the economist i see that in addition to the united states japan switzerland hong kong and singapore had 3 month rates less than 0 5 britain canada and saudi arabia had rates between 0 5 and 1 the official rate of the swedish riksbank is now 2 5 but it held the rate at 0 5 until economic conditions improved as for malpass s next sentence where to begin i won t dwell on the garbled syntax but even if that were its intention the fed is obviously not succeeding in discouraging thrift as private indebtedness has been falling consistently over the past three years the question is whether it would be good for the economy if people were saving even more than they are now and the answer to that clearly is not unless there was a great deal more demand by private business to invest than there is now why is business not investing despite repeated declamations about the regulatory overkill and anti business rhetoric of the obama administration no serious observer doubts that the main obstacle to increased business investment is that expected demand does not warrant investments aimed at increasing capacity when existing capacity is not being fully utilized and for the life of me i cannot tell what it is that mr malpass thinks is connected to the weakness in personal income nor am i am so sure that i know what weakness in personal income even means from here malpass meanders into the main theme of his tirade which is how terrible it is that we have a weak dollar one of the fastest most decisive ways to restart u s private sector job growth would be to end the fed s near zero interest rate and the bush obama weak dollar policy as presidents reagan and clinton showed sound money is a core growth strategy the fastest and most effective way to tell world capital that the u s is back in business mr malpass served in the reagan administration so i would have expected him to know something about what happened in that administration obviously my expectations were too high according to the federal reserve s index of trade weighted dollar exchange rate the dollar exchange rate stood at 95 66 when reagan took office in january 1981 and at 90 82 when reagan left office 8 years later now it is true that the dollar rose rapidly in reagan s first term reaching about 141 in may 1985 but it fell even faster for the remainder of reagan s second term so what exactly is the lesson that mr malpass thinks that the reagan administration taught us certainly the reduction in dollar exchange rate in reagan s second term was much greater than the reduction in the exchange rate so far under mr obama from about 83 to 68 then going in for the kill mr malpass warns us not to repeat japan s mistakes only japan after the bursting of its real estate bubble in 1990 has tried anything similar to u s policy for close to a decade tokyo pursued a policy of amped up government spending high tax rates zero interest rates and mega trillion yen central bank buying of government debt the weak recovery became a deep malaise with japan s own monetary officials warning the u s not to follow their lead funny mr malpass seems to forget that japan also pursued the sound money policy that he extols consider the foreign exchange value of the yen in april 1990 the yen stood at 159 to the dollar last week it was at 77 to the dollar sounds like a strong yen policy to me is that the example mr malpass wants us to follow actually the wall street journal in its editorial today summed up its approach to economic policy making rather well the keynesians have fired all their ammo and here we are going south maybe now president obama should consider everything he s done to revive the american economy and do the opposite that s what it comes down to for the journal if obama is for it we re against it simple as that leave your brain at the door

growth of our comfort core innerspring and other higher dollar value units dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected accordingly beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we will stop reporting unit growth for innersprings and box springs we will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units i ll now turn the call over to matt advertisement advertisement matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you karl and good morning everyone in 2018 we generated operating cash flow of 440 million which once again included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance we continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10 6 we repatriated 141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter bringing our full year total to 314 million in november we declared a 0 38 per share quarterly dividend a 6 increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017 our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60 for 2018 at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50 to 60 beginning in 2019 in conjunction with the increasing leverage from the ecs acquisition we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50 of adjusted earnings we expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ecs acquisition advertisement advertisement at friday s closing price of 14 97 our current yield is 3 7 which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the s p 500 s dividend aristocrats for the full year we repurchased 2 6 million shares of our stock at an average price of 43 10 and issued 1 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises during the year we acquired phc and two small tl component operations we also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities primarily in automotive and bedding we increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from 800 million to 1 2 billion in connection with the funding of the ecs transaction we ended the year with debt at 1 9 times our trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda after completing the ecs acquisition in january our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3 5 times we are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and expect to deleverage each to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months ebitda of approximately 2 5 times by temporarily suspending share repurchases reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt we asses on overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three year basis our target is to achieve tsr in the top one third of the s p 500 over the long term which we believe will require an average tsr of 11 to 14 per year while our recent performance has not met this target we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal over time advertisement advertisement sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ecs acquisition we also expect sales growth in automotive u s spring aerospace and hydraulic cylinders partially offset by planned declines in fashion bed and home furniture related to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in adjustable bed 2019 sales are expected to be 4 95 billion to 5 1 billion or up 16 to 19 over last year ecs should add approximately 675 million to sales in addition to ecs same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3 earnings per share are expected to be 2 35 to 2 55 including approximately 0 10 per share of restructuring related cost therefore adjusted eps is expected to be 2 45 to 2 65 reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation partially offset by higher tax rate as we have previously stated the ecs acquisition is expected to be neutral to eps in 2019 eps guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24 versus 20 in 2018 this higher rate reflects the non reoccurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018 a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019 the impact of tcja executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ecs transaction we expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximate 210 million net interest of approximately 95 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million based upon this guidance framework our 2019 full year adjusted ebit margin should be 10 8 to 11 2 while we do not issue specific quarterly guidance we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019 we expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ecs inventory and we expect year over year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year cash from operations should approximate 550 million in 2019 capital expenditures should be near 195 million for the year and dividends should require 205 million of cash our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50 of adjusted earnings our long term priorities for use of cash remain one organic growth involving capital expenditure and working capital investments two dividends three strategic acquisitions and four share repurchases as previously stated we will temporarily suspended share repurchases reduce acquisition spending and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth in dividends with those comments i ll turn the call back over to wendy wendy m watson director investor relations that concludes our prepared remarks we thank you for your attention and we ll be glad to answer any of your questions in order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant if you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well michelle we re ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse please proceed with your question chris kalata credit suisse analyst hi this is chris kalata on for susan thanks for taking our questions first question is just on the industrial products segment you ve been able to realize the significant amount of pricing in the second half of 2018 so i was just wondering how much additional pricing are you expecting this year and what benefit could that have to your margins perry e davis executive vice president chris we this is perry davis we definitely saw a run up last year in both scrap and particularly in rod pricing the we feel at this point in time that we are pretty much at the peak we in fact saw some slight deflation in scrap inputs in january which is a little uncommon i don t believe we ve seen a january decrease in scrap pricing since 2006 but overall we believe that over the next few months our input cost and rod prices will remain relatively constant chris kalata credit suisse analyst okay thanks and then just my second question does your full year guidance that include the impact of the a full 25 tariff environment and are you able to quantify what the incremental headwinds would be between the 10 and 25 karl g glassman president and chief executive officer chris this is karl the answer to that is no we don t know what to expect as it relates to tariff we assume that if the tariffs aren t in fact increased to 25 we ll pass them through but in our top line forecast they do not include the expansion of tariff activity we just don t know chris kalata credit suisse analyst okay thanks for that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bobby griffin with raymond james financial please proceed with your question bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst yes thank you and good morning everybody and i appreciate you guys taking my question karl g glassman president and chief executive officer good morning bobby bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst first of all touch on the automotive segment and kind of see what the outlook is assuming your guidance for 2019 and how kind of the program wins trended in 2018 j mitchell dolloff executive vice president chief operating officer president specialized products and furniture p good morning bobby this is mitch i ll take that one of course our automotive business continues to perform really well and our long term outlook hasn t changed our strong pipeline of awarded future programs continues to give us confidence in our goal of beating the vehicle production growth by 1 000 basis points we ve had double digit increases in our new awards every year since i ve been counting this since 2011 overall cagr of over 15 since that time so we think the visibility that we have there it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal for 2019 production is forecasted to be up about 1 globally and about 0 6 in the major market and we look at what we have net of coming online versus programs and then we still feel confident in our double digit target bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst okay does the production forecast assume any type of stimulate and for china automotive demand that they announced recently karl g glassman president and chief executive officer i don t know i think it s kind of hard to tell with a variety of factors that are happening in china certainly people have been hopeful that there s some kind of incentive that kicks in but you still have some general economic release malaise there and certainly some impact from the trade disputes so i think that china forecast for 2019 is a little bit better so it was down 3 5 in 2018 the forecast that i see shows it up 1 7 in 2019 so by historical term that s still not still fairly low for china bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst okay i appreciate that detail and then lastly for me just from a modeling standpoint is there any help you guys can offer on the sales wind down of home furniture and fashion bed i know fashion bed was probably roughly 200 million or so business last year and home furniture half that businesses motion and half stationary and that was probably around 370 million combined how should we think about those two businesses in 2019 and i understand they re going to be smaller but from a modeling standpoint any help would be greatly appreciated j mitchell dolloff executive vice president chief operating officer president specialized products and furniture p okay bobby this is mitch again i ll take a shot and wendy can jump in if there is additional detail but on the home let me talk about home furniture first i think that we re making good progress there we ve got a lot of good activity under way in terms of passing loan price increases or shedding low margin business we made good progress transferring production to our chinese operations to take advantage of lower input cost and we ve been reducing overhead and operating cost and we will look forward to further reduce excess capacity i think you re starting to see that performance stabilize in the fourth quarter we are moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by the end of the first half of the year so for 2019 in that business i think we do see some shrinkage of sales think about it in terms of like mid single digit but with increased significantly increased earnings power on that side on the fashion bed side i think we ll see more significant sales declines as we continue to trim the product categories there and really focus on monetizing inventory i d think about the sales decline there being closer in the 20 to 30 range with probably very little earnings impact bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst okay i appreciate all the details i will jump back in the queue and best of luck this year j mitchell dolloff executive vice president chief operating officer president specialized products and furniture p thank you bobby operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john baugh with stifel please proceed with your question john baugh stifel analyst thank you good morning i just have two questions i guess first 2019 guidance is there anything assumed around timing or rate on the antidumping situation karl g glassman president and chief executive officer john no that we continue to be optimistic and have every reason to be optimistic the timing with the government shutdown is pushed out until end of may for the early determination we do expect some positive impact that don t know how to quantify us so we just were kind of ignored it from a guidance perspective john baugh stifel analyst okay thank you and then as a follow up could you comment on one on the flooring weakness what you saw both in the fourth quarter and maybe for the year last year and what you re seeing right now and then anyway appreciate the comment about not giving us units like on box springs and obviously they re in steep decline but how do we think about the dollar maybe the net dollar impact of gaining units on the adjustable side but then losing the box springs what s that net trade thank you karl g glassman president and chief executive officer i ll take the last one remember those two are in different segments so they re reported differently with adjustables being in furniture and box springs being a subset of u s spring in residential but i guess the one order is significantly positive the average unit selling price of an adjustable bed is in the 200 to 300 range higher in some cases and of a box spring is probably 10 to 15 remember that s just a steel bridge structure so that trade is a good trade there s other things going on in that there are fewer bed frames sold because of the advent of box beds and platform beds when there s fewer box springs there s fewer bed frames and box springs correlate so there s just a lot going on in those markets as it relates to flooring weakness go ahead perry perry e davis executive vice president yeah john looking at q4 and there were a few factors that kind of played into a little bit of a down drop first of all we had some customers and then some secondary customers which secondary i mean down the value chain so during the fourth quarter mattress firm went through a where they a period of time where they liquidated some excessive inventories we also had that occur among some of our major customer groups during the fourth quarter and then also we feel like based on the conversations we ve been having that in preparation for the preliminary determinations of the dumping duties we saw a glut of dumped chinese mattresses that have been exported into the u s and so as they work through that we think probably through the first quarter something like that that had an effect definitely on fourth quarter results the other thing going back to karl s comments on the effort to get in place a dumping order with that delay because of the government shut down being pushed out we now feel like that somewhere around the end of february product that is landed would be subject to the 90 day look back and in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect because obviously an importer of record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they re importing product so we still believe that somewhere around the end of may or somewhere along in there we ll see that preliminary determination hopefully it s favorable and we ll repatriate to the u s product in place of some of that dumb product karl g glassman president and chief executive officer hey john i think you also asked about flooring flooring the external reports on carpet sales in the fourth quarter they were down 9 in the square yards so that led there s obviously a high correlation between our carpet cushion sales and carpet sales again highly correlated with the housing market in total so i think it s just that general softness we have not at all lost share the answer to your question just through january the flooring products business is down about 2 but with one fewer shipping day so it s flattish in january john baugh stifel analyst thank you for that color good luck karl g glassman president and chief executive officer thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you one question on elite do you have a better feel at this point what the purchase accounting kit in 2019 is going to be on elite matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer keith this is matt we re still reviewing that but the upshot is in the first quarter we will have some inventory accounting impact it will be a few million dollars we don t it specifically quantified and bigger picture we currently estimate that the goodwill associated with the transaction would be something around 40 to 50 of purchase price i don t know if that helps some of your modeling expectations but that s all very much being finalized and you ll certainly see all that as we get the case filed keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and the amortize that goodwill over kind of what period of time right now there s different parts of it but some of it drops off after like three years matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer that s just straightforward goodwill that will be on the balance sheet keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and then second question on lifo that was a negative here in the year as you ve discussed in the press release did it impact the fourth quarter and what kind of expectations do you have in your guidance from 2019 on lifo matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer as of keith this is matt again as always we start the year not assuming we have a better crystal ball than anything else anyone else and that we assume there will be basically flat lifo to the year neither income nor expense you certainly heard perry talk a bit about commodity trends right now and trends will move around all throughout the year but at the moment we don t have any assumption of lifo income or expense in the guidance we provided and that s consistent with all of our past practice historically wendy m watson director investor relations and i d just say keith we expect full year lifo would be lower than 31 million it was in 2018 keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and it play over on the fourth quarter positive or negative wendy m watson director investor relations it will it was we had estimated at the end of the third quarter that it was going to be 33 million and when we trued it out as of the fourth quarter it came in at 31 million matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer so it basically came in almost spot on with what we thought 90 days before and that rarely happens of course keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer but if you look forward to this year we don t anticipate nearly that magnitude of lifo expense of 2019 and for modeling purposes here we assume right now out of the gate that there won t be any lifo in some of our expense wendy m watson director investor relations and we ll estimate that each we ll update that estimate each quarter karl g glassman president and chief executive officer keith the impact to the fourth quarter of lifo was 7 million keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst fourth quarter was 7 million ok 7 million negative right karl g glassman president and chief executive officer the expense that s correct matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right thank you karl g glassman president and chief executive officer you re welcome thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan moore with cjs securities please proceed with your question daniel moore cjs securities analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions as it relates to elite it s only been only a very short while now but wondering what you ve learned if anything good or bad since closing the acquisition karl g glassman president and chief executive officer dan it s you are right it will be just three weeks tomorrow but a number of us were at the las vegas furniture market last week and perry and i ve had a number of conversations as among ourselves and then with the elite management team and all i can tell you is thank goodness that we own that business with the growth of high grade products the numbers of boxed bed mattresses that were displayed in las vegas really it s very very early but for the predictions that we made in our analysis of the strategies around elite are proving true and that we re seeing a lot of box beds that are being sold or marketed to conventional brick and mortar environments that are very very apparent in las vegas we re also seeing significant increased conversation around specialty foams and the attributes of specialty foams in terms of heat dissipation so we feel again admittedly early we re always cautious but thank goodness we ve done that deal and what a fantastic group of managers and employees in that business culturally there s such an incredible connectivity that frankly we re blessed to have them on the team daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it and just a little bit of pencil sharpening in terms of the remaining restructuring charges do you expect those to be frontend loaded more evenly spread through the year any sense there karl g glassman president and chief executive officer first half loaded for sure there may be a little residual into the back half but heavily loaded to the first half daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it and then lastly little bit more philosophical but just a thought process understanding you are very cognizant of leverage and it s appreciated but why automatically suspend share repurchase rather than remain opportunistic given the really strong free cash flow outlook karl g glassman president and chief executive officer dan it almost sounds like you re trying to pick a fight between matt and i but because we have that conversation it will be very difficult based on our belief as to what the value of the equity is for us not to repurchase shares if there s any fall off in the stock price we are extremely bullish on the company s future and believe well personal opinion the stock is probably undervalued from a trade perspective right now so it s difficult but we ve made a commitment to the lenders and to ourselves that we ll continue to deleverage for us to be at 3 5 times is remarkably high in either matt or i s history for sure and perry has been here longer than both of us so it will we ll continue to watch it but any melt off it would be hard to pounce but matt and i will arm wrestle for that one later matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes dan we re all certainly aligned with the considerations in order deployment of cash and capital and the very good news is our cash flow is quite predictable typically there s some seasonality to it but it is predictable and we have a lot of it so the deleveraging that we re earmarking take place over the next 12 to 18 months is something we feel very comfortable in estimating and that it will happen promptly daniel moore cjs securities analyst okay understood appreciate the color again operator thank you our next question comes from the line of peter keith with piper jaffray please proceed with your question peter keith piper jaffray co analyst thanks good morning everyone so just to follow on that last point the operating cash flow of 550 million is pretty big step up from the 450 million run rate in the last two years could you just get us comfortable on i guess your comfort of that acceleration what is the key levers you plan on pulling and what are the drivers matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah peter this is matt i ll jump in and then wendy and karl perry and mitch certainly can amplify but first of all don t be surprised of course that it reflects the ecs acquisition and we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ecs this year is estimated to be 675 million you also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the ebitda margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average so you could do math there to see the ebitda will be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of 573 million that we just posted companywide for leggett before we owned ecs secondly as you saw on the fourth quarter once again our working capital performance strongly ended the year and i know both mitch and perry and certainly karl are working hard to be able to not ride in that 12 range of working capital which we did most of 2018 we re working hard to make sure that improve performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustained throughout 2019 that will naturally flush up in meaningful amount of cash and otherwise when you think about go further to the cash flow statement and capital expenditure is pretty predictable we talked about m a dialing down significantly share repurchases same as karl just mentioned so that circa 550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings ecs being part of the family working capital concentration and focus and really no surprise uses of cash on the operating side and again we feel very confident about that expectation that you should use in your model peter keith piper jaffray co analyst okay thank you matt one of the bigger picture follow up and i guess i m just refer back to the tsr target where you are looking for historically around 7 to 10 eps growth and this year at the midpoint i guess you are guiding for 3 so there s sort of lots of puts and takes in the business right now but i was hoping you could maybe just provide a high level sweep on what are the main challenges to not being in line with your tsr for 2019 wendy m watson director investor relations yeah this is wendy i ll take a stab at this if you think about eps it s going to be a big generator in the short term really over at least the first three year period for the sales growth we expect margin to be consistent of course share repurchases are going to be lower but as matt said with the strong operating performance in ecs added to expected margin improvement in our other businesses we think we re going to be able to achieve that 11 to 14 tsr so think about it as long term we re not changing our tsr target and we re not changing the individual components of tsr in the short term while we for instance it s been share repurchase they ll change a little bit but we think we position the company well to achieve that 11 to 14 peter keith piper jaffray co analyst okay and maybe just a follow up i guess i was even i was speaking about earnings growth ex buyback is at 7 to 10 so the top line growth is a little light margins are kind of flat to down if someone say why is leggett in that guiding a mic could you just give us again any broad brush strokes on what the key challenges are for this year even if those are going to go away looking out to 2020 karl g glassman president and chief executive officer yeah the key challenge is well we have the from an ecs perspective we are dealing with the purchase accounting issue which will be mitigated to some degree in time so that s one issue one of the challenges with doing an acquisition of that size you kind of pay for it from an accounting perspective in year one to a lesser degree in year two there certainly is uncertainty in the macro environment it s difficult to guide in this environment the other good earlier good question about tariffs we don t know government shut down we don t know brexit impact we don t know so we re coming up with the best guidance that we feel comfortable putting out there and as wendy said those tsr targets are longer term and we feel very comfortable as we sit here today that we ll be in that range peter keith piper jaffray co analyst okay i appreciate all the color karl thanks a lot karl g glassman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of justin bergner with gabelli co please proceed with your question justin bergner gabelli company analyst hello good morning everyone karl g glassman president and chief executive officer good morning matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin justin bergner gabelli company analyst i guess just to start with ecs should i think of the increase in depreciation and amortization from sort of that 140 million run rate at the end of the year to 210 million that step up is almost all ecs karl g glassman president and chief executive officer virtually all matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we ve had some higher capital spending as you know in the last few years but yes the vast majority of that is associated with ecs justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay so you re not adding back any ecs cost outside of transaction cost in your adjusted eps framework correct karl g glassman president and chief executive officer we are not adding back any additional make sure i understand your question so justin bergner gabelli company analyst the only cost you re adding back for ecs are transaction cost karl g glassman president and chief executive officer well we ve got the inventory write up phenomena it s an accounting gap treatment that will happen in the first quarter that we ve talked about but beyond that there is no significant add back in costs associated with ecs justin bergner gabelli company analyst but the inventory cost will not be added back for your adjusted eps framework you ll eat that cost in the first quarter for your adjusted karl g glassman president and chief executive officer yes justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay should i think of the 10 sales growth for ecs in 2019 maybe a little bit less than 10 sales because it s compared to a 611 million for the 12 months through september i mean it seems like when you announced the deal you might have had expectations for sort of sales growth more in the double digit range has that tapered down or the end markets caused that view to taper down karl g glassman president and chief executive officer it s not justin this is karl it s not end market its deflation so there s about 5 of the early expected growth in ecs that is being pulled back said differently that the chemical input cost have decreased significantly so the resultant sales dollars will be lower than originally expected but the ebitda margins will not been negatively impacted by that so you are your observation is correct the forecast is about a 10 growth if raw material input cost would have stayed neutral we would have been looking at about a 15 growth rate justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay so when you said ebitda margin will stay similar or do you mean ebitda dollars will stay similar karl g glassman president and chief executive officer i should have said dollars justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay that s what i thought and then just two other non ecs related questions you mentioned that in the earnings framework for 2019 you have some benefit from the timing related to steel pricing offsetting tax keeping your margin profile i guess pretty constant or at least organically and i guess i m wondering why aren t you seeing operating leverage besides deal timing related from the 0 to 3 organic sales growth given that you should be seeing some benefit in your fashion bed and home furniture from the actions you re taking wendy m watson director investor relations justin we do expect to see some margin improvement from our in the core leggett business remember ecs is going to be slightly dilutive to ebit margins and in addition to higher tax rate we ve got higher interest expense and we re going to have a higher share count so we have a few small headwinds if you will but we do expect to see margin improvement in the core leggett business justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay that s helpful and then lastly any comment on quantum edge growth in the quarter i think you spoke about last quarter perry e davis executive vice president justin this is perry yeah quantum edge and the overall category of comfort core continues to grow for the full year last year our comfort core as a percentage of our innersprings is about 46 it was a little stronger than that in the fourth quarter and of those comfort core innerspring in the fourth quarter about 37 were quantum edge that continues to grow in fact we saw great representation of what we call activeedge which encompasses quantum edge all of those coil encased products as opposed to foaming case products we saw a great representation of new introductions and existing product lines at the recently completed las vegas market so we believe that content gain story that we ve been preaching for some time now will continue throughout 2019 justin bergner gabelli company analyst thank you for taking all my questions karl g glassman president and chief executive officer thank you perry e davis executive vice president thanks justin operator thank you there are no further question at this time i would like to turn the call back over to ms watson for any closing remarks wendy m watson director investor relations thank you

well what do you know it turns out that amateur economist donald j trump knows more about sound monetary policy than fed chairman jerome powell and his team of hundreds of ph d economists call it street smarts or call it business moxie but trump was dead right when he attacked the fed first in september and then even more savagely after the fed s christmas eve rate hike massacre which closed the day on a 650 point crash in the dow jones industrial average more than 500 points of that blood spillage occurring while powell was making his economically hapless rate hike announcement the political left and the media rallied around the fed s actions and could hardly have been more disdainful of the president on this issue they seemed to want the economy to falter so as to discredit trump s policies sign up free daily newsletter sign up the new york times and others scolded how dare trump attack the economic oracles at the temple the left has acted as if powell has some kind of divine infallibility as if he were the pope but of course we learned with the 4 trillion meltdown in the stock market that the fed is not just fallible but has lost its grip on the steering wheel fortunately this week the fed put its tail between its legs and as the wall street journal put it issued its apology by signaling to financial markets that no more rate hikes are likely this year the retreat by the fed began shortly after christmas and eureka markets are healthy again though still rightly skittish about the china trade war after the fed started backing off the threat of even tighter money in 2019 commodity prices pulled out of their dangerous deflationary spiral from the time of the fed s september rate hike through the end of december general commodity prices lead copper silver soybeans wheat etc collapsed by nearly 13 percent then in december consumer prices fell by 0 1 percent the only logical reason for the fed to raise interest rates and or sell off the assets on its balance sheet would be to fight inflation but there was no inflation at the time of their last two rate hike decisions the fed should have been cutting rates not raising them but at least by calling off the dogs with their turnabout on future rate hikes the fed enabled commodity prices to rally although they are still too low unfortunately the fed severely damaged its credibility with the financial markets and the voters via its acts of economic malpractice late last year the wild swings in the markets caused by the fed are destabilizing and add risk and uncertainty jerome powell s job is to dampen market volatility not to stimulate it trump saw the perils of excessively tight money before nearly anyone else he said that the rate hikes were colliding with his pro growth tax cut and deregulatory policies and thus preventing the 3 to 4 percent growth that america wants and deserves the trump growth agenda increased global demand for dollars at the very time the fed started pulling back on dollar supply this set in motion the destructive deflation of the last quarter of 2018 that left so many investors standing on the ledge the fed was responsible for the worst december for the stock market in 60 years what is doubly confounding about the fed inspired financial collapse is that mistakes like this are so easily avoided the fed could have simply adopted the rule that the two of us have been pushing and targeted for stable commodity prices this is the strategy that paul volcker employed in the early 1980s to break the back of hyperinflation had the fed done this the stock market collapse would have been avoided and the real economy wouldn t have been jolted stock prices and the crb index have been highly correlated stock values fell and then rose primarily in nominal terms not in real terms as gauged by the crb index the fed can keep commodity prices stable by selling bonds when prices are rising and buying them when prices are falling investors were pleased when the fed also pulled back on its unwinding of the balance sheet as this also stops the unwise yanking of dollar liquidity out of the market in a deflationary environment many investors are looking at the fed s recent policy switch toward stable money with an attitude of better late than never however that isn t good enough the fed should hardly be congratulated for cleaning up its own mess that s why we want a permanent change in fed monetary policy that will ensure stable money if the fed does this president trump s other economic policies will continue to produce rapid growth stephen moore

russia s relationship with europe looks little better after trump s election many in moscow staked bets on marine le pen the kremlin feted her in moscow before the first round vote in the french presidential election though le pen made it into the run off she was roundly defeated by emmanuel macron who has adopted a relatively tough policy toward russia driven in part by allegations that russians hacked macron s campaign meanwhile angela merkel who devised europe s policy of sanctioning russia and supporting ukraine has survived as german chancellor the attempted assassination of sergei skripal in the u k and ongoing revelations of russian spying and hacking across europe mean that eu sanctions on russia are unlikely to be lifted soon sanctions on russia are more likely to be intensified than weakened in the united states congress is set on punishing russia for a range of sins the perception that president trump does not take seriously russian meddling in u s elections has encouraged congress to pass legislation obligating the administration to sanction russia next up could be restrictions on russia s ability to issue sovereign debt thus far only russian corporations have faced restrictions on their ability to issue debt in u s and eu markets because the u s and the eu have the world s deepest capital markets this has all but prevented sanctioned russian firms from issuing debt abroad

the longest partial federal government shutdown in american history may be over but the economic consequences for people across the country endure decades of conservative rhetoric about smaller government were tested in real time with disastrous costs for individuals families and businesses on tuesday night president donald trump will deliver a state of the union address that is sure to pass the blame for his shutdown onto others while he takes credit for an economy that has been growing for nine years in his two years in office president trump has done everything in his power to set american workers and families back and place the country on the road to a low wage high cost economy in which a few hands hold all the economic power the 35 day shutdown is just the latest in a series of actions that hurt everyone except the wealthy and those with political connections trump s shutdown cost american families the shutdown is the latest example of the trump administration s disregard for american workers and families the congressional budget office calculated that the five week shutdown cost the u s economy 11 billion 3 billion of which will never be recouped but for millions of americans the shutdown s effect on their paychecks was more apparent about 800 000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay and as many as 1 2 million contractors felt the impact and may not receive back pay in addition shutdowns have a disproportionate effect on black workers and families in fact the proportion of federal workers who are black women is twice as high in the federal government as it is in the greater civilian workforce at the beginning of the shutdown about half of all federal workers were still required to show up to work without pay yet that number grew as the trump administration played favorites with agencies in response to lobbying from some industries beyond the shutdown s effects on the nearly 2 million workers employed by the federal government or working as contractors there are economic consequences that result from closing various parts of the government that help americans in their everyday lives for example elderly renters in rural areas rely on the department of agriculture for rental assistance while homeless veterans rely on the department of housing and urban development for similar assistance moreover as a result of the shutdown community organizations that help families afford food or stay safe while fleeing domestic violence dealt with funding uncertainty and had to limit support or tap into emergency funds meanwhile small business owners who had planned to expand into new areas or hire new staff were unable to receive loans from the small business administration and delays in reports and forecasting about agricultural crops and fisheries have constrained farmers ability to prepare for the spring season larger businesses even suffered consequences the securities and exchange commission sec delayed initial public offerings ipos limiting businesses ability to raise capital as planned government funding will expire again next week and it is imperative that the president does not shut the government down this time trump cherry picks data to hide struggles of everyday americans in his state of the union address president trump will tout carefully chosen data about the economy in order to make a case for his policies yet the statistics that the president uses to brag about the economy do not capture the full picture moreover they hide where and which americans continue to struggle the overall unemployment rate has continued to go down this year as it has since long before the trump administration but low unemployment has not translated into commensurate gains in wages or sufficient improvement in labor force participation typically the low unemployment rates on which the president focuses would indicate that workers are in demand which in turn raises salaries or leads to better jobs instead wages have barely budged the minimum wage has lost significant purchasing power in the decade since it was increased overall real wages for workers without four year college degrees have been essentially stagnant for decades similarly the overall participation of 25 to 54 year old workers in the labor market is down from its 1999 peak level an indicator of slack in the labor market more and more americans aren t participating fully in the economy meaning they have stopped looking for jobs or are unable to find full time work when they look for it as the center for american progress blueprint for the 21st century highlights this reflects an economy that is not creating jobs that american workers need especially jobs for non college educated americans indeed if the labor force participation rate for 25 to 54 year olds were at its 1999 peak the unemployment rate for this demographic would increase from 3 3 percent to 5 6 percent furthermore the employment numbers show that the employment and wage gaps that exist across america have not closed these gaps persist between urban areas and rural communities between white and black americans between white and latinx americans and between women and men as well as at the intersections of these groups at the end of 2018 the unemployment rate for latinx workers was 1 4 times that of white workers and the unemployment rate for black workers was nearly double that of white workers earnings are also constrained by a person s demographics women black and latino men and white men without four year college degrees earn significantly less each week than white men overall meanwhile people with disabilities and members of the lgbtq community face discrimination and barriers to participation in the labor market regional differences also remain pronounced in some cases reflecting years of systemic inequality including anti worker policies while in others reflecting government failures to invest in workers and communities trump s economy continues to squeeze americans who are struggling to make ends meet as the costs of rent child care health care and postsecondary education continue to rise faster than wages declining earnings and persistent wage and wealth gaps illustrate that for many americans the ability to save for retirement or send children to college is out of reach since 2000 rent of primary residences has increased on average by 15 percent in real terms while the median income of renter households has decreased by 2 percent this trend makes it increasingly difficult for renters to afford other basic necessities and makes saving and building wealth nearly impossible as the american middle class continues to decline as a share of total u s income working families seeking to join or stay in the middle class face greater challenges than ever americans can t build wealth without wage growth and support systems in the state of the union the president will likely brag about the stock market claiming that it shows the strength of the economy but for millions of americans the 2008 financial crisis and failure to fully recover from the great recession were major hits to wealth reserves as families try to rebuild their wealth the strongest indicator of their ability to weather a health crisis or period of unemployment they are thwarted by stagnant working and middle class wage growth moreover due to long term structural inequality and discrimination the wealth gap between black and white families persists regardless of education marital status age or income today 4 in 10 adults would not be able to afford a 400 emergency expense without targeted policies that address income as a means of building wealth american families particularly nonwhite families will remain economically insecure stagnant wages low quality jobs and rising costs have created an economy in which 51 million american households struggle to afford basic necessities yet the trump administration has launched repeated attacks on programs that help families put food on the table and send their kids to the doctor it has pushed punitive so called work requirement policies which take food health care and housing away from workers who cannot find a job or get enough hours at work each month last december on the day that congress rejected a version of the farm bill that would have dismantled food assistance with work requirements the trump administration announced plans to sidestep congress and impose these cuts unilaterally similarly the administration has encouraged states to take away health care from unemployed and underemployed workers by imposing medicaid restrictions compounding the damage from its efforts to sabotage health care markets the administration has also proposed such cuts for housing assistance despite a spiraling homelessness crisis driven by a lack of affordable housing these moves aren t just cruel evidence shows that stripping basic necessities away from workers won t help them find a job any faster and may actually be counterproductive moreover there is no indication that the president will use his major annual address to roll out any major reversals to his harmful policies trump s tax tactics benefit the wealthy against this backdrop concentration of economic power only gets worse the tax cuts and jobs act tcja of 2017 showcased the president s true priorities corporations not american families despite the trends outlined above the trump administration made it a top priority to enact a tax cut heavily weighted toward large corporations and the wealthy which the administration jammed through congress at the end of 2017 despite strong public opposition in his address president trump will likely repeat the claim that the tax cuts will soon trickle down to american workers in the form of a 4 000 wage increase for the typical family but that promise has proven to be false instead corporate profits have skyrocketed while the gulf between these profits and wages continues to widen trump administration officials have claimed that the tax cuts would spur a boom in new business investment however no such boom has materialized business investment grew in the first two quarters of 2018 but slowed dramatically in the third quarter instead of investing in real estate purchasing machinery or tools from local businesses increasing wages or making other economic decisions that contribute to the growth of communities businesses have simply put more money toward stock buybacks corporations have largely chosen to use their tax windfall to enrich shareholders and executives and to drive mergers and acquisitions across the economy power is kept in the hands of the few despite campaign promises to look out for workers the trump administration has furthered this concentration of economic power by largely greenlighting another wave of corporate consolidation in sector after sector america faces the growing threat of closed markets controlled by a small handful of dominant firms which is stifling entrepreneurship innovation and consumer choice while also imperiling democracy concentrated economic power is further bolstered by a wave of deregulation being driven economywide from workplace safety protections to the environment corporate power increases while working families priorities are crushed furthermore the administration and trump appointed financial regulators are rolling back the important financial stability safeguards and consumer protections put in place to keep american workers from facing another financial crisis the fact that the shutdown further hamstrung the sec s ability to hold companies and financial market participants accountable is only the latest example of the administration s clear preferences it answers to wall street not working families conclusion trump s low wage high cost power concentrated economy is not the only choice america has the vision of government and america that the president will provide in tuesday s address won t present a suite of policies that could raise wages lower costs build wealth or break up concentrated economic power to restore accountable government congress should pass a bold infrastructure package to create jobs and raise wages and to tackle the climate crisis as cap s jobs blueprint lays out government can improve lives and provide well paid dependable jobs by investing in child care school construction climate focused retrofits and long term care as well as by providing a partial job guarantee for communities facing the most severe challenges pairing these jobs with paid training a 15 minimum wage comprehensive and equitable paid family and medical leave and tools to increase worker voice and power can meaningfully improve economic opportunities for workers and families across america the state of the union will not introduce policies to increase wages nor will it announce any intentions to rein in costs government however can address the cost burden facing working families by investing in bold new approaches to build affordable housing taking further steps to ensure that all americans have affordable health care fighting for workers retirement savings and standing with savers and retirees rather than with wall street economic power and political power reinforce and strengthen each other and trump s vision of the economy concentrates these powers in the hands of the few government can and must stand for a democracy where economic and political power are broadly distributed that means implementing key democracy reforms reviving antitrust enforcement for industries from agriculture to technology and ensuring that financial markets are oriented toward the long term public interest the state of the economy will only be strong when government is equipped and empowered to stand up for all americans lily roberts is the director of economic mobility at the center for american progress andy green is the managing director of economic policy at the center
in an october 2018 campaign appearance democratic darling ocasio cortez on the premise that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with human industrial activity are responsible for potentially catastrophic climate change made reference to a green new deal which aims to make the u s 100 percent reliant on renewable energy sources wind water solar by 2035 there s no debate as to whether we should continue producing fossil fuels she said there s no debate we should not every single scientific consensus points to that in another campaign speech that same month ocasio cortez likened the fight against climate change to america s battle against nazi germany so we talk about existential threats the last time we had a really major existential threat to this country was around world war ii we had a direct existential threat with another nation this time it was nazi germany and the axis who explicitly made the united states as an enemy as an enemy and what we did was that we chose to mobilize our entire economy and industrialized our entire economy and we put hundreds if not millions of people to work in defending our shores and defending this country we have to do the same thing in order to get us to 100 percent renewable energy and that s just the truth of it the green new deal we are proposing will be similar in scale to the mobilization efforts seen in world war ii or the marshall plan ocasio cortez said on yet another occasion it will require the investment of trillions of dollars and the creation of millions of high wage jobs we must again invest in the development manufacturing deployment and distribution of energy but this time green energy in a january 2019 interview on cbs this morning host anderson cooper asked the newly elected ocasio cortez if her green new deal would mean everybody having to drive an electric car the congresswoman replied it s going to require a lot of rapid change that we don t even conceive as possible right now what is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible emphasizing that her energy plan would require wealthy people to start paying their fair share in taxes she proceeded to suggest that tax rates of 60 or 70 percent on top earners would be fair and appropriate when cooper subsequently observed that ocasio cortez was proposing a radical agenda the legislator replied well i think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country abraham lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation franklin delano roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like social security cooper then asked do you call yourself a radical to that ocasio cortez said yeah you know if that s what radical means call me a radical operationally the green new deal would eliminate all fossil fuels from the u s electric grid by 2030 thereby forcing americans to use much more expensive and much less reliable energy sources such as wind which costs twice as much as power derived from coal and oil and solar which costs three times as much the plan would also mandate trillions of dollars in spending on a government approved upgrade of all homes and businesses in the united states to make them more energy efficient in a january 2019 analysis of the green new deal the heartland institute notes that the plan is appropriately named after the original new deal the big government power grab imposed by president franklin roosevelt in the 1930s under fdr says heartland democrats tripled taxes in seven years and the government imposed an endless array of regulations mandates and even a secret police force to enforce them the economy limped along for the entirety of the 1930s with an average unemployment rate of a whopping 17 percent and americans more dependent on government than ever regarding the green new deal s call for the elimination of fossil fuels heartland points out that when there is more carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere plants generally grow faster which means there s more food available to feed the world s growing population of people and animals aside from that adds the institute regardless of what we do in the united states the rest of the world is going to continue increasing its fossil fuel use more than offsetting any co2 reductions we might make in short any carbon cutting measures taken by the united states would be doomed to irrelevance why then do ocasio cortez and her fellow democrats seek to enact this green new deal scholar tim huelskamp who describes the plan as the most radical socialist proposal in modern congressional history explains that its provisions extend far beyond matters that are even remotely associated with energy the environment and climate that is the green new deal seeks to remake the entire american economy heir real desire is to accomplish the left s longtime goal of moving the united states toward full adoption of socialism this isn t just a theory significant provisions of the green new deal reveal its true purpose of imposing socialism on an unprecedented scale the plan would create a basic income program and federal jobs guarantee providing a living wage to everybody who says they want one it would impose a federal government run single payer health care system with bureaucrats and liberal politicians in washington d c in charge of every american s health care it would encourage the federal reserve to unleash inflation and create a system of government owned banks to create tens of trillions of dollars needed to fund these immense programs none of these proposals has anything at all to do with climate change the origins of the term green new deal can be traced back to richard murphy a british tax scholar and political economy professor who in 2007 collaborated with a number of newspaper editors economists and environmentalists to form a green new deal group that proposed massive public expenditures to fund a the development of a zero carbon emission transportation infrastructure wholly reliant on renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels b the wide scale insulation of homes to make them more energy efficient and c the establishment of training programs to develop a national corps of workers to carry out these objectives to fund this initiative murphy advocated a combination of tax hikes on wealthy people and corporations straightforward deficit spending and the implementation of quantitative easing a strategy whereby the government would establish a green infrastructure bank that would issue bonds which the government in turn could buy back on july 21 2008 murphy s green new deal group published a report detailing its specific recommendations in a similar spirit on october 22 2008 united nations environment programme executive director achim steiner unveiled a global green new deal initiative designed to simultaneously strengthen the world economy and curb climate change by creating jobs in a wide array of green industries the following year the united nations drafted a report explicitly calling for a global green new deal to promote government stimulus spending on renewable energy projects such objectives gained significant popular momentum in the united kingdom when the ruling labour party in 2010 established a green infrastructure bank as richard murphy had proposed but when the conservative tories swept into office later that year they sold the bank and cut subsidies for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs among the first to introduce the concept of a green new deal in the united states was new york times columnist thomas friedman who in january 2007 wrote e will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables and that is a huge industrial project much bigger than anyone has told you finally like the new deal if we undertake the green version it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century in 2008 democratic presidential candidate barack obama added a green new deal to his campaign platform in april of that year the self identified revolutionary communist van jones who in 2009 would become president obama s green jobs czar made clear his desire to incrementally socialize by stealth the u s economy right now we say we want to move from suicidal gray capitalism to something eco capitalism where at least we re not fast tracking the destruction of the whole planet will that be enough no it won t be enough we want to go beyond the systems of exploitation and oppression altogether until becomes the engine for transforming the whole society a few months later in february 2009 jones proclaimed that america s new green economy would emphasize gender equity in contrast to the pollution based economy wherein women are making 70 cents to the dollar as compared to men moreover he charged that the united states was built on land that had been stolen from our native american sisters and brothers who were bullied and mistreated and shoved into all the land we didn t want where it was all hot and windy but under a renewable energy system i e solar and wind power he explained there would be retribution as native americans would now own and control 80 percent of the renewable energy resources give them the wealth jones shouted we owe them a debt a clean energy revolution he emphasized would merely be the first step toward wholesale societal transformation e gonna change the whole system we gonna change the whole thing but when the cap and trade legislation known as the american clean energy and security act died in the u s senate in 2010 talk of a green new deal became suddenly scarce in 2012 and again in 2016 green party presidential candidate jill stein revived the idea by making a green new deal a central part of her campaigns and the green new deal became part of the green party s official platform it is noteworthy that although ocasio cortez and some other democrats likewise began making reference to a green new deal during the 2018 campaign season it was not until december 2018 well after election day that their plan was actually fleshed out in the form of a tangible piece of legislation remarkably the green new deal that democrats are now promoting was drafted during a single december weekend by young millennial staffers employed by ocasio cortez and three like minded progressive organizations the sunrise movement justice democrats and the new consensus according to saikat chakrabarti ocasio cortez s chief of staff we spent the weekend learning how to put laws together we looked up how to write resolutions before the end of december 2018 40 house democrats had joined ocasio cortez in openly declaring their support for the green new deal these were jared huffman barbara

remind you that today remarks today concerning future expectations events objectives strategies trends or results constitute forward looking statements actual results or events may differ materially

yesterday s press release in the section in our 10 k and 10 qs entitled forward looking statements i ll now turn the call over to karl karl g glassman president and chief executive officer good morning and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call first i would like to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year they are very much appreciated we are pleased with our 2018 operational performance despite the challenges we faced in some of our businesses most notably home furniture and fashion bed fourth quarter sales increased 6 to 1 05 billion on flat volume raw material related price increases net of currency impact added 3 to sales growth and acquisitions also added 3 fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were 0 39 this includes several items outlined in yesterday s press release that amount to a 0 23 per share reduction in earnings excluding these items adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 5 to 0 62 per share from 0 59 last year this increase is primarily due to the improved metal margins in our steel rod business in 2018 sales grew 8 to 4 3 billion with organic sales up 6 from a combination of 3 volume growth and a 3 benefit from raw material related price increases and currency impact acquisitions net of divestitures completed in 2017 added 2 to sales growth whole year sales benefited from ongoing content gains and new program awards in automotive market share gains and continued shift to comfort core and quantum edge innersprings and u s spring and strong growth in adjustable bed work furniture and aerospace these improvements were partially offset by declines in other businesses primarily home furniture fashion bed and flooring products full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 2 26 from 2 14 in 2017 earnings from 2018 include the fourth quarter 0 23 per share reduction just mentioned and a third quarter 0 01 per share benefit related to the tax cuts and jobs act for a net reduction of 0 22 per share full year 2017 earnings included a 0 32 per share net reduction primarily from cost associated with the tax cuts and jobs act adjusted full year earnings per share increased 1 to 2 48 adjusted eps benefited from improved metal margins are steel mill and higher sales these improvements were largely offset by higher steel cost including lifo expense and the lag associated with passing along ongoing inflation in 2018 we made some important strategic moves that should reinforce achievement of our long term financial goals in january we acquired precision hydraulic cylinders a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market phc is our first business in the hydraulic cylinder industry a market we identified through our styles of competition analysis in november we announced the acquisition of elite comfort solutions and we have completed the acquisition last month ecs is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology primarily for the bedding and furniture industries the purchase price was 1 25 billion and was financed through an expansion of our commercial paper program and the issuance of a 500 million five year term loan with our current bank group through the ecs acquisition we have gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale in the production of private label finished mattresses our combined expertise in spring and foam technology make us the leading provider of differentiated products for the global bedding industry ecs annualized sales for the fiscal year ended september 2018 were 611 million and we expect ecs to add approximately 675 million to sales growth of 2019 ecs is in our new specialty foams business unit within the residential products segment reporting to perry as previously discussed we continued an in depth analysis of our fashion bed and home furniture businesses and initiated restructuring activity late last year restructuring related charges in 2018 were 16 million and we expect an additional 17 million of charges in 2019 the restructuring activity should be substantially complete by the end of this year in 2019 we expect these acquisitions and leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and increased margins matt will discuss our guidance for the year later in the call finally the quarterly slide decks that we posted to the investor relations website contains unit growth rates for innerspring and box spring pieces within our residential products segment because of content gains including strong growth of our comfort core innerspring and other higher dollar value units dollar growth and unit growth have become increasingly disconnected accordingly beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we will stop reporting unit growth for innersprings and box springs we will continue to provide dollar growth as we do for our other business units i ll now turn the call over to matt matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you karl and good morning everyone in 2018 we generated operating cash flow of 440 million which once again included our typically strong fourth quarter cash flow performance we continue to have a strong and sharp focus on working capital management and we ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 10 6 we repatriated 141 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter bringing our full year total to 314 million in november we declared a 0 38 per share quarterly dividend a 6 increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017 our dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings was 60 for 2018 at the top of our target dividend payout range of 50 to 60 beginning in 2019 in conjunction with the increasing leverage from the ecs acquisition we announced a modest change in our dividend payout target to approximately 50 of adjusted earnings we expect to continue increasing the dividend as we repay debt associated with the ecs acquisition at friday s closing price of 14 97 our current yield is 3 7 which is one of the highest yields among the 57 companies that comprise the s p 500 s dividend aristocrats for the full year we repurchased 2 6 million shares of our stock at an average price of 43 10 and issued 1 2 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises during the year we acquired phc and two small tl component operations we also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities primarily in automotive and bedding we increased the borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from 800 million to 1 2 billion in connection with the funding of the ecs transaction we ended the year with debt at 1 9 times our trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda after completing the ecs acquisition in january our debt levels increased as expected to approximately 3 5 times we are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and expect to deleverage each to a target ratio of debt to trailing 12 months ebitda of approximately 2 5 times by temporarily suspending share repurchases reducing other acquisition spending and using our operating cash flow to repay debt we asses on overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three year basis our target is to achieve tsr in the top one third of the s p 500 over the long term which we believe will require an average tsr of 11 to 14 per year while our recent performance has not met this target we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and prudent use of capital will support achievement of our top third goal over time sales growth in 2019 will benefit significantly from the ecs acquisition we also expect sales growth in automotive u s spring aerospace and hydraulic cylinders partially offset by planned declines in fashion bed and home furniture related to restructuring efforts and from less promotional activity in adjustable bed 2019 sales are expected to be 4 95 billion to 5 1 billion or up 16 to 19 over last year ecs should add approximately 675 million to sales in addition to ecs same location sales growth is expected to be flat to up 3 earnings per share are expected to be 2 35 to 2 55 including approximately 0 10 per share of restructuring related cost therefore adjusted eps is expected to be 2 45 to 2 65 reflecting slightly higher organic sales and moderating steel inflation partially offset by higher tax rate as we have previously stated the ecs acquisition is expected to be neutral to eps in 2019 eps guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 24 versus 20 in 2018 this higher rate reflects the non reoccurrence of some valuation allowance releases we benefited from in 2018 a smaller expected stock compensation benefit in 2019 the impact of tcja executive compensation limits and tax implications from higher interest expense due to the financing of the ecs transaction we expect 2019 depreciation and amortization to approximate 210 million net interest of approximately 95 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million based upon this guidance framework our 2019 full year adjusted ebit margin should be 10 8 to 11 2 while we do not issue specific quarterly guidance we expect revenue growth rates to be somewhat consistent across the quarters in 2019 we expect adjusted margins in the first quarter to be lower than first quarter last year in part due to the purchase accounting for acquired ecs inventory and we expect year over year adjusted margins to be flat to slightly improving by the second half of the year cash from operations should approximate 550 million in 2019 capital expenditures should be near 195 million for the year and dividends should require 205 million of cash our dividend payout ratio for 2019 is anticipated to be above our target of approximately 50 of adjusted earnings our long term priorities for use of cash remain one organic growth involving capital expenditure and working capital investments two dividends three strategic acquisitions and four share repurchases as previously stated we will temporarily suspended share repurchases reduce acquisition spending and prioritize debt repayment after organic growth in dividends with those comments i ll turn the call back over to wendy wendy m watson director investor relations that concludes our prepared remarks we thank you for your attention and we ll be glad to answer any of your questions in order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate we request that you ask only one question and then yield to the next participant if you have additional questions you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will answer those questions as well michelle we re ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse please proceed with your question chris kalata credit suisse analyst hi this is chris kalata on for susan thanks for taking our questions first question is just on the industrial products segment you ve been able to realize the significant amount of pricing in the second half of 2018 so i was just wondering how much additional pricing are you expecting this year and what benefit could that have to your margins perry e davis executive vice president chris we this is perry davis we definitely saw a run up last year in both scrap and particularly in rod pricing the we feel at this point in time that we are pretty much at the peak we in fact saw some slight deflation in scrap inputs in january which is a little uncommon i don t believe we ve seen a january decrease in scrap pricing since 2006 but overall we believe that over the next few months our input cost and rod prices will remain relatively constant chris kalata credit suisse analyst okay thanks and then just my second question does your full year guidance that include the impact of the a full 25 tariff environment and are you able to quantify what the incremental headwinds would be between the 10 and 25 karl g glassman president and chief executive officer chris this is karl the answer to that is no we don t know what to expect as it relates to tariff we assume that if the tariffs aren t in fact increased to 25 we ll pass them through but in our top line forecast they do not include the expansion of tariff activity we just don t know chris kalata credit suisse analyst okay thanks for that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bobby griffin with raymond james financial please proceed with your question bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst yes thank you and good morning everybody and i appreciate you guys taking my question karl g glassman president and chief executive officer good morning bobby bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst first of all touch on the automotive segment and kind of see what the outlook is assuming your guidance for 2019 and how kind of the program wins trended in 2018 j mitchell dolloff executive vice president chief operating officer president specialized products and furniture p good morning bobby this is mitch i ll take that one of course our automotive business continues to perform really well and our long term outlook hasn t changed our strong pipeline of awarded future programs continues to give us confidence in our goal of beating the vehicle production growth by 1 000 basis points we ve had double digit increases in our new awards every year since i ve been counting this since 2011 overall cagr of over 15 since that time so we think the visibility that we have there it really gives us a strong case to stand by our goal for 2019 production is forecasted to be up about 1 globally and about 0 6 in the major market and we look at what we have net of coming online versus programs and then we still feel confident in our double digit target bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst okay does the production forecast assume any type of stimulate and for china automotive demand that they announced recently karl g glassman president and chief executive officer i don t know i think it s kind of hard to tell with a variety of factors that are happening in china certainly people have been hopeful that there s some kind of incentive that kicks in but you still have some general economic release malaise there and certainly some impact from the trade disputes so i think that china forecast for 2019 is a little bit better so it was down 3 5 in 2018 the forecast that i see shows it up 1 7 in 2019 so by historical term that s still not still fairly low for china bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst okay i appreciate that detail and then lastly for me just from a modeling standpoint is there any help you guys can offer on the sales wind down of home furniture and fashion bed i know fashion bed was probably roughly 200 million or so business last year and home furniture half that businesses motion and half stationary and that was probably around 370 million combined how should we think about those two businesses in 2019 and i understand they re going to be smaller but from a modeling standpoint any help would be greatly appreciated j mitchell dolloff executive vice president chief operating officer president specialized products and furniture p okay bobby this is mitch again i ll take a shot and wendy can jump in if there is additional detail but on the home let me talk about home furniture first i think that we re making good progress there we ve got a lot of good activity under way in terms of passing loan price increases or shedding low margin business we made good progress transferring production to our chinese operations to take advantage of lower input cost and we ve been reducing overhead and operating cost and we will look forward to further reduce excess capacity i think you re starting to see that performance stabilize in the fourth quarter we are moving aggressively and expect to complete the implementation largely by the end of the first half of the year so for 2019 in that business i think we do see some shrinkage of sales think about it in terms of like mid single digit but with increased significantly increased earnings power on that side on the fashion bed side i think we ll see more significant sales declines as we continue to trim the product categories there and really focus on monetizing inventory i d think about the sales decline there being closer in the 20 to 30 range with probably very little earnings impact bobby griffin raymond james financial analyst okay i appreciate all the details i will jump back in the queue and best of luck this year j mitchell dolloff executive vice president chief operating officer president specialized products and furniture p thank you bobby operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john baugh with stifel please proceed with your question john baugh stifel analyst thank you good morning i just have two questions i guess first 2019 guidance is there anything assumed around timing or rate on the antidumping situation karl g glassman president and chief executive officer john no that we continue to be optimistic and have every reason to be optimistic the timing with the government shutdown is pushed out until end of may for the early determination we do expect some positive impact that don t know how to quantify us so we just were kind of ignored it from a guidance perspective john baugh stifel analyst okay thank you and then as a follow up could you comment on one on the flooring weakness what you saw both in the fourth quarter and maybe for the year last year and what you re seeing right now and then anyway appreciate the comment about not giving us units like on box springs and obviously they re in steep decline but how do we think about the dollar maybe the net dollar impact of gaining units on the adjustable side but then losing the box springs what s that net trade thank you karl g glassman president and chief executive officer i ll take the last one remember those two are in different segments so they re reported differently with adjustables being in furniture and box springs being a subset of u s spring in residential but i guess the one order is significantly positive the average unit selling price of an adjustable bed is in the 200 to 300 range higher in some cases and of a box spring is probably 10 to 15 remember that s just a steel bridge structure so that trade is a good trade there s other things going on in that there are fewer bed frames sold because of the advent of box beds and platform beds when there s fewer box springs there s fewer bed frames and box springs correlate so there s just a lot going on in those markets as it relates to flooring weakness go ahead perry perry e davis executive vice president yeah john looking at q4 and there were a few factors that kind of played into a little bit of a down drop first of all we had some customers and then some secondary customers which secondary i mean down the value chain so during the fourth quarter mattress firm went through a where they a period of time where they liquidated some excessive inventories we also had that occur among some of our major customer groups during the fourth quarter and then also we feel like based on the conversations we ve been having that in preparation for the preliminary determinations of the dumping duties we saw a glut of dumped chinese mattresses that have been exported into the u s and so as they work through that we think probably through the first quarter something like that that had an effect definitely on fourth quarter results the other thing going back to karl s comments on the effort to get in place a dumping order with that delay because of the government shut down being pushed out we now feel like that somewhere around the end of february product that is landed would be subject to the 90 day look back and in a lot of cases that has a cooling effect because obviously an importer of record needs to understand their cost basis whenever they re importing product so we still believe that somewhere around the end of may or somewhere along in there we ll see that preliminary determination hopefully it s favorable and we ll repatriate to the u s product in place of some of that dumb product karl g glassman president and chief executive officer hey john i think you also asked about flooring flooring the external reports on carpet sales in the fourth quarter they were down 9 in the square yards so that led there s obviously a high correlation between our carpet cushion sales and carpet sales again highly correlated with the housing market in total so i think it s just that general softness we have not at all lost share the answer to your question just through january the flooring products business is down about 2 but with one fewer shipping day so it s flattish in january john baugh stifel analyst thank you for that color good luck karl g glassman president and chief executive officer thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you one question on elite do you have a better feel at this point what the purchase accounting kit in 2019 is going to be on elite matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer keith this is matt we re still reviewing that but the upshot is in the first quarter we will have some inventory accounting impact it will be a few million dollars we don t it specifically quantified and bigger picture we currently estimate that the goodwill associated with the transaction would be something around 40 to 50 of purchase price i don t know if that helps some of your modeling expectations but that s all very much being finalized and you ll certainly see all that as we get the case filed keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and the amortize that goodwill over kind of what period of time right now there s different parts of it but some of it drops off after like three years matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer that s just straightforward goodwill that will be on the balance sheet keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and then second question on lifo that was a negative here in the year as you ve discussed in the press release did it impact the fourth quarter and what kind of expectations do you have in your guidance from 2019 on lifo matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer as of keith this is matt again as always we start the year not assuming we have a better crystal ball than anything else anyone else and that we assume there will be basically flat lifo to the year neither income nor expense you certainly heard perry talk a bit about commodity trends right now and trends will move around all throughout the year but at the moment we don t have any assumption of lifo income or expense in the guidance we provided and that s consistent with all of our past practice historically wendy m watson director investor relations and i d just say keith we expect full year lifo would be lower than 31 million it was in 2018 keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and it play over on the fourth quarter positive or negative wendy m watson director investor relations it will it was we had estimated at the end of the third quarter that it was going to be 33 million and when we trued it out as of the fourth quarter it came in at 31 million matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer so it basically came in almost spot on with what we thought 90 days before and that rarely happens of course keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer but if you look forward to this year we don t anticipate nearly that magnitude of lifo expense of 2019 and for modeling purposes here we assume right now out of the gate that there won t be any lifo in some of our expense wendy m watson director investor relations and we ll estimate that each we ll update that estimate each quarter karl g glassman president and chief executive officer keith the impact to the fourth quarter of lifo was 7 million keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst fourth quarter was 7 million ok 7 million negative right karl g glassman president and chief executive officer the expense that s correct matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer that s correct keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right thank you karl g glassman president and chief executive officer you re welcome thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan moore with cjs securities please proceed with your question daniel moore cjs securities analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions as it relates to elite it s only been only a very short while now but wondering what you ve learned if anything good or bad since closing the acquisition karl g glassman president and chief executive officer dan it s you are right it will be just three weeks tomorrow but a number of us were at the las vegas furniture market last week and perry and i ve had a number of conversations as among ourselves and then with the elite management team and all i can tell you is thank goodness that we own that business with the growth of high grade products the numbers of boxed bed mattresses that were displayed in las vegas really it s very very early but for the predictions that we made in our analysis of the strategies around elite are proving true and that we re seeing a lot of box beds that are being sold or marketed to conventional brick and mortar environments that are very very apparent in las vegas we re also seeing significant increased conversation around specialty foams and the attributes of specialty foams in terms of heat dissipation so we feel again admittedly early we re always cautious but thank goodness we ve done that deal and what a fantastic group of managers and employees in that business culturally there s such an incredible connectivity that frankly we re blessed to have them on the team daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it and just a little bit of pencil sharpening in terms of the remaining restructuring charges do you expect those to be frontend loaded more evenly spread through the year any sense there karl g glassman president and chief executive officer first half loaded for sure there may be a little residual into the back half but heavily loaded to the first half daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it and then lastly little bit more philosophical but just a thought process understanding you are very cognizant of leverage and it s appreciated but why automatically suspend share repurchase rather than remain opportunistic given the really strong free cash flow outlook karl g glassman president and chief executive officer dan it almost sounds like you re trying to pick a fight between matt and i but because we have that conversation it will be very difficult based on our belief as to what the value of the equity is for us not to repurchase shares if there s any fall off in the stock price we are extremely bullish on the company s future and believe well personal opinion the stock is probably undervalued from a trade perspective right now so it s difficult but we ve made a commitment to the lenders and to ourselves that we ll continue to deleverage for us to be at 3 5 times is remarkably high in either matt or i s history for sure and perry has been here longer than both of us so it will we ll continue to watch it but any melt off it would be hard to pounce but matt and i will arm wrestle for that one later matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes dan we re all certainly aligned with the considerations in order deployment of cash and capital and the very good news is our cash flow is quite predictable typically there s some seasonality to it but it is predictable and we have a lot of it so the deleveraging that we re earmarking take place over the next 12 to 18 months is something we feel very comfortable in estimating and that it will happen promptly daniel moore cjs securities analyst okay understood appreciate the color again operator thank you our next question comes from the line of peter keith with piper jaffray please proceed with your question peter keith piper jaffray co analyst thanks good morning everyone so just to follow on that last point the operating cash flow of 550 million is pretty big step up from the 450 million run rate in the last two years could you just get us comfortable on i guess your comfort of that acceleration what is the key levers you plan on pulling and what are the drivers matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah peter this is matt i ll jump in and then wendy and karl perry and mitch certainly can amplify but first of all don t be surprised of course that it reflects the ecs acquisition and we have been very clearly stating that the sales expectation that will arrive from ecs this year is estimated to be 675 million you also recall reading that we anticipate fully that the ebitda margin on that sales base will be higher than the company average so you could do math there to see the ebitda will be driving significantly higher from this 2018 level of 573 million that we just posted companywide for leggett before we owned ecs secondly as you saw on the fourth quarter once again our working capital performance strongly ended the year and i know both mitch and perry and certainly karl are working hard to be able to not ride in that 12 range of working capital which we did most of 2018 we re working hard to make sure that improve performance of a pretty significant nature by the end of the year is sustained throughout 2019 that will naturally flush up in meaningful amount of cash and otherwise when you think about go further to the cash flow statement and capital expenditure is pretty predictable we talked about m a dialing down significantly share repurchases same as karl just mentioned so that circa 550 million of operating cash flow is readily correlated to the higher earnings ecs being part of the family working capital concentration and focus and really no surprise uses of cash on the operating side and again we feel very confident about that expectation that you should use in your model peter keith piper jaffray co analyst okay thank you matt one of the bigger picture follow up and i guess i m just refer back to the tsr target where you are looking for historically around 7 to 10 eps growth and this year at the midpoint i guess you are guiding for 3 so there s sort of lots of puts and takes in the business right now but i was hoping you could maybe just provide a high level sweep on what are the main challenges to not being in line with your tsr for 2019 wendy m watson director investor relations yeah this is wendy i ll take a stab at this if you think about eps it s going to be a big generator in the short term really over at least the first three year period for the sales growth we expect margin to be consistent of course share repurchases are going to be lower but as matt said with the strong operating performance in ecs added to expected margin improvement in our other businesses we think we re going to be able to achieve that 11 to 14 tsr so think about it as long term we re not changing our tsr target and we re not changing the individual components of tsr in the short term while we for instance it s been share repurchase they ll change a little bit but we think we position the company well to achieve that 11 to 14 peter keith piper jaffray co analyst okay and maybe just a follow up i guess i was even i was speaking about earnings growth ex buyback is at 7 to 10 so the top line growth is a little light margins are kind of flat to down if someone say why is leggett in that guiding a mic could you just give us again any broad brush strokes on what the key challenges are for this year even if those are going to go away looking out to 2020 karl g glassman president and chief executive officer yeah the key challenge is well we have the from an ecs perspective we are dealing with the purchase accounting issue which will be mitigated to some degree in time so that s one issue one of the challenges with doing an acquisition of that size you kind of pay for it from an accounting perspective in year one to a lesser degree in year two there certainly is uncertainty in the macro environment it s difficult to guide in this environment the other good earlier good question about tariffs we don t know government shut down we don t know brexit impact we don t know so we re coming up with the best guidance that we feel comfortable putting out there and as wendy said those tsr targets are longer term and we feel very comfortable as we sit here today that we ll be in that range peter keith piper jaffray co analyst okay i appreciate all the color karl thanks a lot karl g glassman president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of justin bergner with gabelli co please proceed with your question justin bergner gabelli company analyst hello good morning everyone karl g glassman president and chief executive officer good morning matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin justin bergner gabelli company analyst i guess just to start with ecs should i think of the increase in depreciation and amortization from sort of that 140 million run rate at the end of the year to 210 million that step up is almost all ecs karl g glassman president and chief executive officer virtually all matthew c flanigan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we ve had some higher capital spending as you know in the last few years but yes the vast majority of that is associated with ecs justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay so you re not adding back any ecs cost outside of transaction cost in your adjusted eps framework correct karl g glassman president and chief executive officer we are not adding back any additional make sure i understand your question so justin bergner gabelli company analyst the only cost you re adding back for ecs are transaction cost karl g glassman president and chief executive officer well we ve got the inventory write up phenomena it s an accounting gap treatment that will happen in the first quarter that we ve talked about but beyond that there is no significant add back in costs associated with ecs justin bergner gabelli company analyst but the inventory cost will not be added back for your adjusted eps framework you ll eat that cost in the first quarter for your adjusted karl g glassman president and chief executive officer yes justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay should i think of the 10 sales growth for ecs in 2019 maybe a little bit less than 10 sales because it s compared to a 611 million for the 12 months through september i mean it seems like when you announced the deal you might have had expectations for sort of sales growth more in the double digit range has that tapered down or the end markets caused that view to taper down karl g glassman president and chief executive officer it s not justin this is karl it s not end market its deflation so there s about 5 of the early expected growth in ecs that is being pulled back said differently that the chemical input cost have decreased significantly so the resultant sales dollars will be lower than originally expected but the ebitda margins will not been negatively impacted by that so you are your observation is correct the forecast is about a 10 growth if raw material input cost would have stayed neutral we would have been looking at about a 15 growth rate justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay so when you said ebitda margin will stay similar or do you mean ebitda dollars will stay similar karl g glassman president and chief executive officer i should have said dollars justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay that s what i thought and then just two other non ecs related questions you mentioned that in the earnings framework for 2019 you have some benefit from the timing related to steel pricing offsetting tax keeping your margin profile i guess pretty constant or at least organically and i guess i m wondering why aren t you seeing operating leverage besides deal timing related from the 0 to 3 organic sales growth given that you should be seeing some benefit in your fashion bed and home furniture from the actions you re taking wendy m watson director investor relations justin we do expect to see some margin improvement from our in the core leggett business remember ecs is going to be slightly dilutive to ebit margins and in addition to higher tax rate we ve got higher interest expense and we re going to have a higher share count so we have a few small headwinds if you will but we do expect to see margin improvement in the core leggett business justin bergner gabelli company analyst okay that s helpful and then lastly any comment on quantum edge growth in the quarter i think you spoke about last quarter perry e davis executive vice president justin this is perry yeah quantum edge and the overall category of comfort core continues to grow for the full year last year our comfort core as a percentage of our innersprings is about 46 it was a little stronger than that in the fourth quarter and of those comfort core innerspring in the fourth quarter about 37 were quantum edge that continues to grow in fact we saw great representation of what we call activeedge which encompasses quantum edge all

well what do you know it turns out that amateur economist donald j trump knows more about sound monetary policy than fed chairman jerome powell and his team of hundreds of ph d economists advertisement call it street smarts or call it business moxie but trump was dead right when he attacked the fed first in september and then even more savagely after the fed s christmas eve rate hike massacre which closed the day on a 650 point crash in the dow jones industrial average more than 500 points of that blood spillage occurring while powell was making his economically hapless rate hike announcement the political left and the media rallied around the fed s actions and could hardly have been more disdainful of the president on this issue they seemed to want the economy to falter so as to discredit trump s policies the new york times and others scolded how dare trump attack the economic oracles at the temple the left has acted as if powell has some kind of divine infallibility as if he were the pope but of course we learned with the 4 trillion meltdown in the stock market that the fed is not just fallible but has lost its grip on the steering wheel fortunately this week the fed put its tail between its legs and as the wall street journal put it issued its apology by signaling to financial markets that no more rate hikes are likely this year the retreat by the fed began shortly after christmas and eureka markets are healthy again though still rightly skittish about the china trade war after the fed started backing off the threat of even tighter money in 2019 commodity prices pulled out of their dangerous deflationary spiral advertisement recommended from the time of the fed s september rate hike through the end of december general commodity prices lead copper silver soybeans wheat etc collapsed by nearly 13 percent then in december consumer prices fell by 0 1 percent the only logical reason for the fed to raise interest rates and or sell off the assets on its balance sheet would be to fight inflation but there was no inflation at the time of their last two rate hike decisions the fed should have been cutting rates not raising them but at least by calling off the dogs with their turnabout on future rate hikes the fed enabled commodity prices to rally although they are still too low unfortunately the fed severely damaged its credibility with the financial markets and the voters via its acts of economic malpractice late last year the wild swings in the markets caused by the fed are destabilizing and add risk and uncertainty jerome powell s job is to dampen market volatility not to stimulate it trump saw the perils of excessively tight money before nearly anyone else he said that the rate hikes were colliding with his pro growth tax cut and deregulatory policies and thus preventing the 3 to 4 percent growth that america wants and deserves the trump growth agenda increased global demand for dollars at the very time the fed started pulling back on dollar supply this set in motion the destructive deflation of the last quarter of 2018 that left so many investors standing on the ledge the fed was responsible for the worst december for the stock market in 60 years advertisement what is doubly confounding about the fed inspired financial collapse is that mistakes like this are so easily avoided the fed could have simply adopted the rule that the two of us have been pushing and targeted for stable commodity prices this is the strategy that paul volcker employed in the early 1980s to break the back of hyperinflation had the fed done this the stock market collapse would have been avoided and the real economy wouldn t have been jolted stock prices and the crb index have been highly correlated stock values fell and then rose primarily in nominal terms not in real terms as gauged by the crb index the fed can keep commodity prices stable by selling bonds when prices are rising and buying them when prices are falling investors were pleased when the fed also pulled back on its unwinding of the balance sheet as this also stops the unwise yanking of dollar liquidity out of the market in a deflationary environment many investors are looking at the fed s recent policy switch toward stable money with an attitude of better late than never however that isn t good enough the fed should hardly be congratulated for cleaning up its own mess that s why we want a permanent change in fed monetary policy that will ensure stable money if the fed does this president trump s other economic policies will continue to produce rapid growth advertisement stephen moore is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with freedomworks he is the co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive the american economy
a slowing u s economy and rising u s inflation create a fed dilemma the u s federal reserve since 1977 has been required to follow a dual mandate in which it must simultaneously promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates okay that probably sounds like three goals instead of two but who s counting the problem with achieving any set of two or three goals is that they sometimes conflict with each other if the fed wishes to maintain maximum employment then they may have to sacrifice stable prices and or moderate long term interest rates if they are obsessed with stable inflation and moderate long term interest rates as paul volcker had been during his tenure as fed chief then maximum employment has to be sacrificed at least for two or three years in the new testament book of matthew 6 24 it states that no one can serve two masters either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other this is precisely the dilemma in which the current u s federal reserve finds itself even after a sharp pullback during the final third of 2018 the valuations for u s stocks corporate bonds and real estate remain near their highest levels in history the fed would like to prevent runaway asset inflation which has made these essential wealth builders unaffordable for millennials and many others but it doesn t want to either raise interest rates or continue its treasury tapering program too emphatically if either action would tip the u s economy into recession the quantitative easing plan caused many people to take money out of the bank to buy stocks and corporate bonds while unusually lenient fha mortgage down payment requirements foolishly allowed almost anyone to purchase a home with no down payment thereby generating artificial demand and driving up prices well above income growth what does this imply for the u s economy going forward the fed is boxed into a corner here are the wonderful choices the u s federal reserve can make 1 continue to steadily raise interest rates and to continue its quantitative tightening plan by not reinvesting expiring u s treasuries thus deflating u s asset bubbles while maintaining stable inflation 2 stop raising rates or actually cut them while going back to their previous policy of reinvesting maturing treasuries or 3 some combination where the fed tries to pretend it will raise rates and continue quantitative tightening while actually doing the opposite the problem with the first approach is that it will almost certainly cause a hard landing for the u s economy since merely a return to fair value for u s financial assets and real estate will require huge percentage losses for both the fed s foolishly maintaining near zero overnight lending rates for several years after the u s economy had recovered from the 2007 2009 recession induced u s stocks and u s corporate bonds to trade dangerously above their average inflation adjusted levels of recent decades while real estate prices today as they had been during their 2005 2006 bubble are incredibly inflated and are generally more overvalued than they had been during the previous bubble in many coastal cities in some neighborhoods the ratios of average housing prices to average household incomes are three to four times their long term average levels while even in less overpriced regions real estate prices are well above fair value not only will a regression to the mean cause serious losses but as people see their retirement assets and houses being worth less they will feel poorer this negative wealth effect will by itself create enough of a cutback in spending to cause at least a moderate recession even if there is no increase in unemployment and we enjoy continued steady u s wage growth especially if prices for average consumers climb along with a falling greenback employers will be put under continued social political and media pressure to increase wages especially at the lowest income levels being dovish could be worse than maintaining price stability if the fed is afraid of the above consequences and decides instead of hiking rates to keep them steady while implementing renewed u s treasury purchases as nearly all investors are currently anticipating then this will almost surely encourage a new bout of inflation especially since inflation has been kept under control for decades most investors don t even consider a u s inflationary surge to be a serious threat in 2019 and take for granted that it can t happen one serious risk of the fed s making no rate hikes in 2019 is that postponing rate activity until 2020 will be widely perceived as interfering with the u s election cycle there is a risk that u s treasury yields could climb substantially just as the u s budget deficit is soaring from a combination of increased spending and the disastrous 2018 2020 tax cuts which will be more than reversed but not until 2021 recently over 200 house democrats have been supporting a radical increase in the social security payroll tax newton s third law is proving itself to apply in finance as well as in physics as tax rates in 2021 and beyond will likely far surpass those from the obama administration to reach their highest levels since at least 1980 the fed s balance sheet might be more important than overnight lending rates probably too much attention regarding the fed is focused on whether or not overnight lending rates are changed or not in 2019 and beyond while this is important it is equally critical how the fed adjusts its balance sheet which it had foolishly allowed to balloon far beyond what was required to help lift the u s economy out of its previous recession the fed has trimmed its u s treasury holdings from roughly 4 5 to 4 0 trillion u s dollars since its plan to stop reinvesting expired treasuries began in october 2017 the fed is well aware that their tapering or quantitative tightening is having a contractionary impact on the u s economy and doesn t want to be held responsible for the next recession which is inevitable no matter what the fed does or doesn t do since its quantitative easing had been equivalent to putting the economy on steroids and there is no way to get out of such a mess once you have created it the fed will likely adjust its tapering based upon how financial assets have been recently performing significant declines for u s stocks corporate bonds and or housing prices will likely encourage future fed buying of u s treasuries regardless of the potentially serious long term side effects from such a misguided policy the fed is attempting to act dovishly while talking hawkishly the only realistic way for the fed to thread this needle is to try to convince investors that it will do whatever it takes to fight future asset inflation while actually doing as little as possible in that regard investors will allow themselves to be fooled until either asset prices fall sharply or inflation rises substantially or we suffer a toxic combination of both in 2019 called stagflation like the wizard of oz the illusion of false fed control cannot be maintained indefinitely it s mostly bernanke s and yellen s fault not powell s to be fair to powell it s hardly his fault that he is stuck in this predicament both ben bernanke and janet yellen kept interest rates steady far too long not just by months but by years in any decade prior to the last one the fed would have begun raising rates as early as the final months of 2009 instead of waiting an astonishingly tardy six years later when the first fed hike was made in december 2015 quantitative easing was also a huge failure wildly inflating asset valuations while having minimal impact on average wages and standards of living the economy has persisted so long with subpar growth and subdued inflation that it has encouraged increasing acceptance of the latest absurd economic fantasy known as modern monetary theory essentially concluding that a government can spend indefinitely without creating serious negative side effects one of its primary proponents stephanie kelton has become a rock star in the socialist wing of the democratic party it doesn t require a degree in economics to figure out that continued economic stimulus and overspending implying even greater deficits will necessarily lead to double digit interest rates and soaring inflation within the upcoming decade although the financial markets often act with a delay so this is not necessarily an immediate threat however the fed s loss of credibility and the end of global confidence in the fed s ability to keep raising interest rates has already caused the previously rising u s dollar to begin a downtrend several weeks ago which will likely continue for most of 2019 and perhaps into early 2020 in addition the diminished confidence in u s assets will likely lead to a surprise decline for u s real estate in 2019 which could continue for a few more years no matter what is happening with the economy if we enter a recession at any point than housing prices will probably accelerate their losses the falling u s dollar will help some u s companies with minimal imports and major exports while other u s stocks and corporate bonds will probably disappoint investors in 2019 by forming mostly lower highs for another year or more with many indices like the russell 2000 and the nasdaq composite index remaining well below their all time tops from the final days of august 2018 and eventually accelerating their downtrends probably in 2020 investors are irrationally almost unanimous in expecting no fed action in 2019 according to the fed rate monitor tool even if we go all the way forward to the fed announcement scheduled for october 30 2019 appropriately one day before halloween it is frightening to see the nearly unanimous consensus of a 94 7 projected chance of no change in overnight lending rates over the next nine months only 3 3 of investors expect rates to be hiked once while 2 1 of investors are expecting the fed to make a single rate cut by october 30 2019 even if this amazingly static perception changes later this year it will almost certainly occur too late to reverse the fate of the sliding u s dollar which will probably retreat to multi year bottoms versus many global currencies which investments will perform best with a cornered fed fortunately there is ample past history illustrating how assets worldwide are likely to perform during the upcoming year the russell 2000 is almost certain to remain in its bear market that began from its all time zenith on august 30 2018 which refers not to the magnitude of the percentage loss since then but by the presence of repeated lower highs at key resistance points investors worldwide will become increasingly convinced that the 2018 outperformance by u s assets of all kinds was a temporary response to the sugar high tax cuts and other factors and will lead to underperformance throughout 2019 nearly all developed markets will end the year with much better percentage behavior than u s stocks as u s equity indices probably end with net losses as compared with their current valuations emerging markets in general will likely be among the biggest winners after having suffered significant losses from their january 2018 highs to their fourth quarter 2018 lows since small caps and value shares fell much more than large caps and growth names throughout 2018 2019 will likely reverse that kind of behavior with notable significant gains for small caps and smaller mid cap shares which had become the most glaringly undervalued other kinds of assets which benefit the most from a falling u s dollar such as commodity producers will probably be among the top winners of 2019 as the u s dollar declines and the fed mostly watches u s inflation by early 2020 could increase to its highest level since 2008 here are specific exchange traded funds which should be major 2019 winners small cap non u s stock funds which had fallen sharply in 2018 such as ashs small cap china and scif small cap india will likely be among those assets which enjoy the largest percentage gains in 2019 other funds which fit into this category are ewgs small cap germany and rsxj small cap russia in the energy sector funds which intentionally avoid large cap favorites like xes mid cap energy services and psce small cap energy are already surging in price from their lows around christmas mining shares which usually perform well at this stage during u s equity markets sticking with the small and mid cap theme include gdxj mid cap gold silver mining remx rare earth extraction ura uranium mining and copx copper mining two related securities which usually outperform at this point of the economic cycle are sea sea shipping and slx steel manufacturing assets which had become irrationally undervalued in 2018 will tend to be among 2019 s biggest winners chinese equities sported price earnings ratios averaging between 8 and 9 as of january 3 2019 with ashr large cap china probably not increasing as much as ashs in the upcoming year but providing a high degree of liquidity other bargains in asia include pak pakistan vnm vietnam and jof small cap japan closed end europe features a surprising number of compelling purchases as overblown political fears over merkel s decision not to run for re election the brexit fiasco parisian yellow vests and parliamentary wrangling in italy and elsewhere have created bargains for ewg germany ewi otcpk italy epol poland ewq france ewn netherlands ewk belgium ewd sweden ewo austria and much disliked grek greece which perhaps has the greatest potential upside with the usual somewhat justified fears over greek government insolvency with their lowest valuations in decades relative to u s equities investors are finally noticing europe s worthwhile equity undervaluations for those who prefer less risk emerging market government bond funds including eld and lemb are likely to continue to provide above average gains with yields roughly twice those of the united states and with limited potential downside there will be disheartening disappointments u s stocks overall will mostly disappoint investors especially as many of them have already experienced the lion s share of their total 2019 gains while emerging market shares and commodity related securities listed above will continue to form higher lows and higher highs for most of 2019 and perhaps into 2020 u s equities as soon as the second quarter of 2019 could form lower highs as compared with their eventual first quarter peaks this would be consistent with past u s equity bear markets u s bonds both corporate and otherwise will likely also disappoint investors long dated u s treasuries like many u s equity indices could actually experience overall net losses for the remainder of 2019 it is not often that u s stocks and u s treasuries both end up with overall net losses during the same calendar year but 2019 could be such an occasion and will definitely disappoint those who have typical vanilla 60 40 portfolio allocations or are following other boglehead style approaches just as blind passive index investing had become a trendy fad in recent years it will be a major loser until this strategy becomes unpopular again finally i can t fail to mention that the new england patriots victory in the super bowl is notoriously bearish for u s equity indices with the u s stock market probably ending 2019 below its levels from the date of the super bowl on february 3 2019 the real danger arises in 2020 not 2019 the major problem with the fed waiting six years too long before raising interest rates will come to roost not in 2019 but in 2020 when global risk asset rebounds run their course near the end of this year or in the early part of 2020 and transition to downtrends we are likely to enter a worldwide recession in 2020 because u s interest rates are so low this deeply into the expansion there is much less room to cut them with the fed already holding a huge balance sheet even after the tapering process the fed also cannot intervene significantly in any other manner with so little ammunition available the fed will end up mostly observing the acceleration of the u s equity bear market in 2020 rather than being an active participant one could even argue as richard fisher has done that the primary purpose of the fed is to raise rates aggressively during an economic expansion so they have much more flexibility in making rate cuts during a subsequent economic downturn the overall top to bottom descent for u s equity indices in 2018 2020 could therefore end up being among the greatest total percentage losses since the extremely volatile period from 1929 through 1942 u s political uncertainty throughout 2020 with primary elections followed by the general presidential and congressional elections on november 3 2020 will tend to exacerbate investors fear and encourage new all time record net fund outflows whenever we are experiencing the next major bear market bottoming pattern perhaps in the second half of 2020 real estate valuations will probably take roughly two additional years after that before they finally complete their nadirs
once in a century storms tsunamis and earthquakes now threaten life and resources around the world on a regular basis disasters upend civic life and threaten the public order but disaster relief operations often double as contests over the authority of the state to govern recent histories of disaster relief in developing nations reveal that claims about scientific knowledge and technological sophistication hold the key to defending political authority in the anthropocene disasters live in public memory and the historical record through narratives that tell us whom to blame how to survive and who can best answer these questions building these narratives is part of the work of disaster management a specialised field whose experts often depict their mandate as a perennial cycle characterised by successive phases of preparedness post disaster relief and recovery and finally reconstruction a phase that sets up the next round of preparedness efforts popular reporting about disasters in poorer and developing countries usually begins with the spectacle and focuses on post event relief and reconstruction operations these accounts follow a straightforward narrative they acknowledge the absence or failure of early warning systems and explain that the affected society was vulnerable to natural hazards because of developmental failures outdated scientific expertise and political resistance to global best practices having established the problem and its likely causes media coverage shifts to describe the efforts of the international community in coordinating the flow of aid knowledge and technology into the affected region finally reports quote foreign leaders and experts proclaiming that much of the damage could have been avoided by investing in social resilience and empowering civil society to counter governmental inefficiencies neglect corruption and arbitrariness these accounts drawing a direct relationship between developmental and technological deficiencies the state s legitimacy to govern and its moral obligation to seek foreign assistance highlight the insight that political legitimacy is historically a function of scientific knowledge and expertise for centuries rulers have understood that their authority is sustained by the perceived reliability of knowledge claims and their ability to regulate society s relationship with nature louis xiv s france unable to quell outbreaks of plague defended its authority by insisting that the widespread deaths were not the result of a disease but a consequence of commoners unhygienic ways of life low moral character and irrationality similarly victorian colonisers argued that savages unable to master natural hazards needed colonial rule for their own protection in our time governments play the same hand when they characterise migrants and refugees as unintelligent disease ridden and morally tainted swarms that threaten natural resources dishonour national values and compromise citizen s prosperity and wellbeing problems of nature cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the problems of society to claim authority over the one is to take responsibility for the other so what is the political sovereignty of vulnerable nations worth in the era of climate change how is it defended or lost india s handling of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and haiti s manhandling by international actors following the 2010 earthquake bookend the possibilities on 26 december 2004 a rupture in the sumatra andaman fault resulted in a 9 3 richter seismic scale magnitude earthquake that rippled across the indian ocean it caused rapid uplift and subsidence of land masses soil liquefaction and mud volcanoes the tsunami that followed washed over the maldives myanmar thailand indonesia sri lanka and malaysia and reached southern india a few hours after the quake two hours after the tsunami struck the andaman and nicobar islands the indian government in new delhi became aware of the initial quake but not the tsunami headed its way india did not have an early warning system in place and a series of communication disruptions prevented the government from warning citizens a mere 40 minutes after the government first learned of the quake around 9am the first waves arrived in the southeastern state of tamil nadu in 2004 tamil nadu s average population density was 495 people per square kilometre 1 282 people per square mile an hour later the second and third waves followed they were far more destructive they arrived as 15 metre high walls of water that killed 12 405 people along the coastline alone in all the earthquake and tsunami claimed more than 250 000 people including those missing and displaced a further 2 million india was caught unaware and hit hard with the tsunami destroying fishing villages and hamlets before moving inland the devastation moved the united nations un to make a flash appeal for 1 86 billion in aid but the flow of international aid was almost immediately arrested by the indian state s concern with self sufficiency the government activated a disaster management group to oversee relief operations it deployed 2 400 civil servants to assist affected areas and distributed some 11 000 metric tons of relief supplies civilian political leaders called for public shows of unity and sought financial support from the reserve bank of india the private sector philanthropists and civil society institutions it pressured insurance companies to make quick settlements india was not a failed or rogue state but simply incompetent and unreasonable india marshalled the military to disaster relief on a war footing 4 000 troops 25 aircrafts and 30 helicopters transported food personnel supplies and evacuees to and from affected regions within india as well as the andaman and nicobar islands 30 navy frigates carried food and emergency provisions to the andaman islands and sri lanka all told the government committed roughly 250 million and pledged 7 billion indian rupees roughly 159 million in 2004 to reconstruction efforts within its territory 23 million in aid to sri lanka and the maldives and 500 000 in relief to thailand it joined a un coordinated international effort to assist with tsunami relief efforts across the indian ocean region at the same time the state refused to accept relief workers experts or aid from other governments and international organisations it denied travel permits to foreign aid workers and journalists and used the military to secure strategically sensitive spaces including inhabited islands struck by the tsunami international institutions ngos and the western media chastised the indian government s handling of the situation the then us president george w bush praised india s response but noted that officials had refused 3 1 million in disaster aid other critics noted that the state failed to appreciate people s needs and recover in accordance with global standards and best practices the indian state s knowledge and technological deficiencies had prevented risk assessment and evacuation blunted relief operations and possibly jeopardised long term recovery and preparedness projects india was not a failed state or a rogue state it was simply incompetent and unreasonable shortcomings that directly challenged one of the hallmarks of sovereignty exclusive control over its people and natural circumstances some experts of indian origin such as the economist jagdish bhagwati at columbia university in new york defended india as a confident and responsible sovereign others tried to burnish state authority by linking it to technological progress anirban basu a state policy advisor said india is not just a technical leader in south asia and southeast asia but a leader in taking up the tsunami warning system since independence india has dutifully followed an agenda of modernisation at some significant costs but which has also produced world renowned scientific institutions and generations of experts this legacy earned india significant credibility as a nation capable of mastering disaster relief and preparedness systems for the future eighteen days after the tsunami arrived india agreed to a scientific and internationalist governance programme it consented to develop early warning and web based information management systems including a national spatial data infrastructure on the one hand and a comprehensive disaster management law as well as transparent and sustained relief distribution processes on the other this commitment transformed these processes and systems into standard expectations of responsible states across the developing world by 2015 india s self sufficiency narrative compelled shamshad akhtar the un under secretary general and executive secretary of the un economic and social commission for asia and the pacific escap to declare early warning is a particularly promising area of collaboration for the government of india and escap as india is a leader in this field the rest of the region can benefit tremendously from india s resources skills and expertise the same year india and escap signed a 1 million partnership to develop early warning systems for coastal hazards including tsunamis coastal zone flooding storm surges and tropical cyclones across asia and the pacific in contrast to india s apparent demonstration of competency in disaster relief reforms haiti presented a different story in january 2010 a 7 3 richter seismic scale magnitude earthquake near port au prince showed a country empty of scientific competency and incapable of meaningful assertions of political sovereignty the january 2010 quake is estimated to have killed between 112 000 and 230 000 people injured some 300 000 and left another 1 1 5 million homeless across a population of some 9 million one in 15 was killed and only one in 16 588 rescued property damage neared 14 billion the government estimated that the national gdp would drop by 8 5 per cent while the inter american development bank projected the cost of rebuilding infrastructure at 8 1 billion haiti had neither an early warning system nor local evacuation plans population density poverty poor urban planning and unstable public infrastructure all contributed to the death and devastation that followed the country had long been subject to extreme natural hazards as well as more than five centuries of colonial or imperial domination after the earthquake the haitian government quickly re established a stable supply of fuel and water it restored cashflow to banks within a week two of the country s four damaged electrical plants were operational in a month within days however national rescue relief and recovery operations were overwhelmed by the involvement of the us and the international community despite having no experience in disaster relief the us southern command took control of operations in coordination with the us state department and the us agency for international development usaid the military secured the airport at port au prince prioritising us aircrafts carrying more than 20 000 troops while redirecting supplies and emergency personnel from the world food programme and doctors without borders to the dominican republic the scale and character of the us intervention caused france to accuse the us of attempting to occupy haiti in march 2010 international donors demanded that aid not go directly to the haitian government the haitian parliament relented approving legislation that transferred political authority to a us led interim haiti reconstruction commission ihrc haiti was in effect coerced into relinquishing a vital part of its sovereignty the ability to make knowledge claims and policy determinations about the present and future of its people and resources the former us president bill clinton and the then haitian prime minister jean max bellerive chaired the ihrc of 26 members two non voting seats were held for local ngos the us canada france and the european union got individual votes while the caribbean community and common market shared a single vote public officials received the same voting power as international ngos operating in haiti by 2010 a legion of foreign ngos ran 80 per cent of haiti s public services with usaid and world bank grants while drawing experts away from public service with higher compensation and reputational gains in effect disaster relief operations began by treating the haitian government as incompetent and untrustworthy virtually all international disaster relief aid was spent on foreign institutions and experts foreign ihrc members were chosen by a pay to play ritual members agreed to invest at least 100 million in haiti s reconstruction over two years or offer 200 million in debt relief the ihrc controlled haiti s finances and directed recovery and reconstruction efforts but it was not politically accountable to haitians its decisions were automatically confirmed unless rejected by haiti s president in keeping with world bank and imf policies in the 1990s the ihrc proceeded to develop an assembly industry capitalising on cheap surplus labour and enforced trade liberalisation policies backed by investment in large agribusinesses to supply coffee and mangoes to the export market the disaster relief specialists did not try to strengthen haiti s scientific and technological capacity us corporations not haitian managed clean up the ihrc authorised the world bank to manage the haiti reconstruction fund where the bulk of international donations were collected only spain and venezuela offered cash support to the haitian government donors cited the state s technocratic incapacity mismanagement and generalised inefficiency to justify donating to the reconstruction fund and not the government virtually all international disaster relief aid was spent on foreign institutions and experts the government received less than a cent for every dollar of available us relief more than 7 per cent of usaid funds went to private contractors with influence in washington dc of 1 500 housing reconstruction contracts amounting to 267 million awarded by the us only 20 about 4 3 million went to haitian firms at least 75 per cent of bilateral aid went to nonstate actors and multilateral agencies yet by january 2011 less than half of the reconstruction aid pledged by foreign donors had been paid only 2 074 of the 180 000 damaged homes had been repaired most of the urban rubble in port au prince remained on the ground while around 800 000 haitians settled into makeshift camps outside the city the un in turn trusted its own agencies foreign ngos and corporations to attend to restoring public utilities and services meetings took place inside the port au prince airport secured by armed personnel haitians were physically barred from participating in meetings much less decisions those present at the cluster meetings found them to be disorganised and inefficient exercises in exchanging logistical information in march 2010 only 17 5 per cent of haitians surveyed trusted the ihrc s goals and priorities in december the 12 haitian members of the ihrc wrote a scathing letter to bill clinton describing their marginalisation within the commission in april 2011 40 haitian social organisations chastised the ihrc for extending centuries of coercion and dependence a callback to colonial discourses that justified benevolent dictatorships by claiming scientific and thus moral superiority over subjugated people and their resources foreign intervention in disaster relief challenges state sovereignty however the international community tries to justify this challenge it is always a strike against the state s ability to balance social demands and natural forces a popular scholarly understanding of the sovereign is as an authority capable of declaring emergencies and making law for exceptional times but disasters are emergencies because they unsettle established assertions of competence and authority disaster relief in turn is a contest to supplant the monopoly on knowledge and expertise that provides the basis for state sovereignty a failed state for instance is not defined by poverty and poor urban planning or even delayed disaster relief it signals a loss of confidence in the state s ability to govern its subjects and manage environmental circumstances a collective heckling from foreign governments international organisations and the media that threatens to drown out the state s soliloquy of knowledge and self sufficiency exactly when in the aftermath of disaster it is most needed on 28 september 2018 the indonesian island of sulawesi suffered a 7 5 magnitude richter seismic scale earthquake indonesia sits within the ring of fire a volatile tectonic region since 2017 there have been 200 earthquakes with a magnitude of 6 or greater around the world and indonesia has endured 19 of them sulawesi a poor province in indonesia has suffered many earthquakes tsunamis and volcanic eruptions over the past half century the quake struck near the provincial

killing 2 000 injuring 11 000 others displacing 87 300 and damaging public services and 67 000 homes solicitation and refusal of foreign help invite an examination of the state in the aftermath media commentary examined the crisis from two perspectives first it investigated the state s technical competence to handle preparedness and hazard mitigation the answer predictably focused on the mismanagement and subsequent failure of the country s early warning system second the commentary scrutinised the legal and political rationale underlying relief and recovery decisions did indonesia as it had in the past refuse foreign relief workers aid and expertise in a show of sovereign authority in 2018 the indonesian state solicited foreign aid and assistance with disaster relief this step saved the country from facing the kinds of challenges endured by india and haiti in effect both solicitation and refusal of foreign assistance invite an examination of the state s mastery of scientific knowledge and thus its character as a moral guardian of society soon after however the indonesian government fearing it would be perceived as incompetent tightened its grip on international aid and asked foreign workers to leave once again complicating the future of disaster relief climate change and anthropocene discourses are a mix of scientific and political claims about the past present and future regulation of social demands and natural limits they foresee an era in which the relationship between professions of scientific knowledge and technological capacity on the one hand and moral and political authority on the other is destined to deepen to know the world is to rule it or at least survive it this is why the un intergovernmental panel on climate change a body of faceless unelected scientists and technocrats has emerged as a global political authority whose pronouncements have the power to influence the agendas of democratically elected governments around the world the stories of india and haiti exemplify the stakes of political sovereignty in our time they reflect the terms of engagement under which poorer and politically weaker nations will have to fight for the right to govern themselves come hell or high water

thank you monique and good morning everyone as many of you already know in december we celebrated the one year anniversary of the closing of the bard transaction together with bard we accelerated our strategy to provide our customers and their patients with leading medical technologies and innovative solutions we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year it is evident that the combination of bd and bard is delivering value to our customers patients and shareholders turning to slide 5 and our first quarter highlights we are very pleased with the strong start to fiscal 2019 as we stated in our pre announcement in mid january our first quarter results were ahead of our previous expectations largely driven by the timing of certain tax items as well as better than expected performance across all three segments our results reflect continued momentum across our businesses and regions and strong margin expansion after a very strong q4 in 2018 our integration of bard is on track and we are continuing to realize cost and revenue synergies as expected during the quarter we held our first combined sales training meetings in every region of the world there was tremendous energy and excitement about the opportunity we have to make a difference in the lives of others we are already seeing traction with our combined biosurgery and infection prevention sales force in europe which is evident in our financial results we are also making good progress integrating and simplifying our systems and processes which delivers costs savings and helps associates work more efficiently we are leveraging bd s shared service centers and the infrastructure investments we made during the care fusion integration by bringing legacy bard associates onto our it finance and hr operating systems and technologies we ve also made progress with supply chain efficiencies and also with our real estate footprint combining bd and bard sites in several key locations including our new jersey headquarters looking forward to the total year we expect continued momentum and are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 revenue and eps guidance i will now turn things over to chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our fiscal year 2019 guidance christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration thanks vince and good morning everyone moving on to slide 7 i ll review our first quarter revenue and eps results as well as the key financial highlights as vince mentioned we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2019 first quarter revenues grew 5 2 on a comparable currency neutral basis this includes a pricing decline of about 20 basis points which was in line with our expectations first quarter revenue growth was driven by mid single digit growth across all three segments at the business unit level there are some puts and takes which are driven by year over year comparisons along with timing within this fiscal year when we adjust for these items we still drove total company revenue growth of over 5 on an underlying basis i ll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when i take you through the results by segment and geography adjusted eps of 2 70 grew 8 9 or 14 9 on a currency neutral basis as we stated in our pre announcement this was ahead of our previous expectations as the quarter benefited from some timing within the year related to certain tax items in addition performance was better than expected across all three segments we also continued to delever during the first quarter paying down approximately 400 million of debt as a result our gross leverage ratio declined to 3 8x as of december 31st we continue to be on target to achieve our commitment to deleverage to below 3x over three years moving on to slide 8 i ll review our medical segment revenue growth bd medical first quarter revenues increased 5 2 revenues in medication delivery solutions or mds grew 2 9 driven by strength in vascular access and infusion disposable performance in mds reflects a tough comparison to the prior year in the u s revenues in medication management solutions or mms grew 6 7 growth in mms was driven by stronger than expected capital placements in infusion diabetes care revenues grew 0 6 revenue growth was impacted by the timing of distributor orders in the u s and the timing of tenders in ema orders that were anticipated to occur in the first quarter are now expected to occur over the second and third fiscal quarters revenues in pharmaceutical systems grew 15 7 driven by strong demand for core products and continued growth in sais performance also reflects the favorable timing of customer ordering patterns which benefited the first quarter and is expected to negatively impact growth in the second quarter turning to slide 9 and the bd life sciences segment first quarter revenues increased 4 7 this includes a headwind of approximately 50 basis points related to the strength of last year s flu season as expected as you re aware the timing and severity of the flu season can impact our year over year comparisons revenues in diagnostic systems grew 2 7 performance was driven by our instrumented microbiology platforms including blood culture and idast and our bd max molecular platform performance in diagnostic systems reflects a tough comparison to the prior year for kiestra installations as well as a headwind of approximately 130 basis points related to the flu grow over preanalytical systems revenues grew 7 6 growth was aided by recent capacity additions that have eased constraints on the supply of push button collection sets as well as the timing of distributor orders biosciences revenues grew 3 6 growth was driven by research reagents as well as growth in newer instruments such as the facslyric performance in biosciences reflects the unfavorable timing of tenders in ema now turning to slide 10 and the bd interventional segment first quarter revenues increased 5 7 revenues in peripheral intervention or pi grew 0 6 as we expected this reflects a tough comparison to the prior year which included sales related to a distribution agreement that has since ended on an underlying basis growth remained strong and in line with our full year expectations in terms of dcbs performance was in line with our expectations and we did not see a negative impact as a result of the paclitaxel study released in december performance in pi also reflects strong growth in oncology products particularly in emerging markets and china first quarter revenue growth in surgery was 10 this reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year related to progel we continue to receive a very positive response to progel being reintroduced in the market performance in surgery also reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year in our hernia business related to hurricane maria which partially reverses in the second quarter we are also pleased that our hernia business has regained almost all of its share following the hurricane growth in the surgery unit also includes strong performance in infection prevention in europe where we expanded our direct sales presence as part of our revenue synergy investment revenues in urology and critical care or ucc grew 7 3 performance in ucc was driven by new products in acute care urology as well as strength in our homecare and targeted temperature management businesses now moving on to slide 11 i ll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter u s revenues grew 6 this is above our normal growth rate and primarily reflects strong growth in mms and pharmaceutical systems within the bd medical segment preanalytical systems in bd life sciences segment and surgery and ucc in the bd interventional segment as discussed previously moving on to international revenues grew 4 1 strong performance in asia pac and latin america was partially offset by lower growth in europe due to kiestra and pharmaceutical systems order timing as well as a tough comparison to the prior year and timing of tenders in ema as previously discussed developed market revenues grew 4 7 driven by strong performance in the u s revenues in emerging markets grew 7 8 performance was driven by growth of 13 3 in china and double digit growth in latin america partially offset by ema as previously discussed growth in china reflects strength across the life science and interventional segments as expected performance in the medical segment in china was slightly ahead of our expectations due to the geography of orders in pharmaceutical systems turning to slide 12 which recaps the first quarter income statement as discussed revenues grew 5 2 in the quarter on a comparable basis and 37 1 as reported moving down the p l gross profit improved during the quarter increasing 42 8 year over year i ll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment ssg a as a percentage of revenues was 25 7 which reflects bard s higher ssg a spend profile partially offset by the achievement of synergies r d as a percentage of revenues was 6 1 which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation operating margins increased 80 basis points or 170 basis points on a currency neutral basis we continue to deliver significant operating margin expansion which reflects strong p l leverage as the new bd our tax rate was 11 2 in the quarter which is significantly below our full year guidance range due to the timing of some discrete items as expected we paid preferred dividends of 38 million in the quarter as we have been discussing the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation in the quarter adjusted earnings per share were 2 70 which is an 8 9 increase versus the prior year or 14 9 basis now turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter gross profit margin was a strong 56 3 in the quarter on a performance basis gross profit margin improved by 230 basis points this reflects the inclusion of bard s more robust gross margin profile as well as our continuous improvement initiatives cost synergies and favorable mix these items were partially offset by headwinds from raw materials and pricing currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points on gross profit margin as expected operating margin grew 80 basis points in the quarter or 170 basis points on a currency neutral basis margin expansion was driven primarily by gross margin improvement combined with synergy capture currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points on operating margin in the quarter i ll take you through our fiscal 2019 guidance over the next several slides but while we re discussing margins i d like to point out that we continue to expect to deliver margin expansion of 100 150 basis points on a currency neutral basis this is in addition to significant margin expansion of approximately 750 basis points over the last five years now moving on to slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2019 guidance as we discussed while there are a number of moving pieces within the year our underlying performance is strong and we have reaffirmed our revenue guidance we continue to expect total company revenue growth of 5 6 on a comparable currency neutral basis by segment we expect bd medical revenues to grow between 5 6 bd life sciences to grow between 4 5 which includes a headwind of approximately 90 basis points related to the flu and bd interventional to grow between 6 7 we continue to anticipate developed market growth of 4 5 and growth of about 10 in emerging markets driven by a diversified base with low double digit growth in china and strength in ema and latin america moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2019 eps guidance we have also reaffirmed our adjusted eps guidance on the left side of the chart you see that we continue to expect strong underlying growth driven by revenue growth and robust operating performance as well as the benefit from a lower tax rate due in part to the achievement of tax synergies partially offsetting this growth are a number of headwinds first while the pressure from raw materials has eased slightly we continue to expect a headwind of about 2 in addition we continue to expect an impact of about 1 from tariffs which includes the postponement of the increase from the 10 rate to a 25 rate we continue to work with our partners to minimize the unfavorable impact to the company going forward our guidance also continues to assume a normal flu season in contrast to the severe flu in fiscal 2018 which results in a headwind of about 1 in fiscal 2019 the majority of which will occur in the second fiscal quarter the divestiture of advanced bioprocessing at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and the annualization of the divestitures to merit medical will also impact our eps growth in fiscal 2019 on a currency neutral basis our strong underlying performance is expected to drive adjusted eps growth of 13 14 despite the pressure from headwinds and divestitures based on current rates we continue to expect currency will be a sizable headwind of about 3 5 in fiscal 2019 this assumes a euro to dollar of 1 14 all in we continue to expect to deliver adjusted eps of 12 05 12 15 which represents growth of approximately 10 now from a phasing perspective we continue to expect revenue and eps growth to be weighted toward the back half of the year and as a result of the timing of a few items within the year that are impacting growth we are providing explicit guidance for the second fiscal quarter starting with the top line we expect revenue growth to be below our full year guidance range by about 100 basis points driven primarily by the flu comparison on the bottom line in addition to the unfavorable impact from raw materials and tariffs we now expect the headwind from fx will be most pronounced in the second quarter due to profit and inventory we also assume a tax rate at or above our full year guidance range however as we saw this quarter the tax rate can fluctuate depending on a number of items including the possibility of special items arising in the quarter based on these variables we expect eps to be between 2 50 2 60 in the second quarter now turning to slide 17 the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2019 remain unchanged we continue to expect to achieve approximately 100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2019 and we are committed to fully realizing 300 million in annualized cost synergies over the three year deal period we re excited about the momentum we have across our businesses and are confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond now i d like to turn the call back over to vince who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris turning to slide 19 and our planned product launches by segment as you can see on this slide we have a rich pipeline of planned product launches in fiscal 2019 across our segments there are a number of things we continue to be excited about i ll touch on just a few of the recent launches here starting with the bd medical segment we recently launched two new cloud based applications bd healthsight data manager and bd healthsight diversion analytics both are part of the bd healthsight platform that enables an enterprisewide connected medication management system the data manager application simplifies the management of drug formularies for customers by allowing for a consistent understanding of every drug s identity across all bd devices and customer sites the diversion analytics application is designed to help hospitals and health systems identify potential narcotic drug diversion through the use of augmented intelligence and integrated workflows we are pleased with the strong customer interest in healthsight as the number of customer sites adopting the platform continues to accelerate these newest applications are attracting even stronger demand and are already getting traction in the marketplace regarding our type 2 patch pump as expected we submitted our regulatory approval applications for the u s and europe and continue to anticipate our early access launch will occur late in calendar year 2019 we continue to be excited about bringing this differentiated solution to the market for people living with type 2 diabetes in the bd life science segment we recently received u s fda clearance of the bd phoenix cpo detect test and the bd max enteric viral panel bd max continues to perform very well and drive growth in this segment growing over 30 this past quarter the bd phoenix cpo detect test expands bd s portfolio of solutions for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of infections caused by cpos cpos or superbugs as they are more commonly called represent a prominent threat to public health because these dangerous microbes are often resistant to nearly all available antibiotics this new test gives laboratories an accurate and cost effective method to rapidly identify cpos and support patient management and is another example of the company s commitment to providing solutions that help address the global burden of amr with the approval of the bd max enteric viral panel bd now offers a broad suite of solutions of the detection of intestinal conditions of bacterial viral and parasitic origin in clinically relevant targeted panels with this launch bd s suite of assays for diagnosing gastrointestinal conditions will provide clinicians with greater flexibility for more efficient and cost effective patient management in the bd interventional segment as expected wavelinq our solution that provides a minimally invasive nonsurgical option for creating critical av fistulas for hemodialysis procedures launched in the u s in the first quarter we are pleased with the early results and feedback and look forward to introducing our next generation product later in the year regarding lutonix btk as you are aware the first releases of our ide trial data for our lutonix 014 drug coated balloon with a below the knee indication were provided at the viva and veith meetings in late 2018 the data has been well received and continues to generate interest and excitement in the marketplace we have also continued to work with the fda toward regulatory approval and our projected timelines remain on track for commercialization by the end of fiscal year 2019 in addition to lutonix btk we also continue to look forward to several new products later this year that will enhance growth in the interventional segment including venovo venous stent and the covera stent graft fistula indication as you can see we have a rich pipeline of new products across our businesses and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way before i move on i would like to remind you that we have again included a slide in the appendix of today s presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives we hope you find the information useful in understanding bd s commitment to this important topic moving on to slide 20 i would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today we are very pleased with the strong start to fiscal year 2019 our results reflect continued momentum across our businesses and regions strong margin expansion and excellent execution by our bd associates i want to thank all of our bd associates for their tremendous efforts on behalf of our customers their patients and our shareholders you ve done an outstanding job the integration of bard is on track and we are confident in our ability to achieve our cost and revenue synergy commitments new product innovation is continuing to fuel growth and we are excited about the robust pipeline across our businesses in summary we have a significant opportunity to deliver innovative healthcare solutions to our customers and their patients around the world looking forward i am confident that we will deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond thank you we will now open our call to questions questions and answers operator at this time if you would like to ask an audio question please press 1 on your touchtone phone we do request that you limit your questions to one question and one follow up question one moment for your first question your first question comes from the line of brian weinstein with william blair brian weinstein william blair partner good morning thanks for taking the question i thought we could just start with the phasing throughout the year just trying to understand that a little bit better first half versus second half is this any different than what you originally thought and can you talk about your confidence on the acceleration that s needed that looks like you have to do mid to high sixes in the back half of the year to get to the midpoint of the revenue guidance so can you talk about your confidence on the acceleration there and dig into the drivers a bit more both on the top line as well as on the bottom line thanks vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer i ll start and then i ll turn it over to chris for some more detail we feel good about it this is how we expected the year to play out with the exception of course of the tax item that occurred in the fourth quarter but if i go to operating results this is pretty much what we thought would happen of course we knew we had the large flu coming up that we had to jump over in the second quarter we did a little better in the first quarter than expected as you heard in our remarks but we always knew that the back end of the year the second half of the year we were going to see higher growth and accelerating eps and that s driven by actually all three segments and improving performance across each there was a bunch of timing things that happened in the first quarter that chris will walk you through but you re going to see strong performance across all three segments the phase in of the cost synergies in the second half and then fx turns around as well so chris those are high level comments over to you christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration sure i think vince covered most of the points it is in line with what we expected with a couple of adjustments in terms of timing for q1 to q2 so for example the higher tax rate in q2 is to be expected considering 11 tax rate in q1 so there ll be some catch up there fx will be a little bit worse in q2 than we had originally expected and we know there are some other offsets to that but that ll hit us mostly in the second quarter and then pharm systems growing nearly 16 in the first quarter there ll be some bounce back on that in the second quarter but the first half of the year just about where we would have expected in terms of the rest of the year ramping we did expect that and we re very confident in that on the revenue side we ve got a lot of new product launches in the pipeline across the business you ve got wavelinq product that we talked about from the tva acquisition venovo covera and lutonix 018 and even some btk upside potential progel as we said is doing well and our reintroduction of that product is going very well as you know we have revenue synergies ramping in the back half of the year and then on the p l side fx abates in the second half and you start getting the cost synergies ramping so all of those things give us great confidence in the second half of the year and we re very comfortable with the full year guidance it is a little bit lumpy and that s what we had expected vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer brian just to add one or two more comments on the life science side what you saw in the first quarter is a bunch of cd4 tenders that got shifted to later in the year that s going to improve life sciences growth it also negatively impacted ema in the first quarter that s going to come back in the second part of the year as well and then you saw some kiestra timing that s going to help so there s a whole bunch of things across the segments here playing out that way and then lastly on the medical side we re expecting continued strong growth in mms as we do well both in dispensing but in particular on the pump side of things and pharm systems is going to continue to be strong for the year there ll be a lumpiness next quarter but then bounce back so those are a whole bunch of things that are going on and maybe alberto you want to comment on what s happening in the pump space alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment yeah thanks good morning yes we were feeling very pleased about the performance and very confident on the mms side this quarter in particular and for the rest of the year on the infusion side we re seeing continued above market growth we do feel very confident that we are gaining category share in infusion in the u s a lot of it has to do with great acceptance of our refreshed alaris m2 pump with our complete focus on interoperability where we are seeing now 350 live sites in interoperability and that s not that is a very difficult operational thing to pull off as we know by experience and i think we ve dialed in now the process and we re expanding interoperability beyond cerner and epic to new platforms as well meditech and allscripts and the last element that i think is driving the business as well is what i would call more horizontal interoperability as we put into play all our platforms and our healthsight analytics platform that leverages all our platforms together not only the pumps but it gives a lot of visibility across the different platforms it s really engaging our customers and providing us nice wins in the marketplace so very pleased with the performance of that business vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer thanks alberto and of course we grew 6 7 after we had such a strong quarter in the business last year we moved 50 million ahead and a bunch of that was pumps so i think overall that should give you a good sense across the segments chris do you have anything else you wanted to add christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration nope i think that covers it vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer great thanks brian for the question operator your next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo lawrence biegelsen wells fargo analyst good morning thanks for taking the question one question on emerging markets one follow up question on mms so on emerging markets vince growth was 7 8 this quarter slightly softer versus recent quarters the outlook is still 10 for fiscal 2019 why the confidence there and then just a follow up on mms obviously very strong this quarter after 23 growth in the u s in q4 so maybe could you give us a little bit more color on share gain that you expect this year versus last year in pumps and pyxis thanks for taking the questions vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer sure i ll talk to emerging markets yeah we re confident in emerging markets and what you actually saw was a decrease in ema which was actually two things a strong comp but also these tenders which have moved from the first quarter into the second third and fourth and so we re going to see a very strong bounce back in ema we have the orders that s why i am so confident it s a matter of course of setting up the financing which is something that takes up a bit of time to do so you look at that latin america was strong right at double digits and of course china was strong and did extremely well so it was really just ema and that bounce back that we have visibility to gives me the confidence so alberto a little bit more on share gains and also how we re doing with pyxis too you ve been talking about the pumps alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment yes in terms of the category shares it s very consistent with what we ve said before which is slightly accelerating share gains more toward 200 basis points in infusion and closer to 100 basis points on the pyxis side on the dispensing side and in dispensing and pyxis we really are supporting our core platform with a lot of new launches pyxis logistics pyxis iv prep for the pharmacy and pyxis supply as well that happened last quarter so there s a lot of things together with our overall platform again healthsight is the overall envelope if you like that really helps us in some of the conversions so also a good performance on the pyxis side vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer okay great so you get the sense that our new business model which we put in place a year ago is really working for us and larry thanks for the questions lawrence biegelsen wells fargo analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david lewis with morgan stanley david lewis morgan stanley managing director good morning just two questions from me vince i appreciate the comments on the peripheral business this morning but given the investor focus there it sounds like most of the momentum deceleration there is really the distributor dynamic maybe just talk about your confidence in sustaining growth in that business prior to the btk launch and why you re convinced that there s been no clinical response to the recent paclitaxel toxicity concerns and then maybe for chris just a little more detail we think about the earnings dynamics this year you laid down a lot of headwinds and tailwinds some of those headwinds in our mind look a little less significant just given where you came in here in the first quarter your confidence in the back half of the year by our math i think there could have been a little more upside to the earnings guidance potentially this early in the year but you held the earnings guidance just talk about the pacing of earnings and your confidence in that earnings number and the headwinds and tailwinds into the back half thanks so much vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer so chris will talk first and then simon will talk about the business question christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration sure thanks david so in terms of the headwinds i would say that the headwinds for resin costs as we said are getting a little bit better as is the tariffs but both of those have to flow through the inventory so you re really not picking up all that much this year and we would expect that to be offset by a little bit worse on the fx side as you see the dollar continue to strengthen not only against the euro the 1 16 versus 1 14 metric there doesn t seem to be too much but it s pretty much against every other currency around the world so that s a little bit worse so on balance that evens out and in terms of the guidance it s still very early in the year and we still have the flu season which is a big variable that we re watching as well so it feels like the headwinds and tailwinds are balancing each other and it s a bit early to call the flu season simon campion executive vice president and president interventional segment good morning david simon here so at a macro level we do have a lot of confidence in our projections going forward for pi we have several new product launches that are coming up not least btk but also venovo and the covera fistula indication so we re coming in just where we thought for q1 notwithstanding some of the comments that chris made earlier on so our confidence is high as we move through the rest of the year in relation to the paclitaxel study that came out in december we didn t see any impact in december in q1 rather clearly there s been a lot of talk about it and i think you ll have noted that on january 17th fda came out and said that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks and some customers that we d seen moderate their behavior as a result of the paper have now turned back on as a result of that publication and in addition we released data at link we continue to work with regulatory agencies domestically and globally and we continue to have data that supports our position that we do not have any safety concerns with any of our lutonix products christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration i just wanted to add a little bit too on the 0 60 obviously the takeaway is that had nothing to do with the paclitaxel it was a tough compare to last year we had 11 growth and that is as you referred to the boston scientific distribution agreement which is now ended basically that was a loading of the channel that we now have to jump over there s also some timing when you re closing out the year with the transaction don t forget it was the last quarter for bard and that s always big quarter from a sales comp standpoint so that made it a tougher compare as well and there was even a little bit of drag from revenue recognition we talk about that being immaterial at the bdx level but it did have about a 100 basis point drag to the pi business so a tough comp that had nothing to do with that paper and we do expect that to be rebounding in q2 the pi business and we re still calling it to be high single digits for the full year operator your next question comes from the line of kristen stewart with barclays kristen stewart barclays analyst hey good morning everybody vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer good morning kristen kristen stewart barclays analyst i was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color swatch on the insulin patch technology just in terms of how you expect to approach the market does this require you guys to build up sales force or any color in terms of market activity that you may be looking to do as this year progresses and then i have a follow up for chris vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer sure i think alberto s going to take that alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment yes we re obviously in the process of defining that as was mentioned before the early access units will be available toward the end of the calendar year first quarter of next fiscal year so we have some time to we re beginning to it has to do with obviously physical evidence generation it has to do with engaging the payers it has to do with what channels do we use and what weight do we use in each of the channels and yes some additional focused resources that will be paced with our sales and our revenue generation appropriately so we are looking at all these factors it s a little bit too early to define these things because but we ve started the process certainly in terms of engagement of outside process and we re still defining our own channel strategies in detail so stay tuned on that kristen stewart barclays analyst will there be any of the clinical experience presented at ada or any other meetings alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment i don t think so but maybe on follow up we can define that better vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer thanks kristen operator your next question comes from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america bob hopkins bank of america merrill lynch managing director hi thanks and good morning vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer good morning bob bob hopkins bank of america merrill lynch managing director just two quick questions and i apologize if i missed this but just on the fx headwinds for the second quarter and really the first quarter can you just quantify the headwind to eps that s implied in that q2 guidance and also what the specific eps headwind was in q1 just so we can get a sense for the fx fit in the first half versus the second half christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration sure so as we had called out in the first quarter there was about 0 15 of headwinds we see that accelerating to about 0 22 in q2 again the dollar has strengthened a little bit we have visibility into the profit and inventory coming through in the second quarter and then the second half of the year you basically lap the strong dollar year over year so those fx headwinds abate so it s really a first half story but accelerating drag in the second quarter of about 0 22 bob hopkins bank of america merrill lynch managing director right ok perfect thank you for that makes for easy math in the back half and then the other thing i wanted to discuss really quickly on the mms side was obviously a fantastic last quarter and strong quarter this quarter but obviously very different growth rates from the low 20s down to where we are today i was wondering if you could just help us understand the moving pieces driving those big swings and what the cadence looks like for that division over the course of the rest of the year thank you vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer okay alberto can talk to that alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment yes hi it s alberto there s component most of the business on the infusion side is cash sales as we sell the product so it has to do a lot of times with when we place the instruments when we install the instruments and that is defined by obviously the contracting process but also when the customer is ready for that implementation so there s a bit of bulky sales quarter to quarter depending on the disposition of the customer to actually install the resources are there and we can t always control it quarter on quarter obviously that normalizes on a yearly basis on the pyxis side most of that now is given our trace methodology 75 of that business is very predictable so there s less variability there but 25 continues to be what we call cash business and that depends on the timing of the contracts installations and things like that so that s what s driving that and we do have some visibility on these things but ultimately it s when you schedule some of these installations and placements with a customer that drives the quarterly revenues but we have some visibility obviously in the coming quarter so we feel confident that overall in the year we ll have the expected results and if not we re confident about the overall results for the year christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration yeah and bob i would add that yes we had 20 growth in the fourth quarter which was particularly strong but that s really not indicative of what we would expect for the year but having said that mms is very strong and a 6 7 growth rate in q1 following up that pull forward of quarters into the fourth quarter is really very strong growth we see that continuing in the second quarter as well with high single digit growth so clearly mms is growing very strong it s got a lot of great momentum based on some of the things that alberto has been talking about so we really feel good about that part of the business vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer thanks for the questions operator your next question comes from the line of isaac ro with goldman sachs isaac ro goldman sachs vice president good morning guys thank you chris i wanted to come back to the comment on fiscal 2q eps guidance the street was more like 2 92 so clearly we mismodeled the fx dynamic you gave us the bottom line effect i think 0 20 could you maybe go a little further up the p l and give us a little more detail on what the fx means for gross margin and op margin just so we get the quarterly trend proper there thank you christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration sure let me go through each step obviously we talked about revenue growth being down around 100 basis points from the low end so think about 4 and that s really primarily two big things it s the tough flu compare of about 70 basis points and then you ve got pharm systems which grew 16 in the first quarter and you know that s a lumpy business so that moderates in the second quarter and that s a drag of about 50 basis points year over year then there s a bunch of other puts and takes in biosciences and a tough pi compare those kinds of things will be another 30 basis points of so so about 150 basis points of drag on the top line that obviously flows down then you ve got the drag on from fx which is most pronounced in q2 as we talked about and that will have a greater impact on the gross margin you also got the rollout of some of the raw material resin costs and tariff costs that we talked about that really hit us more in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter and then another point i d make is on a year over year basis we started to ramp the investments to get revenue synergies in the second half of last year and those are ramping and we continue to spend that or make those investments so in the second quarter the year over year impact is a headwind as well now it s positive in terms of those investments are driving revenue synergies that show up in the second half of the year so there s unfavorable timing of spending and things like that and then lastly obviously you have the tax rate being 11 in the first quarter and that s going to moderate somewhat to get to our 14 16 for the remainder of the year you put all those things together we didn t want anybody guessing we put out the number of 250 260 just to get everybody aligned with that isaac ro goldman sachs vice president really helpful thanks very much and then maybe vince a follow up question for you on end markets specifically china if i look at the life science part of the franchise and listen to what your peers have had to say it seems like the outlook remains pretty healthy anywhere from high single to low double digits for the rest of the year can you just comment on what s baked into your expectations there and your visibility as to the pace of spend we re obviously all looking at macro data points to try and get a sense of the economic effect as we enter 2020 and that region seems the most sensitive to a change in the cycle so i appreciate your views vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer let me take it at a high level and then i ll turn it over to patrick to talk about life sciences in china which is doing quite well and so we actually had the leader of china in here about a week ago and we see even though with the economic slowdown we can see continued spending on healthcare and not a real change in the cost control mentality that was there a year ago so kind of steady in that sense and not doing big capital projects building hospitals but they are funding continuing care and so we had a good first quarter across all of our businesses and as i mentioned a little better on the medical side including life sciences and so as we look at not just over the base and the rest of this year but even the next couple of years that seems to be the pattern that we re going to expect continued funding of the healthcare system it drives stability in the country so that s the way we re looking at it that s the way our china team is looking at it so patrick maybe you want to talk a little bit about life sciences and what you re seeing there patrick kaltenbach executive vice president and president life sciences segment sure i m happy to definitely if you look at q1 we grew about 14 7 close to 15 in china in life sciences so very strong underlying growth and also for the full year we continue to project double digit growth for sure as vince said there s a lot of investment not only in healthcare there s a lot of investment in pharma and a lot of investment in life science research where we place a lot of our bdb products so we are very confident that the underlying growth and demand in china will continue for the remainder of the year and also next year as you know the current five year plan in china really is focused on providing better healthcare to the population in china and it will drive a lot of the underlying growth vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks patrick operator your next question comes from the line of robbie marcus with j p morgan robert marcus j p morgan analyst great and thanks for taking the question vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer good morning robbie robert marcus j p morgan analyst good morning two from me one can you talk about where you stand in terms of sales and operational synergies with the bard business we ve seen now a one plus one equals more than two from the combination and then maybe just spend a minute on the urology business one that was growing low single digits with bard but since the deal has been in mid to high single digits just help us understand what s going on there and how it is vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer sure so first tom will talk to you about the bard synergies and where we re going with that and then simon can talk about the really strong performance in urology thomas polen president and chief operating officer hey robbie this is tom so i can touch base very briefly on certainly the cost synergies but definitely focus on the revenue synergies obviously cost synergies are going as planned as you heard earlier and we expect that to continue to ramp up through the back half of the year i think probably of more interest to you is on the revenue synergy side and so as we think about that overall we still expect bard revenue synergies of about 250 million by fy 22 that s greater than the care fusion revenue synergies of 150 175 million by the end of this year which is well on track and of course both of those are five year targets so in fy 19 we see revenue synergies to be think about it in the tens of bps relatively minimal to no impact to eps benefit in fy 19 because we re investing behind getting those initiatives we start seeing eps benefits of the revenue synergies starting next year more meaningfully so as we think about what the drivers of those are as we ve said in the past we invested about 15 million in fy 18 toward revenue synergies most of those in selling particularly around our vascular access portfolio bringing together the picc the midline the catheter sales teams as well as investing in a new surgery sales force in europe and so the three areas that we ve talked about historically on revenue synergies are all progressing through our plans those three are vascular access we ve got the broadest portfolio of vascular access devices again from piccs to central lines to catheters and we ve integrated our sales forces in the u s and europe so that they re all now selling the entire portfolio and we re seeing really positive customer feedback again we just did that this past summer but as we look at our pipeline in those categories i d say it s certainly stronger than it ever has been pre bd and bard coming together so we feel really good about the momentum there and we expect some benefits to the back half of the year second on surgery again we just put in also late last year the biosurgery sales force in europe and we re seeing some really positive signs there so we re seeing infection prevention growth rate in europe go up this past quarter we re feeling good about the next quarter and so that momentum is heading in the right direction we just put in just to note we went from zero to about 50 reps in biosurgery in europe as part of that investment strategy so it s a meaningful number and then third was the geographic expansion and so there we had talked that legacy bard had invested heavily in china and saw strong growth there but had relatively limited penetration in latin america ema rest of asia outside china and so we ve started expanding the channels in some of those markets as well to get after some growth opportunities that we see so i think that sums it up hopefully on where we stand on synergies but we feel good about it and i ll turn it over to simon to talk about urology vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer maybe just before simon starts a little more data on the cost side christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration sure so just to talk about the phasing a bit as you know we drove about 75 million of cost synergies last year in fiscal year 18 we ll do 100 million this year and then the rest flow into another 100 million the following year and then the last 25 million so if you think about what we said 300 million essentially 100 million per year but since we only had three quarters last year some of that flows into 21 i would say that what we re seeing is great traction in terms of supply chain and procurement synergies and as vince had mentioned in the prepared remarks we re really leveraging our platforms and the infrastructure investments that we made during the care fusion integration by bringing bard onto our it finance and hr operating systems and then notably some efficiencies in our real estate footprint think of that as sales offices at this point those kinds of things as well as the headquarters here in new jersey so we ve made good moves in getting all the bard associates up here to franklin lakes and closing down the murray hill facility so good traction on all of those points and then as we think through the remainder of the synergies think distribution centers and manufacturing plant synergies those kinds of things continuing some of the infrastructure as well into 20 so really we feel good about the visibility that we have and the traction that we have on cost synergies simon campion executive vice president and president interventional segment good morning robbie it s simon here as you know in ucc there are three legs to that stool there s acute urology there s targeted temperature management and there s homecare so across all three of those legs of that stool we ve seen great performance in q1 acute urology was driven by new products and ttm and homecare was driven by a renewed focus particularly with homecare where we ve identified several opportunities here as a result of a review that we did last summer as to how to accelerate the growth in that business and make it more meaningful so as we look forward for the rest of the year we ve got high confidence in the ucc team to continue to deliver the growth rates that we ve experience so far operator ladies and gentlemen in the interests of time please limit your questions to one question your next question comes from vijay kumar with evercore isi vijay kumar evercore isi managing director hey guys thanks for taking my questions i ll limit it to one question just maybe on the guidance here chris if i understand what you re saying are you saying gross margins are going to be down sequentially and opex up just for us to get to the guide and given your revenue comment fees it implies back half 6 but you do have tough comps in the back half so i m just trying to understand the back half cadence thank you christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration sure so what you ll see is in q2 the gross margins for example actually are slightly favorable year over year but it should be around the 56 level and then those ramp considerably in the second half of the year and that flows down to operating margin as well so you really get the pressure in the second quarter and then as synergies and continuous improvement and fx abates in the second half we see that building so think about the low end of below the guidance range of 56 5 57 5 on gross margin kind of in that 56 range in the second quarter and so there is a little bit of lumpiness but strong rebound in the second half operator your next question comes from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies brandon couillard jefferies senior vice president hey thanks good morning quick one for chris just curious if you could quantify the impact of that tender timing whether it s in life sciences or biosciences either one in the first quarter christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration so this is in ema i think you re referring to it is a big drag in the first quarter it rebounds considerably for the remainder of the year and that is biosciences and a little bit of other areas as well diabetes care we referred to in our prepared remarks so primarily in those areas and as we talked about if you look at the emerging market growth of 7 8 you ve got china growing over 13 you ve got double digits on latin america so you can see ema was a significant drag to get you down to 7 8 and that s just the timing of orders and as vince said we have the orders in hand we feel real confident that that bounces back for the remainder of the year and we close out ema for the full year with a double digit growth rate so just an anomaly in the first quarter operator your next question comes from the line of larry keusch with raymond james lawrence keusch raymond james managing director thanks chris just on the synergies again the cost synergies clearly get the sense that they are built through the year but again just help us think about that second half is this really more of a fourth quarter event or do you start to see some rebound in the third quarter also vince any quick comment on the environment in europe as a whole christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration so larry you do see it starting in the third quarter so think third and fourth quarter probably a little bit more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter but still very strong in the third quarter as well vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer and the environment in europe i would call it stable from our business standpoint we really didn t see any major changes in demand or pricing or anything operator your next question comes from the line of bill quirk with piper jaffray william quirk piper jaffray managing director great thanks good morning everyone two quick ones for me vince and tom i know you don t break it down anymore but any comment on safety adoption in the major geographies i m specifically thinking emerging markets in europe and then secondly patrick just a comment regarding the reimbursement shifts in infectious disease panels you guys are obviously doing very well in that space and it looks like that may get more attractive as some of the private payers follow cms thanks guys vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer so on safety alberto you going to take that alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment yeah on healthcare worker safety which is a traditional leg here i think obviously in the u s that is mostly behind us in europe the big push is there there s still more to do but i think it ll be a slow gain in terms of the penetration safety the big push also is probably behind us but there ll be steady growth and the opportunity still remains in the emerging markets as the standards of living and the ability of funds happen it will be adopted more so that s where the upside is we re also now pivoting more to patient safety a more comprehensive view of safety and i think there we re putting in place some pilots that really can we think begin to move the needle beyond just helping worker safety more centered around the patient and there s other components like our hazardous drug safety as well which is related often to more healthcare but it s not from a needles and syringes and catheter perspective but more protecting the pharmacists doing the preps against oncology type drugs that are hazardous to health vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer just to support what alberto was saying you step back and you look at our safety how we re focused in safety remember once we ve done we did the bar transaction we now cover 75 of the hais and so as alberto was indicating we have a broad infection prevention program that is more of a growth driver than the needle stick safety at this point in time and we think that s where the real legs are operator your next question comes from the line of rick wise with stifel frederick wise stifel nicolaus managing director good morning everybody vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer good morning rick frederick wise stifel nicolaus managing director chris maybe picking up on your earlier comments about the accelerated debt paydown i think you said you paid down over 400 million in the quarter clearly you re on track to get below 3x but remind us why you need to get below 3x it sounds like the debt paydown could even accelerate as the year unfolds and maybe evolving use or cash priorities or balance sheet priorities or options over the next 12 18 months as you get toward obviously a very much delevered position congrats on all that thanks christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration thank you well we did pay down 400 million in q1 and we ve paid down 1 6 billion since the transaction closed and we re down to 3 8x leverage at this point on a path to 3x leverage by december of 2020 and you can think about that as ratable so you mentioned accelerated this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated now when we committed to 3x leverage we also left ourselves some room to do tuck in acquisitions and to continue to invest in the business and so we ve continued to do that you saw the tva medical acquisition as an example of that so we re not feeling constrained in terms of doing tuck in acquisitions and i think it s important that we get back to our commitment levels because when you flex your leverage like that you re committing to the rating agencies that you re coming back to a more normal leverage level and we did that on care fusion we got back down to the 3x leverage so we re very focused on living to that commitment again and well on our way to do that operator your next question comes from the line of matt taylor with ubs matt taylor ubs executive director thank you for taking the question i wanted to ask one about medication management solutions because it continues to do well and you talked about above market growth there for infusion and pyxis has been doing well as well so with the new healthsight platform and with this outperformance that you ve driven now for years i was hoping you could give us an understanding of how long you think you can drive the above market performance what are the enhancements that we could see going forward and where are you gaining share from is it new sites or are you actually taking competitive share alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment this is alberto i ll start with the last portion of the question i think there s two aspects of that one is that we re expanding the market with new capabilities and healthsight is an example of that that was not there before and we re doing that fairly uniquely so that obviously affects our share of the pot if you like and then there s in terms of the visibility we have we think that the current environment and competitive environment will continue in the sense that we anticipate to continue to do that in the foreseeable future beyond that it s more difficult to say but we could continue to invest in our platforms and our capabilities and mostly this comes better as one all our platforms unified in terms of the text stack in terms of the analytics we think that s a big driver in the medium term and long term thomas polen president and chief operating officer matt this is tom to complement alberto s comment we don t comment on specific competitors but i d say we re taking share across most everyone in both the pump and the dispensing space at this point and so we do feel good about that momentum and as you heard from alberto as well we ve been continually shifting since bd and care fusion came together we certainly continue to invest in the platform itself let s call it the hardware which has been traditionally where a lot of the investment has gone we do have and we ve recently released next gen pump of course with the m2 we ve got next gen pumps beyond that as well deep and well under way in our pipeline and we have the same thing for pyxis of course we launched pyxis es we have next gen versions also in our pipeline as well but we have very purposely shifted a chunk of that investment increasingly into the software solutions and you saw that with healthsight you saw that with narcotic diversion analytics et cetera and we see that when customers look at our solution versus what may be available from others in the marketplace it s that software connectivity across the platforms that really allows someone to manage the medication management process in a unique way that we think we become a very preferred and unique offering in the marketplace because of the solutions that we ve been able to bring together not just in the hardware but through the software that connects everything and eliminates the inefficiencies in the process and eliminates the opportunities for medication errors in a way that again is very unique in the marketplace alberto mas executive vice president and president medical segment this is alberto i ll just complement one data point to give you a sense of how healthsight is getting traction healthsight viewer which is a product that we launched in fiscal year 18 already has over 140 sites that are live for example there s obviously some others like diversion where optimization is a little bit too early to say we do certainly see some contracts flowing through but 140 sites for healthsight viewer are live operator your next question comes from the line of richard newitter with svb leerink richard newitter svb leerink managing director hi thanks for taking the question just to follow up on mms with respect to the comparable spend environment in the u s we ve seen a number of competitors and companies in the space put up some strong capital numbers and the environment seems pretty robust also i would imagine just alluding to some of your profits and some of the outlook for this division so how much of this outlook is underlying capital investments where are we in the cycle in your view and again how much of a lift for the optimistic outlook is underlying spend versus the market share gains that you ve been alluding to vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer i think there s a couple of things going on here one is hospitals in terms of capital spending are doing well we don t see any significant change in that in the short run the other thing that s going on is that we ve seen remarkable concentration of our customer base and starting to see a shift in governance let me call it improved governance across large systems as that happens they want to standardize care they want to standardize their systems and i think what you re seeing is early on in that conversion with that mentality in the marketplace and the kind of approach that we are taking with healthsight and the informatics tying this across the entire system alberto just gave you a quick update on the number of accounts or whatnot we think we re very early on in that story and the winners in the marketplace are going to have to run that way thomas polen president and chief operating officer this is tom maybe just one other comment as well just to keep it in perspective obviously we get very focused on what s happening in the u s with pyxis aleris and the software solutions we talked about but i would say that we re also getting strong performance in the other areas of mms as well and that includes our cme acquisition that we did the other year which is for the alternate site home infusion market primarily outside of the u s and also our rowa platform which is for retail pharmacy dispensing we ve begun having some sales in the u s but that still is primarily an ex u s business and it s also growing very nicely double digits and it s getting of increasing size because we ve been growing at double digits for the last few years so areas we don t speak as much about but certainly are helping fuel the mms growth rate as well operator your next question comes from the line of amit hazan with citigroup amit hazan citigroup director thank you very much i want to come back to the interventional and peripheral segment and just ask it looks regionally that the slowdown was both in the u s and outside the u s so just a clarification if you can help us understand if the boston scientific distribution agreement impacted both regions and then just given the focus on dcbs here a little bit of increased focus if you can just give us a reminder of how dcbs grew in your fiscal year 18 and what you expect for fiscal 19 for dcb growth thank you very much guys simon campion executive vice president and president interventional segment hey amit it s simon with respect to outside the u s as chris said we re already on to there were some tender issues here in q1 on a global basis that we re coming back from in q2 and beyond with respect to dcbs across the board we expect mid to high single digit growth in dcbs across the sfa and av platforms but i think it s very important that we don t isolate dcbs we have a full complement of solutions dcbs ptas stents and grafts we have the whole bag whether it s sfa intervention or av intervention so to focus on one aspect of that is not doing the category leadership and position that we ve worked hard to generate any favors so we look at it as a total solution here vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer some great new products coming out there thanks thanks for the question operator and presenters there are no further questions do you have any closing remarks vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer yes thank you very much and thanks to everyone for their questions and a really great dialogue so let me just move to my closing remarks in december we celebrated the one year anniversary of the closing of the bard transaction so now i have to say we re really proud of our achievements over the past year as a combined company it s just off to a great start secondly fiscal 2019 is off to a strong start with continued momentum across our businesses and regions after a strong finish to the year in 18 looking ahead i m confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitments so thank you very much we look forward to updating you next time christopher reidy chief financial officer and executive vice president administration thanks everyone vincent forlenza chairman and chief executive officer have a great day operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect

definitions funds from operations ffo we calculate funds from operations or ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from real estate transactions non controlling interests share of gain on sale of property impairment of investment in real estate real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs unconsolidated jv real estate related depreciation amortization non controlling interests in operating partnership and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to other reits ffo ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance core funds from operations core ffo we present core funds from operations or core ffo as a supplemental operating measure because in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in our core business operating performance we calculate core ffo by adding to or subtracting from ffo i termination fees and other non core revenues ii transaction and integration expenses iii gain from early extinguishment of debt iv issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock v equity in earnings adjustment for non core items vi severance equity acceleration and legal expenses vii bridge facility fees and viii other non core expense adjustments because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations the utility of core ffo as a measure of our performance is

income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance adjusted funds from operations affo we present adjusted funds from operations or affo as a supplemental operating measure because when compared year over year it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits affo will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other reits including on a per share and unit basis we calculate affo by adding to or subtracting from core ffo i non real estate depreciation ii amortization of deferred financing costs iii amortization of debt discount premium iv non cash stock based compensation expense v straight line rental revenue vi straight line rental expense vii above and below market rent amortization viii deferred non cash tax expense ix capitalized leasing compensation x recurring capital expenditures and xi capitalized internal leasing commissions other reits may calculate affo differently than we do and accordingly our affo may not be comparable to other reits affo affo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda we believe that earnings before interest loss from early extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization and impairment of investments in real estate or ebitda and adjusted ebitda as defined below are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and with respect to adjusted ebitda severance equity acceleration and legal expenses transaction and integration expenses gain loss on real estate transactions equity in earnings adjustment for non core items other non core adjustments net noncontrolling interests preferred stock dividends including undeclared dividends and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock adjusted ebitda is ebitda excluding severance equity acceleration and legal expenses transaction and integration expenses gain on real estate transactions other non core adjustments net non controlling interests and preferred stock dividends including undeclared dividends in addition we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes exclude capitalized costs such as leasing commissions and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business their utility as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do and accordingly our ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda accordingly ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered only as supplements to net

pennsylvania gov tom wolf is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars more for schools in his budget proposal released tuesday as well as a sprinkling of money for new voting machines and programs to improve worker training and the agricultural sector the democrat is also seeking new college benefits for members of the national guard who re enlist and tuition aid for community college students who remain in pennsylvania in his budget address to a joint session of the republican controlled legislature wolf said the most significant element of the 34 1 billion budget plan his first since winning a second term is its efforts to help pennsylvanians compete in a changing economy by bolstering skills and education including nearly 500 million in supplemental cash for the current fiscal year wolf is seeking authorization for another 1 9 billion in new spending or nearly 6 percent more the proposal would not increase the state s taxes on income and sales but wolf last week laid out a parallel plan to impose a severance tax on marcellus shale natural gas production to finance borrowing for an ambitious capital plan that would fund a wide range of projects democratic gov tom wolf delivers his budget address for the 2019 20 fiscal year to a joint session of the pennsylvania house and senate in harrisburg pa tuesday feb 5 2019 ap wolf s first term was marked by long drawn out budget fights with republican lawmakers the new proposal is modest in comparison to his earliest plans which carried multibillion dollar tax increases and seems to reflect wolf s shift in strategy in the past couple years to the realities of negotiating with big republican majorities the extra spending would largely go toward public schools prisons pension obligations health care for the poor mental health services and social services for children the elderly and disabled the administration said the plan carries a half billion dollars in new initiatives to help fund it wolf s administration is counting on tax collections to rise by a solid 3 percent plus hundreds of millions of dollars from money already appropriated higher assessments on medicaid providers and a fee on municipalities that rely only on state troopers to provide police coverage budget address here is the text of pennsylvania gov tom wolf s 2019 budget address as prepared for delivery on tuesday this is my fifth budget address and for the last four years sitting to my left was karen coates a trusted adviser to speaker turzai a friend mother sister daughter and respected member of our community and for the same four years i would look out into the chamber and see flo fabrizio mike o brien and sid kavulich this year they are not with us let us all remember their lasting impact commitment to service and carry forward in their memory three weeks ago i had the honor of taking the oath of office for another term as governor i spoke of a commonwealth on a comeback a pennsylvania on a path to a more functional government a more prosperous economy and a brighter future for our children the people of our commonwealth have proven that despite the challenges we face pennsylvania remains a place worthy of its history a place where people can find good work strong communities and opportunity for their kids and here in harrisburg we ve proven that despite our differences we remain capable of doing what washington just cannot seem able to do tackle big challenges put aside petty partisanship and serve the public interest we must never forget that embedded in pennsylvania s history is the fact that not one but two noble experiments were launched here first there was william penn s holy experiment second the founders launched their own experiment in self government both of these are perpetual experiments when we reaffirm our commitment to these experiments we honor both our history and those founders and we show our constituents that whether they voted for us or not those experiments are in good hands and their government is worthy of their trust now we have a chance to show that good faith once again in proposing and debating this budget we get to the heart of our perpetual experiment in self government we show the founders that we can govern ourselves today i put forth my budget proposal and let me cut to the chase this proposal asks for no new taxes not one dollar not one dime not one penny at the same time this budget proposes to do a number of things aimed at improving the lives of our fellow citizens the people of pennsylvania have made substantial sacrifices in recent years to help our state get up off the mat and despite a budget that asks for no new taxes we now have a chance to continue making some important new investments on their behalf investments in our schools investments to make sure more pennsylvanians of all ages have real choices when it comes to their health care decisions continued investments to reinforce our commitment to the battle against the opioid epidemic that has claimed the lives of so many of our neighbors investments to support our farmers and agricultural producers so they can continue to sustain our rural communities for generations to come in the coming weeks we ll have the chance to discuss debate and negotiate the details and i will ask for your partnership in ensuring that this important work continues and that we maintain our commitment to advancing this experiment in self government a pedestrian walks past the dome of the pennsylvania capitol on the morning of democratic gov tom wolf s scheduled budget address for the 2019 20 fiscal year in harrisburg pa tuesday feb 5 2019 ap my administration has worked hard to make these investments possible striving to run our government not just more ethically but more efficiently so that it is worthy of the public trust and capable of advancing the public interest we ve saved billions of taxpayer dollars and reduced the number of state employees without furloughs all while improving customer service we ve gotten rid of facilities and leases that we don t use or need while consolidating commonwealth operations within the capitol complex we ve made the procurement process smarter and more efficient and we will continue to look for ways to streamline government so we can invest in the things that matter to pennsylvanians while at the same time serving them better today however i want to focus on the most significant element of this budget proposal a comprehensive plan for preparing pennsylvanians to compete and win in our rapidly changing economy a plan to create a new generation of prosperity in our commonwealth by building the strongest workforce in the nation the credit for our economic success has always belonged to the people of pennsylvania the innovators who turned new ideas into new industries the business leaders who built great companies large and small and the working women and men who toiled in fields and mines and factories not to mention research labs and classrooms and cubicles there s a reason pennsylvanians know names like carnegie hershey westinghouse and a reason why we believe so strongly in the power of our work ethic and the importance of individual responsibility that s who we are but in the background government has been there working on our behalf building canals and highways so manufacturers could get their goods to market protecting the integrity of the marketplace to ensure fair competition and helping to unlock the potential offered by our abundant resources in the end however our most important economic resource has always been our people it s always been workers that have propelled our prosperity that s why we ve always made sure to invest in public schools universities and training centers the path to prosperity begins with an educated workforce that s as true today as it s always been but while that principle remains intact a lot about our economy has changed new businesses new industries new technology new competition and with all that we have a need for new skills over the last four years pennsylvania has created more than 12 000 new businesses and more than 239 000 new jobs we ve begun to match and advance beyond our neighbors now it s time for us to really pull ahead today i present a comprehensive plan to help grow our economy by continuing to invest in our workforce this plan calls on contributions from the business community labor unions educators research institutions students parents and adult workers and it increases opportunity for every pennsylvanian at every stage of life from birth to retirement i m proposing a package of policies and investments called the statewide workforce education and accountability program it s the next step we can take together to build on all of the work we ve done over the past four years consider just how far we ve already come we ve made pennsylvania a leader in computer science education by establishing a workforce development initiative that invests in computer science and stem education programs for k 12 students we ve increased the number of career and technical education students earning industry recognized credentials by 34 percent and increased the number of credentials earned by students enrolled in career and technical education programs by 27 percent we ve provided high school students options to demonstrate graduation readiness as alternatives to high stakes standardized testing we ve increased participation to nearly 800 registered apprenticeship programs and almost 17 000 active apprenticeships and we ve assisted nearly 3 000 companies in training more than 145 000 incumbent workers across the commonwealth to help employees develop new skills to thrive in their jobs but we know there is more to do when amazon made its decision not to locate its second headquarters in pennsylvania it cited workforce concerns as a main reason and in western pennsylvania we ve struggled to find pennsylvanians to fill the jobs as welders and pipefitters at the shell cracker plant across the commonwealth we have workers aging out of our workforce and too often the next generation of worker is not there or doesn t have the skills to replace them if we can t strengthen our workforce we will fall behind and we cannot let our government s response to this problem be handcuffed by stale habit we need to continue to break down silos we need to inject our efforts with common purpose and we need to make sure that as leaders we are providing direction and giving teeth to our workforce efforts that s why we are going to do something a little different starting immediately we are going to put together a keystone economic development and workforce command center agency secretaries are going to meet each week with plans in hand and sit together to make sure no workforce effort walks alone or falls through some crack in the state government if the department of community and economic development knows a company that needs 20 welders and the department of labor and industry has a welding program we re going to connect them those connections within state government are valuable and necessary but we also need to hear from businesses and labor not just when they re upset and not just when we tour a facility in a hard hat we need to hear from them constantly we need to know when there is a problem right away so we can fix it if a labor union is having trouble establishing a training program because of antiquated procedures then we need to fix it we need to get those workers trained and into the workforce if a business can t hire a worker because of an out of date or unnecessary rule or regulation we need to know about it so we can take action if medical professionals are concerned about a licensing backlog they need receptive ears in state government we re also not going to try to solve every workforce problem on our own the command center will have a first of its kind employer fund a public private partnership that empowers businesses to address the skills gap from their end and encourages them to share their best ideas and best practices so that we can scale them up and learn from their success after all government doesn t have a monopoly on good ideas for addressing these challenges but it can serve as an incubator for the best ones and a partner for putting them into action the dome of the pennsylvania capitol is visible on the morning of democratic gov tom wolf s scheduled budget address for the 2019 20 fiscal year in harrisburg pa tuesday feb 5 2019 ap the command center is going to be led by the secretaries of the departments of community and economic development labor and industry and state three agencies that have the largest impact on pennsylvania s workforce and business development we are also going to bring outside voices in my friends gene barr and rick bloomingdale will also be co chairs they co chaired my middle class task force which helped launch many of the workforce development ideas we implemented last year and that i m proposing to build on in this plan and they ll be joined by tony bartolomeo of team pa and auditor general depasquale who has worked on these issues and will have important recommendations but we need to do more we need policies that start at the very beginning and end with every pennsylvanian receiving an excellent education and the opportunity to land a good job last year i convened a ready to start task force charging it with finding ways to improve the lives of children under three and their families i know that no new parent looks at their baby and sees a spreadsheet but the fact is that preparing our kids for success starts long before they ever enter a classroom or even take their first steps and providing services for children helps to get parents into the workforce and fight poverty that s why this new program includes funding for home visits to support vulnerable pregnant women new mothers and at risk infants and toddlers home visiting programs promote healthy relationships and safe and stable home environments they re proven to work in preventing adverse childhood experiences giving children and their parents the skills they need to reach their full potential and lift families out of poverty and into good jobs you know we already have programs like this working in pennsylvania misericordia university is home to one of only eight programs in the country that helps single mothers who are struggling economically to complete a college degree the program provides counseling housing and other services to help mothers get into the workforce we plan to replicate this innovative job training program all across the commonwealth and this program leverages federal funds to improve our child care system so we can get more kids off of waiting lists and into high quality support systems and help more parents make their way into the workforce pennsylvania s children deserve every opportunity to succeed when they enter our public school system and they deserve to enter a public school system that isn t just adequate but world class restoring 1 billion in funding to our schools was an important first step but now we need to go further we must continue to increase funding for education starting with pre k and culminating at the end of a student s journey but that s not all it s time to lower the age of compulsory attendance to age 6 bringing our commonwealth in line with the vast majority of other states and we should consider going even further with a careful study of the costs and benefits of moving to universal free full day kindergarten for every 5 year old in pennsylvania meanwhile we should increase the minimum dropout age to 18 and partner with school districts to keep our graduation rate rising of course no governor or legislator can do more for a child than a teacher can and my program empowers teachers to do even more through a program called teacherworks that provides them with workplace experience in pennsylvania businesses so they can better understand the needs of employers we ask a lot of our teachers and if we re going to prepare the next generation of pennsylvanians for the jobs of the future we re going to be asking even more of those teachers including more training and more accountability teachers on the other hand they just want safe schools to work in support from administrative staff a fair wage for the important work they do that s not asking a lot but the law governing teacher pay hasn t been updated since the 1980s and so our classroom teachers have been too often getting the short end of the stick i don t think anyone here in harrisburg would say that we shouldn t value the contributions our educators have made over the last 30 years and i don t think anyone would disagree that they have a critical role to play in securing our prosperity over the next 30 and yet our government has failed to address this injustice that ends now my plan increases the pay floor for teachers to 45 000 a year this is a real investment in our future it s an investment the state not local school districts will make and it s included in this budget this is a fully funded mandate we are going to start competing to recruit and retain the very best education professionals not just in well funded suburban school districts but in every community every zip code in our commonwealth this could be a game changer for our schools especially for our communities that are struggling to attract and retain the next generation of educators in fact most districts that cannot afford to pay their teachers more are located in the heart of rural pennsylvania and it is time to make sure we are investing in educators in those areas today to prepare our kids for the competitive world of tomorrow we re also going to do more to recruit students ambitious brilliant creative young women and men who are looking for the next step in their education our commonwealth is blessed with a terrific system of colleges and universities including community colleges we all know that our post secondary institutions are laboratories for innovation but they are also launch pads for job creators and the skilled workers that will fill those jobs that s why my plan creates a new grant program for students who graduate from a pennsylvania community college with an associate s degree or other industry recognized credential and then stay in pennsylvania to start their careers if you re willing to put your newly acquired skills to work here in our commonwealth the least we can do is help you avoid carrying around a crushing burden of student debt and if you re a parent who wants to trade up from a job that pays the bills to a job that can sustain your family my plan includes a parent pathway initiative designed to help you get the education you need to get ahead even while you prepare your own kids for success indeed my workforce program isn t just about the jobs of tomorrow it s about the jobs of today last year we launched pasmart a comprehensive new initiative focusing on stem skills apprenticeships career counseling and public private partnerships no matter how old you are now is a great time to acquire new skills and we want to make that opportunity available to every pennsylvanian as part of the pasmart initiative we just launched a new website pa smart dot gov that consolidates workforce resources and information for pennsylvanians who want to get training and education to enter the workforce or expand their skills it s similar to the business one stop shop we built last year and that we re still improving upon we need comprehensive digital portals for both businesses and workers that gets them all the information they need in one place and breaks down agency barriers this year i m proposing 10 million in new funding for pasmart so we can fill more advanced manufacturing positions help more non traditional students obtain the training they need to compete in the job market and create more jobs at better wages for more pennsylvania workers this program also includes funding to help returning veterans get the training they need to continue their contributions to our commonwealth as members of our workforce and even better that funding is transferable meaning that veterans can use it to help their kids get a college degree or career credential as well it s a gi bill for pennsylvania one more thing we cannot comprehensively address our workforce development system without fixing our criminal justice system tens of thousands of pennsylvanians are shut out of our workforce or underemployed because of mistakes they ve made in their past families are being denied providers employers are being denied skilled workers we ve already passed clean slate legislation making us the first state in the country to do so but we need to go further and make our criminal justice system more equitable and fair while helping people who have made amends enter the workforce indeed even as we work on this budget we also have to improve re entry programs and make it easier for those who have done their time to succeed in the workforce and their daily lives our challenge demands an all hands on deck approach and this budget proposal itself asks pennsylvanians to come together business leaders educators students parents workers to address the challenge of renewing our prosperity for another generation in my inaugural address i asked us to do our best right here in harrisburg to do two things first to ensure that the interests of all pennsylvanians are reflected in the policies we pursue and second to show the world that pennsylvanians know how to make representative democracy work this budget is the embodiment of that noble effort it asks for no new taxes no new burdens on our citizens while at the same time increasing dramatically our investments in the public goods that will make life better for all pennsylvanians this budget recognizes that government should not try to do everything we have a long held faith in our tradition of limited government and individual responsibility but it also recognizes that government should not do nothing either the public goods government invests in should make the lives of our fellow citizens better public goods that give pennsylvanians the skills they need to thrive in our 21st century economy public goods that promote their safety and health public goods that connect them more seamlessly with each other public goods that keep our air and water clean that s what this budget aims to do it makes investments in workforce readiness our early childhood system our schools our universities our community colleges our apprenticeship training programs it makes investments in ensuring that pennsylvanians of all ages have real choices when it comes to their health care decisions and it continues to prioritize the fight against the opioid epidemic that has destroyed the lives of so many of our friends and neighbors but above all else this budget proclaims to the world that right here in pennsylvania we do not indulge in the sterile politics of anger and insult that here we know how to engage in the respectful and honest give and take that must stand at the heart of a functional democracy while the rest of this country and indeed the rest of the world descends into divisive nasty and unproductive bouts of shouting we are showing everyone else how democracy is supposed to work so this is our challenge it s not just about yet another budget it s about our democracy let us show the world along with the rest of our country that right here in pennsylvania we are making this experiment work that we are re dedicating ourselves to this noble experiment in democratic self governance let s show that in the way we tackle the challenge of preparing our commonwealth for a brighter future starting with this budget this and no less than this is our task this is also our privilege may god bless us in this task and may god bless the commonwealth of pennsylvania thank you find lehighvalleylive com on facebook
in 1972 the socialist left swept to power in jamaica calling for the strengthening of workers rights the nationalization of industries and the expansion of the island s welfare state the people s national party pnp led by the charismatic michael manley sought nothing less than to overturn the old order under which jamaicans had long labored first as enslaved then indentured then colonized and only recently as politically free of great britain jamaica is a small island but the ambition of the project was global in scale two years before his election as prime minister manley took to the pages of foreign affairs to situate his democratic socialism within a novel account of international relations while the largely north atlantic readers of the magazine might have identified the fissures of the cold war as the dominant conflict of their time manley argued otherwise the real battleground he declared was located in that largely tropical territory which was first the object of colonial exploitation second the focus of non caucasian nationalism and more latterly known as the underdeveloped and the developing world as it sought euphemisms for its condition manley displaced the cold war s east west divide instead drawing on a longstanding anti colonial critique to look at the world along its north south axis when viewed from the tropics the world was not bifurcated by ideology but by a global economy whose origins lay in the project of european imperial expansion the sovereignty of former colonies was undermined by their economic dependence on former colonial powers a condition kwame nkrumah called neocolonialism imperialism for manley was a form of not just political but economic domination through which territories such as jamaica were geared to produce not what was needed for themselves or for exchange for mutual advantage but rather compelled to be the producers of what others needed between the 1940s and 60s the first generation of anti colonial nationalists including norman manley michael s father had largely liberated their countries from the political chains of empire by securing independence anti colonial nationalists aspired to use their newfound sovereignty to transform the political and economic legacies of imperialism as a member of the second generation of postwar nationalists manley viewed his election as an opportunity to realize this aspiration for postcolonial transformation given the condition of a newly independent society encumbered with the economic social and psychological consequences of three hundred years of colonialism manley hoped his political program would secure individual and collective self reliance as well as political and economic equality his platform of democratic socialism for jamaica inaugurated an ambitious project of land redistribution state control of key industries stronger rights for organized labor worker ownership of industries and the expansion of health care and education however this vision of postcolonial transformation was limited by the very forms of dependence and inequality that it sought to overcome because postcolonial states remained primary good exporters with national economies dependent on products such as bauxite cocoa coffee cotton sisal and tea their domestic economic policies were subject to the vagaries of the international market this contradiction between the achievement of political sovereignty and the persistence of economic dependence famously captured in kwame nkrumah s term neocolonialism was heightened as manley inaugurated his socialist project already beginning in the late 1960s prices for primary products in international markets experienced a precipitous decline coupled with opec s 1973 oil embargo which heavily burdened new postcolonial states dependent on oil imports the decline in commodity prices resulted in steep foreign exchange shortages and exacerbated postcolonial states reliance on debt the end of this story is a familiar one by the 1980s unable to service their debt postcolonial states entered structural adjustment agreements with the world bank and international monetary fund imf while mexico s 1982 default is often viewed as the beginning of this process manley s jamaica was the first victim of the third world debt crisis and began structural adjustment in 1977 then in his second term manley acceded to the terms of the imf s stabilization program which required a 30 percent devaluation of jamaica s currency major cuts in public expenditures especially in the wages of public sector workers and the privatization of state assets long before greece s syriza there was manley and his pnp although the 1970s ended with postcolonial capitulation to the new age of neoliberal globalization the decade had begun on a very different note with a radical call from the global south for a new international economic order nieo announced in the un general assembly with the declaration on the establishment of a new international economic order 1974 and the charter of economic rights and duties of states 1974 the nieo was conceived as the international corollary to the domestic projects of socialism manley and other anti colonial nationalists were pursuing how did such an ambitious effort to create an egalitarian global economy emerge a decade prior to passage of the declaration on the establishment of the neio and the charter on economic rights and duties of states the afro asian bloc of states in the united nations had come to recognize a possible source of strength in their majority in the general assembly they mobilized to create the united nations conference of trade and development unctad unlike the world bank and imf which were created prior to the postwar surge of decolonization and empowered states of the global north unctad was organized as a forum to address trade and development in the global south despite the opposition of the united states and its allies third world states used their majority to place the argentine economist and dependency theorist raúl prebisch at the helm of this new agency it was in unctad and then on the floor of the un general assembly that the policy prescriptions of the nieo were first articulated and backed by a group of third world states that had organized themselves under the name g 77 in its ambition to transform international economic relations the nieo addressed critical issues that included the ownership of resources in land space and the seas the growing power of transnational corporations and the transportation of goods in an increasingly globalized commodity chain at its core however the nieo was concerned with the unequal relations of trade between the global north and south proponents of the nieo saw in this inequality a distorted and damaging international division of labor one that according to manley consistently relegated postcolonial states to the low end of the value added scale until something changed they would be condemned to serve as planter and reaper economically subservient to the global north with its manufacturing economies high incomes and domestic consumer markets to overcome the dependence that structured international trade unctad and the postcolonial statesmen who supported the nieo looked for lessons in the welfare states of the twentieth century these systems constructed by the labor movements of industrialized societies were by the 1970s at the peak of their success in diminishing domestic inequality the assumption that an egalitarian global economy could be modeled on the welfare state thus depended on viewing the position of postcolonial states as structurally analogous to the working class and rural sector within the states of the global north this analogy transposing from the domestic political economies of the global north to the political economy of the whole planet shaped the politics of the nieo in two ways first it framed third world solidarity as an assertive class politics as manley noted the postcolonial world now proclaimed itself the third world to mark its transition from an age of apology to one of assertiveness according to julius nyerere president of tanzania and one of manley s collaborators postcolonial states had constituted themselves as an international trade union of the poor the g 77 in the un general assembly as well as commodity associations modelled on opec that would negotiate the price of products such as bauxite and coffee were manifestations of this trade unionism like the labor movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries their demand for economic equality was predicated on the view that the postcolonial world had produced the wealth that the global north enjoyed in this recasting of economic relations between the global north and south the nieo s proponents reimagined the international arena as a site for a politics of redistribution that extended far beyond the discourses of aid and charity second the domestic analogy cast the postcolonial project as an effort to internationalize the postwar social compact between labor and capital the nieo was to use gunnar myrdal s term a welfare world that would democratize global economic decision making and redistribute the gains of global trade in the absence of a world state armed with the coercive power of taxation this international welfarism sought to deploy the united nations to regulate market prices of primary commodities provide compensatory financing when prices fell unexpectedly remove protectionist barriers in the global north and provide special and preferential treatment for the products postcolonial states produced unctad justified this set of policy prescriptions by insisting that the international community had a clear responsibility towards developing countries that have suffered a deterioration in their terms of trade in the same way as governments recognize a similar responsibility towards their domestic primary producers this responsibility was not framed as a rectification or reparation for past injustices of the global economy instead it was a claim that internationalizing the welfare state was necessary for overcoming the structural inequality of global trade and thereby for achieving a postimperial global economy just as the workers movements of the global north had in their struggles for unions and socialism built democracy in germany britain france and the united states so too would the states of the global south in pursuing global economic equality achieve a new world political order the welfare world of the nieo marked the high point of anti colonial politics in the united nations and indicated a sharp break with the postwar status quo if the right to self determination had universalized legal equality for postcolonial states the nieo radicalized the meaning of sovereign equality in the hands of postcolonial states sovereign equality now entailed equal decision making power within the united nations according to the charter of rights and duties the juridical equality of all states and their equal status as members of the international community granted them the right to participate fully and effectively in the international decision making process in the solution of world economic financial and monetary problems this claim of equal legislative power grounded the more ambitious claim that sovereign equality had material implications it required and entailed an equitable share of the world s wealth according to the declaration on the establishment of the nieo the welfare world aimed for the broadest co operation of all the states members of the international community based on equity whereby the prevailing disparities in the world may be banished and prosperity secured for all postcolonial states constituted themselves as an international trade union of the poor fearing that third world states would launch commodity embargoes on the model of opec s 1973 oil embargo western statesmen initially pursued a conciliatory policy of appeasement in public even as they criticized the nieo privately in this context postcolonial states gained allies among social democrats in the global north and secured small victories for instance with the addition of part 4 to the general agreement on trade and tariffs postcolonial states were able to secure lower tariffs in the global north on some of their goods moreover postcolonial states were freed from the requirement of reciprocity in trade agreements with the global north these special and preferential provisions recognized the unfair character of international trade and sought to strengthen the position of postcolonial states however the political openings that made possible these concessions and enabled the third world to demand the nieo proved narrow with commodity prices declining and debt skyrocketing the bargaining power of postcolonial states eroded rapidly by the end of the 1970s the era of neoliberal globalization had dawned displacing visions of a welfare world leading the opposition to the nieo the world bank and imf rejected its aspiration to democratic and universal international economic law instead these financial institutions insulated the global economy from political contestation by recasting it as the domain of technocratic expertise in doing so they rejected the claim that the global economy could be subject to demands for redistribution the colony went free stood for a brief moment in the sun then moved back again toward servitude this time to the empire of debt almost forty years after the triumph of neoliberalism over the nieo it is difficult to imagine that another world was possible in accepting this triumph as inevitable we have forgotten that decolonization promised not only to free nations from foreign domination but also to remake the world from our perspective the wave of independence movements that followed world war ii is largely associated with the moral and legal delegitimization of alien rule the transition from colony to nation and the expansion of the international society to include previously excluded african asian and caribbean states in this view anti colonial nationalists appropriated the principle of self determination and the modular form of the nation state expanding and universalizing languages and institutions with a european provenance this is a compelling narrative because it describes the world that emerged from decolonization in the three decades between 1945 and 1975 un membership had grown from 51 states to 144 at the turn of the twentieth century european states ruled 84 percent of earth s surface by 1975 the remnants of alien rule largely in southern africa appeared to be anachronistic and barbaric holdouts however this narrative obscures some of the most innovative aspects of the politics of decolonization by eliding its global ambitions and it thereby misses the mechanisms by which empire reasserted itself persisting into our time and reinforcing global white supremacy when african and west indian nationalists met at the fifth pan african congress in manchester in 1945 to articulate a global vision of decolonization national independence was high on their agenda but it was only one part of an internationalist framework that looked forward to inevitable world unity and federation from ghana s nkrumah who helped to organize the pan african congress to jamaica s manley anti colonial nationalists pitched decolonization on this global scale to address the global character of imperialism in their view empire was a globalizing force that unequally and violently integrated disparate peoples and lands with the gun and the lash it had made a single world from many it produced according to w e b du bois a global color line through which europe dominated the darker races of men in asia and africa in america and the islands of the sea this structure of racial hierarchy endured well after the achievement of juridical independence finding a new form in manley s real battleground which demarcated the postcolonial world and the global north seeking to undo international economic hierarchies and shore up the right to self determination the nieo sought to realize the aspiration to world unity and federation by creating international frameworks that would support self rule at home this novel combination of nation building and world making the idea that democratic self governance depended on an international context conducive to its exercise emerged out of the sense that empire s globalization could be made egalitarian but could not be reversed the world was already unified under the terms of white supremacy and capitalist exploitation as manley pointed out the caribbean itself was a global formation and could not be disaggregated from the international political and economic relations in which it was embedded this extreme form of extraversion necessarily required moving beyond national insularity the ideal of a national independence disembedded from the world was not only a fantasy for decolonizing nations it was also increasingly impossible for the global north anticipating the contemporary dilemmas of neoliberal globalization manley argued that international entanglements of trade capital flows and financialization as well as the emergence of transnational private actors threatened to undermine the capacity of all states to steer and regulate their national economies for manley the multinational corporation revealed the growing contradictions between the international economy and the bounded nation state in creating an international system of political management for the world economy the nieo would supplement the diminished role of the state it would create a system for political and democratic regulation of the global economy ultimately benefiting all states and peoples thus while anticolonial nationalists reimagined international institutions for the postcolonial condition their vision extended beyond the global south the democratic decision making and global redistribution at the heart of the nieo could yet again be a source for inspiration especially in our present moment when the tension between nationalism and internationalism electrifies political debate brexit the election of donald trump and the wave of authoritarian populism surging across the west all frame national insularity as the solution to an age of neoliberal globalization by withdrawing from international institutions erecting barriers to global trade and closing borders to migrants the new right in the global north aspires to realize a vision of national independence that manley and other anti colonial nationalists already realized was impossible fifty years ago but if the right s model of national insularity is impossible the neoliberal globalization that displaced anti colonial world making and has been the order of the day since the 1980s is equally untenable its vision of an economy insulated from political contestation and its rejection of distributive justice nationally and globally have magnified inequality and contributed to the rise of the new right one vision would insulate nation states from the world the other the world from its people in this context demanding a return to the liberal world order as leading scholars in international relations and international law have recently done is an inadequate response it obscures the ways that the illiberal backlash of our moment emerged out of the inequalities and hypocrisies of that very same system from our vantage point the welfare world of the nieo might appear utopian and unrealistic but to dismiss the world that decolonization aspired to make is to refuse to reckon with the dilemmas we inherited from the end of empire it is to evade our responsibility to build a world after empire our world like manley s is characterized by a battleground of widening inequality and ongoing domination we cannot simply recreate the 1970s vision of a welfare world but we can take from its architects the insight that building an egalitarian and postimperial world is the only route to true democratic self governance
during the state of the union address on tuesday president donald trump tried to persuade americans that the us economy is booming and that it s all thanks to him in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there has been nothing like it trump said at the beginning of his speech an economic miracle is taking place in the united states by the end of his speech he ll likely point to the low unemployment rate and robust job growth as evidence of his business skills he ll probably remind americans that the us stock market had a great month in january even though 2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade he ll also definitely leave out the fact that manufacturing jobs are far from roaring back to life as a result of his new trade deals here s the truth the us economy under trump is doing just fine the president has overseen a slow but steady economic expansion albeit one that started under president barack obama there is one major problem though that growth has mostly benefited the wealthiest americans while average workers have barely seen their paychecks grow taking that into account it s no surprise that many americans are concerned nearly half 48 percent of americans say they believe economic conditions are worsening up from 45 percent in december and 36 percent in november according to a january poll by gallup a washington dc based consulting firm businesses have mostly welcomed the president s hands off approach to government regulation but not all of them are benefiting from his agenda the us steel industry is making handsome profits from steep tariffs his administration placed on imported steel and aluminum last year so are aluminum factories yet trump s obsession with taxing foreign goods has inadvertently hurt farmers and us automakers that export their products overseas even the gop s signature economic policy achievement the tax cuts and jobs act did little to boost wages and business investment however the economy isn t contracting so things could be a lot worse and it s possible they might get that way wall street banks are already preparing for the us economy to slow down in 2019 the international monetary fund also expects the global economy to cool down this year partly because of the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies the united states and china so sure trump can take credit for overseeing steady economic growth during his first two years in the white house but the story is more complicated than that and warning signs are flashing here are five things to know about the state of the us economy the gop s tax cuts are meh if there s one economic policy trump and his fellow republicans in congress oversold it was the idea that cutting taxes would propel us economic growth into outer space in november 2017 the president assured americans that slashing taxes on corporations and private businesses would provide the rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before and when trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act on december 22 2017 in the oval office he also promised that businesses would invest those tax savings in their businesses and give billions and billions of dollars away to their workers he pointed to a handful of big companies that promised to raise wages and give employees 1 000 cash bonuses among them walmart bank of america and comcast more than a year later economic data shows that the tax bill s benefit to workers was largely a mirage the left leaning economic policy institute recently crunched compensation data from the bureau of labor statistics showing that the much touted bonuses did little to boost workers paychecks in the past 12 months cash bonuses only gave workers an extra 2 cents in average hourly compensation adjusted for inflation this does not include bonuses tied to productivity goals instead us companies have spent a record amount of money this year buying back shares of company stock an effort to inflate their value for shareholders us corporations have announced spending 1 trillion on stock buybacks so far this year that s a 64 percent increase from 2017 according to cnn business so it s no mystery why the savings from the gop tax bill didn t trickle down to workers only a handful of companies 34 from the fortune 500 said they are using the tax savings to invest in us operations economists do believe the tax bill helped boost overall economic growth for a little while at least the economy was growing at about 2 2 percent a year since the end of the recession in 2009 and then hit 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 right after the tax cuts went into effect the third quarter was also strong with a 3 5 percent increase by the end of 2018 however annual economic growth fell to 2 6 percent economists expect growth to slow even more in 2019 and fall even further in 2020 so to recap instead of rocket fuel the tax cuts were more like a sugar high they gave the us economy a brief jolt while triggering an 800 billion hole in the federal budget the stock market is yikes trump s favorite measure of us economic health the stock market has been wildly unstable in recent months the president loves to take credit when the stock market is roaring but stays silent when it falls that s exactly what happened in 2018 trump bragged as the major stock indices reached record highs early in the year insisting that the market was smashing one record after another but in the last few months of 2018 things went downhill fast it was in fact the worst year for stocks since 2008 the year the country sank into the great recession as vox s emily stewart explained some of the factors behind the slide had to do with trump and some didn t as the market plummeted from october through december trump was silent but he inadvertently showed what a bad year 2018 was for us investors in a tweet he posted last week celebrating that the dow jones industrial average hit 25 000 points as vox s aaron rupar and javier zarracina point out in this chart trump tweeted the same milestone a year ago which means that the dow gained no overall value in the past year january on the other hand has been a much better month for the stock market so it s almost certain that trump will brag about that during his address to congress he ll likely ignore the rest trump s trade wars are ouch when trump arrived in the white house he promised to upend free trade which he blamed for the loss of well paying manufacturing jobs he definitely disrupted international trade but his restrictions have done more harm than good over the past year america has placed about 200 billion in tariffs on chinese goods in part to make chinese products more expensive so americans don t buy them the administration has also placed steep tariffs on all imported steel angering other major us trade partners the idea was to level out the trade deficit with china and make china buy more us goods but as expected china responded by slapping its own tariffs on american imports trump s protectionist trade agenda ended up hitting american farmers the hardest with foreign countries levying tens of billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on the american agricultural industry china mexico and canada have responded to the trump administration s taxes on imported steel aluminum and electronics with taxes on american soybeans dairy pork apples and potatoes among other american goods american farmers are desperate a total of 84 farms in the upper midwest filed for bankruptcy between july 2017 and june 2018 according to the minneapolis star tribune that s more than double the number of chapter 12 filings during the same period in 2013 and 2014 in wisconsin minnesota north dakota south dakota and montana farms that produce corn soybeans milk and beef were suffering due to low global demand and low prices according to economists and trump s trade war is making the problem even worse the problem has gotten so bad that the trump administration launched a 12 billion aid package for us farmers coping with retaliatory tariffs that foreign countries have imposed on their products in september the government cut 25 million worth of bailout checks to the agriculture industry but even the bailout may not be enough to keep farms open bankers in the midwest are worried that too many farmers are falling behind on loan payments in short trump s strategy has been to try to cripple the chinese economy at all costs while disregarding the impact on the us economy now the trade imbalance between the two countries is worse in september america s trade deficit with china reached a new high 34 1 billion that s a 13 percent increase compared to last year ford america s second largest car company said in august that trump s tariffs cost the company 1 billion and the company now expects massive layoffs on monday gm began laying off 4 000 workers in ohio placing part of the blame on trump s steel tariffs trump s trade war might help the small us steel industry but it s hurting nearly every other sector of the economy and now taxpayers are stuck with the bill of trump s 12 billion bailout job opportunities are pretty good employers added an average of 223 000 jobs a month last year far more than the 170 000 expected but that s largely because trump inherited a healthy economy and job growth from the obama administration during president obama s last two years in office the economy added 5 million jobs compared with 4 8 million in the first two years of the trump white house the job numbers do show a promising trend the us economy created more factory jobs in 2018 than any other year since 1997 the president will surely tout the 284 000 new manufacturing jobs and he should but they re hardly a sign that us manufacturing is roaring back to life compare that to the 1 2 million factory jobs that have disappeared since the great recession began a decade ago and to the other 8 million factory jobs lost before that however overall unemployment is no longer a problem the us unemployment rate has been on a steady downward trend since the end of the great recession dropping from 9 8 percent in january 2010 to 4 8 percent when obama left office under trump unemployment hit a low of 3 7 percent in september though it has started to tick up in recent months one thing trump will surely try to take credit for is the super low unemployment rate for african american workers in september the black unemployment rate fell to 6 percent for the first time setting a new record that suggests progress is being made toward closing a longstanding employment gap between black and white workers the black unemployment rate has since ticked up to 6 8 percent but that s still low by historical standards as vox s p r lockhart points out the falling unemployment rate lacks context trump s claims about the black unemployment rate are somewhat misleading while it s undeniable that the rate has hit a new low it is also true that black unemployment began declining during the obama administration and has been falling steadily for the past several years in sum job numbers under trump are great but they were also great before he took office paychecks are blah slow income growth has been the most persistent problem afflicting the us economy since the recession ended around 2010 wages have barely kept up with the cost of living even as the unemployment rate dropped and the economy expanded in january private sector workers excluding farmworkers got an average 3 cent hourly raise adding up to an average hourly pay of 27 56 in the past 12 months average hourly earnings have only increased 85 cents or 3 2 percent and that doesn t even take inflation into account january s 3 cent average hourly wage hike suggests that the trend has not really shifted it s true that wages are rising faster than they have in a decade which trump will likely point out but that s only because the us economy collapsed 10 years ago comparing current wage growth to recession era wage growth sets a pretty low standard and over the past year prices rose so paychecks had to stretch further when the 1 9 percent inflation rate is taken into account based on the consumer price index workers wages only grew about 1 3 percent within the past year a pathetic amount compared to the sky high payouts to corporate ceos frustration over stagnant wages is also the major underlying factor behind widespread worker strikes across the country in places like california oklahoma and west virginia congressional republicans had promised that their massive corporate tax cuts would help the average worker but the gains have been meager don t expect trump to bring that up

all key financial metrics we delivered 7 organic sales growth and 26 growth in diluted earnings per share we generated record cash flows which we successfully deployed on strategic acquisitions and we continued to invest on our businesses to position them for long term success in addition to the impressive result for the full year we also had a fantastic fourth quarter with record results sales were up low double digits driven by strong acquisition contributions and continuous solid organic growth orders also grew at a strong pace and we ended the year with a record backlog operating profit growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter were excellent leading to a high quality of earnings that exceeded expectations we remained very active investing our strong cash flows deploying over 750 million on three acquisitions and 364 million on an opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter we also bolstered the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet with an expanded revolving credit line and completed a private placement debt offering providing a significant capacity to pursue future growth opportunities now for the fourth quarter results fourth quarter sales were a record 1 3 billion up 11 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 organic sales growth was solid at 5 with acquisitions contributing 7 and foreign currency a 1 headwind orders also remained very solid overall orders were up 11 over the prior year with organic orders up 5 another positive book to bill quarter resulted in a record backlog of more than 1 6 billion providing us with solid visibility as we enter 2019 ebitda in the quarter was a record 332 million up 22 over the prior year period with ebitda margins a very strong 26 1 our operating income in the quarter was a record 282

increased an impressive 130 basis points over last year s fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were a record 0 86 in the quarter representing an outstanding 23 increase over the prior year s fourth quarter earnings now for the full year 2018 results ametek delivered annual records essentially on all key financial metrics in 2018 overall sales were up 13 to 4 8 billion organic sales grew

particular strength on our materials analysis businesses eig s operating income in the quarter was a record 214 6 million up 11 over the fourth quarter of 2017 reported operating margins were 26

outstanding operating performance emg sales in the fourth quarter were 445 3 million up 11 over the fourth quarter of 2017 organic sales growth was very strong at 9 while the acquisition of fmh aerospace contributed 3 and foreign currency was a one point headwind sales grew nicely across all emg businesses in the quarter with particular strength across our aerospace and engineered materials businesses emg s operating performance in the quarter was outstanding with operating income increasing 18 to 85 8 million and operating margins expanding 110 basis points to 19 3 so to summarize ametek delivered tremendous performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the year each of our businesses continued to deliver exceptional results through the execution of the ametek growth model which combines our four growth strategies with a disciplined focus on cash generation and capital deployment to create long term value for all of ametek s stakeholders i would like to thank all ametek colleagues for their exceptional work and success in 2018 before i discuss our outlook for 2019 i wanted to highlight some of the efforts our businesses are taking to drive the future of ametek i ll start with acquisitions 2018 was an exciting year on the acquisition front having deployed a record level of capital to acquire six outstanding businesses we deployed over 1 1 billion of capital on these acquisitions and acquired approximately 350 million in annual sales in the fourth quarter alone we completed three acquisitions forza and telular which i highlighted during our last earnings call and spectro scientific which we acquired in late november spectro scientific is a leading provider of machine condition monitoring solutions for critical assets in high value industrial applications they offer differentiated solutions that serve increasing need for predictive maintenance in a broad and growing set of end markets spectro scientific provides both lab based and on site instrumentation including consumables and cloud based software analytics to help customers determine and monitor the condition of lubricants and fluids in mission critical equipment they are based in chelmsford mass and have approximately 50 million in annual sales spectro scientific along with the other businesses acquired in 2018 are integrating very nicely into ametek and we expect them to add tremendous value going forward in addition to deploying a record level of capital on acquisitions we also deployed 364 million on share repurchases during the quarter bringing the total capital deployed in 2018 to nearly 1 5 billion acquisitions clearly remained the no 1 priority for capital deployment as we have done in the past we will continue to repurchase our shares opportunistically and we ll continue to pay a modest dividend to our shareholders despite the record level of capital deployment we have significant capacity available to continue our acquisition strategy and bill will touch on this further in a moment we remain focused on investing back on our businesses to support their growth initiatives in 2018 we invested approximately 75 million in incremental growth opportunities these investments were focused across our sales and marketing and research development and engineering functions we re seeing excellent result from these initiatives as we continue to drive strong organic sales growth one important driver of this organic sales growth is new product development in the fourth quarter our vitality index which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years was excellent at 25 the traction that our new products are gaining in their respective markets speak to the success of our research development and engineering efforts we also remain focused on expanding our footprint across the globe and to new adjacent markets in october we celebrated the opening of our newest technology solutions center in bangalore india the center showcases the latest products and technologies of many of ametek s businesses and is designed to assist customers in selecting the right equipment and enhance our service platforms within the region this facility greatly enhances our ability to expand our position in india s attractive growth markets we will continue to expand our global sales channels develop additional service capabilities and add to our manufacturing flexibility to better serve our customers and support global growth lastly our operational excellence initiatives continued to drive strong improvements in the operating performance as we ve seen in our margin expansion in the fourth quarter and full year results in 2018 we generated approximately 90 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives largely driven by our global sourcing and strategic procurement efforts we also remain focused on driving top line growth through our expanded commercial excellence toolkit which continues to drive additional market share gains across our businesses these key strategies make up the cornerstone of ametek s growth model and will remain a strong focus as we move into 2019 now let me provide some brief comments on tariffs our businesses continue to do a tremendous job managing each of the work streams we have put in place to help address the effects of tariffs while the situation remains fluid we remain very confident in our ability to mitigate the headwinds from the announced tariffs given our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our business the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain and our ability to shift production given our asset light business model ametek s proven operational excellence capability which captures each of these elements positions us extremely well to offset the impacts from tariffs in the fourth quarter we were able to fully offset the direct impact from tariffs and for all of 2019 we also expect we will be able to offset the impact of known tariffs through our various initiatives now i ll move to our outlook for the year as we noted in our press release going forward we will report eps results and guidance on an adjusted basis that adds back non cash after tax acquisition related intangible amortization we believe providing this non gaap measure allows our shareholders to better understand the strength of our cash flow generation and core operating results and aligns more comparably to our acquisitive peers with that said we expect 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 3 95 to 4 05 an increase of 8 to 11 over the comparable result in 2018 we expect overall sales in 2019 to be up high single digits organic sales are expected to be up 3 to 5 with a similar level of organic growth across each reportable segment for the first quarter we anticipate sales will be up high single digits adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of 0 95 to 0 97 per diluted share a 9 to 11 increase over the prior year to conclude our teams performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and delivered outstanding results in 2018 we are firmly positioned to achieve another year of solid growth and sustainable long term success through the execution of the ametek growth model i will now turn it over to bill burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we ll be glad to take your questions bill bill burke executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you dave as dave highlighted ametek finished the year with a strong performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter i will provide some additional financial details but first a brief comment on the fourth quarter tax related gain as part of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ametek recognized a net gain in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings this gain was considered provisional and was subject to further adjustment during the measurement period the 11 8 million or 0 05 gain we recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was the finalization of the provisional adjustments from tax reform now on to the additional financial highlights sore selling expense was up in line with core sales in the quarter general administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were down slightly over the prior year and were 1 5 of sales in the quarter down from 1 6 of sales in last year s fourth quarter 2019 general administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2018 levels the adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22 8 and in line with our expectations this compares to last year s adjusted rate of 25 7 the year over year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22 as we ve stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate working capital in the quarter was very solid at 16 9 of sales essentially in line with last year s fourth quarter capital expenditures were 35 million for the quarter and 82 million for the full year we expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately 100 million or 1 9 of sales reflecting our asset light business model depreciation and amortization expense was 54 million in the fourth quarter and 200 million for the full year in 2019 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 235 million including acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately 130 million or 0 43 per diluted share as dave mentioned our businesses continued to generate excellent levels of cash flow fourth quarter operating cash flow and free cash flow were both records at 296 million and 262 million respectively with both up 17 over the prior year free cash flow conversion for the quarter was outstanding at 131 of adjusted net income our full year cash flow was also very strong operating cash flow for 2018 was 926 million and free cash flow was 843 million both of these metrics up 11 over the prior year we remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions and as dave mentioned ametek had an outstanding year on this front in all of 2018 we deployed more than 1 1 billion on six acquisitions with approximately 750 million deployed on three acquisitions in the fourth quarter alone in addition we deployed 368 million on share repurchases in 2018 with 364 million of the repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter total debt at december 31 was 2 63 billion up from 2 17 billion at the end of 2017 offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of 354 million following our record level of capital deployment in 2018 we still have significant capacity to support our growth initiatives with more than 1 5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities these amounts reflect the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended and upsized revolving credit facility we announced in november and which i discussed during our last call as well as the private placement offering we announced in mid december the private placement offering consisted of 660 million of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 3 93 and a weighted average maturity of 8 2 years the proceeds were used to pay outstanding borrowings on our revolver as well as a maturing 100 million senior note in december to summarize our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter to complete an exceptional year looking ahead to 2019 our outlook is positive as we are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows kevin kevin coleman vice president of investor relations thanks bill jimmy could we please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from scott graham with bmo capital markets your line is now open scott graham bmo capital markets analsyt hey good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning so i have two questions one on organic and one on the savings which is the three to five percent organic guidance i m just wondering two things on this your orders organic orders have been running at 5 or better for quite some time you had a pretty good fourth quarter i m just wondering is there something relative to the orders where maybe that s a little bit longer term that would be keeping the guidance to 3 to 5 and then secondly what gets you to the 5 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right i appreciate the question we re expecting solid growth in 2019 but we do expect the growth to moderate compared to 2018 and the growth is moderating a bit because of the global uncertainties and the trade tensions but we expect to continue to grow nicely and certainly the comparisons will make it more difficult we just completed eight quarters with average organic growth of 6 and six straight quarters with a positive book to bill so and we ended the year with a record backlog so overall we feel very good about the environment we re operating in and we feel good what we re hearing from our business and our customers and we continue to see a solid underlying demand and we re positioned to perform very well in this environment and we re executing very well but there is a little bit of global uncertainty and our guidance takes that into account scott graham bmo capital markets analsyt got it and then secondly on the savings i know you mentioned that most of the 90 million in savings this year was from global procurement i was wondering if you can kind of maybe specifically parse that out global procurement versus the other areas and what you re expecting on that from each for 2019 as well dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer sure sure scott and as you know we started the year in 2018 with an 80 million guide for cost savings and those are cost savings that actually worked their way through the p l and where we ended up we did a little bit better than that and it was largely driven by our sourcing initiatives so we ended up at 90 million as you mentioned about 70 million of that was from sourcing and about 20 million was from other opex initiatives and for 2019 we re starting to guide at 80 million about 60 million of that will come from sourcing initiatives and strategic procurement initiatives and about 20 million from other opex initiatives operator our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research your line is now open nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning nigel coe wolfe research analyst yes i want to get away from the ops for a second and just talk about the share repurchases in 4q i mean you re not known for being a heavy repurchase company so is that a reflection of the m a options on the table here the backlog or is it more a reflection of your share price at november december and supporting your stock at those levels and the real question is how does the m a backlog look from here dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes the m a backlog looks great we just completed a record year and i think the pipeline looks equivalent to what it looked like as we entered 2018 so for 2019 we have a very strong pipeline over time we have an opportunistic view of share purchases and we see the market adjust like it did in the fourth quarter and we have a strong balance sheet we thought it was a good time to buy back some shares and in the past that has been a good investment for ametek shareholders when we made that decision nigel coe wolfe research analyst i agree with that and then dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer when you think about our balance sheet nigel we entered 2018 with a debt to ebitda of about 1 95 of 1 95 we ended 2018 at the same level 1 96 so we deployed over 1 5 billion on acquisition and m a and we still have the same debt to ebitda so it s really the strong balance sheet the strong cash flow generation and generating capability of the company and the fact that we could control our own destiny to a certain degree nigel coe wolfe research analyst and then one question two parts what are you seeing in china you ve got a recently large exposure to china about terms in the sales what do you see in there by major business and then on tariffs you talked about how your company covered tariffs do you have list three 25 price right now or do you have to go out and reprice if we do get that step up in march dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right great questions the list three is built into our guidance so what we assumed in march 1 that the tariffs would go to 25 that s built into our guide and as i said in the prepared remarks we feel comfortable that we ll be able to offset the impact of tariffs completely and regarding to china china is an important marker for us it s about 9 of our sales and china grew nicely in the quarter it drove overall asia growth of 12 and that was a bit higher than the overall asia growth and certainly the trade situation with china has a complexity that we re watching very closely so far we continued to grow nicely but we re going to continue to monitor that as i ve said before the reality is that we produce products that china market needs to operate their manufacturing capability to monitor their nuclear power plants and help clean up their environment we are expecting growth to moderate in 2019 more in line with ametek s overall growth but we feel good about that level of growth in china for 2019 operator and our next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson your line is now open matt summerville d a davidson co analyst thank you good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning matt matt summerville d a davidson co analyst can you first talk about how much price you guys actually realized in 18 and based upon the comments you just made david how much price you anticipate realizing for 2019 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer sure matt as you ll recall during the year we increased our pricing as we got ahead of tariffs and inflation and q4 was much like q3 q4 we had an excellent quarter we achieved a bit more than 2 of price across our entire portfolio total inflation was about 1 5 so we re very pleased with these results and we think we re well positioned to continue the trend in 2019 specifically for 2019 we re expecting about two points of price and about the same level of total inflation about one and a half points so the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our of the ametek portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets and our focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of the global changing environment so we re feeling good about pricing going into 2019 matt summerville d a davidson co analyst and then david can you comment when you look in the fourth quarter specifically with emg what drove the year over year acceleration in organic performance against a double digit comparison and then specifically can you also comment at what you re seeing with respect to the robotics and automation market specifically dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes robotics and automation was a driver of the emg growth but it was more broad based than that i mean we had a really solid growth in the military aerospace business and we also saw solid growth on our emip business so pretty much all components of emg were firing in all cylinders in the fourth quarter operator our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is now open allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst hi guys good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst could you maybe give us a little bit more color on growth investments in 2019 i mean obviously the new products developments there but where else are you focusing your growth investment dollars for 19 at this point dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right we re our growth investments incremental growth investments for 2019 are up about 7 versus 2018 and we re going to invest incrementally about 80 million in growth investments and they re going to be across incremental sales opportunities incremental marketing opportunities and incremental engineering opportunities and then they re in three buckets and they re probably about equally spread across those buckets allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst that s helpful and then incremental operating leverage for 19 anything we should be mindful of there that could maybe drive it outside of the normal for you dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we were for 2018 we had excellent operating income margins we had about 110 basis points of expansion ex acquisitions and the core incrementals were about 35 and we think about 2019 we re back to about 30 to 40 basis points of operating income margin expansion and we re back to about the incrementals of 30 to 35 there is really nothing driving that except that there s a going to see how the year get started and but we feel good about the way the company is performing and the margin performance of the company operator our next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer your line is now open christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thank you good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst dave i m wondering about the 80 million in savings for cash similar to execute in 2019 you ve been delivering that range as long as i ve been covering you i just wanted to ask about the evergreen expects of that does that get more challenging at some point dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer i don t think it does chris it s kind of in our dna we go around to each of our businesses and we look at cost reductions as an element of our core operating environment and there s always new acquisitions that come into the fold that provide some new opportunities so i think we re solid for 2019 and when i look at long term i think as long as we keep executing our strategy they will remain evergreen opportunities christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst and in the outlook i m just curious if you re seeing any acceleration in aerospace clearly some peers are seeing that into that vertical and overall if there are other areas that are accelerating versus notably stable or potentially some rollover dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes i think our aerospace and defense businesses had an outstanding fourth quarter i mean a lot of it is that s what you see across other businesses our sales were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter and the growth was driven by very strong organic growth organic growth was 10 on our aerospace business in the fourth quarter we had similar to the first three quarters of the year we continued to see solid and balanced growth across aerospace markets with notable strength across both commercial and military businesses and so we re feeling good about our aerospace business operator our next question comes from brett linzey with vertical research your line is now open brett linzey vertical research analyst good morning all kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning brett brett linzey vertical research analyst i just wanted to talk about the pace or pattern of activity through q4 any major fluctuations between october and december and then how did january orders perform for the total company dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes great question brett q4 played out like a typical q4 we strengthened into q4 and december was our strongest month in terms of orders and sales so that s pretty typical for us and we had a very strong december as we anticipated when you look at january recently completed our orders were right on plan so we feel really good about january orders and across the board across all business they came in on plan so we feel good about that too brett linzey vertical research analyst ok and then just more housekeeping what are you assuming for interest expense in 2019 given the heavy deal load in q4 and are you assuming any de leveraging within that assumption bill burke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes our interest expense is going to be up a bit in 2019 up a little bit and what was the second brett if you look at our debt profile most of it is fixed debt with some balance on the revolver so given the new private placement in december and the heavy acquisition and share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter you ll see an increase probably upwards of close to 10 in interest expense year over year and given that most everything of our debt is fixed you ll see modest de everaging as we pay down our revolver but again that s really going to depend on the pace of acquisition activity as we go through the year so our full expectation is we ll continue to be very active on the deal front and de leveraging won t be a factor operator our next question comes from deane dray with rbc capital markets your line is now open deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning deane dray rbc capital markets analyst i d like to start first with a congratulations on the move to cash eps look we all acknowledge it doesn t change the fundamentals but it certainly puts you on a level playing field with your acquisition minded competitors what i also like seeing is that you guys are willing to adapt and be flexible so maybe you can share with us a bit about the deliberation process internally obviously at the beginning of the year would be the time to do it but any insight into the focus internally on this dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer it all comes down to our cash flow and we have strong cash flows or consistent cash flows and it s just another window into our financials that will allow our shareholders to better understand the strength of those cash generating capabilities and as you said it aligns more comparably with our acquisitive peers but it doesn t change how we re operating the business it doesn t change how we re valuing deals we always value deals on a cash basis anyhow so really it s additional information a different window into the business that will provide our investors with that view and we ve got most people that we talk to wanted to go to cash eps some minority were not fans of it but net net the aggregate it was a good decision for us because we didn t want to disadvantage everyone versus our peers deane dray rbc capital markets analyst great and for the record we re big fans of the move so we applaud that and then second question is on capex so 100 million you did 82 million in 2018 that said nice healthy 20 plus boost and if we look around the multi industry sector that s probably going to be one of the higher if not the highest percentage increases i think it s the first look we re seeing is closer to flat so that speaks to your growth ambitions and confidence but can you share with us the thought about investing capex here at this rate and how committed are you to spend all of it and kind of what kind of returns are you expecting dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we re an asset light business and we spend less than 2 of sales historically on capex and the 100 million ends up being about 1 9 of sales and there were really good projects across our businesses and it made sense to fund them and they all have excellent returns so i think there is a commitment to do that and our businesses have good plans so we re a bigger business we acquired some businesses there are some investments that are needed to be made but still within the context of being an asset light business and spending less than 2 of sales on capital deane dray rbc capital markets analyst and do you look at those returns in comparison to the same thresholds on acquisitions what s the algorithm there dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes usually the returns on internal capex are much higher but there is a process that gives a similar metric on returns and they come bottom up from our businesses and we evaluate them during the budget process and that s where we ended up this year operator and our next question comes from robert mccarthy with stephens your line is now open robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good morning everyone can you hear me kevin coleman vice president of investor relations yes robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst great great well good to be back and i must say my brethren have asked a lot of very very direct good questions so we re getting to the end of the bingo card here but nevertheless just a couple of things i mean i guess number one i know i ve been out of it for a while but can you do the typical around the horn on organic growth across the segments and orders trends dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer sure rob and we re glad to have you back and i will go around the horn i talked about aerospace a little bit and so i ll start with our process businesses and so we finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter the overall sales were up mid teens driven by contributions from the acquisitions of soundcom forza telular and spectro scientific organic sales were up mid single digits in the quarter with particularly strong growth across our materials analysis business and for 2019 we expect another solid year for our process businesses with organic sales expected to be up mid single digits our automation and engineered solutions business has closed out the year with another excellent quarter with organic sales up high single digits in the fourth quarter dunkermotoren continued to deliver excellent results as their growth funnel is driving exciting new applications in precision motion control additionally as i mentioned before our engineered solutions businesses are seeing continued solid demand across our key markets and in 2019 we expect a solid mid single digit organic growth across our automation and engineered solutions business and that brings me to power and industrial overall sales were for power and industrial were up mid single digits driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of arizona instrument and motec organic sales were down low single digits in the quarter against a difficult prior year comparison for our power instrumentation business and for 2019 we expect low to mid single digit of growth with balanced growth across power and industrial so if you look at our different market segments we re expecting mid single for process mid single for aerospace low to mid for power and industrial and mid single for automation and engineered solutions robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst and just in that context in the context of this question how do you think about your oil and gas especially metals exposure for the quarter and then expectations for next year just break that out for us dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes sure rob in the fourth quarter our oil and gas was up mid single digits our upstream was up mid teens and our mid and downstream was flat it was a precipitous decline and then a significant increase in the quarter really didn t affect business conditions much for us for all of 2019 we expect our oil and gas business to grow mid single digits and we expect the upstream to be up high single digits and the mid and downstream to be up low to mid single digits so moderating growth but still solid for our oil and gas businesses robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst and especially metals i mean i didn t know if you had dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer the metals business was it was up a bit higher than emg so emg we had solid growth and especially metals had a good quarter and for 19 we expect it to be in line with ametek growth so we re seeing strong markets the end markets there are aerospace medical specialized industrials so that s the businesses doing well and we re expecting it to continue in 2019 somewhat on a moderating basis robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst if you ll indulge me one follow up a different question looking at some of your ostensible comps in the public market through your acquisition stories they definitely have a narrative around how they buy companies i think there s a narrative view of all not formally articulated but if you were to formally articulate how you go about buying companies and improving them what would you focus on would you focus on besides higher public and private multiples i mean would you focus on r d enhancement would you focus on international expansion or global excellence procurement how would you explain to someone how you re going to take a business and make it better on the sg a gross margin front working capital front and what is kind of your secret sauce for capital deployment and fundamentally making these businesses selecting these businesses but then fundamentally making them better dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right rob in terms of selection it really comes down to the being in a narrow adjacency of our existing presence and we look for product differentiation we look for service differentiation that s the no 1 attribute and in terms of how we add value to deals we have a long track record of taking businesses that are 10 to 15 ebitda and then doubling the margins in over the course of three to five years and really it s all of the above in terms of how we do it we have seasoned operators that are very experienced in m a and very experienced in improving the businesses and we the playbook that we develop can be based on improving organic growth in terms of exploiting global opportunities they can be based on improving their gross margins by global sourcing it can be based on reducing g a it can be there s a whole playbook and certainly pricing is one thing that we think we have some insight into these markets and know what price can be paid and what the customers are willing to pay so we do we have a very well defined process it results in the custom playbooks for each business we have excellent process capability it s a process capability across deal sourcing across deal modeling diligence and integration and i think our secret sauce is our very strong business operators that are well engrained in the ametek business system and they provide ownership for delivery of the financial metrics for each individual deal and none of that has changed and we have a great class of businesses that joined ametek in 2018 and we re looking forward to improving them in 2019 and we also have a strong pipeline that we re looking at bringing into the company so we feel very good about the m a opportunities for ametek operator our next question comes from andrew obin with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning andrew andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst just a couple of questions from me i was really surprised by your china growth number very different i think from a lot of your competitors can you just give us some more color as to what end markets are driving this strong performance dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes i think the biggest market that s driving the strong performance are our process and analytic instrumentation businesses and it s chiefly because their primary products allow customers to enhance their manufacturing capabilities so as china moves up the value chain and wants to do more sophisticated manufacturing our process businesses provide that capability through their instrumentation so that s the primary reason that we ve been doing so well in china and as i said we think the growth is going to moderate but we still feel good about the market andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst sure thing and then the follow up question on m a and by the way just to consult when you say process that s manufacturing process not oil and gas process right dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and just a question on m a have you guys changed how you guys source the deals because a lot of companies sort of complain about the pricing availability you guys still seem to be able to execute very well on the m a pipeline if you could give us some color on sourcing of your deals and evolution of your sourcing over the past couple of years and a great quarter by the way dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer well thank you andrew thank you yes deal sourcing is a competitive advantage for ametek we have in our niche presences we dedicate resources to developing a pipeline of deals so some of our deals come through the typical auction process but some of our deals are privately sourced by businesses that see how we operate in the niche markets that we re in so and we have a dedicated we have about nine or 10 m a professionals or 10 actually 10 m a professionals who work closely with our businesses and they identify strategic acquisitions and we have people dedicated to the field to so let s say it s a business process it s not just an event and that process allows us to build up an intangible asset on this pipeline of deals that we follow over the years so when we re looking to acquire them they see how we operate and we re a preferred buyer so it s really a long term commitment to the markets that we re operating in and good knowledge about the targets and the pipeline as i said looks as strong now as it did entering last year and last year we had a record year operator our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley your line is now open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning josh josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst yes just a follow up on some of the other questions that have been asked i guess first on some of the actions that we saw on the fourth quarter particularly the oil price dislocation i think for a lot of folks that brought up kind of the 16 17 time frame and some of the volatility you saw in the businesses back then just to as a bit of a sanity check can you remind us kind of how far off trough or maybe still how far away from prior peak some of those businesses are give us some sensitivity around if we were to come into a more difficult macro scenario and maybe there s not as much downside as there was back in that time frame dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes sure josh if we go back our oil and gas exposure was peak at about 400 million and right now total exposure is about 290 million so it s about 6 of the company and about 290 million so we re still well off our peak and of our presence about a third of that is u s and two thirds of it is international and about 25 of it is upstream and 75 is mid and downstream and what we re seeing in the market is pretty typical of oil and gas expansion the upstream starts as you come out of the cycle and then it transitions to mid and downstream and we have a bigger mid and downstream presence so we re expecting the mid and downstream to pick up a little bit this year so we re feeling pretty good about our oil and gas presence right now and we think we re well positioned josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst got it that s helpful and then a lot of questions on m a during the call maybe one more from me a lot of your peers that are kind of in the same category as being compounders and who have also moved to cash eps i think have also tried to develop a bit more of a recurring revenue profile i think in eig you probably touched more data than a lot of your peers or competitors out there is there an ambition to maybe step up the recurring revenue side of that through something in the software space is that something that you looked at in the pipeline something that you ve kind of considered strategically just curious what your thoughts on those are dave dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer that was a great question if you look at the last two acquisitions we did with telular and spectro scientific there is both a recurring theme in both of those businesses that s tied to the software that s tied to the data and is i think with telular we have about 65 recurring revenue and with spectro about 25 recurring revenue in both cases they re dealing with information they re dealing with algorithms they re dealing with making the information and solving customer problems so it s definitely a focus for us and we have a tremendous growing software capability that we ve been investigate investing in over many years we have about 150 engineers in india developing software for us in bangalore so we have a good internal capability and with our acquisition profile it s certainly something that we re looking at and the recurring nature is something that is key for us to grow in ametek operator our next question comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets your line is now open ken newman keybanc capital markets analyst hey thanks for fitting me in this is actually ken newman on for steve i just had a quick modeling question and i m sure if this has been covered already but you had really good flexibility to hedge some changes in fx this quarter just curious is there any embedded expectations for the impact on foreign exchange to sales or margin within the guide dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes for the full year 2018 on the top line fx was a benefit of about a point but for 2019 the full year fx is a negative 1 and then when we move to the bottom line as we ve communicated in the past we re largely naturally hedged at the profit line given the general balance of revenues and costs across currencies so you won t see a meaningful impact either way on our profit results from the fx movement so that s how we model the year and that s been the history of how the business has resulted in operations ken newman keybanc capital markets analyst got it and then last one from me you saw a pretty decent acceleration in the incremental margin for emg i think someone else touched on this a little bit before is there any reason to believe that that could kind of revert back to the same type of incrementals you saw in the last in the first half of 18 or is this kind of run rate for incremental margin pretty solid for 2019 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we had a good year in 18 and we had a good year in q4 our incrementals were solid at 40 with our eig business around 50 and our emg business around 30 and for 2019 we re expecting good solid incrementals but more in the 30 or 35 range operator and our next question comes from richard eastman with baird your line is now open richard eastman robert w baird co analyst dave just kind of reading the body language here through your body language here through all the responses and questions as we guide the 3 to 5 core for 19 i m curious i mean the tone here is such that the businesses generally stay steady and strong but run up against the comps and so is that largely kind of how you re feeling about the business right now given the backlog the orders is this is the 3 to 5 really kind of a comp issue more so than the tone of business in any of the segments dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes i think that s an accurate representation of how we re feeling rick richard eastman robert w baird co analyst yes and in like dunkermotoren i mean you commented how strong it was in the fourth quarter but i would think of that business as being maybe an earlier cyclical kind of indicator oil and gas maybe the same but no break in trend in those businesses at all when you look out to 19 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer when you think about dunkermotoren and think automation and the global macro trends automation is really a secular trend so dunkermotoren is a really strong backlog and is performing exceptionally well and as i said with the oil and gas we re positioned now with a larger mid and downstream presence to do quite well in that business of performing very well and we re quite away from our peak so we re feeling pretty good about that richard eastman robert w baird co analyst and geographically the 3 to 5 they re pretty much spread across the three major regions in terms of an expectation for 19 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes that s pretty much maybe a little bit better growth in the u s but pretty much all geographies will grow in that 3 to 5 range richard eastman robert w baird co analyst ok and then just maybe a last question this might be a little bit more difficult but when you look at ametek s mix of business on a next 12 month basis could you take a swing at what revenue was coming from call it maybe the medical and food exposure that we now have i mean it must be north of half a billion i would presume dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes our medical exposure is about 13 14 of sales and you have to work with kevin on the food exposure i m not as we usually don t break that out so that s combined in our process businesses and it actually shows up a little bit about in our automation businesses also but it s a growing presence but the medical the healthcare business is about 13 14 of sales and it s performing well for us richard eastman robert w baird co analyst ok ok and just last question the aerospace you maybe provided this but in terms of 19 what s the growth expectation for all of aerospace and do we still lead with commercial and military or has the bizjet piece of the business has the backlog there built or how do we look at the four segments there against the 19 forecast dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we re expecting growth in all four segments and our guide is positive mid single digit growth and we re still seeing strong business in the military and commercial side so business jet is going to have a solid year but we think we re going to have more strength in commercial and military richard eastman robert w baird co analyst ok great thank you dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer thanks rick operator and i m showing no further questions in the queue at this time i d like to turn the call back over to kevin coleman

delivered another solid performance in the fourth quarter with organic sales up 5 2 adjusted operating margin up 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share up 23 at a segment level in commercial and industrial organic sales were up 1 3 with strength in a number of end markets including power generation oil and gas and commercial hvac offsetting weakness in asia particularly china in the climate segment organic sales were up a strong 9 4 with strength in north american residential hvac both oem and aftermarket as well as commercial refrigeration partially offset by weakness in international market finally in the pts segment organic sales were up a strong 9 for the quarter with robust growth in distribution and oil and gas from an operating profit perspective the adjusted operating margin improved 80 basis points year over year the operating margin benefited from volume incremental price and variable cost productivity but was held back by commodity inflation and tariffs the resulted adjusted earnings per share was up 23 and was based on strong operational performance with no benefit coming from the 2018 tax reform for the quarter free cash flow to net income was 169 in the quarter we repurchased 49 5 million of our shares the fourth quarter was the sixth quarter out of the last seven that we have repurchased shares additionally we also announced the divestiture of non core engineered drives business which we closed down in january overall it was a strong close to a record year with strong organic sales growth and further progress on our march to improve operating margins looking forward as we enter the new year overall we expect continued growth in 2019 despite the tougher year over year comparisons for 2019 our guidance assumes total year organic growth to be up low to mid single digits we expect to carry the price benefits from our 2018 increases into 2019 we expect our top line to benefit from continued growth in residential and light commercial hvac end markets and we expect to benefit from the upcoming fer energy efficiency regulation we are planning for modest growth in north american commercial and industrial markets and we are planning for market headwinds in china and europe and margin performance our manufacturing facilities are performing well and we continue to realize the benefits of our simplification initiative further we are making the needed investments in our tariff mitigation programs to help offset the impact of tariffs with these mitigation programs and the benefits of the pricing carryover we expect to continue to offset tariffs and commodity inflation in 2019 our total year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2019 has been set at 6 15 to 6 55 up 6 at the midpoint of our guidance when you account for the impact of our recent divestitures and exits our earnings per share guidance for our ongoing business would result in a 10 increase in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint i will now turn it over to rob rob rehard vice president chief financial officer thank you mark and good morning everyone sales in the fourth quarter 2018 were 881 7 million up 7 4 from the prior year acquisitions contributed 3 9 the business to be exited was a negative 0 4 and foreign currency was a negative 1 4 in the quarter therefore organic sales increased a solid 5 2 from the prior year with all three segments contributing our adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 10 7 our margin was up 80 basis points compared to the prior year margins benefited from both volume growth and productivity improvements price cost was slightly positive in the quarter additionally we incurred 10 8 million in lifo expense which impacted all three segments for your reference i ve included a table at the bottom of the slide showing the lifo expense or benefit by segment for the fourth quarter 2018 and the fourth quarter 2017 overall it was a solid quarter with strong organic sales growth and continued operating margin improvement our fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share reported on a gaap basis were 1 28 there were a number of adjustments to gaap eps in the fourth quarter the first adjustment was restructuring and related costs of 2 2 million or 0 04 per share the second adjustment was a gain on the sale of assets of 2 2 million or 0 04 per share the third adjustment was related to the business to be exited of 800 000 or 0 01 per share the fourth adjustment was related to ceo transition cost of 3 8 million or 0 07 per share and the final adjustment was related to the impact of the new us tax legislation of 3 million or 0 07 per share net of these adjustments the adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 1 41 representing a 22 6 increase from the prior year now i will summarize a few key financial metrics our capital expenditures were 18 4 million in the fourth quarter capital expenditures were 77 6 million for the full year 2018 our simplification activities resulted in 2 2 million of restructuring and related costs in the fourth quarter restructuring and related costs were 7 7 million for the full year 2018 in the upper right quadrant we show our effective tax rate information the adjusted etr in the fourth quarter was 21 we re adjusting the etr for the effect of the impact of the new us tax legislation i mentioned on the prior slide we ve provided a table in the appendix of this presentation to reconcile the gaap etr to the adjusted etr our adjusted etr was 20 8 for the full year 2018 in the lower left quadrant we present information on our fourth quarter 2018 balance sheet our total debt was 1 307 million and our net debt was 1 059 million we finished the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 2 0 in the lower right quadrant we present information on our free cash flow we generated 94 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter representing 169 of net income for the quarter and lastly we repurchased just over 645 000 of our shares for 49 5 million in the fourth quarter throughout 2018 we repurchased over 1 6 million of our shares for 127 8 million before i cover 2019 guidance i would like to spend some time talking about a number of businesses we either have or will be divesting or exiting you may have seen this referenced in yesterday s earnings release on the top half of this page i have provided the five different non core businesses that have been or expect to be divested or exited the first is the residential hermetic motor parts business we disclosed in the second quarter of 2018 the second business is the engineered drives and controls business we announced at the end of 2018 and divested at the beginning of 2019 the final three businesses are other small non core businesses that we have already or will be divesting or exiting early in 2019 on the bottom half of this page i have provided a summary of the impact of these businesses to be divested and exited by segment the results of these businesses are not included in our 2019 guidance i would like to point out to all of our investors that additional details related to these divestitures and exits are included in the appendix of this presentation in these tables we ve included net sales and adjusted income from operations for each segment by quarter and for the full year as well as the impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year so you can clearly see the impact of these divestitures and exits on our ongoing business divesting or exiting non core businesses is consistent with one of the key elements of our enterprise strategy which is focusing on the core now i will provide information on our full year guidance for 2019 our guidance assumes low to mid single digit organic sales growth for the full year we are expected expecting continued improvement in our adjusted operating margin for the full year 2019 making this the third consecutive year of improvement we are expecting to see improvements in all three segments from volume leverage continued simplification efforts and price we are expecting free cash flow to exceed net income for the full year our full year 2019 gaap eps guidance is 6 59 to 6 99 on an adjusted eps basis our full year 2019 guidance is 6 15 to 6 55 the expected adjustments to convert the gaap eps to the adjusted eps total of 0 44 per share the adjustments are restructuring and related costs of 10 million or 0 18 per share a gain on the sale of assets related to the recent divestiture of the engineered drives and controls business of 40 million or 0 70 per share and ceo transition costs of 4 5 million or 0 08 per share also shown on this slide for your reference are some key assumptions included in our 2019 guidance in summary at the midpoint of our guidance our full year adjusted eps is expected to be up 6 over the prior year or 10 on a comparable basis after accounting for the impact of the divestitures and exits included in the appendix of this presentation now i will turn the call over to jon jon avampato vice president chief information officer thanks rob good morning everyone before i cover the normal updates on the segments i d like to talk about the recent ahr expo in atlanta and the upcoming fer regulation at the trade show we had the opportunity to highlight our latest hvac and refrigeration technologies to both our existing customers and potential new customers consistent with our enterprise strategy there were three key innovation themes to our booth the first theme of energy efficiency is all about the new products we have introduced to help our customers meet upcoming regulations the most significant is the upcoming fer regulation for gas furnaces which goes into effect in july of this year we showcased an entire lineup of new products developed to help our customers meet the new rule we continue to expect 40 million in annual incremental sales in our climate solutions segment as a result of the fer regulation we re forecasting a meaningful impact in the second half of 2019 by 2020 we would expect to see the full impact of the incremental sales the second theme is around iot capabilities of our new products we had many examples in our booth to show our customers a great example is the insight motor and control our entry level product targeted for fer this new product features near field communication which allows our oem customers to easily program the product on their production lines reducing inventory and improving productivity we also believe that this iot feature can simplify the commissioning and troubleshooting of hvac systems we were excited that our new insight motor and control was recognized at the show by receiving the 2019 ahr innovation award and finally the third theme was all about our disruptive axial technology this technology delivers improvements and reduced size weight noise and increased energy efficiency many of the new products displayed in our booth are utilizing axial technology last year we experienced solid growth across the hvac markets and we re excited about the growth our innovation efforts will deliver in 2019 now i ll walk through each of the segments and give more details on organic sales and operating margin performance in commercial industrial systems sales were 437 million with organic sales increasing 1 3 from prior year we were facing a relatively difficult comparison in c i as organic sales were up 8 8 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we experienced sales strength in oil and gas power generation and commercial hvac sales and distribution were relatively flat to the prior year this strength was partially offset by weakness across asia particularly in china price improved sequentially and was up over prior year price cost continue to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter similar to our performance in the second and third quarter we were pleased with the favorable price cost performance given additional cost headwinds we experienced from the tariffs and lifo expense adjusted operating margin was 7 8 of sales up 170 basis points from prior year productivity from our simplification programs and price had a positive impact on our margins lifo expense was a drag to margin in the quarter but did help the year over year comparison inflation and tariff expense were headwinds for the full year organic sales grew 4 7 in our c i segment and adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points over prior year our margin improvement efforts for the c i segment are on track and we expect to deliver another year of meaningful margin improvement in 2019 in climate solutions adjusted sales were 223 million with organic sales increasing a strong 9 4 from prior year in north america sales in residential hvac were up low double digit to prior year with strength with both our oem and distribution customers we also experienced sales strength in commercial refrigeration and water heating sales in europe were up slightly over the prior year the strength in north america was partially offset by headwinds in asia and the middle east price improved sequentially and was up over prior year price cost continue to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter similar to our performance in the second and third quarter adjusted operating margin was 15 of adjusted sales down 30 basis points from prior year volume productivity in our manufacturing operations mix and price all had a positive impact on margins the lifo expense in the quarter compared with the large lifo benefit in the prior year was a margin headwind and offset these benefits for the full year in the climate segment organic sales grew by 4 6 and in spite of the year over year increase in lifo expense adjusted operating margin was a strong 15 5 we entered 2019 encouraged by the overall end market demand and our ability to drive organic sales growth with our innovation efforts sales in power transmission solutions were 213 million with organic sales increasing a strong 9 from prior year in the quarter we experienced strength across a number of end markets including distribution oil and gas marine and commercial hvac similar to the third quarter we saw weaker demand in agriculture price improved sequentially and was up over prior year price cost was favorable in the quarter adjusted operating margin was 11 9 of sales down 30 basis points from the prior year the higher volume price and productivity in our manufacturing operations had a positive impact on margins and similar to our climate business the lifo expense in the quarter compared with the large lifo benefit in the prior year was a margin headwind and offset these benefits for the full year organic sales grew by 9 1 in the pts segment and adjusted operating margin was 12 6 up 120 basis points from the prior year it was great progress in 2018 and we re expecting another year of sales growth and margin improvement in our pts business in 2019 before i turn the call back over to mark i d like to reflect on the three year financial commitments that we made at our investor day meeting in march of 2017 the metrics in purple are the targets that we committed to deliver by 2019 in green we show the progress that we have made through the first two years of 2017 and 2018 in the first two years we ve delivered an organic sales compound annual growth rate of 5 2 higher than our target we ve experienced strength in many of the end markets and the investments we re making to grow organic sales are paying off over the past two years we ve increased adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points and return on invested capital by 180 basis points during this time period we were faced with significant inflation from both the commodities and freight and we also had to deal with the increased tariff expenses in 2018 we were able to overcome these headwinds and deliver meaningful improvement and profitability and finally free cash flow to net income exceeded 100 in each of the past two years coming in at a 112 through the two year period we ve made significant progress on all four metrics through the first two years we expect further progress in 2019 and the targets remain in sight we re confident that the three elements of our enterprise strategy are key to delivering these results focus on the core innovate to grow and simplification i ll now turn the call back over to mark mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks jeff thanks jon before we go to q a i would like to briefly reflect on our 2018 total year results 2018 was a record year in both sales and adjusted earnings organic sales were up 5 7 and adjusted operating margins increased 60 basis points versus the prior year in spite of the significant commodity and tariff headwinds adjusted earnings per share increased 23 with most of the benefit coming from operations versus tax reform and for the eighth consecutive year we finished with free cash flow to net income greater than 100 this year s free cash flow to net income was 116 in 2018 we made the strategic acquisition of nicotra gebhardt to strengthen our position in the commercial air moving space we repurchased roughly 128 million of our shares and we reduced our net debt to adjusted ebitda to 2 0 over the last six months we have put plans in place to exit or divested five non core businesses with annual revenues totaling roughly 200 million this will allow our management team to focus on and reinvest back in our core operations further we have a healthy pipeline of potential core related acquisition targets finally jon laid out the three year performance targets we communicated at the march 2017 investor day organic growth operating margin return on invested capital and free cash flow to net income we are pleased that in both 2017 and 2018 we made meaningful progress on all four metrics and we believe that with our expected 2019 performance the target range is still in sight as we close 2018 we expect that the 2018 momentum will continue into 2019 our 2019 guidance reflects low to mid single digits organic growth our third consecutive year of margin improvement and a resulting 6 increase in adjusted earnings per share at the center point of our guidance when you account for the impact of our recent divestitures and exits our eps guidance for our ongoing business would result in a 10 increase in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint to cap off a great year regal recently published its first ever sustainability report you can find it on our website a few years ago we restated our regal purpose to read we create a better tomorrow by efficiently converting power into motion today our regal employees live this purpose and our sustainability report tells our story we talk about our regal handprint which represents the products we make and the positive impact they have on our environment by saving enormous amounts of energy and we talk about the regal footprint which represents our efforts to reduce the waste we leave behind as well as the natural resources we consume to produce our products every year we strive to increase the impact of our handprint and decrease the impact of our footprint from the products we make to the way we make them our purpose is to create a better tomorrow for everyone we believe sustainability is yet another element of the long term value we deliver to shareholders and finally before we go to q a i would like to briefly update you on our ceo transition our original transition plan remains intact i will be retiring and stepping down as regal s ceo once the new ceo is on board a committee comprised of members of regal s board of directors is leading the search and we expect the new ceo to be in place sometime in the second quarter i will continue to lead the company until that time and i will remain as an advisor for a short period after the new ceo is in place to assure an orderly transition the regal organization has responded very well through this transition and all of our energy is focused on delivering for our stakeholders we will now take your questions questions and answers operator thank you sir we will now begin the question and answers session operator instructions the first question we have will come from joe ritchie of goldman sachs please go ahead ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst hi good morning guys this is ashay gupta on for joe mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst so nice quarter and your guidance seems by these numbers i guess just to start off could you maybe talk about the differences in outlook between the three segments as we head into 2019 and maybe specifically also address the performance in climate in the quarter and whether that was some like pre buy associated with the regulation change mark gliebe chief executive officer okay i ll take a pass at those questions and i m sure jon will jump in in terms of our guidance between the three quarters i mean between the three segments when we when we think about the commercial and industrial segment and the pts segment kind of serving many of the same end markets and we are expecting low to mid single digit growth across those markets the commercial industrial business will have more of a headwind out of china and out of europe and then when it comes to our climate segment as we commented we are expecting some lift in the back half of the year as a result of the fer law as that law changes over we expect some improvement there and then relative to whether or not we saw any lift in the quarter as a result of fer i think that was your second question we don t believe there was any impact from fer as a pre build in the fourth quarter jon did i miss anything jon avampato vice president chief information officer no i would just add though that while we don t think there was an impact in the fourth quarter from fer our customers are actively now talking about their needs for any potential pre build we re still pulling that altogether our current assumption is that there will be a nominal pre build in 2019 impacting the first half by in the range of 3 million to 5 million and that s been factored into our guide mark gliebe chief executive officer top line 3 million to 5 million on the top line ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and maybe as a follow up i noticed that your guidance for 2019 doesn t include any impact of buyback so just curious on how you re thinking about capital allocation next year given the strong free cash and the cash that you ll get from the asset sales mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks joe yes you re right we do not include any buyback assumption in our 2019 guidance as we think about capital allocation we will continue to have a balanced approach looking at buybacks as an alternative obviously m a as i mentioned we do have a healthy pipeline of targets that we re considering and we ll also look at debt payment debt pay down ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst got it thanks guys congrats on a good quarter mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you operator next we have scott graham of bmo capital markets scott graham bmo capital markets analyst yes hi good morning and very nice quarter gents mike halloran baird analyst thank you scott graham bmo capital markets analyst the couple questions i have were really very end market specific as i know for example you have a lot of your oil and gas in the upstream and i m just kind of wondering what you re hearing seeing order rate wise in that market given some of the disruptive forces on the price of oil and some of these large upstream guys cutting back a little bit in 2019 can you just sketch that for us a little bit jon avampato vice president chief information officer sure scott this is jon i ll add some comments there so we did see we called out we did see sales strength in the fourth quarter from oil and gas in both the pts segment and the c i segment we had overall good orders performance in 2018 in oil and gas and you re right more of our exposure is upstream i ll comment that we probably saw in the fourth quarter we saw a little bit more choppiness in the order rates in oil and gas but we were coming off some pretty strong orders in the first half of 2018 coming into 2019 we still see order strength in oil and gas but we re now coming up on some pretty difficult comparisons as we look at the orders there also i would say that overall for the company about 5 of our sales are in oil and gas we have exposure in both upstream and midstream and the divestiture of our engineered drives and control business will reduce this exposure a little bit especially in the upstream demand mark gliebe chief executive officer by about 80 basis points or so jon avampato vice president chief information officer correct scott graham bmo capital markets analyst got it thank you and then on your hvac markets what are your oe customers saying both the resi and commercial sides for what they re expecting in 2019 and maybe specify if you re going to respond in sales dollars or sales volumes jon avampato vice president chief information officer so we are i think what we would say we re hearing from most of our customers for 2019 demand in hvac is in the range of the low to mid single digit is the expectation that s pretty much was built into our guidance we ll have a little bit of this dynamic of this nominal prebuilt we talked about in our first half performance that will come out of the second half and that will then of course have a little bit of a delay in the timing of the fbr transition just because of the prebuilt that will be in the channel but we don t think that will be a large amount scott graham bmo capital markets analyst jon are you saying low to mid single across both resi and commercial jon avampato vice president chief information officer yeah i would say that s fair assessment of what we ve built into our guidance this year scott graham bmo capital markets analyst okay and then my last question is about distribution where c i looked flat whereas i think pts you said was strong could you kind of connect those dots for us jon avampato vice president chief information officer yeah we had so you re right c i was more flattish in the fourth quarter pts was strong and climate was also strong in distribution in the fourth quarter we think that for distribution in c i we had pretty healthy demand in distribution but we had some pretty difficult comparisons in the c i segment to prior year fourth quarter prior year was a strong quarter for c i and in particular distribution contributed nicely to that performance so we think it was a bit more of a comparison issue in the fourth quarter for c i scott graham bmo capital markets analyst so nothing changed the tone there we had a couple distributors saying that because of the timing of the holidays there was a little disruption but overall you would say that your distribution channel remains healthy for you jon avampato vice president chief information officer yeah i think that s how we would characterize it scott and similar to the other comments on organic sales we re going to have more difficult comparisons in 2019 but we still feel good about the performance of the market scott graham bmo capital markets analyst got it thank you good job mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks scott operator and next we have mike halloran of baird mike halloran baird analyst hey good morning everyone so just kind of following up on that last point there maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying trajectory and core industrial businesses as you look through the fourth quarter any real change in the trajectory from normal seasonality or from customer cadence that they talk about and any change to start 2019 so far jon avampato vice president chief information officer i would say that we are not seeing any big change related to those kinds of dynamics i would say that from an inventory standpoint we would say that there is probably a slight increase in both industrial and hvac in the distribution channels but it s kind of difficult to understand what the difference is there or what the impact is given the variables on tariffs and price increase and whether this is kind of a little bit of a normal inventory build or just some buying ahead of the tariffs so that s a little bit of noise that would be in the inventory numbers right now mike halloran baird analyst makes sense and obviously some moving pieces on the price cost side with the 2a pricing formulas the changes in commodity pricing and some of the price actions you had last year maybe just help a little bit how you think price cost cadence as we work through the year slightly positive pretty ubiquitously through the year or there is some variances that we should look for jon avampato vice president chief information officer i think i ll comment and then mark can add anything he d like to add so i ll go back to 2018 we felt good about the performance in 2018 on price cost we turned neutral in the first quarter and then we remained slightly favorable for the second third and fourth quarter on price cost we exited the year with a number of price increases that we implemented across all three segments either in the late third quarter or early to mid fourth quarter so we are expecting the carryover from those price actions to carry over into 2019 that s what s in our guidance and our assumption around price cost i think our expectation is that we will remain neutral to slightly favorable on price cost throughout the year mark gliebe chief executive officer i ll just also add copper started to turn somewhat deflationary around the june timeframe and then it s enough that we are seeing some of our 2 way material price formulas cause a price reduction now that s still it s still positive for us on a year over year basis but it was enough to flip to a few of those formulas over in the first quarter jon avampato vice president chief information officer correct mike halloran baird analyst i appreciate the color thank you mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you mike jon avampato vice president chief information officer thank you operator the next question we have will come from julian mitchell of barclays please go ahead julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning julian julian mitchell barclays analyst good morning maybe a first question and maybe i ve missed it but it sounded like you talked about pretty healthy margin expansion at c i and power transmission this year in 2019 i just wondered in climate solutions what the expectations on margins is relative to that 15 5 base figure and what are sort of some of the main moving parts within that rob rehard vice president chief financial officer julian you re right we in 2018 we had nice margin expansion in both our pts and our c i segments on the full year and in climate we finished the year at 15 5 and i mentioned in my comments that the year over year change in lifo expense the lifo expense versus the lifo benefit in 2017 was the headwind to margin expansion in our climate business for 2018 we are expecting margin expansion in climate in 2019 our expectation would be that we ll see margin expansion in all three segments climate will contribute in 2019 i would say the key points there will be leverage on volume some of the same themes we talked about 2018 benefits from productivity and our simplification efforts neutral to slightly favorable price cost and then we ll see a positive impact from mix especially with the high efficiency products in 2019 jon avampato vice president chief information officer i ll just comment there to add in that we could if there is a pull ahead that s meaningful beyond what jon already commented on there could be a negative impact to mix in the front half of the year and then a flip to a more positive impact to mix in the back half of the year julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks and then maybe just my follow up question around commercial and industrial systems are you expecting the first quarter growth rate to be roughly similar to what you saw in q4 given what you talked about in terms of flattish distribution and asia weakness or do we see a bit of a pickup just because of the easier comp and maybe some of that inventory being flushed through mark gliebe chief executive officer i think we would be looking at a quarter that s probably more similar to the fourth quarter of 2018 julian as we look to the first quarter here julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you very much jon avampato vice president chief information officer thanks julian operator next we have robert mccarthy of stephens robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good morning can you hear me mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning how are you doing rob robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good doing well mark congratulations on a great run mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst yeah so you know what the next question is so i guess i won t be impolitic in terms of the first question and it s not my intention to be but in the context of this external ceo search right you have a very strong and talented deep management team but going external seems to send a signal that there must be some concern among the board around the portfolio or the position not in terms of the cost position because you guys do a great job in it in terms of that and managing it but in terms of maybe the strategic vision of the businesses you need to be in can you expand upon what the board is looking for in that ceo and what that could mean for your portfolio to the extent you can mark gliebe chief executive officer i understand your question i d say we have great alignment between the management team and the board around our strategy of kind of price strategy as we laid it out in 2017 and jon talked about it today focus innovate simplify it s working for us no question you re always looking at the portfolio obviously we commented on that back in 2017 when we said we divest roughly 200 million which we did in that timeframe and while we re not ready to set a new target certainly you re always looking at the portfolio in terms of things that no longer are core or things that you d like to add that our core so that s the headset that both management and the board is looking at the business okay and then thank you for taking my question by the way and then i guess a couple follow ups have been i guess in terms of thinking about the environment it looks like definitely from what you re seeing now pretty decent environment but if you do see pricings under further pressure volumes decelerate or we go into a bit of a slowdown here remind us the counter cyclical nature of the free cash flow net income conversion and what we should see given history and what you could maintain in terms of free cash flow to net income conversion if we go into a bit of a meaningful downturn here rob rehard vice president chief financial officer i can take that one so rob this is rob rehard so i think you would expect to see free cash flow conversion through the quarters to be somewhat consistent with our historical trend in terms of how it trends relative to prior quarters we do start out a little slower and then ramp up as we go through the year i ll remind you we do have eight years over 100 on free cash flow conversion in a downturn we would still expect to see strong free cash flow conversion as we did during the downturn a few years back where we still converted over 100 despite the downturn and a lot of that came through trade working capital improvements as we moved through the year so i think that would be how you would look at it robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst i guess the final question would be just around price cost and obviously tariffs and i apologize i did have to miss a little bit of this call in the beginning so i might have missed some of your commentary so i apologize for that but just talk about kind of ring fencing the risks around i mean you already alluded to the price cost being neutral to positive right but around the tariffs and how you re going to manage that impact and could that drive you to the low end of your guidance how do we think about aside from revenue what drives you to the low end and to your guidance range in terms of your cost structure and the pricing environment jon avampato vice president chief information officer rob this is jon i will talk about the tariffs so we in the fourth quarter we commented that price cost remained slightly favorable and that included the expense of the the additional expense of the tariffs so we were pleased with the price cost performance given those additional expenses if you recall in our third quarter call i talked about the two main actions we re taking to deal with the tariffs the first is around our footprint leveraging our global footprint and a number of product moves that we either have made or are making that will help us mitigate the impact of the tariff and then for the remaining products where we either don t have those options or it s not cost justified to do that we have and will look at raising price so we ve been able to offset the tariff our expectation in 2019 is that we ll continue to offset the tariffs mark gliebe chief executive officer i ll just add you had asked robert what would take us to the low end guidance we re assuming low to mid single digit growth rates a chunk of that coming from the markets we participate in so certainly that could be a driver now i also remind you that we talked about 10 million of restructuring for the year so we re continuing our self help efforts to get at margin improvement or offset a down the impact of a downturn robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst thanks for your time mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you operator and next we have jeffrey hammond of keybanc jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just just on long targets long term targets or i guess going into 19 it looks like revenues running ahead do you think you can get into that zip code of 200 basis points to 250 basis points or is that a stretch at this point just given the last year rob rehard vice president chief financial officer no i think there is still we still have our eyes set on those targets on the low end obviously on the low end of the target but we still think there is a shot there a lot has to go our way but it s still in sight jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then any update on timing for the ceo search announcement mark gliebe chief executive officer well as i commented we still believe as it will be sometime in the second quarter jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just on the m a side can you just update us on the nicotra integration how it s going and if you re seeing any change in valuation with some of the some of the choppiness and macro worries thanks mark gliebe chief executive officer so first on nicotra the business is performing kind of the way we had thought it would when we acquired it from an integration perspective it just confirms that the business integrating into the company i would declare victory there we feel good about the integration still work to do on our synergies and there s still more to get there so that will take us another couple years and that s included in our guidance so but we feel good overall about what that business has brought for the company in the air moving space and then finally and valuations we would say that there s probably been a full turn down in valuations and targets so and we see that both on what we re selling and what we re considering as potential targets jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks a lot mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks jeff operator the next question we have comes chris dankert of longbow research chris dankert longbow research analyst hey morning guys mark gliebe chief executive officer morning chris chris dankert longbow research analyst forgive me if i missed it but any update as far as some of the manufacturing transition out of china into other lower production cost regions just kind of any progress there jon avampato vice president chief information officer so chris this is jon we didn t really talk about specifically but we feel good about the progress we re making i had we had commented on the third quarter call about one example of product that we were transitioning from one of our facilities in china to one of our existing facilities in mexico that transition has gone well we are in production today on that product in mexico and serving our customers in the us so we feel good about that particular example there s a couple others that we are working on implementing in the first half of 2019 it s very similar to the one in mexico utilizing either existing footprint in asia outside of china or footprint that we have in mexico so good progress and we feel good about the positive impact that can have to mitigate the tariff expense a portion of the tariff expense chris dankert longbow research analyst got it got it that s helpful and i guess i assume a lot of your customers are trying to look at similar moves has that proven to be a net benefit for you guys or kind of a net neutral overall jon avampato vice president chief information officer i would say today it s a net neutral however we have commented and we continue to believe that over time we would see this as an as slightly net positive for the company we still feel that way today chris dankert longbow research analyst got it got it and one last one if i could quick just any comment on labor cost into 19 is just similar growth from what we ve seen just any kind of reminders on variable comp any kind of impact that might be out of the norm mark gliebe chief executive officer are you talking about for our production workforce or is that what you are referring to chris chris dankert longbow research analyst yeah exactly overall and then for 2019 for guidance sorry rob rehard vice president chief financial officer yeah so i would say that in 2018 with pretty much a strong demand in the markets labor availability and labor inflation has been and will continue to be an impact on the business however in 2018 i would say we didn t see necessarily any meaningful increase in inflation kind of the normal inflationary pressures that we see in the business going into 2019 one change that we are dealing with it s in our guidance but one change we are dealing with is the doubling of the minimum wage in mexico in the cities along the border so that s been a change that s implement that has been implemented in january is impacting us and anyone else manufacturing in that region and we re looking at a number of actions to mitigate that but that s some additional inflation that we re going to have to deal with in 2019 chris dankert longbow research analyst got it thanks so much and congrats on the results guys mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks chris operator and the next question we have will come from walter liptak of seaport global please go ahead walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks and congratulations on the quarter guys mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks walt walter liptak seaport global analyst wanted to ask about the c i business in asia and just maybe you can refresh us on the percentage of revenue for c i that s asia how much of that is china and then you provide us with any other color just kind of the tone of the market pricing etcetera maybe how it trended during the quarter mark gliebe chief executive officer so i ll start off and then jon can jump in so revenue overall for asia is probably i am going to say 10 to 12 of total revenue and then the c i piece of that is probably three quarters of that 10 to 12 is in the c i in the c i segment so yes it is there is some headwind there in particularly in the china area we are seeing nice growth continued growth in india but china middle east europe are headwinds for us and then the second part of your question walt walter liptak seaport global analyst just how how it s trending i mean is it do they come down and then stabilize what are you hearing from your customers i guess what are you expecting for 2019 jon avampato vice president chief information officer i think walt when we look at our china demand what we saw in the second half of 2018 was a step down in demand if you look at our order rates we had pretty strong orders in the first half we saw a decrease in demand in the second half and it s been stable at that lower level so if you looked at order since that drop in demand it s been pretty stable so we re going to see a difficult comparison in the first half of 19 and then we ll see a little bit of certainly in the orders we ll see a better comparison in the second half because we really haven t seen any further deterioration but there was a step down in demand walter liptak seaport global analyst okay good that helps and then just going back to the capital allocation question and m a with potentially a new ceo coming in you re a little bit more careful about m a and maybe size of the m a or number of deals and then you mentioned there s no buyback that s in your in your guidance i wonder if you could refresh us on how much share repurchase authorization you have left the timeframe remaining on it and buyback versus m a given the upcoming ceo change mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks walt we ll have rob rehard address the buyback first rob rehard vice president chief financial officer yes so what we have about 200 million on our buyback authorized on authorization at this time so that s what was remaining we had we had a new authorization in place in 2018 that 250 million we moved that down to about 200 million at the end of the year jon avampato vice president chief information officer in terms of any m a transactions we ve as you know over the years this organization has companies done a lot of m a and there is a core group of people here that know how to do it so that wouldn t be the reason we wouldn t do m a just because of the ceo transition so we re operating like there s just every other day so hope that answers your question walt operator well thank you sir at this time we ll go ahead and conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference call back over to mr mark gliebe ceo for any closing remarks sir mark

excellent quarter with strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance emg sales in the fourth quarter were 445 3 million up 11 over the fourth quarter of 2017 organic sales growth was very strong at 9 while the acquisition of fmh aerospace contributed 3 and foreign currency was a one point headwind sales grew nicely across all emg businesses in the quarter with particular strength across our aerospace and engineered materials businesses emg s operating performance in the quarter was outstanding with operating income increasing 18 to 85 8 million and operating margins expanding 110 basis points to 19 3 so to summarize ametek delivered tremendous performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the year each of our businesses continued to deliver exceptional results through the execution of the ametek growth model which combines our four growth strategies with a disciplined focus on cash generation and capital deployment to create long term value for all of ametek s stakeholders advertisement advertisement i would like to thank all ametek colleagues for their exceptional work and success in 2018 before i discuss our outlook for 2019 i wanted to highlight some of the efforts our businesses are taking to drive the future of ametek i ll start with acquisitions 2018 was an exciting year on the acquisition front having deployed a record level of capital to acquire six outstanding businesses we deployed over 1 1 billion of capital on these acquisitions and acquired approximately 350 million in annual sales in the fourth quarter alone we completed three acquisitions forza and telular which i highlighted during our last earnings call and spectro scientific which we acquired in late november spectro scientific is a leading provider of machine condition monitoring solutions for critical assets in high value industrial applications they offer differentiated solutions that serve increasing need for predictive maintenance in a broad and growing set of end markets spectro scientific provides both lab based and on site instrumentation including consumables and cloud based software analytics to help customers determine and monitor the condition of lubricants and fluids in mission critical equipment they are based in chelmsford mass and have approximately 50 million in annual sales spectro scientific along with the other businesses acquired in 2018 are integrating very nicely into ametek and we expect them to add tremendous value going forward in addition to deploying a record level of capital on acquisitions we also deployed 364 million on share repurchases during the quarter bringing the total capital deployed in 2018 to nearly 1 5 billion acquisitions clearly remained the no 1 priority for capital deployment as we have done in the past we will continue to repurchase our shares opportunistically and we ll continue to pay a modest dividend to our shareholders advertisement advertisement despite the record level of capital deployment we have significant capacity available to continue our acquisition strategy and bill will touch on this further in a moment we remain focused on investing back on our businesses to support their growth initiatives in 2018 we invested approximately 75 million in incremental growth opportunities these investments were focused across our sales and marketing and research development and engineering functions we re seeing excellent result from these initiatives as we continue to drive strong organic sales growth one important driver of this organic sales growth is new product development in the fourth quarter our vitality index which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years was excellent at 25 the traction that our new products are gaining in their respective markets speak to the success of our research development and engineering efforts we also remain focused on expanding our footprint across the globe and to new adjacent markets in october we celebrated the opening of our newest technology solutions center in bangalore india the center showcases the latest products and technologies of many of ametek s businesses and is designed to assist customers in selecting the right equipment and enhance our service platforms within the region this facility greatly enhances our ability to expand our position in india s attractive growth markets we will continue to expand our global sales channels develop additional service capabilities and add to our manufacturing flexibility to better serve our customers and support global growth lastly our operational excellence initiatives continued to drive strong improvements in the operating performance as we ve seen in our margin expansion in the fourth quarter and full year results in 2018 we generated approximately 90 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives largely driven by our global sourcing and strategic procurement efforts we also remain focused on driving top line growth through our expanded commercial excellence toolkit which continues to drive additional market share gains across our businesses advertisement advertisement these key strategies make up the cornerstone of ametek s growth model and will remain a strong focus as we move into 2019 now let me provide some brief comments on tariffs our businesses continue to do a tremendous job managing each of the work streams we have put in place to help address the effects of tariffs while the situation remains fluid we remain very confident in our ability to mitigate the headwinds from the announced tariffs given our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our business the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain and our ability to shift production given our asset light business model ametek s proven operational excellence capability which captures each of these elements positions us extremely well to offset the impacts from tariffs in the fourth quarter we were able to fully offset the direct impact from tariffs and for all of 2019 we also expect we will be able to offset the impact of known tariffs through our various initiatives now i ll move to our outlook for the year as we noted in our press release going forward we will report eps results and guidance on an adjusted basis that adds back non cash after tax acquisition related intangible amortization we believe providing this non gaap measure allows our shareholders to better understand the strength of our cash flow generation and core operating results and aligns more comparably to our acquisitive peers with that said we expect 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 3 95 to 4 05 an increase of 8 to 11 over the comparable result in 2018 we expect overall sales in 2019 to be up high single digits organic sales are expected to be up 3 to 5 with a similar level of organic growth across each reportable segment for the first quarter we anticipate sales will be up high single digits adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of 0 95 to 0 97 per diluted share a 9 to 11 increase over the prior year to conclude our teams performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and delivered outstanding results in 2018 advertisement advertisement we are firmly positioned to achieve another year of solid growth and sustainable long term success through the execution of the ametek growth model i will now turn it over to bill burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we ll be glad to take your questions bill bill burke executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you dave as dave highlighted ametek finished the year with a strong performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter i will provide some additional financial details but first a brief comment on the fourth quarter tax related gain as part of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ametek recognized a net gain in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings this gain was considered provisional and was subject to further adjustment during the measurement period the 11 8 million or 0 05 gain we recognized in the first quarter of 2018 was the finalization of the provisional adjustments from tax reform now on to the additional financial highlights sore selling expense was up in line with core sales in the quarter general administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were down slightly over the prior year and were 1 5 of sales in the quarter down from 1 6 of sales in last year s fourth quarter 2019 general administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2018 levels the adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22 8 and in line with our expectations this compares to last year s adjusted rate of 25 7 the year over year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22 as we ve stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate working capital in the quarter was very solid at 16 9 of sales essentially in line with last year s fourth quarter capital expenditures were 35 million for the quarter and 82 million for the full year we expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately 100 million or 1 9 of sales reflecting our asset light business model depreciation and amortization expense was 54 million in the fourth quarter and 200 million for the full year in 2019 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 235 million including acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately 130 million or 0 43 per diluted share as dave mentioned our businesses continued to generate excellent levels of cash flow fourth quarter operating cash flow and free cash flow were both records at 296 million and 262 million respectively with both up 17 over the prior year free cash flow conversion for the quarter was outstanding at 131 of adjusted net income our full year cash flow was also very strong operating cash flow for 2018 was 926 million and free cash flow was 843 million both of these metrics up 11 over the prior year we remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions and as dave mentioned ametek had an outstanding year on this front in all of 2018 we deployed more than 1 1 billion on six acquisitions with approximately 750 million deployed on three acquisitions in the fourth quarter alone in addition we deployed 368 million on share repurchases in 2018 with 364 million of the repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter total debt at december 31 was 2 63 billion up from 2 17 billion at the end of 2017 offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of 354 million following our record level of capital deployment in 2018 we still have significant capacity to support our growth initiatives with more than 1 5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities these amounts reflect the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended and upsized revolving credit facility we announced in november and which i discussed during our last call as well as the private placement offering we announced in mid december the private placement offering consisted of 660 million of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 3 93 and a weighted average maturity of 8 2 years the proceeds were used to pay outstanding borrowings on our revolver as well as a maturing 100 million senior note in december to summarize our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter to complete an exceptional year looking ahead to 2019 our outlook is positive as we are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows kevin kevin coleman vice president of investor relations thanks bill jimmy could we please open the lines for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from scott graham with bmo capital markets your line is now open scott graham bmo capital markets analsyt hey good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning so i have two questions one on organic and one on the savings which is the three to five percent organic guidance i m just wondering two things on this your orders organic orders have been running at 5 or better for quite some time you had a pretty good fourth quarter i m just wondering is there something relative to the orders where maybe that s a little bit longer term that would be keeping the guidance to 3 to 5 and then secondly what gets you to the 5 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right i appreciate the question we re expecting solid growth in 2019 but we do expect the growth to moderate compared to 2018 and the growth is moderating a bit because of the global uncertainties and the trade tensions but we expect to continue to grow nicely and certainly the comparisons will make it more difficult we just completed eight quarters with average organic growth of 6 and six straight quarters with a positive book to bill so and we ended the year with a record backlog so overall we feel very good about the environment we re operating in and we feel good what we re hearing from our business and our customers and we continue to see a solid underlying demand and we re positioned to perform very well in this environment and we re executing very well but there is a little bit of global uncertainty and our guidance takes that into account scott graham bmo capital markets analsyt got it and then secondly on the savings i know you mentioned that most of the 90 million in savings this year was from global procurement i was wondering if you can kind of maybe specifically parse that out global procurement versus the other areas and what you re expecting on that from each for 2019 as well dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer sure sure scott and as you know we started the year in 2018 with an 80 million guide for cost savings and those are cost savings that actually worked their way through the p l and where we ended up we did a little bit better than that and it was largely driven by our sourcing initiatives so we ended up at 90 million as you mentioned about 70 million of that was from sourcing and about 20 million was from other opex initiatives and for 2019 we re starting to guide at 80 million about 60 million of that will come from sourcing initiatives and strategic procurement initiatives and about 20 million from other opex initiatives operator our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research your line is now open nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning nigel coe wolfe research analyst yes i want to get away from the ops for a second and just talk about the share repurchases in 4q i mean you re not known for being a heavy repurchase company so is that a reflection of the m a options on the table here the backlog or is it more a reflection of your share price at november december and supporting your stock at those levels and the real question is how does the m a backlog look from here dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes the m a backlog looks great we just completed a record year and i think the pipeline looks equivalent to what it looked like as we entered 2018 so for 2019 we have a very strong pipeline over time we have an opportunistic view of share purchases and we see the market adjust like it did in the fourth quarter and we have a strong balance sheet we thought it was a good time to buy back some shares and in the past that has been a good investment for ametek shareholders when we made that decision nigel coe wolfe research analyst i agree with that and then dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer when you think about our balance sheet nigel we entered 2018 with a debt to ebitda of about 1 95 of 1 95 we ended 2018 at the same level 1 96 so we deployed over 1 5 billion on acquisition and m a and we still have the same debt to ebitda so it s really the strong balance sheet the strong cash flow generation and generating capability of the company and the fact that we could control our own destiny to a certain degree nigel coe wolfe research analyst and then one question two parts what are you seeing in china you ve got a recently large exposure to china about terms in the sales what do you see in there by major business and then on tariffs you talked about how your company covered tariffs do you have list three 25 price right now or do you have to go out and reprice if we do get that step up in march dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right great questions the list three is built into our guidance so what we assumed in march 1 that the tariffs would go to 25 that s built into our guide and as i said in the prepared remarks we feel comfortable that we ll be able to offset the impact of tariffs completely and regarding to china china is an important marker for us it s about 9 of our sales and china grew nicely in the quarter it drove overall asia growth of 12 and that was a bit higher than the overall asia growth and certainly the trade situation with china has a complexity that we re watching very closely so far we continued to grow nicely but we re going to continue to monitor that as i ve said before the reality is that we produce products that china market needs to operate their manufacturing capability to monitor their nuclear power plants and help clean up their environment we are expecting growth to moderate in 2019 more in line with ametek s overall growth but we feel good about that level of growth in china for 2019 operator and our next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson your line is now open matt summerville d a davidson co analyst thank you good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning matt matt summerville d a davidson co analyst can you first talk about how much price you guys actually realized in 18 and based upon the comments you just made david how much price you anticipate realizing for 2019 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer sure matt as you ll recall during the year we increased our pricing as we got ahead of tariffs and inflation and q4 was much like q3 q4 we had an excellent quarter we achieved a bit more than 2 of price across our entire portfolio total inflation was about 1 5 so we re very pleased with these results and we think we re well positioned to continue the trend in 2019 specifically for 2019 we re expecting about two points of price and about the same level of total inflation about one and a half points so the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our of the ametek portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets and our focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of the global changing environment so we re feeling good about pricing going into 2019 matt summerville d a davidson co analyst and then david can you comment when you look in the fourth quarter specifically with emg what drove the year over year acceleration in organic performance against a double digit comparison and then specifically can you also comment at what you re seeing with respect to the robotics and automation market specifically dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes robotics and automation was a driver of the emg growth but it was more broad based than that i mean we had a really solid growth in the military aerospace business and we also saw solid growth on our emip business so pretty much all components of emg were firing in all cylinders in the fourth quarter operator our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is now open allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst hi guys good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst could you maybe give us a little bit more color on growth investments in 2019 i mean obviously the new products developments there but where else are you focusing your growth investment dollars for 19 at this point dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right we re our growth investments incremental growth investments for 2019 are up about 7 versus 2018 and we re going to invest incrementally about 80 million in growth investments and they re going to be across incremental sales opportunities incremental marketing opportunities and incremental engineering opportunities and then they re in three buckets and they re probably about equally spread across those buckets allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst that s helpful and then incremental operating leverage for 19 anything we should be mindful of there that could maybe drive it outside of the normal for you dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we were for 2018 we had excellent operating income margins we had about 110 basis points of expansion ex acquisitions and the core incrementals were about 35 and we think about 2019 we re back to about 30 to 40 basis points of operating income margin expansion and we re back to about the incrementals of 30 to 35 there is really nothing driving that except that there s a going to see how the year get started and but we feel good about the way the company is performing and the margin performance of the company operator our next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer your line is now open christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thank you good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst dave i m wondering about the 80 million in savings for cash similar to execute in 2019 you ve been delivering that range as long as i ve been covering you i just wanted to ask about the evergreen expects of that does that get more challenging at some point dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer i don t think it does chris it s kind of in our dna we go around to each of our businesses and we look at cost reductions as an element of our core operating environment and there s always new acquisitions that come into the fold that provide some new opportunities so i think we re solid for 2019 and when i look at long term i think as long as we keep executing our strategy they will remain evergreen opportunities christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst and in the outlook i m just curious if you re seeing any acceleration in aerospace clearly some peers are seeing that into that vertical and overall if there are other areas that are accelerating versus notably stable or potentially some rollover dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes i think our aerospace and defense businesses had an outstanding fourth quarter i mean a lot of it is that s what you see across other businesses our sales were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter and the growth was driven by very strong organic growth organic growth was 10 on our aerospace business in the fourth quarter we had similar to the first three quarters of the year we continued to see solid and balanced growth across aerospace markets with notable strength across both commercial and military businesses and so we re feeling good about our aerospace business operator our next question comes from brett linzey with vertical research your line is now open brett linzey vertical research analyst good morning all kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning brett brett linzey vertical research analyst i just wanted to talk about the pace or pattern of activity through q4 any major fluctuations between october and december and then how did january orders perform for the total company dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes great question brett q4 played out like a typical q4 we strengthened into q4 and december was our strongest month in terms of orders and sales so that s pretty typical for us and we had a very strong december as we anticipated when you look at january recently completed our orders were right on plan so we feel really good about january orders and across the board across all business they came in on plan so we feel good about that too brett linzey vertical research analyst ok and then just more housekeeping what are you assuming for interest expense in 2019 given the heavy deal load in q4 and are you assuming any de leveraging within that assumption bill burke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes our interest expense is going to be up a bit in 2019 up a little bit and what was the second brett if you look at our debt profile most of it is fixed debt with some balance on the revolver so given the new private placement in december and the heavy acquisition and share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter you ll see an increase probably upwards of close to 10 in interest expense year over year and given that most everything of our debt is fixed you ll see modest de everaging as we pay down our revolver but again that s really going to depend on the pace of acquisition activity as we go through the year so our full expectation is we ll continue to be very active on the deal front and de leveraging won t be a factor operator our next question comes from deane dray with rbc capital markets your line is now open deane dray rbc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning deane dray rbc capital markets analyst i d like to start first with a congratulations on the move to cash eps look we all acknowledge it doesn t change the fundamentals but it certainly puts you on a level playing field with your acquisition minded competitors what i also like seeing is that you guys are willing to adapt and be flexible so maybe you can share with us a bit about the deliberation process internally obviously at the beginning of the year would be the time to do it but any insight into the focus internally on this dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer it all comes down to our cash flow and we have strong cash flows or consistent cash flows and it s just another window into our financials that will allow our shareholders to better understand the strength of those cash generating capabilities and as you said it aligns more comparably with our acquisitive peers but it doesn t change how we re operating the business it doesn t change how we re valuing deals we always value deals on a cash basis anyhow so really it s additional information a different window into the business that will provide our investors with that view and we ve got most people that we talk to wanted to go to cash eps some minority were not fans of it but net net the aggregate it was a good decision for us because we didn t want to disadvantage everyone versus our peers deane dray rbc capital markets analyst great and for the record we re big fans of the move so we applaud that and then second question is on capex so 100 million you did 82 million in 2018 that said nice healthy 20 plus boost and if we look around the multi industry sector that s probably going to be one of the higher if not the highest percentage increases i think it s the first look we re seeing is closer to flat so that speaks to your growth ambitions and confidence but can you share with us the thought about investing capex here at this rate and how committed are you to spend all of it and kind of what kind of returns are you expecting dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we re an asset light business and we spend less than 2 of sales historically on capex and the 100 million ends up being about 1 9 of sales and there were really good projects across our businesses and it made sense to fund them and they all have excellent returns so i think there is a commitment to do that and our businesses have good plans so we re a bigger business we acquired some businesses there are some investments that are needed to be made but still within the context of being an asset light business and spending less than 2 of sales on capital deane dray rbc capital markets analyst and do you look at those returns in comparison to the same thresholds on acquisitions what s the algorithm there dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes usually the returns on internal capex are much higher but there is a process that gives a similar metric on returns and they come bottom up from our businesses and we evaluate them during the budget process and that s where we ended up this year operator and our next question comes from robert mccarthy with stephens your line is now open robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good morning everyone can you hear me kevin coleman vice president of investor relations yes robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst great great well good to be back and i must say my brethren have asked a lot of very very direct good questions so we re getting to the end of the bingo card here but nevertheless just a couple of things i mean i guess number one i know i ve been out of it for a while but can you do the typical around the horn on organic growth across the segments and orders trends dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer sure rob and we re glad to have you back and i will go around the horn i talked about aerospace a little bit and so i ll start with our process businesses and so we finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter the overall sales were up mid teens driven by contributions from the acquisitions of soundcom forza telular and spectro scientific organic sales were up mid single digits in the quarter with particularly strong growth across our materials analysis business and for 2019 we expect another solid year for our process businesses with organic sales expected to be up mid single digits our automation and engineered solutions business has closed out the year with another excellent quarter with organic sales up high single digits in the fourth quarter dunkermotoren continued to deliver excellent results as their growth funnel is driving exciting new applications in precision motion control additionally as i mentioned before our engineered solutions businesses are seeing continued solid demand across our key markets and in 2019 we expect a solid mid single digit organic growth across our automation and engineered solutions business and that brings me to power and industrial overall sales were for power and industrial were up mid single digits driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of arizona instrument and motec organic sales were down low single digits in the quarter against a difficult prior year comparison for our power instrumentation business and for 2019 we expect low to mid single digit of growth with balanced growth across power and industrial so if you look at our different market segments we re expecting mid single for process mid single for aerospace low to mid for power and industrial and mid single for automation and engineered solutions robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst and just in that context in the context of this question how do you think about your oil and gas especially metals exposure for the quarter and then expectations for next year just break that out for us dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes sure rob in the fourth quarter our oil and gas was up mid single digits our upstream was up mid teens and our mid and downstream was flat it was a precipitous decline and then a significant increase in the quarter really didn t affect business conditions much for us for all of 2019 we expect our oil and gas business to grow mid single digits and we expect the upstream to be up high single digits and the mid and downstream to be up low to mid single digits so moderating growth but still solid for our oil and gas businesses robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst and especially metals i mean i didn t know if you had dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer the metals business was it was up a bit higher than emg so emg we had solid growth and especially metals had a good quarter and for 19 we expect it to be in line with ametek growth so we re seeing strong markets the end markets there are aerospace medical specialized industrials so that s the businesses doing well and we re expecting it to continue in 2019 somewhat on a moderating basis robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst if you ll indulge me one follow up a different question looking at some of your ostensible comps in the public market through your acquisition stories they definitely have a narrative around how they buy companies i think there s a narrative view of all not formally articulated but if you were to formally articulate how you go about buying companies and improving them what would you focus on would you focus on besides higher public and private multiples i mean would you focus on r d enhancement would you focus on international expansion or global excellence procurement how would you explain to someone how you re going to take a business and make it better on the sg a gross margin front working capital front and what is kind of your secret sauce for capital deployment and fundamentally making these businesses selecting these businesses but then fundamentally making them better dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer right rob in terms of selection it really comes down to the being in a narrow adjacency of our existing presence and we look for product differentiation we look for service differentiation that s the no 1 attribute and in terms of how we add value to deals we have a long track record of taking businesses that are 10 to 15 ebitda and then doubling the margins in over the course of three to five years and really it s all of the above in terms of how we do it we have seasoned operators that are very experienced in m a and very experienced in improving the businesses and we the playbook that we develop can be based on improving organic growth in terms of exploiting global opportunities they can be based on improving their gross margins by global sourcing it can be based on reducing g a it can be there s a whole playbook and certainly pricing is one thing that we think we have some insight into these markets and know what price can be paid and what the customers are willing to pay so we do we have a very well defined process it results in the custom playbooks for each business we have excellent process capability it s a process capability across deal sourcing across deal modeling diligence and integration and i think our secret sauce is our very strong business operators that are well engrained in the ametek business system and they provide ownership for delivery of the financial metrics for each individual deal and none of that has changed and we have a great class of businesses that joined ametek in 2018 and we re looking forward to improving them in 2019 and we also have a strong pipeline that we re looking at bringing into the company so we feel very good about the m a opportunities for ametek operator our next question comes from andrew obin with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys good morning kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning andrew andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst just a couple of questions from me i was really surprised by your china growth number very different i think from a lot of your competitors can you just give us some more color as to what end markets are driving this strong performance dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes i think the biggest market that s driving the strong performance are our process and analytic instrumentation businesses and it s chiefly because their primary products allow customers to enhance their manufacturing capabilities so as china moves up the value chain and wants to do more sophisticated manufacturing our process businesses provide that capability through their instrumentation so that s the primary reason that we ve been doing so well in china and as i said we think the growth is going to moderate but we still feel good about the market andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst sure thing and then the follow up question on m a and by the way just to consult when you say process that s manufacturing process not oil and gas process right dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and just a question on m a have you guys changed how you guys source the deals because a lot of companies sort of complain about the pricing availability you guys still seem to be able to execute very well on the m a pipeline if you could give us some color on sourcing of your deals and evolution of your sourcing over the past couple of years and a great quarter by the way dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer well thank you andrew thank you yes deal sourcing is a competitive advantage for ametek we have in our niche presences we dedicate resources to developing a pipeline of deals so some of our deals come through the typical auction process but some of our deals are privately sourced by businesses that see how we operate in the niche markets that we re in so and we have a dedicated we have about nine or 10 m a professionals or 10 actually 10 m a professionals who work closely with our businesses and they identify strategic acquisitions and we have people dedicated to the field to so let s say it s a business process it s not just an event and that process allows us to build up an intangible asset on this pipeline of deals that we follow over the years so when we re looking to acquire them they see how we operate and we re a preferred buyer so it s really a long term commitment to the markets that we re operating in and good knowledge about the targets and the pipeline as i said looks as strong now as it did entering last year and last year we had a record year operator our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley your line is now open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys kevin coleman vice president of investor relations good morning josh josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst yes just a follow up on some of the other questions that have been asked i guess first on some of the actions that we saw on the fourth quarter particularly the oil price dislocation i think for a lot of folks that brought up kind of the 16 17 time frame and some of the volatility you saw in the businesses back then just to as a bit of a sanity check can you remind us kind of how far off trough or maybe still how far away from prior peak some of those businesses are give us some sensitivity around if we were to come into a more difficult macro scenario and maybe there s not as much downside as there was back in that time frame dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes sure josh if we go back our oil and gas exposure was peak at about 400 million and right now total exposure is about 290 million so it s about 6 of the company and about 290 million so we re still well off our peak and of our presence about a third of that is u s and two thirds of it is international and about 25 of it is upstream and 75 is mid and downstream and what we re seeing in the market is pretty typical of oil and gas expansion the upstream starts as you come out of the cycle and then it transitions to mid and downstream and we have a bigger mid and downstream presence so we re expecting the mid and downstream to pick up a little bit this year so we re feeling pretty good about our oil and gas presence right now and we think we re well positioned josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst got it that s helpful and then a lot of questions on m a during the call maybe one more from me a lot of your peers that are kind of in the same category as being compounders and who have also moved to cash eps i think have also tried to develop a bit more of a recurring revenue profile i think in eig you probably touched more data than a lot of your peers or competitors out there is there an ambition to maybe step up the recurring revenue side of that through something in the software space is that something that you looked at in the pipeline something that you ve kind of considered strategically just curious what your thoughts on those are dave dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer that was a great question if you look at the last two acquisitions we did with telular and spectro scientific there is both a recurring theme in both of those businesses that s tied to the software that s tied to the data and is i think with telular we have about 65 recurring revenue and with spectro about 25 recurring revenue in both cases they re dealing with information they re dealing with algorithms they re dealing with making the information and solving customer problems so it s definitely a focus for us and we have a tremendous growing software capability that we ve been investigate investing in over many years we have about 150 engineers in india developing software for us in bangalore so we have a good internal capability and with our acquisition profile it s certainly something that we re looking at and the recurring nature is something that is key for us to grow in ametek operator our next question comes from steve barger with keybanc capital markets your line is now open ken newman keybanc capital markets analyst hey thanks for fitting me in this is actually ken newman on for steve i just had a quick modeling question and i m sure if this has been covered already but you had really good flexibility to hedge some changes in fx this quarter just curious is there any embedded expectations for the impact on foreign exchange to sales or margin within the guide dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes for the full year 2018 on the top line fx was a benefit of about a point but for 2019 the full year fx is a negative 1 and then when we move to the bottom line as we ve communicated in the past we re largely naturally hedged at the profit line given the general balance of revenues and costs across currencies so you won t see a meaningful impact either way on our profit results from the fx movement so that s how we model the year and that s been the history of how the business has resulted in operations ken newman keybanc capital markets analyst got it and then last one from me you saw a pretty decent acceleration in the incremental margin for emg i think someone else touched on this a little bit before is there any reason to believe that that could kind of revert back to the same type of incrementals you saw in the last in the first half of 18 or is this kind of run rate for incremental margin pretty solid for 2019 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we had a good year in 18 and we had a good year in q4 our incrementals were solid at 40 with our eig business around 50 and our emg business around 30 and for 2019 we re expecting good solid incrementals but more in the 30 or 35 range operator and our next question comes from richard eastman with baird your line is now open richard eastman robert w baird co analyst dave just kind of reading the body language here through your body language here through all the responses and questions as we guide the 3 to 5 core for 19 i m curious i mean the tone here is such that the businesses generally stay steady and strong but run up against the comps and so is that largely kind of how you re feeling about the business right now given the backlog the orders is this is the 3 to 5 really kind of a comp issue more so than the tone of business in any of the segments dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes i think that s an accurate representation of how we re feeling rick richard eastman robert w baird co analyst yes and in like dunkermotoren i mean you commented how strong it was in the fourth quarter but i would think of that business as being maybe an earlier cyclical kind of indicator oil and gas maybe the same but no break in trend in those businesses at all when you look out to 19 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer when you think about dunkermotoren and think automation and the global macro trends automation is really a secular trend so dunkermotoren is a really strong backlog and is performing exceptionally well and as i said with the oil and gas we re positioned now with a larger mid and downstream presence to do quite well in that business of performing very well and we re quite away from our peak so we re feeling pretty good about that richard eastman robert w baird co analyst and geographically the 3 to 5 they re pretty much spread across the three major regions in terms of an expectation for 19 dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes that s pretty much maybe a little bit better growth in the u s but pretty much all geographies will grow in that 3 to 5 range richard eastman robert w baird co analyst ok and then just maybe a last question this might be a little bit more difficult but when you look at ametek s mix of business on a next 12 month basis could you take a swing at what revenue was coming from call it maybe the medical and food exposure that we now have i mean it must be north of half a billion i would presume dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes our medical exposure is about 13 14 of sales and you have to work with kevin on the food exposure i m not as we usually don t break that out so that s combined in our process businesses and it actually shows up a little bit about in our automation businesses also but it s a growing presence but the medical the healthcare business is about 13 14 of sales and it s performing well for us richard eastman robert w baird co analyst ok ok and just last question the aerospace you maybe provided this but in terms of 19 what s the growth expectation for all of aerospace and do we still lead with commercial and military or has the bizjet piece of the business has the backlog there built or how do we look at the four segments there against the 19 forecast dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer yes we re expecting growth in all four segments and our guide is positive mid single digit growth and we re still seeing strong business in the military and commercial side so business jet is going to have a solid year but we think we re going to have more strength in commercial and military richard eastman robert w baird co analyst ok great thank you dave zapico chairman and chief executive offfficer thanks rick operator and i m showing no further questions in the queue at this time i d like to turn the call back over to kevin coleman for any closing remarks kevin

rba hands down rates decision for february source getty images the reserve bank of australia rba announced its first interest rate decision for the year today the cash rate remains on hold at a record low 1 5 for yet another month where is has remained since august 2016 a decision which was widely anticipated advertisement advertisement that s because a lot has changed since we last heard from the rba not least that rather than pricing in that the next move in the cash rate will likely be higher financial markets now believe there s a greater than 50 per cent chance that it will be cut by 25 basis points by the end of this year the change in mindset also seen among a handful of economists reflects that economic data both at home and abroad has weakened noticeably since early december creating renewed concern about the trajectory for the australian and global economy in 2019 rba looks last the housing downturn with corelogic s january hedonic index revealing national dwelling values are falling at the fastest rate since the gfc while sydney and melbourne s rate of decline is now the most rapid since at least the early 1980 s there is the potential the rba may be becoming less comfortable with the performance of the housing sector add to this a consistent downtrend in dwelling approvals weakening consumer sentiment and softer retail trade figures and it looks like the household sector could start to weigh down economic growth corelogic s head of research tim lawless points out the weeks preceding the rba meeting saw several smaller lenders pushing mortgage rates higher in response to persistently high funding costs following an average 14 basis point rise in owner occupier mortgage rates since september last year he said if we see mortgage rates rising more broadly we might see the rba become more willing to consider a rate cut in an effort to offset higher funding costs and support heavily indebted household balance sheets what s the next move for the past two years about 80 per cent of experts have predicted a hike as the next cash rate move this month only 40 per cent did so stephen koukoulas managing director at market economics said he could see a change happen in as little as a month will acknowledge the economy is weaker than when it last met and will signal a change in bias towards an easing it may wait a month or two before acting on that bias koukoulas said graham cooke insights manager at finder said of the experts who put a date on their rate drop predictions were pretty evenly spread throughout the year from march to november this is the most dramatic shift i have seen in four years of running our cash rate survey economists are now swinging significantly in favour of a cut this year but nobody can agree on exactly when this will happen cooke said cooke said that the severity of the housing downturn in recent months was the top reason cited by experts who changed their prediction along with housing concerns inflation is still sitting below two per cent so another cut may be needed to stimulate the economy the only issue with further cuts is that it reduces the ability of the rba to adapt to softer economic conditions in the future cooke said story continues glenn stevens governor monetary policy decision at its meeting today the board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1 50 per cent the global economy grew above trend in 2018 although it slowed in the second half of the year unemployment rates in most advanced economies are low the outlook for global growth remains reasonable although downside risks have increased the trade tensions are affecting global trade and some investment decisions growth in the chinese economy has continued to slow with the authorities easing policy while continuing to pay close attention to the risks in the financial sector globally headline inflation rates have moved lower due to the decline in oil prices although core inflation has picked up in a number of economies financial conditions in the advanced economies tightened in late 2018 but remain accommodative equity prices declined and credit spreads increased but these moves have since been partly reversed market participants no longer expect a further tightening of monetary policy in the united states government bond yields have declined in most countries including australia the australian dollar has remained within the narrow range of recent times the terms of trade have increased over the past couple of years but are expected to decline over time the central scenario is for the australian economy to grow by around 3 per cent this year and by a little less in 2020 due to slower growth in exports of resources the growth outlook is being supported by rising business investment and higher levels of spending on public infrastructure as is the case globally some downside risks have increased gdp growth in the september quarter was weaker than expected this was largely due to slow growth in household consumption and income although the consumption data have been volatile and subject to revision over recent quarters growth in household income has been low over recent years but is expected to pick up and support household spending the main domestic uncertainty remains around the outlook for household spending and the effect of falling housing prices in some cities the housing markets in sydney and melbourne are going through a period of adjustment after an earlier large run up in prices conditions have weakened further in both markets and rent inflation remains low credit conditions for some borrowers are tighter than they have been at the same time the demand for credit by investors in the housing market has slowed noticeably as the dynamics of the housing market have changed growth in credit extended to owner occupiers has eased to an annualised pace of 5½ per cent mortgage rates remain low and there is strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality the labour market remains strong with the unemployment rate at 5 per cent a further decline in the unemployment rate to 4¾ per cent is expected over the next couple of years the vacancy rate is high and there are reports of skills shortages in some areas the stronger labour market has led to some pick up in wages growth which is a welcome development the improvement in the labour market should see some further lift in wages growth over time although this is still expected to be a gradual process inflation remains low and stable over 2018 cpi inflation was 1 8 per cent and in underlying terms inflation was 1¾ per cent underlying inflation is expected to pick up over the next couple of years with the pick up likely to be gradual and to take a little longer than earlier expected the central scenario is for underlying inflation to be 2 per cent this year and 2¼ per cent in 2020 headline inflation is expected to decline in the near term because of lower petrol prices the low level of interest rates is continuing to support the australian economy further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected although this progress is likely to be gradual taking account of the available information the board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time make your money work with yahoo finance s daily newsletter sign up here and stay on top of the latest money news and tech news now

imagine going to the store and finding that nothing has a price tag on it instead you take it to the cashier and they calculate the price what you pay could be twice as much or more than an hour earlier that s if there is even anything left in stock this is the economic reality that underpins venezuela s current political crisis though in truth that crisis has been going on for years the government headed by nicolás maduro who has presided over venezuela since 2013 declared a state of emergency in 2016 that year the inflation rate hit 800 things have since gone from bad to worse by 2018 inflation was an estimated 80 000 it s difficult to say what the rate is now but bloomberg s venezuelan cafe con leche index based on the price of a cup of coffee suggests it is now about 380 000 about 3 million venezuelans a tenth of the population have fled the country this is the largest human displacement in latin american history driven by shortages of everything including food as well as the maduro regime s oppressive treatment of dissent read more venezuela is fast becoming a mafia state here s what you need to know no wonder then that maduro who has just begun his second term as president is now under considerable domestic and international pressure to call new elections so how did things get so bad how did inflation become hyperinflation in venezuela and how do venezuelans deal with it alberto valdes epa the cost of goods and the value of currency what we pay for goods and services reflects not only their cost of production but also of the value of the currency we buy them in if that currency loses value against the currency the goods are sold in the price of those goods goes up by 2014 the value of venezuela s currency the bolívar and the prosperity of the venezuelan economy was highly dependent on oil exports more than 90 of the country s export earnings came from oil these export earnings had enabled the government headed by hugo chavez from 1999 to 2013 to pay for social programs intended to combat poverty and inequality from subsidies for those on low incomes to health services the government s spending obligations were high then the global price of oil dropped foreign demand for the bolívar to buy venezuelan oil crashed as the currency s value fell the cost of imported goods rose the venezuelan economy went into crisis the solution of venezuela s new president nicolas maduro who succeeded chavez in march 2013 was to print more money schenyder mendoza epa that might seem silly but it can keep the economy moving while it gets over a hump caused by a short term price shock the venezuelan crisis however just got worse as the oil price continued to fall compounded by other factors that reduced venezuelan oil output international investors began looking elsewhere driving the value of the bolívar even lower read more curious kids why don t poorer countries just print more money in these conditions printing more money simply made the problem worse it added to the supply of currency pushing the value down even further as prices rose the government printed more money to pay its bills this cycle is what causes hyperinflation playing the currency market circumstances like these quickly make saving money in the local currency nonsensical to protect themselves venezuelans started to convert their savings into a more stable currency like the us dollar this lowered the value of the bolívar even further the government responded by issuing currency controls it set a fixed exchange rate to stop the official value of the bolívar dropping against the us dollar and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolívares into us dollars the idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions us dollars were still available on the black market however this meant going to any number of operators on the streets of downtown caracas or asking a friend to hook you up as the crisis deepened more and more venezuelans looked to switch their bolívares into us dollars shutterstock this increasing demand meant the black market price for greenbacks rose creating a difference between the official exchange rate set by the government and the unofficial going rate with this came new opportunities in 2014 reports emerged that groups of middle aged women were crossing the border to use atms in colombia they could withdraw funds from their venezuelan accounts as us dollars at the official rate they could then cross back into venezuela and exchange the dollars for bolívares at the unofficial rate making a tidy profit government officials able to exchange bolívares for us dollars within venezuela had their own version of this practice this pushed the price of us dollars up and that of bolívars down even more as the crisis deepened increasing numbers of ordinary venezuelans began to engage in the unofficial currency market sometimes this took the form of taking subsidised venezuelan goods like food across the border to sell this earned the sellers foreign currency but it also exacerbated shortages of goods within the country driving prices up even further this does not mean venezuela s currency crisis is the fault of ordinary venezuelans illegal economic activity is largely a coping mechanism a bellwether of the actual economy s ability to provide for people when a government fails its responsibilities it should be no surprise that people protect themselves through unofficial currency trading this is exactly what big international investors do all the time albeit through more official channels miguel gutierrez epa cannot be trusted by august 2018 the venezuelan currency was worth so little that it was more prudent to use cash for toilet paper rather than buy toilet paper the government tried to get on top of this situation by issuing a currency devaluation maduro devalued the bolívar by 95 the largest currency devaluation in contemporary world history he also tied the new currency to the price of oil an economic experiment designed to show the venezuelan economy had solid foundations by bringing the bolívar s value into line with the reality of what people actually thought it was worth and showing it was backed by something valuable oil maduro s government hoped venezuelans would believe in their own currency and not exchange it for dollars this would help stabilise the economy overall but within weeks of the devaluation it was clear ordinary venezuelans had not been convinced they had no reason to be given the government was not addressing other issues such as policies contributing to low productivity across the economy the government s increasing authoritarianism including interfering with the constitution and elections also signalled it was not to be trusted read more is authoritarianism bad for the economy ask venezuela or hungary or turkey hyperinflation is a very difficult hole out of which to climb very few economies ever experience it and it s hard to stop it without massively cutting government spending it is easy then to see why millions of venezuelans responded by dealing in the black market or taking their savings and themselves out the country altogether as the political crisis in the country deepens venezuelans will have to continue to seek ways to allow them to survive the storm any way they can

elizabeth warren is considered a candidate of the left yet even half of republicans share her view that the wealthy should be taxed more a key question is a tax on wealth rather than income the way to do it if you think it s a war on plutocracy you think that rich people have too much political power then if these wealth taxes reduce the wealth of the very wealthy and reduce their political power you re satisfied goal achieved says tax expert joel slemrod at the university of michigan but if you re thinking about this as a war on inequality lower income lower wealth people are not doing well then you care about how much revenue you raise critics see a host of practical challenges one is that the wealthy might move money offshore that risk is a major reason many countries have moved away from wealth taxes in an era of rising inequality it s not uncommon to hear proposals for the wealthy to pay higher income taxes but elizabeth warren the democratic presidential aspirant and us senator from massachusetts recently proposed a different approach her plan would put an annual tax on the assets or wealth of the very rich rather than on the income produced by those assets things like bonds or equity in a business when sen elizabeth warren d of massachusetts proposed a wealth tax as part of her nascent presidential campaign the idea immediately began drawing attention most americans back a wealth tax new polls say economists are debating its pros and cons there s just one problem it s not clear it can fly there are constitutional challenges most of the developed world has moved away from wealth taxes because levies on wealth are harder to administer than those on income and there s a key question of motive do voters want to reduce inequality or the power of rich people over government or both why we wrote this elizabeth warren is considered a candidate of the left yet even half of republicans share her view that the wealthy should be taxed more a key question is a tax on wealth rather than income the way to do it if you think it s a war on plutocracy you think that rich people have too much political power then if these wealth taxes reduce the wealth of the very wealthy and reduce their political power you re satisfied goal achieved says joel slemrod director of the office of tax policy research at the university of michigan in ann arbor but if you re thinking about this as a war on inequality lower income lower wealth people are not doing well then you care about how much revenue you raise senator warren has espoused both goals but from a practical standpoint it s not clear which war her ultramillionaire tax is fighting in the united states where income inequality has soared over the past three decades wealth has become even more concentrated during the 1980s the top 1 percent of households owned 25 to 30 percent of the nation s assets according to gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley by 2016 they owned 40 percent of the assets so placing a tax on wealth and not just income holds lots of appeal to economists and politicians eager to reduce inequality warren s plan would place a 2 percent annual tax on the wealth of americans with 50 million or more in assets and a 3 percent tax on those with 1 billion or more michael dwyer ap sen elizabeth warren d of massachusetts speaks during a january organizing event at manchester community college in manchester n h she has proposed an annual 2 percent tax on the wealth of americans with 50 million or more in assets those rates sound low but they are actually high points out alan viard a tax and budget policy expert at the american enterprise institute in washington d c for example if someone owned bonds yielding 3 percent a year then a 2 percent tax on the value of the bonds would amount to a 67 percent tax on the income from those bonds a 3 percent wealth tax would wipe out all the income that s before accounting for the effects of inflation or other taxes denmark had a 2 2 percent levy on its wealthiest households the highest rate of all the developed nations in the organization for economic co operation and development oecd until the late 1980s when it cut the rate to 1 percent in 1997 it abolished the tax completely and the wealthy especially the ultrarich saw their wealth subsequently expand so if the goal is solely to reduce the wealth and power of the wealthy then a 2 to 3 percent wealth tax might do the trick but capital is key to economic growth people put their savings into savings accounts stocks or other financial instruments that create a pool of money that individuals and companies can use to fund business expansion or new ventures many economists warn that overly onerous taxes on capital would hurt growth for one thing they could cause the wealthy to find loopholes to undervalue their wealth especially hard to value assets like art shelter their assets through legal loopholes or even illegally hide their wealth by transferring it to offshore tax havens in 2013 professor zucman estimated that 8 percent of the world s household wealth was stashed offshore this risk of capital flight is a major reason many oecd countries have moved away from wealth taxes in 1995 14 nations taxed wealth now there are four norway spain switzerland and france this year france replaced its wealth tax with a new wealth levy that specifically exempts financial assets a related complaint wealth taxes brought in less than expected in switzerland for example researchers found that for every 0 1 percentage point rise in the wealth tax the amount of reported wealth went down by 3 5 percent other studies suggest this lowball reporting is less obvious in sweden and denmark potentially because financial institutions in those countries report their customers holdings to the tax authorities in switzerland they don t says marius brülhart an economist at switzerland s university of lausanne in the united states we don t have an infrastructure for determining and monitoring taxable wealth says professor slemrod of the university of michigan it s not easy then there are constitutional objections unique to the us the constitution bans any national direct tax that is not apportioned according to state populations a wealth tax was not considered a direct tax until 1895 when an anti populist supreme court used the language to strike down an income tax and effectively block a national tax on wealth in 1913 the 16th amendment made it legal to collect income taxes regardless of population but didn t address wealth taxes how today s court might rule if such a measure were passed is not clear constitutional scholars say none of this means that warren s wealth tax is dead on arrival quite the opposite a new politico morning consult poll found that 61 percent of americans including 50 percent of republicans support a tax on the very wealthy with just 20 percent opposing it economists behind the plan expect it will raise 2 75 trillion in a decade enough to fund a much more robust internal revenue service as well as warren s priorities on child care reduced student debt and climate policies to avoid the problems that oecd nations faced warren s plan calls for a broad wealth tax with few if any loopholes and a hefty exit tax if rich americans decide to give up their citizenship to avoid taxes you would see some people trying to hide assets abroad says dr viard of the american enterprise institute we ve gotten better at tracking the foreign bank accounts but there are other ways of hiding assets overseas warren s rivals for the democratic presidential nomination have offered alternative ways to tax the wealthy sen bernie sanders i of vermont has proposed expanding the current estate tax which also taxes wealth but only once when it transfers to one s heirs and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d of new york has suggested a 70 percent income tax on people earning more than 10 million get stories that empower and uplift daily by signing up you agree to our privacy policy already a subscriber log in to hide ads given the rise of inequality at the top and prospects that it will continue there is a strong case to be made in the us and elsewhere for increasing the progressivity of taxation again says mr brülhart of the university of lausanne and not just through a wealth tax he adds probably the most reasonable way of doing it is a little bit of everything

discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results and provide updates on centene s markets and products we will also bring you up to date on the integration of fidelis and regulatory and legislative environment advertisement advertisement first let me provide commentary on healthcare legislation legal and regulatory environment we are hopeful that the divided government leads to greater constructive dialog from both parties when it comes to healthcare policy it is clear medicaid and the services we provide are needed more than ever clearly numerous governors from both parties strongly supported medicaid managed care during the repeal and replace debate we also have seen utah nebraska and idaho by ballot initiative recently passing medicaid expansion it also appears from the most recent marketplace enrollment figures there continues to be consistent demand for affordable high quality healthcare coverage as stated in the 2020 proposed payment notice we support cms goal of maintaining a stable regulatory environment allowing for greater product predictability the payment notice is cms annual regulatory and financial guidance for the marketplace importantly we support the administration s continued efforts to give states greater flexibility via 1332 1115 waivers this works well with our local operating model where we have strong relationships with providers and regulators we look forward to working with the states who are on the front lines in making sure all of their citizens have access to affordable high quality healthcare next i d like to recap centene s highlights of 2018 2018 was another year of strong growth and accomplishment for centene capped off by the robust fourth quarter results we reported this morning in 2018 we added 1 8 million members surpassing the 14 million mark we grew revenues by 24 to 60 1 billion and adjusted eps by 41 to 7 08 the hbr improved 140 basis points year over year to 85 9 the adjusted net income margin improved 50 basis points to 2 5 cash flows from operations remained strong at 1 4 times net earnings advertisement advertisement during the year we stuck to our business as usual approach we have not been distracted by aca legal headlines as we agree with all the legal experts it will be reversed while there has been chatter about possible disruption to the exchanges individuals like to have an insurance card with comprehensive coverage we remain the leader in the aca ph marketplace in 2018 centene successfully entered three new exchange markets and expanded in six existing and better markets i ll remind you in 2018 year over year our exchange membership increased by approximately 500 000 members or 52 to 1 5 million please note this is ahead of our initial expectations in medicaid we successfully reprocured contracts in arizona florida washington and kansas and won two new medicaid contracts in new mexico and iowa overall our win rate in medicaid rfps remains an industry leading 80 also our medical management efforts and network initiatives continue to gain traction and help drive the improved hbr i previously noted in addition it is our strong organic growth we engaged in strategic m a and investments throughout the year in 2018 we closed the acquisition of fidelis the only statewide health plan in all 62 counties of new york during the year we began integrating fidelis now our new york health plan into our enterprise we are very pleased with how the integration is going advertisement advertisement for example on january 1 we moved all fidelis employees to centene s hr systems without incident fidelis has also been on our general ledger since the day we closed the transaction we remain on track to achieve the accretion and synergy targets we anticipate high single digit percentage accretion to adjusted eps in the first 12 months following the close and low to mid teens percentage accretion to adjusted eps in the second full year following the close we are also anticipating to generate approximately 25 million in pre tax net synergies in the first 12 months following the close and 100 million in total pre tax net synergies in year two on a run rate basis we expect fidelis to add approximately 12 billion in revenue and over 515 million in adjusted ebitda including net synergies in addition to fidelis we completed the acquisition of mhm services a national provider in healthcare and staffing to correctional systems and other government agencies mhm was previously our joint venture partner in centurion we are now providing correctional services in 15 states with 32 contracts we also completed the acquisition of community group community medical group cmg a leading at risk primary care provider in miami dade florida cmg has 15 clinics that focus on low income beneficiaries with an expertise in social determinants advertisement advertisement we increased our ownership in interpreta a technology company focused on clinical and genomic data as well as real time analytics our total ownership is now 80 we made an investment in rxadvance technology based pharmacy benefits management platform we support a shift toward a more transparent pbm model that is sustainable with higher quality and lower costs for consumers over the past year we have been advocating for net pricing versus rebates lastly centene purchased a controlling stake in university hospital of torrejon in madrid this is an important addition to our ribera salud model which sets the standard for successful public private partnerships in healthcare as a final point we introduced centene forward a transformative program to enhance key parts of our enterprise we expect centene forward to realize up to 500 million in savings over a multi year period it is important to note that this is not a short term effort to have savings immediately go to the bottom line in 2019 rather it is a self generating effort to reinvest capital into additional capabilities and technologies that better position centene for long term growth increased margins and profitability advertisement advertisement moving on to market product updates first we will discuss medicaid activity florida in december as part of a successful reprocurement we continue providing physical and behavioral healthcare services to the state s medicaid program we are now statewide in all 11 regions importantly this large geographic footprint results in additional membership and revenue than our previous from our previous contract kansas on january 1 our kansas health plan renewed its contract to continue providing managed care services for the state s medicaid program this was a successful reprocurement of an existing contract we currently serve approximately 130 000 recipients in this state new mexico last month centene began serving recipients enrolled in new mexico s medicaid managed care program we currently have approximately 65 000 members while still early in the process the launch is progressing as expected pennsylvania in january we began serving over 30 000 beneficiaries enrolled in pennsylvania s long term care program in the southeast zone we launched the southwest zone in january 2018 we now serve over 50 000 long term members in the state the third and final zone will be implemented by january of 2020 our participation in this major program reinforces our national leadership position in long term care advertisement advertisement north carolina we are pleased to be selected in two regions in the north carolina medicaid managed care program these two regions are among the largest in the state our joint venture carolina complete health is the only provider sponsored winner in the rfp this will result in better health outcomes with members at a lower cost for the state the contract is set to commence february 1 2020 as this was only awarded yesterday we ll provide more details on our first quarter earnings call i do want to highlight however that we believe that the state did not fully understand our innovative approach with providers in north carolina however we believe our partnership with the north carolina medical society and the fqhcs will be proven to be the right model for success in that market we are a believer in the provider led entity approach for growth and quality and we expect to be the best partner this state has in its medicaid program we are currently considering an appeal and helping them to understand what this innovative model means and how we can help manage costs and improve quality next centurion florida in december in december centurion began operating under an additional new contract providing comprehensive healthcare services this new contract covers an average of 1 425 detainees in volusia county detention facilities with the addition of this new contract centurion is now statewide in florida new mexico in february centurion began providing comprehensive healthcare services to detainees in the metropolitan detention center in albuquerque centurion is providing a wider range of healthcare services to an average detainee population of 1 550 advertisement advertisement arizona in late january centurion was notified by the state of arizona of its intent to award a contract to provide healthcare services to inmates housed in the state s prison system the contract is expected to begin in july of 2019 under the agreements centurion will provide healthcare services to an average daily population of approximately 34 000 now health insurance marketplace our marketplace business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter at year end 2018 we served approximately 1 5 million exchange members in 16 states for 2019 our continued focus on providing high quality affordable healthcare led to a very successful open enrollment in a national market that shrunk almost 3 ambetter grew approximately 15 and now has approximately 20 national market share we achieved this while maintaining our pricing discipline we began offering exchange products in four new states in 2019 we also expanded our footprint in six of our existing ambetter states in january we had almost 2 million paid members across 20 states this would represent a year over year increase of 250 000 legacy ambetter members as well as 80 000 fidelis members the 250 000 increase is well ahead of our most recent estimate of 150 000 to 200 000 as you recall the initial estimate we provided at our december investor day was 50 000 to 150 000 the key demographics of these members remain consistent with the comments we made at our december investor day excluding fidelis approximately 90 are eligible for subsidies middle tier and other demographics are consistent with prior years our retention rate is maintained at 80 we expect to have another strong year of operations in our industry leading marketplace business on the medicare at year end we served approximately 417 000 medicare and mmp beneficiaries this represents year over year growth of approximately 83 000 or 25 consistent with our growth strategy we have expanded our geographic footprint and are in 21 states in 2019 we continue to take targeted approach to growing our medicare advantage business as we commented at our december investor day we priced for margin stability in 2019 recognizing the headwinds that came with the lowest star rating as a reminder we expect first quarter 2019 ma membership to decrease by approximately 20 000 members this is due to a reposition in fidelis to get back its poor star rating we continue to expect 2019 ma revenue and membership to be flat compared to 2018 we will return to a 4 star ma parent rating for the 2020 plan year we expect this will have a positive impact on multiple new plans including the joint venture we announced with ascension healthcare this should allow us along with other product enhancement efforts to accelerate growth in ma in 2020 and beyond i remind you it is not how fast but how well one grows shifting gears to our rate outlook for 2018 our composite medicaid rate increase was 1 we are expecting a composite medicaid rate increase of 1 5 in 2019 separately cms issued the 2020 advance notice last week and preliminary medicare advantage rates appear to be in line with our expectations we continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends including flu consistent with our expectations in the low single digits in conclusion 2018 was another successful year for centene our strong 2018 results reaffirmed our growth momentum for 2019 and beyond our pipeline of growth opportunities is robust and we remain focused on margin expansion we are raising our 2019 guidance to reflect the higher than expected open enrollment for marketplace the centurion win in arizona and the win in madrid or the acquisition of the madrid hospital before i turn the call over to jeff i would like to remind you that the approval approved two for one stock split will be distributed tomorrow february 6 this split stock enhances liquidity for shareholders in line with centene s market cap growth importantly it moves our float ph to a level appropriate for an enterprise of our size thank you for your interest in centene jeff will now provide you further details on fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results as well as our increased 2019 guidance jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael and good morning this morning we reported strong fourth quarter and full year 2018 results fourth quarter revenues were 16 6 billion an increase of 29 over the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 1 38 this quarter compared to 0 97 last year both the fourth quarter and full year results include additional costs associated with the marketplace open enrollment period during the fourth quarter we invested an additional 0 04 per diluted share into growth related initiatives including member outreach efforts associated with the marketplace business this was above our forecast and previous business expansion cost guidance range the strong fourth quarter caps off a very successful year for the company total revenues grew 24 in 2018 to 60 1 billion driven by the acquisition of fidelis care continued growth in the health insurance marketplace business product and market expansions and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018 this growth led to record adjusted earnings in 2018 with adjusted diluted earnings per share of 7 08 an increase of 41 over 2017 and the growth in earnings year over year was driven by the fidelis acquisition and the growth in the marketplace business before i get into the details i want to remind everyone of the upcoming stock split the split was declared by the board of directors on december 12 2018 to be distributed on february 6 2019 to stockholders of record as of december 24 2018 the split is not reflected in this morning s earnings release unless otherwise noted now let me provide some more details for the fourth quarter total revenues grew by approximately 3 8 billion year over year primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care growth in the health insurance marketplace business the expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 including the illinois contract expansion and the pennsylvania ltss program other acquisitions including mhm and cmg and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018 this growth was partially offset by lower revenues in california associated with a reduction in pass through payments and the impact of the removal of the in home support services program from managed care which took effect in january 2018 moving on to hbr our health benefits ratio was 86 8 in the fourth quarter this year compared to 87 3 in last year s fourth quarter and 86 3 in the third quarter of 2018 the decrease year over year is primarily driven by growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of fidelis care which operates at a higher hbr sequentially the 50 basis point increase in hbr from the third quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to the impact of the ihss reconciliation in the third quarter of 2018 and normal seasonality in the health insurance marketplace business these hbr increases were partially offset by improved medicaid performance over the third quarter of 2018 the marketplace business continues to perform well and membership remained strong as we ended the year with 1 5 million members we had a successful open enrollment season adding approximately 250 000 members from our peak enrollment last year excluding fidelis this growth with the addition of the fidelis membership is expected to give us almost 2 million members for 2019 peak membership the demographics of our membership remain consistent and we ended 2018 with approximately 930 million of risk adjustment payable and over 260 million associated with minimum mlr rebates now on to sg a our adjusted selling general and administrative expense ratio was 9 9 in the fourth quarter this year compared to 10 5 last year and 10 in the third quarter of 2018 the year over year decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care which operates at a lower sg a expense ratio this decrease was partially offset by growth in the health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher sg a expense ratio and the impact of the removal of the ihss program from california s medicaid contract the sequential decrease is primarily due to the costs associated with the end of our contract with the u s department of veterans affairs and the contribution to our charitable foundation recognized in the third quarter 2018 additionally as commented on earlier we spent 0 20 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the fourth quarter which was 0 04 higher than our previous expectations for the full year 2018 we spent 0 38 per diluted share on business expansion costs compared to our previous guidance range of 0 30 per diluted share to 0 34 per diluted share investment income was 67 million during the fourth quarter compared to 53 million last year and 80 million last quarter the increase year over year is due to higher investment balances mainly associated with fidelis acquisition as well as higher interest rates on short term investments sequentially investment income decreased due to lower investable balances associated with the payment of the health insurer fee risk adjustment and the california medicaid expansion minimum mlr rebate payments interest expense was 98 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 66 million last year and 97 million last quarter the increase year over year was driven by additional debt to fund the fidelis acquisition and higher interest rates on our debt associated with our interest rate swaps our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32 5 and in line with our expectations the fourth quarter tax rate is lower than the full year driven by the vesting of our employee stock awards which lowers the rate in the fourth quarter now on to the balance sheet cash and investments totaled 13 5 billion at quarter end including 478 million held by unregulated subsidiaries our risk based capital percentage for naic filers continues to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level debt at quarter end was 6 7 billion which includes 284 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility our debt to capital ratio was 37 4 excluding our non recourse mortgage note and construction loan compared to 40 3 at fourth quarter last year and 36 9 at the third quarter of 2018 our medical claims liability totaled 6 8 billion at quarter end and represents 48 days in claims payable compared to 51 days for the third quarter of 2018 as expected and highlighted on our third quarter earnings call and investor day in december the dcp decreased during the quarter associated with timing items and the fidelis acquisition from the third quarter we continue to expect days in claims payable to be in the mid 40s range on a long term basis cash flow used in operations was 634 million in the fourth quarter and cash flow provided by operations was 1 2 billion for the full year 2018 or 1 4 times net earnings cash flow for the quarter was negatively impacted by the payment of the 2018 health insurer fee of approximately 700 million and the repayment of approximately 370 million of medicaid expansion mlr rebate payments in california which was previously accrued before we discuss 2019 guidance let me provide an update on the fidelis acquisition through the first six months fidelis has performed in line with our expectations including the realization of anticipated synergies the integration continues to go well and we expect to achieve our previously communicated synergy targets for the first and second years post acquisition now on to our 2019 annual guidance our updated 2019 annual guidance is included in our press release issued this morning we have provided our earnings per share guidance on a split adjusted basis for convenience in summary we have increased both our 2019 total revenues guidance at the midpoint by 600 million and adjusted earnings per share by 0 04 at the midpoint on a split adjusted basis to reflect the additional membership growth in the marketplace business which came in above our expectations the acquisition of torrejon in spain and the new contract win for centurion in arizona in summary our full year 2019 guidance on a split adjusted basis is as follows total revenues of 70 3 billion to 71 1 billion gaap diluted earnings per share of 3 65 to 3 83 adjusted diluted earnings per share of 4 11 to 4 31 and hbr of 86 5 to 87 and sg a ratio of 9 3 to 9 8 and adjusted sg a ratio of 9 3 to 9 8 and effective tax rate of 25 to 27 and diluted shares outstanding of 421 5 million to 422 5 million shares split adjusted in conclusion 2018 was a successful year for the company led by strong top and bottom line growth the performance in the fourth quarter and continued growth in the marketplace business provide tailwinds heading into 2019 where we expect to continue to drive long term growth and margin expansion that concludes my remarks and operator you may now open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question today comes from kevin fischbeck with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead kevin fischbeck bofa merrill lynch analyst hi great thanks i wanted to focus on the exchanges i guess the first question there is you mentioned retention similar and the demographics similar any markets in particular that you would highlight as kind of faster growing than average michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i think i mean we have a very balanced approach to our markets it s of course different markets have different sizes so different penetration but it s very balanced across our markets and the demographics across the markets are the same the middle tier there s everything about it kevin it s just consistent with what we have historically seen do you want to add jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer no kevin fischbeck bofa merrill lynch analyst i was going to ask also jeff your comment there what you said that you at the very end you said the growth in the marketplace business provides tailwinds for 2019 and you expect to drive continued ph long term growth and margin expansion i wasn t sure if you were saying that you expect additional margin expansion in the exchanges or whether that was a broader comment about the overall business and margin expansion jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer no that was an overall broader comment i mean i think the tailwinds comment is evident by obviously we haven t even closed the books for january and we re raising guidance right so membership came in higher than we expected and we have obviously the new win in centurion in arizona and the acquisition and we are updating guidance for those items kevin fischbeck bofa merrill lynch analyst all right great thank you operator your next question comes from josh raskin with nephron please go ahead josh raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks good morning want to stick with the exchanges as well michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning josh raskin nephron research analyst good morning michael two questions i guess related to the exchanges one is can we get an updated revenue contribution in terms of your total top line of that 70 billion ish or so how much of that is actually exchanges and then is there any assumed margin reset it doesn t sound like there s any reason to think that i know you talked about conservatism in the past in certain years so curious on that and then just on new competition i don t know are you seeing any traction from the oscars or even new competitors in any of your markets sorry for a bunch of questions on exchanges but that s it michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer go ahead jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so josh a couple of things i think you could probably bridge our investor day slides to get there but for 2019 i would say around the 10 billion 10 billion mark would be for the exchange product and as far as margins i think what we mentioned at our investor day in december was kind of the what we were projecting margins for 2019 to be similar to 2017 2016 2015 which was between the 5 and 10 range and i think that s exactly what we re expecting for 2019 michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer and from a competitive standpoint we re not seeing activity that in any way affects us josh raskin nephron research analyst okay you re not seeing any pockets of growth from some new entrants or anything like that in any of the specific markets michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer no if anything i mean we like to see more people out there because it creates more noise and more activity and in a competitive environment we tend to do very well josh raskin nephron research analyst got you and then just one last one i just want to ask on north carolina could you size sort of the start up and development cost i know you guys have been in the state you guys were one of the earliest in there you know i know you ve grown you ve entered the exchange as well any way to size what that total cost of michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah josh raskin nephron research analyst kind of the market entry was in north carolina michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer we recognized that we just got the information yesterday i d like to suggest that we delay that comment to the next quarter to the first quarter call if i may josh i mean we have some ballpark numbers but we like to on something like that we want to be very specific we are talking about an appeal of this so i don t want to put anything out there that can in any way mislead do you agree jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i know i would multiple speakers yeah i would agree on a specific number i would say that included in our guidance that we gave today are costs we re refining those estimates obviously based on what we learned yesterday josh raskin nephron research analyst got you all right that s fair thank you michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from scott fidel with stephens please go ahead scott fidel stephens analyst hi thanks good morning michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning scott fidel stephens analyst just wanted to follow up on north carolina and just as you continue to do the postmortem today on the results yesterday just interested in as you evaluate the awards what do you think were the key reasons why the state didn t award centene statewide contract and then michael as you mentioned you re considering the appeal maybe help us think about some of the key sort of substantive points that you think that centene can raise around the appeal michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think one i want to back off i mean we re not unhappy when you win the largest service region and the third largest it s meaningful numbers and i have them here somewhere i could quote up so it s not i don t see this as a loss i see it as a win i think as i said in my comments that the state did not fully understand the innovative approach we had working with providers which we have personally done before and i think as they understand that and this was something that was in the legislation that they wanted and that we have worked very hard and we do believe that the partnership when they understand it with the fqhcs the medical society and others will prove to be a very successful model in north carolina when you look at the history of what their models have looked like so i think we re going to be a strong provider in those two regions we re going to take them through what happened and we re going to understand their decision making because you win too you say if it works there this model maybe they re trying to understand it more and they don t really go too far with it until they do i can see lots of recent spread ph so we ll work with them we will appeal and but regardless of what happens we believe in being a strong partner with states and work with them and i think it s going to have a short and longer term a very positive outlook for quality and cost effectiveness in the state scott fidel stephens analyst got it if i could just relate a follow up to just on i know you re not ready to size the revenue impact from north carolina but i think from all of our end we re trying to sort of sort out just what the margin profile of the north carolina business can look like because you ve got some different dynamics in terms of the jv with providers and the minimum mlr s in north carolina and some other factors just sort of i guess conceptually how do you guys think about sort of the margin profile of north carolina more broadly at relative to let s say sort of the more broader normalized margins that you target in the medicaid book michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i expect our margins over time because you as you know we have always taken conservatism and said that for the first three four quarters there s an investment period and the mlr we book high until we see that the system is understanding what s involved with the managed care profiling system that we use and so i mean i don t expect great great margins in the first three four quarters but i do believe that these margins will be consistent to better and as a worker with the providers effectively yes even while we have some pretty good systems with our interpreta and casenet and other things that will help make these providers particularly successful and so i see an opportunity for in 20 because i mean we re not going to start immediately i do see over as the year unfolds some opportunity with some upside on it so and i think we re going to be putting together a model here that others will want to emulate over time scott fidel stephens analyst okay thanks operator the next question comes from michael newshel with evercore isi please go ahead michael newshel evercore isi analyst thanks can you address the contract extension disclosed last night and what it means for succession planning and did the board ask you to stay longer or did the impetus come from you michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i would say once succession planning continues as originally planned with the board and we continue to work through that and as we were talking about succession planning the board asked me if i d be willing to extend it and i said that i would i mean we re having fun we re having success i don t want to jinx it but we are blessed with good health and so and we have a great team here that it s found the lead it s taking on more and more of the of the load so i can continue what i m doing and maybe even add a couple of rounds of golf michael newshel evercore isi analyst so succession planning is still iconic and continues multiple speaker michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer no no the success planning one succession planning can be a point in time but it can also be a process that can be implemented any time one feels it s appropriate to do so so i d rather take that approach and it s business as usual and based it was their idea next day to extend it so because i had a lot questions about it and to give a sense to to all of you and everyone and the people in the company there is there will be continuity and we ll continue down the line michael newshel evercore isi analyst got it and maybe if i can just squeeze one more in and can you just also confirm whether you re buying the qualchoice health plan in arkansas from chi and what the financial impact and timing would be michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah we have we have the terms decided we have not closed on it yet and now we have to close jeff what later this month next month jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we have executed the contract on that mike so we would expect to close in the second quarter and i would just say this is an end market transaction so we tend to like those and work for those so not material in the macro scheme but certainly arkansas has been a good market and we re excited to expand our presence there michael newshel evercore isi analyst right thank you very much operator the next question comes from peter costa with wells fargo securities please go ahead peter costa wells fargo analyst thanks and congratulations on the quarter i wanted to say michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer hi peter peter costa wells fargo analyst i think going forward first off in north carolina what do you expect the start up costs will be in 2019 and 2020 and then because usually your business doesn t start till 2020 and then also on 2020 can you talk about what s going to happen with silver loading and the cost sharing subsidies and what might change there jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so pete this is jeff i ll handle the first question on the cost i think what we said was we have some costs in for our 2019 guidance but since we just got this information yesterday it s a little early and we re reevaluating the costs i guess is what i would say so early for us to give a pinpoint number on that given the information that came out yesterday and on the second i mean we re not talking about 2020 guidance here today so multiple speakers kevin peter costa wells fargo analyst curious if you want to talk about when that might happen in washington this year regarding the cost sharing subsidies and the way silver loading works and if that may change for 2020 relative to the hhs is allowing it for 2019 but it seems to be more up in the year for 2020 kevin j counihan senior vice president of products hey peter it s kevin yeah you re right if you look at the at the 19 payment notice they make allusion to that i think again it s premature to think about what that might actually look like into 2020 we re going to be prepared to pivot irrespective of what the policy decides and again as you know within cms a year is a long time so we ll see what happens michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think also we do have two sides of the government now looking at these issues and our feeling is that that s going to be positive if we get some good constructive discussion going and so i think trying we are going to play every part we can to move it to policy versus power takes there may be some real opportunities there for you peter costa wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator the next question comes from sarah james with piper jaffray please go ahead sarah james piper jaffray co analyst thank you michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer thank you sarah james piper jaffray co analyst in north carolina did centene submit a bid as a health plan also or only a ple and i m wondering since the provider led entities could be awarded regions and health plans statewide can you speak a little bit to the strategy around deciding to submit a debt as the ple michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer well we actually we actually did submit on both sides of that but we emphasize the ple you have to go back and look at the historic programs they ve had in the state and the role providers have had and i think working with the state medical society and they ve been great constructive partners and they really want to deliver high quality care they understand the cost issues and they want to work with us because of our systems and how we can support them doing a better job and everybody doing well we decided that s a good place to be and i still believe that sarah and i think over time it s going to prove to be a very effective model in markets like north carolina with the history they ve had so this is one of those things that i think time will prove to be on our side and so it s going to be business as usual we did do both but we thought the real need to emphasize this side of it and i think the states just i think they had some value and that s why they did give us the largest and third largest regions as opposed to say no we are not going to do any of this provider led organizations but we re going to go back and talk to them and see if that can be expanded some through the appeal process if not we ll still be as a partner no matter how it comes out so it s going to be a sizable business with full size for you on the q1 call sarah james piper jaffray co analyst got it that makes a lot of sense and one more question if i can if i look back at 2018 there were points of 2q and 3q where consensus didn t really get seasonality right on a couple of different lines and that caused some confusion so i m wondering if there s any commentary you can offer around 2019 seasonality your cadence and how you see that differing from 2018 michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i want to make an opening comment and let jeff take that of course we re not we don t look at consensus we look at the business and how it s developing but jeff do you want to talk about seasonality jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah i think what we said in our december investor day we kind of gave we ve been trying to give more insight i guess to the seasonality of the business giving a first half second half view as far as how earnings progression goes and i would say the comment we made there i think were consistent so over 60 in the first half of the year and again as we continue to grow the marketplace business that shift continues to happen i mean the real the real driver of our change in seasonality is really the product mix it s the diversification of the product mix and so to the extent that you have a higher mix of exchange then you will pull more earnings forward to the first half of the year because of the number one that s when we have the highest level of membership and number two that s when we have the lowest hpr as a result of deductibles sarah james piper jaffray co analyst okay so even though you guys are doing much better on exchange growth than you thought at investor day you still think the 60 40 net is the appropriate way to think about the year jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah i would think that s a good place to start sarah james piper jaffray co analyst thank you jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from a j rice with credit suisse please go ahead a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks hi everybody michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer hi a j rice credit suisse analyst first i want to just ask about fidelis a little more it sounds like generally on a broad sense everything is tracking are there any pockets as you drill down where you ve seen new opportunities now that you ve had it for a while are there any areas where you re seeing challenges that weren t anticipated michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i ll start off and others can add if they feel i think it s an incredibly well run company we re pleased with what we ve had father frawley will continue to work with us in social responsibility for some obvious legal reasons it was important that he appoint a new ceo we did in great continuity there the whole team is in place in fact he commented to me the other not too long away he was saying that the turnover rate since we announced the acquisition has been the lowest they ve seen historically so people are really pleased with it i think the opportunity there are opportunities to continue to grow there s some opportunities there to help them with the medical loss ratio using our systems so it s but it s they are hitting all the numbers they are functioning on all eight of 12 cylinders depending how many you have in your automobile and so i think i m familiar with every aspect of it where i made this comment one day that if we could find more businesses like that i d just want to do one in the morning and one in the afternoon they are really a well run company a j rice credit suisse analyst okay i was going to also ask about in mississippi in the press release you highlight that you completed the implementation of the new pbm model can you update us on your thought about rolling it out to other markets and will you wait for sort of proof of concept is mississippi going to play out for a little while or how should we think about that michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer no it we are actively rolling it out now and i like to roll it out as best as we can but once again i want to make sure as well proof of concepts there it s working incredibly well in mississippi and we re confident that we re going to roll it out into additional markets we are right now as we speak and by the end of 2020 we will be in all the markets and if i can pick it up in some way we will but once again i m not going to overload it and but it s a great system it s going to prove to be i think where pharmacy benefits should be headed a j rice credit suisse analyst okay what s the most significant economic benefit of making that transition that you re seeing in mississippi michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer well there s administrative expenses it s cloud based we can reduce the admin costs significantly and we re working with i mean john scott have all been people there are really innovative and creative and i m working with them now because i have a commitment to speak about is some way to move to net pricing as opposed to rebates and i think they have the system skills and capabilities that we can start talking about those kinds and we are talking about those kinds of things with them so that could be instant so there s a lot of significance in what you are doing it s is very innovative and as we re able to demonstrate more and more of it you ll see it a j rice credit suisse analyst okay all right thanks a lot operator the next question comes from lance wilkes with sanford bernstein please go ahead lance wilkes bernstein analyst yeah good morning could you talk a little bit about in the medicaid book medical cost trend and management in particular if you could just kind of hit upon some color on what s doing better than expected and what s doing worse how important steerage and restricted networks are and what s going on with risk profile at the state level with them sort of the reenrollment efforts that are taking place at those levels michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer jeff you want to comment on that jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah a couple of things we did see the medicaid improvement over the third quarter really it s a combination of many things combination of the net management network initiatives premium premium rate adjustments combined with i think what we saw was stable cost trends in the fourth quarter so your comment about risk profile i mean you really have to go on on a state by state basis so if you aggregate the business i mean that s one of the benefits of diversification if you aggregate the business i would say the risk profile has remained relatively consistent michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d like to add that if you look at the scale and size we have in most i mean albeit in the newest markets it s 65 000 in mexico and iowa ph but we have the size we do and you get a balanced book of business and we were expecting to have some that are inaudible and some that are healthier and we look across the whole book and we re seeing that and that s really the large numbers as much with anything else coming into play so that s for the the benefit of our size being the largest medicaid provider and but also as jeff highlighted you have 31 states it puts you in a strong position because as i tell investors it s no different in their portfolios at any given time they might have one stock that s not performing well or two well we re going to have we re going to have a market that has a couple of issues but we have others doing well and they offset while we collect the one that has an issue so it s it s a balance that gives us certain comfort lance wilkes bernstein analyst and can you just talk to the just clarify on the behavioral membership for the quarter what was the decrease in that and does it go into an integrated medical offering michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s moving and we re moving more and more to the integrated medicine i want to do that as quickly as we can i really i really believes that s an important place to be i have used probably the example that somebody s diagnosed a new as a new diabetic i sure want them to talk to a behavioral version as quickly as they can because it gives you more control of the total medical condition jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the membership decrease we previewed this at our investor day it was really a behavioral health only program in arizona that was integrated with the traditional medicaid program and so while the membership decreased quite a bit the revenues are up on a consolidated basis so lower membership higher revenue because it s been integrated with the physical health lance wilkes bernstein analyst got you thanks operator your next question comes from steve tanal with goldman sachs please go ahead stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst good morning guys thanks for the question michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst just quick one on the marketplace i missed the minimal mlr accrual number if you could just give us that once more and then maybe just let us know where 2018 margins ended for the business jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think 260 million approximately 260 million and as i said in our december investor day we re not going to give it s a competitively priced product we re not going to give a specific margin number stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst okay all right fair enough and then the other question that i had we re hearing a little bit more sort of anecdotally around the eligibility redeterminations in medicaid potentially affecting risk polls and making for a bit of a short term blip as some of the the mcas go back to the states for better rates what are your views on whether or not that s happening and if it is maybe is this part of sort of the uptick in medicaid rates where you re looking for a 1 5 comp as an increase in 19 versus one in 18 or how should we think about that if that s not really behind that jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer again i think you have to go on a state by state basis we have seen where redeterminations have changed the risk pool and states have been relatively quick to react i wouldn t necessarily call that meaningful it s certainly helpful but it s not a meaningful driver of the medical cost if you look at the actual volume of redeterminations but we actually have had states do adjustments i would say relatively quickly after the redeterminations and when you look at acuity mix it s different by state some states have had redeterminations that had no effect on acuity michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s once again it s the law of large numbers large number of states in the mix stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and so then the acceleration in the rate is there anything specifically you can sort of think about that s driving that jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer the acceleration in what rate the composites stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst composite yeah composite rate 1 5 ph versus one in 18 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think i mentioned at our december investor day we do have a state certain states which aren t performing at the long term margin some of that is a rating issue so we have seen and are projecting some improvement in rates into 2019 stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst perfect thank you operator the next question comes from dave windley with jefferies please go ahead david steinberg jefferies company inc analyst hi good morning it s dave steinberg in for dave windley first question i had was just on the medicaid business it seems like that that s driving the mlr moving to the bottom end of your 2018 guidance range i d be curious just to get a better sense of where the margins are at this point and we are hearing peers obviously talk about net margin is getting close to 3 over the next couple of years do you think that s something possible for centene or is there some business mix or for other structural considerations that might make it hard for you guys to replicate that type of profile jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i commented on this in our december investor day where we ve also grown faster than anybody else in the industry on the medicaid side and as michael mentioned before when you re starting up these new markets you have compressed margins versus what you d say is your long term margin target so i think from our standpoint we still think 3 to 5 is a good margin target and just because of the mix and the growth that we ve had it s probably different than our competitors michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer and i would add something else if you look at it we we showed the net margin up 50 basis points with what we gave you today it s easy to say what do you think is going to happen in the future we prefer to say we have a continued focus on margin expansion and growing the business and we tend to deliver against it versus saying i m going to get it to x number because i mean that s easy to say in fact i used to learn that they used to say in brazil and other that people will accept anything i m going to simply say that we are going to continue to grow this business and it s dramatic in my opinion and we re going to work hard at margin expansion using systems and other capabilities we have to improve outcomes and reduce cost david steinberg jefferies company inc analyst sure and jeff i think i heard you mention that the risk adjustment payables was with that 930 million up the fourth quarter i think that s up about 37 year over year compared to exchange enrollment that s up a little bit over 50 can you just help us understand maybe the delta there why those don t look a little bit more comparable in terms of growth jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean you have to look at number of months i think is one of the first things so in total but i mean it wasn t it wasn t out of line with our expectations so and i did give you it s 930 million and the reason i m giving those is because typically what we file in the quarter is we file the 10 q and you can pull those from the 10 q obviously here the annual report comes later so i m just giving this to you now david steinberg jefferies company inc analyst sure thanks operator the next question comes from matt borsch with bmo capital markets please go ahead matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst oh thanks for fitting me in a question about if you look out with your the various providers that you re working with do you anticipate shortages as you look ahead the next five years or maybe even beyond that and i ll ask a question in the context of a hypothetical that if you had one of the big drug retailers let s say with sort of ancillary personnel providing primary care services would that be something that would be an attractive model for centene to contract with michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think we tend to kind of march our own drum and we will grow as primary care we work well with specialists and sometime when some of you have the chance to come into the office we will take you through our casenet and our interpreta we ve shown some of it in the investor day but there are systems that help physicians become very successful in treating new patients and given the data and give real time heated scores and things that they can get on we are moving to where they can get on their iphone and so i believe that there are effective contracts in equity where you can have equity in contracts is i m trying to say matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst yeah michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer that s kind that tends to be the direction if we see and i said this in investor day if we saw an area where there is not enough positions for inaudible we re working with some governmental agencies in just that issue we have cmg now that has the capability to open up very successful clinics that deal with this population social determinants et cetera and we d ask louis ph who runs it to move in the region x and put together a little multi specialty clinic so we think we have the capability to meet our members needs and once again we all know what you re thinking of and that s a big operation but they also have a lot of commercial and other membership and we re very focused in the government services area matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst great thank you operator the next question comes from ana gupte with the svb leerink please go ahead ana gupte leerink analyst hi thanks good morning michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer hi ana gupte leerink analyst thanks for fitting me in just wanted some color as you go into 2020 on a couple of drivers growth drivers firstly on exchanges can you talk about what your growth profile might be there as you look at the demand and then the under penetration the move to short term plans and anything else in the competitive environment as you go into the selling season jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer i will start and jeff you can pick up the short term plans i mean short term plans who may have inaudible have been around forever the benefits of maturity are less the majority of our membership has subsidies so why jump out if something else gives you a lot less benefits to go into it and those things still have to be proven out and they are just at the short term and i think over time costs and short term plans go up because you have such a turnover that you have different disease states and they have they ve tried to overcome that by being able to underwrite health risks and that itself i think is going to long term be a problem not for us but just for health states in general so i think it s a long way it s an attempt to be disruptive but i m not sure how disruptive we our particular model so i think that it s so looking forward i mean i ll just remind ana not you but others has talked about our growth rate as we have got bigger wallets we re still maintaining a significant growth rate they talk about the exchanges and all the disruption and how it is and were up 15 this year when the market it s declining so we re just going to continue to business as usual and deal with the facts as we have now and the fact says it s a good business it s a strong business and we know how to manage it we have the systems to manage it does that help ana gupte leerink analyst yeah helpful yes thanks thanks mike on the ma side then for 2020 and i think it s really thought leading on the ascension jv but you do also have the 4 star contract at this point are you planning to do two different products one that s co branded and then one that s with ascension and then one centene or how are you thinking about 2020 as an opportunity for growth michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i think that s going to depend by market it depends on the size of the market where we are our network we are going to work we are going first work effectively with our partners at ascension and they we re not doing inaudible they work with so i mean they so it s a it will be a mix depending on the size of market scale and what makes sense i mean we have some markets we ve had historically more than one product so that s not a bad thing i can go back to my consumer package goods days there was a time in canada we had three different soap ads and it worked very well ana gupte leerink analyst makes sense multiple speakers michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer pardon me ana gupte leerink analyst no i think that makes sense you are not customized i mean you will be more customized by local market than dependents michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer right i think what the key is i think what s key ana is you had the you used to have the systems and the overall capability to manage that multiplicity of opportunities and that s where we re focused and have made comments we re going to continue invest in technology and i think we ve demonstrated that we have the wherewithal to do it in a very meaningful way it goes back to the 500 million we are going to generate internally so as to be able to invest in new technologies and new opportunities without affecting margins and the overall growth of the business ana gupte leerink analyst yeah truly that s a competitive advantage yeah that makes a lot of sense on the systems michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from steven valiquette with barclays please go ahead steven valiquette barclays analyst great thanks good morning everybody michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning steven valiquette barclays analyst so there were some moving parts in medicaid costs throughout 2018 for really centene and really a lot of companies in the overall mco sector but just given all the drivers you mentioned earlier that led to your sequential improvement in medicaid cost trend in 4q 18 and also just exiting the year i guess when you add it all up is there any extra color you can provide just on your expected medicaid mlr assumptions for 2019 overall versus 2018 overall just when comparing on an apples to apples basis thanks jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i commented on this at our investor day i mean we do expect medicaid margins to improve in 2019 over 2018 and a lot of that s driven by a lot of actions that we ve taken this year which will have a full year run rate heading into 2019 but we do we do anticipate improvement in the medicaid margins in 19 steven valiquette barclays analyst yeah and bottom line is that the trends in 4q 18 are certainly very suggestive that you re on track to achieve and so that s i guess kind of the key takeaway at least from my perspective jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yes it was a good quarter steven valiquette barclays analyst yeah got it ok all right thanks guys operator your next question comes from gary taylor with j p morgan please go ahead gary taylor j p morgan analyst hi good morning just a couple of questions left the first is on the 2019 exchange enrollment have you guys disclosed they will be willing to help us with on the four new states how much does that contribute to the 250 000 increase ex fidelis michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i guess what i would say is consistent with what we ve done historically it s not the largest driver of membership growth typically when we go into new markets it s a test and learn approach and i think we followed that for the new markets this year so it s not the majority of the driver of the membership growth it really is coming from existing markets that we ve had gary taylor j p morgan analyst okay and then my second question is cash from ops for 2018 was weighed by about 1 billion i think with some of these california accruals that you ended up paying this year the normal free cash flow looks quite good compared to earnings as we head into 2019 just remind us i don t recall from investor day you called out anything but versus kind of your long term guidance of 1 5 times to 2 times cash from ops versus earnings are there any material variances that for 2019 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean i think the 1 5 to 2 times would apply there s always there s always timing issues right there can always be a timing of the state payment that you don t get at the end of the quarter the end of the year that is subsequently paid within the next few days and so and given our size in some states those can be meaningful so you always have timing items that come up but nothing that i can think of similar to what we experienced in the over 1 billion of mlr payables in california gary taylor j p morgan analyst okay thank you very much operator the next question comes from ralph giacobbe with citi please go ahead ralph giacobbe citi analyst thanks good morning so you ended with a 1 46 million fixed members you mentioned 2 million which i understand is sort of the peak number and i think you also said 250 000 year over year so just want to clarify that sort of year end membership on the hics somewhere in that kind of 17 to 18 is that the right way to think about it jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t we don t actually provide the year end obviously there s attrition from the peak membership so what we re talking about is if you go back to our investor day slides we would have said 2018 peak was 1 650 million ph you re growing 250 on top of that plus the addition of 80 000 with fidelis gets you close to the 2 million right but we don t we are not providing a year end 2019 number ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay is there any reason to think that it wouldn t just be similar to prior years in terms of and being versus peak jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would expect a normal attrition rate that s certainly what we have forecasted ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay that s helpful and then just real quick just effective tax rate we should use for 2019 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer it s in the guidance i provided that in the guidance this morning or did i miss that michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah yeah it s in the press release ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay and one more if i could can you just remind us of the level of incremental maybe strategic investment that you called out in and just framing on sort of the ongoing expense or if you see that pace on thanks jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer strategic investment for which year 2018 or 2019 what specifically are you ralph giacobbe citi analyst 19 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we said start what we call business expansion business expansion costs i think what we said now this is on a split adjusted basis obviously 0 12 to 0 14 ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay all right thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to michael neidorff for any closing remarks michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer well i just want to thank everybody for the questions the time and we look forward to continuing the

executive officer thank you ed good morning everyone and thank you for joining centene s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call during the course of this morning s call we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results and provide updates on centene s markets and products we will also bring you up to date on the integration of fidelis and regulatory and legislative environment first let me provide commentary on healthcare legislation legal and regulatory environment we are hopeful that the divided government leads to greater constructive dialog from both parties when it comes to healthcare policy it is clear medicaid and the services we provide are needed more than ever clearly numerous governors from both parties strongly supported medicaid managed care during the repeal and replace debate we also have seen utah nebraska and idaho by ballot initiative recently passing medicaid expansion it also appears from the most recent marketplace enrollment figures there continues to be consistent demand for affordable high quality healthcare coverage as stated in the 2020 proposed payment notice we support cms goal of maintaining a stable regulatory environment allowing for greater product predictability the payment notice is cms annual regulatory and financial guidance for the marketplace importantly we support the administration s continued efforts to give states greater flexibility via 1332 1115 waivers this works well with our local operating model where we have strong relationships with providers and regulators we look forward to working with the states who are on the front lines in making sure all of their citizens have access to affordable high quality healthcare next i d like to recap centene s highlights of 2018 2018 was another year of strong growth and accomplishment for centene capped off by the robust fourth quarter results we reported this morning in 2018 we added 1 8 million members surpassing the 14 million mark we grew revenues by 24 to 60 1 billion and adjusted eps by 41 to 7 08 the hbr improved 140 basis points year over year to 85 9 the adjusted net income margin improved 50 basis points to 2 5 cash flows from operations remained strong at 1 4 times net earnings during the year we stuck to our business as usual approach we have not been distracted by aca legal headlines as we agree with all the legal experts it will be reversed while there has been chatter about possible disruption to the exchanges individuals like to have an insurance card with comprehensive coverage we remain the leader in the aca ph marketplace in 2018 centene successfully entered three new exchange markets and expanded in six existing and better markets i ll remind you in 2018 year over year our exchange membership increased by approximately 500 000 members or 52 to 1 5 million please note this is ahead of our initial expectations in medicaid we successfully reprocured contracts in arizona florida washington and kansas and won two new medicaid contracts in new mexico and iowa overall our win rate in medicaid rfps remains an industry leading 80 also our medical management efforts and network initiatives continue to gain traction and help drive the improved hbr i previously noted in addition it is our strong organic growth we engaged in strategic m a and investments throughout the year in 2018 we closed the acquisition of fidelis the only statewide health plan in all 62 counties of new york during the year we began integrating fidelis now our new york health plan into our enterprise we are very pleased with how the integration is going for example on january 1 we moved all fidelis employees to centene s hr systems without incident fidelis has also been on our general ledger since the day we closed the transaction we remain on track to achieve the accretion and synergy targets we anticipate high single digit percentage accretion to adjusted eps in the first 12 months following the close and low to mid teens percentage accretion to adjusted eps in the second full year following the close we are also anticipating to generate approximately 25 million in pre tax net synergies in the first 12 months following the close and 100 million in total pre tax net synergies in year two on a run rate basis we expect fidelis to add approximately 12 billion in revenue and over 515 million in adjusted ebitda including net synergies in addition to fidelis we completed the acquisition of mhm services a national provider in healthcare and staffing to correctional systems and other government agencies mhm was previously our joint venture partner in centurion we are now providing correctional services in 15 states with 32 contracts we also completed the acquisition of community group community medical group cmg a leading at risk primary care provider in miami dade florida cmg has 15 clinics that focus on low income beneficiaries with an expertise in social determinants we increased our ownership in interpreta a technology company focused on clinical and genomic data as well as real time analytics our total ownership is now 80 we made an investment in rxadvance technology based pharmacy benefits management platform we support a shift toward a more transparent pbm model that is sustainable with higher quality and lower costs for consumers over the past year we have been advocating for net pricing versus rebates lastly centene purchased a controlling stake in university hospital of torrejon in madrid this is an important addition to our ribera salud model which sets the standard for successful public private partnerships in healthcare as a final point we introduced centene forward a transformative program to enhance key parts of our enterprise we expect centene forward to realize up to 500 million in savings over a multi year period it is important to note that this is not a short term effort to have savings immediately go to the bottom line in 2019 rather it is a self generating effort to reinvest capital into additional capabilities and technologies that better position centene for long term growth increased margins and profitability moving on to market product updates first we will discuss medicaid activity florida in december as part of a successful reprocurement we continue providing physical and behavioral healthcare services to the state s medicaid program we are now statewide in all 11 regions importantly this large geographic footprint results in additional membership and revenue than our previous from our previous contract kansas on january 1 our kansas health plan renewed its contract to continue providing managed care services for the state s medicaid program this was a successful reprocurement of an existing contract we currently serve approximately 130 000 recipients in this state new mexico last month centene began serving recipients enrolled in new mexico s medicaid managed care program we currently have approximately 65 000 members while still early in the process the launch is progressing as expected pennsylvania in january we began serving over 30 000 beneficiaries enrolled in pennsylvania s long term care program in the southeast zone we launched the southwest zone in january 2018 we now serve over 50 000 long term members in the state the third and final zone will be implemented by january of 2020 our participation in this major program reinforces our national leadership position in long term care north carolina we are pleased to be selected in two regions in the north carolina medicaid managed care program these two regions are among the largest in the state our joint venture carolina complete health is the only provider sponsored winner in the rfp this will result in better health outcomes with members at a lower cost for the state the contract is set to commence february 1 2020 as this was only awarded yesterday we ll provide more details on our first quarter earnings call i do want to highlight however that we believe that the state did not fully understand our innovative approach with providers in north carolina however we believe our partnership with the north carolina medical society and the fqhcs will be proven to be the right model for success in that market we are a believer in the provider led entity approach for growth and quality and we expect to be the best partner this state has in its medicaid program we are currently considering an appeal and helping them to understand what this innovative model means and how we can help manage costs and improve quality next centurion florida in december in december centurion began operating under an additional new contract providing comprehensive healthcare services this new contract covers an average of 1 425 detainees in volusia county detention facilities with the addition of this new contract centurion is now statewide in florida new mexico in february centurion began providing comprehensive healthcare services to detainees in the metropolitan detention center in albuquerque centurion is providing a wider range of healthcare services to an average detainee population of 1 550 arizona in late january centurion was notified by the state of arizona of its intent to award a contract to provide healthcare services to inmates housed in the state s prison system the contract is expected to begin in july of 2019 under the agreements centurion will provide healthcare services to an average daily population of approximately 34 000 now health insurance marketplace our marketplace business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter at year end 2018 we served approximately 1 5 million exchange members in 16 states for 2019 our continued focus on providing high quality affordable healthcare led to a very successful open enrollment in a national market that shrunk almost 3 ambetter grew approximately 15 and now has approximately 20 national market share we achieved this while maintaining our pricing discipline we began offering exchange products in four new states in 2019 we also expanded our footprint in six of our existing ambetter states in january we had almost 2 million paid members across 20 states this would represent a year over year increase of 250 000 legacy ambetter members as well as 80 000 fidelis members the 250 000 increase is well ahead of our most recent estimate of 150 000 to 200 000 as you recall the initial estimate we provided at our december investor day was 50 000 to 150 000 the key demographics of these members remain consistent with the comments we made at our december investor day excluding fidelis approximately 90 are eligible for subsidies middle tier and other demographics are consistent with prior years our retention rate is maintained at 80 we expect to have another strong year of operations in our industry leading marketplace business on the medicare at year end we served approximately 417 000 medicare and mmp beneficiaries this represents year over year growth of approximately 83 000 or 25 consistent with our growth strategy we have expanded our geographic footprint and are in 21 states in 2019 we continue to take targeted approach to growing our medicare advantage business as we commented at our december investor day we priced for margin stability in 2019 recognizing the headwinds that came with the lowest star rating as a reminder we expect first quarter 2019 ma membership to decrease by approximately 20 000 members this is due to a reposition in fidelis to get back its poor star rating we continue to expect 2019 ma revenue and membership to be flat compared to 2018 we will return to a 4 star ma parent rating for the 2020 plan year we expect this will have a positive impact on multiple new plans including the joint venture we announced with ascension healthcare this should allow us along with other product enhancement efforts to accelerate growth in ma in 2020 and beyond i remind you it is not how fast but how well one grows shifting gears to our rate outlook for 2018 our composite medicaid rate increase was 1 we are expecting a composite medicaid rate increase of 1 5 in 2019 separately cms issued the 2020 advance notice last week and preliminary medicare advantage rates appear to be in line with our expectations we continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends including flu consistent with our expectations in the low single digits in conclusion 2018 was another successful year for centene our strong 2018 results reaffirmed our growth momentum for 2019 and beyond our pipeline of growth opportunities is robust and we remain focused on margin expansion we are raising our 2019 guidance to reflect the higher than expected open enrollment for marketplace the centurion win in arizona and the win in madrid or the acquisition of the madrid hospital before i turn the call over to jeff i would like to remind you that the approval approved two for one stock split will be distributed tomorrow february 6 this split stock enhances liquidity for shareholders in line with centene s market cap growth importantly it moves our float ph to a level appropriate for an enterprise of our size thank you for your interest in centene jeff will now provide you further details on fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results as well as our increased 2019 guidance jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you michael and good morning this morning we reported strong fourth quarter and full year 2018 results fourth quarter revenues were 16 6 billion an increase of 29 over the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 1 38 this quarter compared to 0 97 last year both the fourth quarter and full year results include additional costs associated with the marketplace open enrollment period during the fourth quarter we invested an additional 0 04 per diluted share into growth related initiatives including member outreach efforts associated with the marketplace business this was above our forecast and previous business expansion cost guidance range the strong fourth quarter caps off a very successful year for the company total revenues grew 24 in 2018 to 60 1 billion driven by the acquisition of fidelis care continued growth in the health insurance marketplace business product and market expansions and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018 this growth led to record adjusted earnings in 2018 with adjusted diluted earnings per share of 7 08 an increase of 41 over 2017 and the growth in earnings year over year was driven by the fidelis acquisition and the growth in the marketplace business before i get into the details i want to remind everyone of the upcoming stock split the split was declared by the board of directors on december 12 2018 to be distributed on february 6 2019 to stockholders of record as of december 24 2018 the split is not reflected in this morning s earnings release unless otherwise noted now let me provide some more details for the fourth quarter total revenues grew by approximately 3 8 billion year over year primarily as a result of the acquisition of fidelis care growth in the health insurance marketplace business the expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 including the illinois contract expansion and the pennsylvania ltss program other acquisitions including mhm and cmg and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018 this growth was partially offset by lower revenues in california associated with a reduction in pass through payments and the impact of the removal of the in home support services program from managed care which took effect in january 2018 moving on to hbr our health benefits ratio was 86 8 in the fourth quarter this year compared to 87 3 in last year s fourth quarter and 86 3 in the third quarter of 2018 the decrease year over year is primarily driven by growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of fidelis care which operates at a higher hbr sequentially the 50 basis point increase in hbr from the third quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to the impact of the ihss reconciliation in the third quarter of 2018 and normal seasonality in the health insurance marketplace business these hbr increases were partially offset by improved medicaid performance over the third quarter of 2018 the marketplace business continues to perform well and membership remained strong as we ended the year with 1 5 million members we had a successful open enrollment season adding approximately 250 000 members from our peak enrollment last year excluding fidelis this growth with the addition of the fidelis membership is expected to give us almost 2 million members for 2019 peak membership the demographics of our membership remain consistent and we ended 2018 with approximately 930 million of risk adjustment payable and over 260 million associated with minimum mlr rebates now on to sg a our adjusted selling general and administrative expense ratio was 9 9 in the fourth quarter this year compared to 10 5 last year and 10 in the third quarter of 2018 the year over year decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of fidelis care which operates at a lower sg a expense ratio this decrease was partially offset by growth in the health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher sg a expense ratio and the impact of the removal of the ihss program from california s medicaid contract the sequential decrease is primarily due to the costs associated with the end of our contract with the u s department of veterans affairs and the contribution to our charitable foundation recognized in the third quarter 2018 additionally as commented on earlier we spent 0 20 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the fourth quarter which was 0 04 higher than our previous expectations for the full year 2018 we spent 0 38 per diluted share on business expansion costs compared to our previous guidance range of 0 30 per diluted share to 0 34 per diluted share investment income was 67 million during the fourth quarter compared to 53 million last year and 80 million last quarter the increase year over year is due to higher investment balances mainly associated with fidelis acquisition as well as higher interest rates on short term investments sequentially investment income decreased due to lower investable balances associated with the payment of the health insurer fee risk adjustment and the california medicaid expansion minimum mlr rebate payments interest expense was 98 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 66 million last year and 97 million last quarter the increase year over year was driven by additional debt to fund the fidelis acquisition and higher interest rates on our debt associated with our interest rate swaps our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32 5 and in line with our expectations the fourth quarter tax rate is lower than the full year driven by the vesting of our employee stock awards which lowers the rate in the fourth quarter now on to the balance sheet cash and investments totaled 13 5 billion at quarter end including 478 million held by unregulated subsidiaries our risk based capital percentage for naic filers continues to be in excess of 350 of the authorized control level debt at quarter end was 6 7 billion which includes 284 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility our debt to capital ratio was 37 4 excluding our non recourse mortgage note and construction loan compared to 40 3 at fourth quarter last year and 36 9 at the third quarter of 2018 our medical claims liability totaled 6 8 billion at quarter end and represents 48 days in claims payable compared to 51 days for the third quarter of 2018 as expected and highlighted on our third quarter earnings call and investor day in december the dcp decreased during the quarter associated with timing items and the fidelis acquisition from the third quarter we continue to expect days in claims payable to be in the mid 40s range on a long term basis cash flow used in operations was 634 million in the fourth quarter and cash flow provided by operations was 1 2 billion for the full year 2018 or 1 4 times net earnings cash flow for the quarter was negatively impacted by the payment of the 2018 health insurer fee of approximately 700 million and the repayment of approximately 370 million of medicaid expansion mlr rebate payments in california which was previously accrued before we discuss 2019 guidance let me provide an update on the fidelis acquisition through the first six months fidelis has performed in line with our expectations including the realization of anticipated synergies the integration continues to go well and we expect to achieve our previously communicated synergy targets for the first and second years post acquisition now on to our 2019 annual guidance our updated 2019 annual guidance is included in our press release issued this morning we have provided our earnings per share guidance on a split adjusted basis for convenience in summary we have increased both our 2019 total revenues guidance at the midpoint by 600 million and adjusted earnings per share by 0 04 at the midpoint on a split adjusted basis to reflect the additional membership growth in the marketplace business which came in above our expectations the acquisition of torrejon in spain and the new contract win for centurion in arizona in summary our full year 2019 guidance on a split adjusted basis is as follows total revenues of 70 3 billion to 71 1 billion gaap diluted earnings per share of 3 65 to 3 83 adjusted diluted earnings per share of 4 11 to 4 31 and hbr of 86 5 to 87 and sg a ratio of 9 3 to 9 8 and adjusted sg a ratio of 9 3 to 9 8 and effective tax rate of 25 to 27 and diluted shares outstanding of 421 5 million to 422 5 million shares split adjusted in conclusion 2018 was a successful year for the company led by strong top and bottom line growth the performance in the fourth quarter and continued growth in the marketplace business provide tailwinds heading into 2019 where we expect to continue to drive long term growth and margin expansion that concludes my remarks and operator you may now open the line for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question today comes from kevin fischbeck with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead kevin fischbeck bofa merrill lynch analyst hi great thanks i wanted to focus on the exchanges i guess the first question there is you mentioned retention similar and the demographics similar any markets in particular that you would highlight as kind of faster growing than average michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i think i mean we have a very balanced approach to our markets it s of course different markets have different sizes so different penetration but it s very balanced across our markets and the demographics across the markets are the same the middle tier there s everything about it kevin it s just consistent with what we have historically seen do you want to add jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer no kevin fischbeck bofa merrill lynch analyst i was going to ask also jeff your comment there what you said that you at the very end you said the growth in the marketplace business provides tailwinds for 2019 and you expect to drive continued ph long term growth and margin expansion i wasn t sure if you were saying that you expect additional margin expansion in the exchanges or whether that was a broader comment about the overall business and margin expansion jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer no that was an overall broader comment i mean i think the tailwinds comment is evident by obviously we haven t even closed the books for january and we re raising guidance right so membership came in higher than we expected and we have obviously the new win in centurion in arizona and the acquisition and we are updating guidance for those items kevin fischbeck bofa merrill lynch analyst all right great thank you operator your next question comes from josh raskin with nephron please go ahead josh raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks good morning want to stick with the exchanges as well michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning josh raskin nephron research analyst good morning michael two questions i guess related to the exchanges one is can we get an updated revenue contribution in terms of your total top line of that 70 billion ish or so how much of that is actually exchanges and then is there any assumed margin reset it doesn t sound like there s any reason to think that i know you talked about conservatism in the past in certain years so curious on that and then just on new competition i don t know are you seeing any traction from the oscars or even new competitors in any of your markets sorry for a bunch of questions on exchanges but that s it michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer go ahead jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so josh a couple of things i think you could probably bridge our investor day slides to get there but for 2019 i would say around the 10 billion 10 billion mark would be for the exchange product and as far as margins i think what we mentioned at our investor day in december was kind of the what we were projecting margins for 2019 to be similar to 2017 2016 2015 which was between the 5 and 10 range and i think that s exactly what we re expecting for 2019 michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer and from a competitive standpoint we re not seeing activity that in any way affects us josh raskin nephron research analyst okay you re not seeing any pockets of growth from some new entrants or anything like that in any of the specific markets michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer no if anything i mean we like to see more people out there because it creates more noise and more activity and in a competitive environment we tend to do very well josh raskin nephron research analyst got you and then just one last one i just want to ask on north carolina could you size sort of the start up and development cost i know you guys have been in the state you guys were one of the earliest in there you know i know you ve grown you ve entered the exchange as well any way to size what that total cost of michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah josh raskin nephron research analyst kind of the market entry was in north carolina michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer we recognized that we just got the information yesterday i d like to suggest that we delay that comment to the next quarter to the first quarter call if i may josh i mean we have some ballpark numbers but we like to on something like that we want to be very specific we are talking about an appeal of this so i don t want to put anything out there that can in any way mislead do you agree jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i know i would multiple speakers yeah i would agree on a specific number i would say that included in our guidance that we gave today are costs we re refining those estimates obviously based on what we learned yesterday josh raskin nephron research analyst got you all right that s fair thank you michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from scott fidel with stephens please go ahead scott fidel stephens analyst hi thanks good morning michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning scott fidel stephens analyst just wanted to follow up on north carolina and just as you continue to do the postmortem today on the results yesterday just interested in as you evaluate the awards what do you think were the key reasons why the state didn t award centene statewide contract and then michael as you mentioned you re considering the appeal maybe help us think about some of the key sort of substantive points that you think that centene can raise around the appeal michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think one i want to back off i mean we re not unhappy when you win the largest service region and the third largest it s meaningful numbers and i have them here somewhere i could quote up so it s not i don t see this as a loss i see it as a win i think as i said in my comments that the state did not fully understand the innovative approach we had working with providers which we have personally done before and i think as they understand that and this was something that was in the legislation that they wanted and that we have worked very hard and we do believe that the partnership when they understand it with the fqhcs the medical society and others will prove to be a very successful model in north carolina when you look at the history of what their models have looked like so i think we re going to be a strong provider in those two regions we re going to take them through what happened and we re going to understand their decision making because you win too you say if it works there this model maybe they re trying to understand it more and they don t really go too far with it until they do i can see lots of recent spread ph so we ll work with them we will appeal and but regardless of what happens we believe in being a strong partner with states and work with them and i think it s going to have a short and longer term a very positive outlook for quality and cost effectiveness in the state scott fidel stephens analyst got it if i could just relate a follow up to just on i know you re not ready to size the revenue impact from north carolina but i think from all of our end we re trying to sort of sort out just what the margin profile of the north carolina business can look like because you ve got some different dynamics in terms of the jv with providers and the minimum mlr s in north carolina and some other factors just sort of i guess conceptually how do you guys think about sort of the margin profile of north carolina more broadly at relative to let s say sort of the more broader normalized margins that you target in the medicaid book michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i expect our margins over time because you as you know we have always taken conservatism and said that for the first three four quarters there s an investment period and the mlr we book high until we see that the system is understanding what s involved with the managed care profiling system that we use and so i mean i don t expect great great margins in the first three four quarters but i do believe that these margins will be consistent to better and as a worker with the providers effectively yes even while we have some pretty good systems with our interpreta and casenet and other things that will help make these providers particularly successful and so i see an opportunity for in 20 because i mean we re not going to start immediately i do see over as the year unfolds some opportunity with some upside on it so and i think we re going to be putting together a model here that others will want to emulate over time scott fidel stephens analyst okay thanks operator the next question comes from michael newshel with evercore isi please go ahead michael newshel evercore isi analyst thanks can you address the contract extension disclosed last night and what it means for succession planning and did the board ask you to stay longer or did the impetus come from you michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i would say once succession planning continues as originally planned with the board and we continue to work through that and as we were talking about succession planning the board asked me if i d be willing to extend it and i said that i would i mean we re having fun we re having success i don t want to jinx it but we are blessed with good health and so and we have a great team here that it s found the lead it s taking on more and more of the of the load so i can continue what i m doing and maybe even add a couple of rounds of golf michael newshel evercore isi analyst so succession planning is still iconic and continues multiple speaker michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer no no the success planning one succession planning can be a point in time but it can also be a process that can be implemented any time one feels it s appropriate to do so so i d rather take that approach and it s business as usual and based it was their idea next day to extend it so because i had a lot questions about it and to give a sense to to all of you and everyone and the people in the company there is there will be continuity and we ll continue down the line michael newshel evercore isi analyst got it and maybe if i can just squeeze one more in and can you just also confirm whether you re buying the qualchoice health plan in arkansas from chi and what the financial impact and timing would be michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah we have we have the terms decided we have not closed on it yet and now we have to close jeff what later this month next month jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we have executed the contract on that mike so we would expect to close in the second quarter and i would just say this is an end market transaction so we tend to like those and work for those so not material in the macro scheme but certainly arkansas has been a good market and we re excited to expand our presence there michael newshel evercore isi analyst right thank you very much operator the next question comes from peter costa with wells fargo securities please go ahead peter costa wells fargo analyst thanks and congratulations on the quarter i wanted to say michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer hi peter peter costa wells fargo analyst i think going forward first off in north carolina what do you expect the start up costs will be in 2019 and 2020 and then because usually your business doesn t start till 2020 and then also on 2020 can you talk about what s going to happen with silver loading and the cost sharing subsidies and what might change there jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so pete this is jeff i ll handle the first question on the cost i think what we said was we have some costs in for our 2019 guidance but since we just got this information yesterday it s a little early and we re reevaluating the costs i guess is what i would say so early for us to give a pinpoint number on that given the information that came out yesterday and on the second i mean we re not talking about 2020 guidance here today so multiple speakers kevin peter costa wells fargo analyst curious if you want to talk about when that might happen in washington this year regarding the cost sharing subsidies and the way silver loading works and if that may change for 2020 relative to the hhs is allowing it for 2019 but it seems to be more up in the year for 2020 kevin j counihan senior vice president of products hey peter it s kevin yeah you re right if you look at the at the 19 payment notice they make allusion to that i think again it s premature to think about what that might actually look like into 2020 we re going to be prepared to pivot irrespective of what the policy decides and again as you know within cms a year is a long time so we ll see what happens michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think also we do have two sides of the government now looking at these issues and our feeling is that that s going to be positive if we get some good constructive discussion going and so i think trying we are going to play every part we can to move it to policy versus power takes there may be some real opportunities there for you peter costa wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator the next question comes from sarah james with piper jaffray please go ahead sarah james piper jaffray co analyst thank you michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer thank you sarah james piper jaffray co analyst in north carolina did centene submit a bid as a health plan also or only a ple and i m wondering since the provider led entities could be awarded regions and health plans statewide can you speak a little bit to the strategy around deciding to submit a debt as the ple michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer well we actually we actually did submit on both sides of that but we emphasize the ple you have to go back and look at the historic programs they ve had in the state and the role providers have had and i think working with the state medical society and they ve been great constructive partners and they really want to deliver high quality care they understand the cost issues and they want to work with us because of our systems and how we can support them doing a better job and everybody doing well we decided that s a good place to be and i still believe that sarah and i think over time it s going to prove to be a very effective model in markets like north carolina with the history they ve had so this is one of those things that i think time will prove to be on our side and so it s going to be business as usual we did do both but we thought the real need to emphasize this side of it and i think the states just i think they had some value and that s why they did give us the largest and third largest regions as opposed to say no we are not going to do any of this provider led organizations but we re going to go back and talk to them and see if that can be expanded some through the appeal process if not we ll still be as a partner no matter how it comes out so it s going to be a sizable business with full size for you on the q1 call sarah james piper jaffray co analyst got it that makes a lot of sense and one more question if i can if i look back at 2018 there were points of 2q and 3q where consensus didn t really get seasonality right on a couple of different lines and that caused some confusion so i m wondering if there s any commentary you can offer around 2019 seasonality your cadence and how you see that differing from 2018 michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i want to make an opening comment and let jeff take that of course we re not we don t look at consensus we look at the business and how it s developing but jeff do you want to talk about seasonality jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah i think what we said in our december investor day we kind of gave we ve been trying to give more insight i guess to the seasonality of the business giving a first half second half view as far as how earnings progression goes and i would say the comment we made there i think were consistent so over 60 in the first half of the year and again as we continue to grow the marketplace business that shift continues to happen i mean the real the real driver of our change in seasonality is really the product mix it s the diversification of the product mix and so to the extent that you have a higher mix of exchange then you will pull more earnings forward to the first half of the year because of the number one that s when we have the highest level of membership and number two that s when we have the lowest hpr as a result of deductibles sarah james piper jaffray co analyst okay so even though you guys are doing much better on exchange growth than you thought at investor day you still think the 60 40 net is the appropriate way to think about the year jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah i would think that s a good place to start sarah james piper jaffray co analyst thank you jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator the next question comes from a j rice with credit suisse please go ahead a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks hi everybody michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer hi a j rice credit suisse analyst first i want to just ask about fidelis a little more it sounds like generally on a broad sense everything is tracking are there any pockets as you drill down where you ve seen new opportunities now that you ve had it for a while are there any areas where you re seeing challenges that weren t anticipated michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i ll start off and others can add if they feel i think it s an incredibly well run company we re pleased with what we ve had father frawley will continue to work with us in social responsibility for some obvious legal reasons it was important that he appoint a new ceo we did in great continuity there the whole team is in place in fact he commented to me the other not too long away he was saying that the turnover rate since we announced the acquisition has been the lowest they ve seen historically so people are really pleased with it i think the opportunity there are opportunities to continue to grow there s some opportunities there to help them with the medical loss ratio using our systems so it s but it s they are hitting all the numbers they are functioning on all eight of 12 cylinders depending how many you have in your automobile and so i think i m familiar with every aspect of it where i made this comment one day that if we could find more businesses like that i d just want to do one in the morning and one in the afternoon they are really a well run company a j rice credit suisse analyst okay i was going to also ask about in mississippi in the press release you highlight that you completed the implementation of the new pbm model can you update us on your thought about rolling it out to other markets and will you wait for sort of proof of concept is mississippi going to play out for a little while or how should we think about that michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer no it we are actively rolling it out now and i like to roll it out as best as we can but once again i want to make sure as well proof of concepts there it s working incredibly well in mississippi and we re confident that we re going to roll it out into additional markets we are right now as we speak and by the end of 2020 we will be in all the markets and if i can pick it up in some way we will but once again i m not going to overload it and but it s a great system it s going to prove to be i think where pharmacy benefits should be headed a j rice credit suisse analyst okay what s the most significant economic benefit of making that transition that you re seeing in mississippi michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer well there s administrative expenses it s cloud based we can reduce the admin costs significantly and we re working with i mean john scott have all been people there are really innovative and creative and i m working with them now because i have a commitment to speak about is some way to move to net pricing as opposed to rebates and i think they have the system skills and capabilities that we can start talking about those kinds and we are talking about those kinds of things with them so that could be instant so there s a lot of significance in what you are doing it s is very innovative and as we re able to demonstrate more and more of it you ll see it a j rice credit suisse analyst okay all right thanks a lot operator the next question comes from lance wilkes with sanford bernstein please go ahead lance wilkes bernstein analyst yeah good morning could you talk a little bit about in the medicaid book medical cost trend and management in particular if you could just kind of hit upon some color on what s doing better than expected and what s doing worse how important steerage and restricted networks are and what s going on with risk profile at the state level with them sort of the reenrollment efforts that are taking place at those levels michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer jeff you want to comment on that jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah a couple of things we did see the medicaid improvement over the third quarter really it s a combination of many things combination of the net management network initiatives premium premium rate adjustments combined with i think what we saw was stable cost trends in the fourth quarter so your comment about risk profile i mean you really have to go on on a state by state basis so if you aggregate the business i mean that s one of the benefits of diversification if you aggregate the business i would say the risk profile has remained relatively consistent michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i d like to add that if you look at the scale and size we have in most i mean albeit in the newest markets it s 65 000 in mexico and iowa ph but we have the size we do and you get a balanced book of business and we were expecting to have some that are inaudible and some that are healthier and we look across the whole book and we re seeing that and that s really the large numbers as much with anything else coming into play so that s for the the benefit of our size being the largest medicaid provider and but also as jeff highlighted you have 31 states it puts you in a strong position because as i tell investors it s no different in their portfolios at any given time they might have one stock that s not performing well or two well we re going to have we re going to have a market that has a couple of issues but we have others doing well and they offset while we collect the one that has an issue so it s it s a balance that gives us certain comfort lance wilkes bernstein analyst and can you just talk to the just clarify on the behavioral membership for the quarter what was the decrease in that and does it go into an integrated medical offering michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s moving and we re moving more and more to the integrated medicine i want to do that as quickly as we can i really i really believes that s an important place to be i have used probably the example that somebody s diagnosed a new as a new diabetic i sure want them to talk to a behavioral version as quickly as they can because it gives you more control of the total medical condition jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the membership decrease we previewed this at our investor day it was really a behavioral health only program in arizona that was integrated with the traditional medicaid program and so while the membership decreased quite a bit the revenues are up on a consolidated basis so lower membership higher revenue because it s been integrated with the physical health lance wilkes bernstein analyst got you thanks operator your next question comes from steve tanal with goldman sachs please go ahead stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst good morning guys thanks for the question michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst just quick one on the marketplace i missed the minimal mlr accrual number if you could just give us that once more and then maybe just let us know where 2018 margins ended for the business jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think 260 million approximately 260 million and as i said in our december investor day we re not going to give it s a competitively priced product we re not going to give a specific margin number stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst okay all right fair enough and then the other question that i had we re hearing a little bit more sort of anecdotally around the eligibility redeterminations in medicaid potentially affecting risk polls and making for a bit of a short term blip as some of the the mcas go back to the states for better rates what are your views on whether or not that s happening and if it is maybe is this part of sort of the uptick in medicaid rates where you re looking for a 1 5 comp as an increase in 19 versus one in 18 or how should we think about that if that s not really behind that jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer again i think you have to go on a state by state basis we have seen where redeterminations have changed the risk pool and states have been relatively quick to react i wouldn t necessarily call that meaningful it s certainly helpful but it s not a meaningful driver of the medical cost if you look at the actual volume of redeterminations but we actually have had states do adjustments i would say relatively quickly after the redeterminations and when you look at acuity mix it s different by state some states have had redeterminations that had no effect on acuity michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s once again it s the law of large numbers large number of states in the mix stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and so then the acceleration in the rate is there anything specifically you can sort of think about that s driving that jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer the acceleration in what rate the composites stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst composite yeah composite rate 1 5 ph versus one in 18 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think i mentioned at our december investor day we do have a state certain states which aren t performing at the long term margin some of that is a rating issue so we have seen and are projecting some improvement in rates into 2019 stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst perfect thank you operator the next question comes from dave windley with jefferies please go ahead david steinberg jefferies company inc analyst hi good morning it s dave steinberg in for dave windley first question i had was just on the medicaid business it seems like that that s driving the mlr moving to the bottom end of your 2018 guidance range i d be curious just to get a better sense of where the margins are at this point and we are hearing peers obviously talk about net margin is getting close to 3 over the next couple of years do you think that s something possible for centene or is there some business mix or for other structural considerations that might make it hard for you guys to replicate that type of profile jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i commented on this in our december investor day where we ve also grown faster than anybody else in the industry on the medicaid side and as michael mentioned before when you re starting up these new markets you have compressed margins versus what you d say is your long term margin target so i think from our standpoint we still think 3 to 5 is a good margin target and just because of the mix and the growth that we ve had it s probably different than our competitors michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer and i would add something else if you look at it we we showed the net margin up 50 basis points with what we gave you today it s easy to say what do you think is going to happen in the future we prefer to say we have a continued focus on margin expansion and growing the business and we tend to deliver against it versus saying i m going to get it to x number because i mean that s easy to say in fact i used to learn that they used to say in brazil and other that people will accept anything i m going to simply say that we are going to continue to grow this business and it s dramatic in my opinion and we re going to work hard at margin expansion using systems and other capabilities we have to improve outcomes and reduce cost david steinberg jefferies company inc analyst sure and jeff i think i heard you mention that the risk adjustment payables was with that 930 million up the fourth quarter i think that s up about 37 year over year compared to exchange enrollment that s up a little bit over 50 can you just help us understand maybe the delta there why those don t look a little bit more comparable in terms of growth jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean you have to look at number of months i think is one of the first things so in total but i mean it wasn t it wasn t out of line with our expectations so and i did give you it s 930 million and the reason i m giving those is because typically what we file in the quarter is we file the 10 q and you can pull those from the 10 q obviously here the annual report comes later so i m just giving this to you now david steinberg jefferies company inc analyst sure thanks operator the next question comes from matt borsch with bmo capital markets please go ahead matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst oh thanks for fitting me in a question about if you look out with your the various providers that you re working with do you anticipate shortages as you look ahead the next five years or maybe even beyond that and i ll ask a question in the context of a hypothetical that if you had one of the big drug retailers let s say with sort of ancillary personnel providing primary care services would that be something that would be an attractive model for centene to contract with michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think we tend to kind of march our own drum and we will grow as primary care we work well with specialists and sometime when some of you have the chance to come into the office we will take you through our casenet and our interpreta we ve shown some of it in the investor day but there are systems that help physicians become very successful in treating new patients and given the data and give real time heated scores and things that they can get on we are moving to where they can get on their iphone and so i believe that there are effective contracts in equity where you can have equity in contracts is i m trying to say matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst yeah michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer that s kind that tends to be the direction if we see and i said this in investor day if we saw an area where there is not enough positions for inaudible we re working with some governmental agencies in just that issue we have cmg now that has the capability to open up very successful clinics that deal with this population social determinants et cetera and we d ask louis ph who runs it to move in the region x and put together a little multi specialty clinic so we think we have the capability to meet our members needs and once again we all know what you re thinking of and that s a big operation but they also have a lot of commercial and other membership and we re very focused in the government services area matt borsch bmo capital markets analyst great thank you operator the next question comes from ana gupte with the svb leerink please go ahead ana gupte leerink analyst hi thanks good morning michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer hi ana gupte leerink analyst thanks for fitting me in just wanted some color as you go into 2020 on a couple of drivers growth drivers firstly on exchanges can you talk about what your growth profile might be there as you look at the demand and then the under penetration the move to short term plans and anything else in the competitive environment as you go into the selling season jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer i will start and jeff you can pick up the short term plans i mean short term plans who may have inaudible have been around forever the benefits of maturity are less the majority of our membership has subsidies so why jump out if something else gives you a lot less benefits to go into it and those things still have to be proven out and they are just at the short term and i think over time costs and short term plans go up because you have such a turnover that you have different disease states and they have they ve tried to overcome that by being able to underwrite health risks and that itself i think is going to long term be a problem not for us but just for health states in general so i think it s a long way it s an attempt to be disruptive but i m not sure how disruptive we our particular model so i think that it s so looking forward i mean i ll just remind ana not you but others has talked about our growth rate as we have got bigger wallets we re still maintaining a significant growth rate they talk about the exchanges and all the disruption and how it is and were up 15 this year when the market it s declining so we re just going to continue to business as usual and deal with the facts as we have now and the fact says it s a good business it s a strong business and we know how to manage it we have the systems to manage it does that help ana gupte leerink analyst yeah helpful yes thanks thanks mike on the ma side then for 2020 and i think it s really thought leading on the ascension jv but you do also have the 4 star contract at this point are you planning to do two different products one that s co branded and then one that s with ascension and then one centene or how are you thinking about 2020 as an opportunity for growth michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer i think that s going to depend by market it depends on the size of the market where we are our network we are going to work we are going first work effectively with our partners at ascension and they we re not doing inaudible they work with so i mean they so it s a it will be a mix depending on the size of market scale and what makes sense i mean we have some markets we ve had historically more than one product so that s not a bad thing i can go back to my consumer package goods days there was a time in canada we had three different soap ads and it worked very well ana gupte leerink analyst makes sense multiple speakers michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer pardon me ana gupte leerink analyst no i think that makes sense you are not customized i mean you will be more customized by local market than dependents michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer right i think what the key is i think what s key ana is you had the you used to have the systems and the overall capability to manage that multiplicity of opportunities and that s where we re focused and have made comments we re going to continue invest in technology and i think we ve demonstrated that we have the wherewithal to do it in a very meaningful way it goes back to the 500 million we are going to generate internally so as to be able to invest in new technologies and new opportunities without affecting margins and the overall growth of the business ana gupte leerink analyst yeah truly that s a competitive advantage yeah that makes a lot of sense on the systems michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from steven valiquette with barclays please go ahead steven valiquette barclays analyst great thanks good morning everybody michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer good morning steven valiquette barclays analyst so there were some moving parts in medicaid costs throughout 2018 for really centene and really a lot of companies in the overall mco sector but just given all the drivers you mentioned earlier that led to your sequential improvement in medicaid cost trend in 4q 18 and also just exiting the year i guess when you add it all up is there any extra color you can provide just on your expected medicaid mlr assumptions for 2019 overall versus 2018 overall just when comparing on an apples to apples basis thanks jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i commented on this at our investor day i mean we do expect medicaid margins to improve in 2019 over 2018 and a lot of that s driven by a lot of actions that we ve taken this year which will have a full year run rate heading into 2019 but we do we do anticipate improvement in the medicaid margins in 19 steven valiquette barclays analyst yeah and bottom line is that the trends in 4q 18 are certainly very suggestive that you re on track to achieve and so that s i guess kind of the key takeaway at least from my perspective jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yes it was a good quarter steven valiquette barclays analyst yeah got it ok all right thanks guys operator your next question comes from gary taylor with j p morgan please go ahead gary taylor j p morgan analyst hi good morning just a couple of questions left the first is on the 2019 exchange enrollment have you guys disclosed they will be willing to help us with on the four new states how much does that contribute to the 250 000 increase ex fidelis michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer jeff jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i guess what i would say is consistent with what we ve done historically it s not the largest driver of membership growth typically when we go into new markets it s a test and learn approach and i think we followed that for the new markets this year so it s not the majority of the driver of the membership growth it really is coming from existing markets that we ve had gary taylor j p morgan analyst okay and then my second question is cash from ops for 2018 was weighed by about 1 billion i think with some of these california accruals that you ended up paying this year the normal free cash flow looks quite good compared to earnings as we head into 2019 just remind us i don t recall from investor day you called out anything but versus kind of your long term guidance of 1 5 times to 2 times cash from ops versus earnings are there any material variances that for 2019 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean i think the 1 5 to 2 times would apply there s always there s always timing issues right there can always be a timing of the state payment that you don t get at the end of the quarter the end of the year that is subsequently paid within the next few days and so and given our size in some states those can be meaningful so you always have timing items that come up but nothing that i can think of similar to what we experienced in the over 1 billion of mlr payables in california gary taylor j p morgan analyst okay thank you very much operator the next question comes from ralph giacobbe with citi please go ahead ralph giacobbe citi analyst thanks good morning so you ended with a 1 46 million fixed members you mentioned 2 million which i understand is sort of the peak number and i think you also said 250 000 year over year so just want to clarify that sort of year end membership on the hics somewhere in that kind of 17 to 18 is that the right way to think about it jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t we don t actually provide the year end obviously there s attrition from the peak membership so what we re talking about is if you go back to our investor day slides we would have said 2018 peak was 1 650 million ph you re growing 250 on top of that plus the addition of 80 000 with fidelis gets you close to the 2 million right but we don t we are not providing a year end 2019 number ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay is there any reason to think that it wouldn t just be similar to prior years in terms of and being versus peak jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would expect a normal attrition rate that s certainly what we have forecasted ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay that s helpful and then just real quick just effective tax rate we should use for 2019 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer it s in the guidance i provided that in the guidance this morning or did i miss that michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer yeah yeah it s in the press release ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay and one more if i could can you just remind us of the level of incremental maybe strategic investment that you called out in and just framing on sort of the ongoing expense or if you see that pace on thanks jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer strategic investment for which year 2018 or 2019 what specifically are you ralph giacobbe citi analyst 19 jefferey a schwaneke executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we said start what we call business expansion business expansion costs i think what we said now this is on a split adjusted basis obviously 0 12 to 0 14 ralph giacobbe citi analyst okay all right thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to michael neidorff for any closing remarks michael f neidorff chairman and chief executive officer well i just want to thank everybody for the questions the time and we look forward to continuing the record year after year so have a good first quarter we ll talk to you soon operator this conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect duration 74

advertisement advertisement regal delivered another solid performance in the fourth quarter with organic sales up 5 2 adjusted operating margin up 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share up 23 at a segment level in commercial and industrial organic sales were up 1 3 with strength in a number of end markets including power generation oil and gas and commercial hvac offsetting weakness in asia particularly china in the climate segment organic sales were up a strong 9 4 with strength in north american residential hvac both oem and aftermarket as well as commercial refrigeration partially offset by weakness in international market finally in the pts segment organic sales were up a strong 9 for the quarter with robust growth in distribution and oil and gas from an operating profit perspective the adjusted operating margin improved 80 basis points year over year the operating margin benefited from volume incremental price and variable cost productivity but was held back by commodity inflation and tariffs the resulted adjusted earnings per share was up 23 and was based on strong operational performance with no benefit coming from the 2018 tax reform for the quarter free cash flow to net income was 169 in the quarter we repurchased 49 5 million of our shares the fourth quarter was the sixth quarter out of the last seven that we have repurchased shares additionally we also announced the divestiture of non core engineered drives business which we closed down in january overall it was a strong close to a record year with strong organic sales growth and further progress on our march to improve operating margins advertisement advertisement looking forward as we enter the new year overall we expect continued growth in 2019 despite the tougher year over year comparisons for 2019 our guidance assumes total year organic growth to be up low to mid single digits we expect to carry the price benefits from our 2018 increases into 2019 we expect our top line to benefit from continued growth in residential and light commercial hvac end markets and we expect to benefit from the upcoming fer energy efficiency regulation we are planning for modest growth in north american commercial and industrial markets and we are planning for market headwinds in china and europe and margin performance our manufacturing facilities are performing well and we continue to realize the benefits of our simplification initiative further we are making the needed investments in our tariff mitigation programs to help offset the impact of tariffs with these mitigation programs and the benefits of the pricing carryover we expect to continue to offset tariffs and commodity inflation in 2019 our total year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2019 has been set at 6 15 to 6 55 up 6 at the midpoint of our guidance when you account for the impact of our recent divestitures and exits our earnings per share guidance for our ongoing business would result in a 10 increase in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint advertisement advertisement i will now turn it over to rob rob rehard vice president chief financial officer thank you mark and good morning everyone sales in the fourth quarter 2018 were 881 7 million up 7 4 from the prior year acquisitions contributed 3 9 the business to be exited was a negative 0 4 and foreign currency was a negative 1 4 in the quarter therefore organic sales increased a solid 5 2 from the prior year with all three segments contributing our adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 10 7 our margin was up 80 basis points compared to the prior year margins benefited from both volume growth and productivity improvements price cost was slightly positive in the quarter additionally we incurred 10 8 million in lifo expense which impacted all three segments advertisement advertisement for your reference i ve included a table at the bottom of the slide showing the lifo expense or benefit by segment for the fourth quarter 2018 and the fourth quarter 2017 overall it was a solid quarter with strong organic sales growth and continued operating margin improvement our fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share reported on a gaap basis were 1 28 there were a number of adjustments to gaap eps in the fourth quarter the first adjustment was restructuring and related costs of 2 2 million or 0 04 per share the second adjustment was a gain on the sale of assets of 2 2 million or 0 04 per share the third adjustment was related to the business to be exited of 800 000 or 0 01 per share the fourth adjustment was related to ceo transition cost of 3 8 million or 0 07 per share and the final adjustment was related to the impact of the new us tax legislation of 3 million or 0 07 per share net of these adjustments the adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 1 41 representing a 22 6 increase from the prior year now i will summarize a few key financial metrics our capital expenditures were 18 4 million in the fourth quarter capital expenditures were 77 6 million for the full year 2018 our simplification activities resulted in 2 2 million of restructuring and related costs in the fourth quarter restructuring and related costs were 7 7 million for the full year 2018 advertisement advertisement in the upper right quadrant we show our effective tax rate information the adjusted etr in the fourth quarter was 21 we re adjusting the etr for the effect of the impact of the new us tax legislation i mentioned on the prior slide we ve provided a table in the appendix of this presentation to reconcile the gaap etr to the adjusted etr our adjusted etr was 20 8 for the full year 2018 in the lower left quadrant we present information on our fourth quarter 2018 balance sheet our total debt was 1 307 million and our net debt was 1 059 million we finished the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 2 0 in the lower right quadrant we present information on our free cash flow we generated 94 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter representing 169 of net income for the quarter and lastly we repurchased just over 645 000 of our shares for 49 5 million in the fourth quarter throughout 2018 we repurchased over 1 6 million of our shares for 127 8 million before i cover 2019 guidance i would like to spend some time talking about a number of businesses we either have or will be divesting or exiting you may have seen this referenced in yesterday s earnings release on the top half of this page i have provided the five different non core businesses that have been or expect to be divested or exited advertisement advertisement the first is the residential hermetic motor parts business we disclosed in the second quarter of 2018 the second business is the engineered drives and controls business we announced at the end of 2018 and divested at the beginning of 2019 the final three businesses are other small non core businesses that we have already or will be divesting or exiting early in 2019 on the bottom half of this page i have provided a summary of the impact of these businesses to be divested and exited by segment the results of these businesses are not included in our 2019 guidance i would like to point out to all of our investors that additional details related to these divestitures and exits are included in the appendix of this presentation in these tables we ve included net sales and adjusted income from operations for each segment by quarter and for the full year as well as the impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year so you can clearly see the impact of these divestitures and exits on our ongoing business divesting or exiting non core businesses is consistent with one of the key elements of our enterprise strategy which is focusing on the core now i will provide information on our full year guidance for 2019 our guidance assumes low to mid single digit organic sales growth for the full year we are expected expecting continued improvement in our adjusted operating margin for the full year 2019 making this the third consecutive year of improvement we are expecting to see improvements in all three segments from volume leverage continued simplification efforts and price we are expecting free cash flow to exceed net income for the full year our full year 2019 gaap eps guidance is 6 59 to 6 99 on an adjusted eps basis our full year 2019 guidance is 6 15 to 6 55 advertisement advertisement the expected adjustments to convert the gaap eps to the adjusted eps total of 0 44 per share the adjustments are restructuring and related costs of 10 million or 0 18 per share a gain on the sale of assets related to the recent divestiture of the engineered drives and controls business of 40 million or 0 70 per share and ceo transition costs of 4 5 million or 0 08 per share also shown on this slide for your reference are some key assumptions included in our 2019 guidance in summary at the midpoint of our guidance our full year adjusted eps is expected to be up 6 over the prior year or 10 on a comparable basis after accounting for the impact of the divestitures and exits included in the appendix of this presentation now i will turn the call over to jon jon avampato vice president chief information officer thanks rob good morning everyone before i cover the normal updates on the segments i d like to talk about the recent ahr expo in atlanta and the upcoming fer regulation at the trade show we had the opportunity to highlight our latest hvac and refrigeration technologies to both our existing customers and potential new customers consistent with our enterprise strategy there were three key innovation themes to our booth the first theme of energy efficiency is all about the new products we have introduced to help our customers meet upcoming regulations the most significant is the upcoming fer regulation for gas furnaces which goes into effect in july of this year we showcased an entire lineup of new products developed to help our customers meet the new rule we continue to expect 40 million in annual incremental sales in our climate solutions segment as a result of the fer regulation we re forecasting a meaningful impact in the second half of 2019 by 2020 we would expect to see the full impact of the incremental sales the second theme is around iot capabilities of our new products we had many examples in our booth to show our customers a great example is the insight motor and control our entry level product targeted for fer this new product features near field communication which allows our oem customers to easily program the product on their production lines reducing inventory and improving productivity we also believe that this iot feature can simplify the commissioning and troubleshooting of hvac systems we were excited that our new insight motor and control was recognized at the show by receiving the 2019 ahr innovation award and finally the third theme was all about our disruptive axial technology this technology delivers improvements and reduced size weight noise and increased energy efficiency many of the new products displayed in our booth are utilizing axial technology last year we experienced solid growth across the hvac markets and we re excited about the growth our innovation efforts will deliver in 2019 now i ll walk through each of the segments and give more details on organic sales and operating margin performance in commercial industrial systems sales were 437 million with organic sales increasing 1 3 from prior year we were facing a relatively difficult comparison in c i as organic sales were up 8 8 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we experienced sales strength in oil and gas power generation and commercial hvac sales and distribution were relatively flat to the prior year this strength was partially offset by weakness across asia particularly in china price improved sequentially and was up over prior year price cost continue to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter similar to our performance in the second and third quarter we were pleased with the favorable price cost performance given additional cost headwinds we experienced from the tariffs and lifo expense adjusted operating margin was 7 8 of sales up 170 basis points from prior year productivity from our simplification programs and price had a positive impact on our margins lifo expense was a drag to margin in the quarter but did help the year over year comparison inflation and tariff expense were headwinds for the full year organic sales grew 4 7 in our c i segment and adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points over prior year our margin improvement efforts for the c i segment are on track and we expect to deliver another year of meaningful margin improvement in 2019 in climate solutions adjusted sales were 223 million with organic sales increasing a strong 9 4 from prior year in north america sales in residential hvac were up low double digit to prior year with strength with both our oem and distribution customers we also experienced sales strength in commercial refrigeration and water heating sales in europe were up slightly over the prior year the strength in north america was partially offset by headwinds in asia and the middle east price improved sequentially and was up over prior year price cost continue to be slightly favorable in the fourth quarter similar to our performance in the second and third quarter adjusted operating margin was 15 of adjusted sales down 30 basis points from prior year volume productivity in our manufacturing operations mix and price all had a positive impact on margins the lifo expense in the quarter compared with the large lifo benefit in the prior year was a margin headwind and offset these benefits for the full year in the climate segment organic sales grew by 4 6 and in spite of the year over year increase in lifo expense adjusted operating margin was a strong 15 5 we entered 2019 encouraged by the overall end market demand and our ability to drive organic sales growth with our innovation efforts sales in power transmission solutions were 213 million with organic sales increasing a strong 9 from prior year in the quarter we experienced strength across a number of end markets including distribution oil and gas marine and commercial hvac similar to the third quarter we saw weaker demand in agriculture price improved sequentially and was up over prior year price cost was favorable in the quarter adjusted operating margin was 11 9 of sales down 30 basis points from the prior year the higher volume price and productivity in our manufacturing operations had a positive impact on margins and similar to our climate business the lifo expense in the quarter compared with the large lifo benefit in the prior year was a margin headwind and offset these benefits for the full year organic sales grew by 9 1 in the pts segment and adjusted operating margin was 12 6 up 120 basis points from the prior year it was great progress in 2018 and we re expecting another year of sales growth and margin improvement in our pts business in 2019 before i turn the call back over to mark i d like to reflect on the three year financial commitments that we made at our investor day meeting in march of 2017 the metrics in purple are the targets that we committed to deliver by 2019 in green we show the progress that we have made through the first two years of 2017 and 2018 in the first two years we ve delivered an organic sales compound annual growth rate of 5 2 higher than our target we ve experienced strength in many of the end markets and the investments we re making to grow organic sales are paying off over the past two years we ve increased adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points and return on invested capital by 180 basis points during this time period we were faced with significant inflation from both the commodities and freight and we also had to deal with the increased tariff expenses in 2018 we were able to overcome these headwinds and deliver meaningful improvement and profitability and finally free cash flow to net income exceeded 100 in each of the past two years coming in at a 112 through the two year period we ve made significant progress on all four metrics through the first two years we expect further progress in 2019 and the targets remain in sight we re confident that the three elements of our enterprise strategy are key to delivering these results focus on the core innovate to grow and simplification i ll now turn the call back over to mark mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks jeff thanks jon before we go to q a i would like to briefly reflect on our 2018 total year results 2018 was a record year in both sales and adjusted earnings organic sales were up 5 7 and adjusted operating margins increased 60 basis points versus the prior year in spite of the significant commodity and tariff headwinds adjusted earnings per share increased 23 with most of the benefit coming from operations versus tax reform and for the eighth consecutive year we finished with free cash flow to net income greater than 100 this year s free cash flow to net income was 116 in 2018 we made the strategic acquisition of nicotra gebhardt to strengthen our position in the commercial air moving space we repurchased roughly 128 million of our shares and we reduced our net debt to adjusted ebitda to 2 0 over the last six months we have put plans in place to exit or divested five non core businesses with annual revenues totaling roughly 200 million this will allow our management team to focus on and reinvest back in our core operations further we have a healthy pipeline of potential core related acquisition targets finally jon laid out the three year performance targets we communicated at the march 2017 investor day organic growth operating margin return on invested capital and free cash flow to net income we are pleased that in both 2017 and 2018 we made meaningful progress on all four metrics and we believe that with our expected 2019 performance the target range is still in sight as we close 2018 we expect that the 2018 momentum will continue into 2019 our 2019 guidance reflects low to mid single digits organic growth our third consecutive year of margin improvement and a resulting 6 increase in adjusted earnings per share at the center point of our guidance when you account for the impact of our recent divestitures and exits our eps guidance for our ongoing business would result in a 10 increase in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint to cap off a great year regal recently published its first ever sustainability report you can find it on our website a few years ago we restated our regal purpose to read we create a better tomorrow by efficiently converting power into motion today our regal employees live this purpose and our sustainability report tells our story we talk about our regal handprint which represents the products we make and the positive impact they have on our environment by saving enormous amounts of energy and we talk about the regal footprint which represents our efforts to reduce the waste we leave behind as well as the natural resources we consume to produce our products every year we strive to increase the impact of our handprint and decrease the impact of our footprint from the products we make to the way we make them our purpose is to create a better tomorrow for everyone we believe sustainability is yet another element of the long term value we deliver to shareholders and finally before we go to q a i would like to briefly update you on our ceo transition our original transition plan remains intact i will be retiring and stepping down as regal s ceo once the new ceo is on board a committee comprised of members of regal s board of directors is leading the search and we expect the new ceo to be in place sometime in the second quarter i will continue to lead the company until that time and i will remain as an advisor for a short period after the new ceo is in place to assure an orderly transition the regal organization has responded very well through this transition and all of our energy is focused on delivering for our stakeholders we will now take your questions questions and answers operator thank you sir we will now begin the question and answers session operator instructions the first question we have will come from joe ritchie of goldman sachs please go ahead ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst hi good morning guys this is ashay gupta on for joe mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst so nice quarter and your guidance seems by these numbers i guess just to start off could you maybe talk about the differences in outlook between the three segments as we head into 2019 and maybe specifically also address the performance in climate in the quarter and whether that was some like pre buy associated with the regulation change mark gliebe chief executive officer okay i ll take a pass at those questions and i m sure jon will jump in in terms of our guidance between the three quarters i mean between the three segments when we when we think about the commercial and industrial segment and the pts segment kind of serving many of the same end markets and we are expecting low to mid single digit growth across those markets the commercial industrial business will have more of a headwind out of china and out of europe and then when it comes to our climate segment as we commented we are expecting some lift in the back half of the year as a result of the fer law as that law changes over we expect some improvement there and then relative to whether or not we saw any lift in the quarter as a result of fer i think that was your second question we don t believe there was any impact from fer as a pre build in the fourth quarter jon did i miss anything jon avampato vice president chief information officer no i would just add though that while we don t think there was an impact in the fourth quarter from fer our customers are actively now talking about their needs for any potential pre build we re still pulling that altogether our current assumption is that there will be a nominal pre build in 2019 impacting the first half by in the range of 3 million to 5 million and that s been factored into our guide mark gliebe chief executive officer top line 3 million to 5 million on the top line ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst got it thank you and maybe as a follow up i noticed that your guidance for 2019 doesn t include any impact of buyback so just curious on how you re thinking about capital allocation next year given the strong free cash and the cash that you ll get from the asset sales mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks joe yes you re right we do not include any buyback assumption in our 2019 guidance as we think about capital allocation we will continue to have a balanced approach looking at buybacks as an alternative obviously m a as i mentioned we do have a healthy pipeline of targets that we re considering and we ll also look at debt payment debt pay down ashay gupta goldman sachs analyst got it thanks guys congrats on a good quarter mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you operator next we have scott graham of bmo capital markets scott graham bmo capital markets analyst yes hi good morning and very nice quarter gents mike halloran baird analyst thank you scott graham bmo capital markets analyst the couple questions i have were really very end market specific as i know for example you have a lot of your oil and gas in the upstream and i m just kind of wondering what you re hearing seeing order rate wise in that market given some of the disruptive forces on the price of oil and some of these large upstream guys cutting back a little bit in 2019 can you just sketch that for us a little bit jon avampato vice president chief information officer sure scott this is jon i ll add some comments there so we did see we called out we did see sales strength in the fourth quarter from oil and gas in both the pts segment and the c i segment we had overall good orders performance in 2018 in oil and gas and you re right more of our exposure is upstream i ll comment that we probably saw in the fourth quarter we saw a little bit more choppiness in the order rates in oil and gas but we were coming off some pretty strong orders in the first half of 2018 coming into 2019 we still see order strength in oil and gas but we re now coming up on some pretty difficult comparisons as we look at the orders there also i would say that overall for the company about 5 of our sales are in oil and gas we have exposure in both upstream and midstream and the divestiture of our engineered drives and control business will reduce this exposure a little bit especially in the upstream demand mark gliebe chief executive officer by about 80 basis points or so jon avampato vice president chief information officer correct scott graham bmo capital markets analyst got it thank you and then on your hvac markets what are your oe customers saying both the resi and commercial sides for what they re expecting in 2019 and maybe specify if you re going to respond in sales dollars or sales volumes jon avampato vice president chief information officer so we are i think what we would say we re hearing from most of our customers for 2019 demand in hvac is in the range of the low to mid single digit is the expectation that s pretty much was built into our guidance we ll have a little bit of this dynamic of this nominal prebuilt we talked about in our first half performance that will come out of the second half and that will then of course have a little bit of a delay in the timing of the fbr transition just because of the prebuilt that will be in the channel but we don t think that will be a large amount scott graham bmo capital markets analyst jon are you saying low to mid single across both resi and commercial jon avampato vice president chief information officer yeah i would say that s fair assessment of what we ve built into our guidance this year scott graham bmo capital markets analyst okay and then my last question is about distribution where c i looked flat whereas i think pts you said was strong could you kind of connect those dots for us jon avampato vice president chief information officer yeah we had so you re right c i was more flattish in the fourth quarter pts was strong and climate was also strong in distribution in the fourth quarter we think that for distribution in c i we had pretty healthy demand in distribution but we had some pretty difficult comparisons in the c i segment to prior year fourth quarter prior year was a strong quarter for c i and in particular distribution contributed nicely to that performance so we think it was a bit more of a comparison issue in the fourth quarter for c i scott graham bmo capital markets analyst so nothing changed the tone there we had a couple distributors saying that because of the timing of the holidays there was a little disruption but overall you would say that your distribution channel remains healthy for you jon avampato vice president chief information officer yeah i think that s how we would characterize it scott and similar to the other comments on organic sales we re going to have more difficult comparisons in 2019 but we still feel good about the performance of the market scott graham bmo capital markets analyst got it thank you good job mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks scott operator and next we have mike halloran of baird mike halloran baird analyst hey good morning everyone so just kind of following up on that last point there maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying trajectory and core industrial businesses as you look through the fourth quarter any real change in the trajectory from normal seasonality or from customer cadence that they talk about and any change to start 2019 so far jon avampato vice president chief information officer i would say that we are not seeing any big change related to those kinds of dynamics i would say that from an inventory standpoint we would say that there is probably a slight increase in both industrial and hvac in the distribution channels but it s kind of difficult to understand what the difference is there or what the impact is given the variables on tariffs and price increase and whether this is kind of a little bit of a normal inventory build or just some buying ahead of the tariffs so that s a little bit of noise that would be in the inventory numbers right now mike halloran baird analyst makes sense and obviously some moving pieces on the price cost side with the 2a pricing formulas the changes in commodity pricing and some of the price actions you had last year maybe just help a little bit how you think price cost cadence as we work through the year slightly positive pretty ubiquitously through the year or there is some variances that we should look for jon avampato vice president chief information officer i think i ll comment and then mark can add anything he d like to add so i ll go back to 2018 we felt good about the performance in 2018 on price cost we turned neutral in the first quarter and then we remained slightly favorable for the second third and fourth quarter on price cost we exited the year with a number of price increases that we implemented across all three segments either in the late third quarter or early to mid fourth quarter so we are expecting the carryover from those price actions to carry over into 2019 that s what s in our guidance and our assumption around price cost i think our expectation is that we will remain neutral to slightly favorable on price cost throughout the year mark gliebe chief executive officer i ll just also add copper started to turn somewhat deflationary around the june timeframe and then it s enough that we are seeing some of our 2 way material price formulas cause a price reduction now that s still it s still positive for us on a year over year basis but it was enough to flip to a few of those formulas over in the first quarter jon avampato vice president chief information officer correct mike halloran baird analyst i appreciate the color thank you mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you mike jon avampato vice president chief information officer thank you operator the next question we have will come from julian mitchell of barclays please go ahead julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning julian julian mitchell barclays analyst good morning maybe a first question and maybe i ve missed it but it sounded like you talked about pretty healthy margin expansion at c i and power transmission this year in 2019 i just wondered in climate solutions what the expectations on margins is relative to that 15 5 base figure and what are sort of some of the main moving parts within that rob rehard vice president chief financial officer julian you re right we in 2018 we had nice margin expansion in both our pts and our c i segments on the full year and in climate we finished the year at 15 5 and i mentioned in my comments that the year over year change in lifo expense the lifo expense versus the lifo benefit in 2017 was the headwind to margin expansion in our climate business for 2018 we are expecting margin expansion in climate in 2019 our expectation would be that we ll see margin expansion in all three segments climate will contribute in 2019 i would say the key points there will be leverage on volume some of the same themes we talked about 2018 benefits from productivity and our simplification efforts neutral to slightly favorable price cost and then we ll see a positive impact from mix especially with the high efficiency products in 2019 jon avampato vice president chief information officer i ll just comment there to add in that we could if there is a pull ahead that s meaningful beyond what jon already commented on there could be a negative impact to mix in the front half of the year and then a flip to a more positive impact to mix in the back half of the year julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks and then maybe just my follow up question around commercial and industrial systems are you expecting the first quarter growth rate to be roughly similar to what you saw in q4 given what you talked about in terms of flattish distribution and asia weakness or do we see a bit of a pickup just because of the easier comp and maybe some of that inventory being flushed through mark gliebe chief executive officer i think we would be looking at a quarter that s probably more similar to the fourth quarter of 2018 julian as we look to the first quarter here julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you very much jon avampato vice president chief information officer thanks julian operator next we have robert mccarthy of stephens robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good morning can you hear me mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning how are you doing rob robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst good doing well mark congratulations on a great run mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst yeah so you know what the next question is so i guess i won t be impolitic in terms of the first question and it s not my intention to be but in the context of this external ceo search right you have a very strong and talented deep management team but going external seems to send a signal that there must be some concern among the board around the portfolio or the position not in terms of the cost position because you guys do a great job in it in terms of that and managing it but in terms of maybe the strategic vision of the businesses you need to be in can you expand upon what the board is looking for in that ceo and what that could mean for your portfolio to the extent you can mark gliebe chief executive officer i understand your question i d say we have great alignment between the management team and the board around our strategy of kind of price strategy as we laid it out in 2017 and jon talked about it today focus innovate simplify it s working for us no question you re always looking at the portfolio obviously we commented on that back in 2017 when we said we divest roughly 200 million which we did in that timeframe and while we re not ready to set a new target certainly you re always looking at the portfolio in terms of things that no longer are core or things that you d like to add that our core so that s the headset that both management and the board is looking at the business okay and then thank you for taking my question by the way and then i guess a couple follow ups have been i guess in terms of thinking about the environment it looks like definitely from what you re seeing now pretty decent environment but if you do see pricings under further pressure volumes decelerate or we go into a bit of a slowdown here remind us the counter cyclical nature of the free cash flow net income conversion and what we should see given history and what you could maintain in terms of free cash flow to net income conversion if we go into a bit of a meaningful downturn here rob rehard vice president chief financial officer i can take that one so rob this is rob rehard so i think you would expect to see free cash flow conversion through the quarters to be somewhat consistent with our historical trend in terms of how it trends relative to prior quarters we do start out a little slower and then ramp up as we go through the year i ll remind you we do have eight years over 100 on free cash flow conversion in a downturn we would still expect to see strong free cash flow conversion as we did during the downturn a few years back where we still converted over 100 despite the downturn and a lot of that came through trade working capital improvements as we moved through the year so i think that would be how you would look at it robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst i guess the final question would be just around price cost and obviously tariffs and i apologize i did have to miss a little bit of this call in the beginning so i might have missed some of your commentary so i apologize for that but just talk about kind of ring fencing the risks around i mean you already alluded to the price cost being neutral to positive right but around the tariffs and how you re going to manage that impact and could that drive you to the low end of your guidance how do we think about aside from revenue what drives you to the low end and to your guidance range in terms of your cost structure and the pricing environment jon avampato vice president chief information officer rob this is jon i will talk about the tariffs so we in the fourth quarter we commented that price cost remained slightly favorable and that included the expense of the the additional expense of the tariffs so we were pleased with the price cost performance given those additional expenses if you recall in our third quarter call i talked about the two main actions we re taking to deal with the tariffs the first is around our footprint leveraging our global footprint and a number of product moves that we either have made or are making that will help us mitigate the impact of the tariff and then for the remaining products where we either don t have those options or it s not cost justified to do that we have and will look at raising price so we ve been able to offset the tariff our expectation in 2019 is that we ll continue to offset the tariffs mark gliebe chief executive officer i ll just add you had asked robert what would take us to the low end guidance we re assuming low to mid single digit growth rates a chunk of that coming from the markets we participate in so certainly that could be a driver now i also remind you that we talked about 10 million of restructuring for the year so we re continuing our self help efforts to get at margin improvement or offset a down the impact of a downturn robert mccarthy stephens inc analyst thanks for your time mark gliebe chief executive officer thank you operator and next we have jeffrey hammond of keybanc jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys mark gliebe chief executive officer good morning jeff jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just just on long targets long term targets or i guess going into 19 it looks like revenues running ahead do you think you can get into that zip code of 200 basis points to 250 basis points or is that a stretch at this point just given the last year rob rehard vice president chief financial officer no i think there is still we still have our eyes set on those targets on the low end obviously on the low end of the target but we still think there is a shot there a lot has to go our way but it s still in sight jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then any update on timing for the ceo search announcement mark gliebe chief executive officer well as i commented we still believe as it will be sometime in the second quarter jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just on the m a side can you just update us on the nicotra integration how it s going and if you re seeing any change in valuation with some of the some of the choppiness and macro worries thanks mark gliebe chief executive officer so first on nicotra the business is performing kind of the way we had thought it would when we acquired it from an integration perspective it just confirms that the business integrating into the company i would declare victory there we feel good about the integration still work to do on our synergies and there s still more to get there so that will take us another couple years and that s included in our guidance so but we feel good overall about what that business has brought for the company in the air moving space and then finally and valuations we would say that there s probably been a full turn down in valuations and targets so and we see that both on what we re selling and what we re considering as potential targets jeffrey hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks a lot mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks jeff operator the next question we have comes chris dankert of longbow research chris dankert longbow research analyst hey morning guys mark gliebe chief executive officer morning chris chris dankert longbow research analyst forgive me if i missed it but any update as far as some of the manufacturing transition out of china into other lower production cost regions just kind of any progress there jon avampato vice president chief information officer so chris this is jon we didn t really talk about specifically but we feel good about the progress we re making i had we had commented on the third quarter call about one example of product that we were transitioning from one of our facilities in china to one of our existing facilities in mexico that transition has gone well we are in production today on that product in mexico and serving our customers in the us so we feel good about that particular example there s a couple others that we are working on implementing in the first half of 2019 it s very similar to the one in mexico utilizing either existing footprint in asia outside of china or footprint that we have in mexico so good progress and we feel good about the positive impact that can have to mitigate the tariff expense a portion of the tariff expense chris dankert longbow research analyst got it got it that s helpful and i guess i assume a lot of your customers are trying to look at similar moves has that proven to be a net benefit for you guys or kind of a net neutral overall jon avampato vice president chief information officer i would say today it s a net neutral however we have commented and we continue to believe that over time we would see this as an as slightly net positive for the company we still feel that way today chris dankert longbow research analyst got it got it and one last one if i could quick just any comment on labor cost into 19 is just similar growth from what we ve seen just any kind of reminders on variable comp any kind of impact that might be out of the norm mark gliebe chief executive officer are you talking about for our production workforce or is that what you are referring to chris chris dankert longbow research analyst yeah exactly overall and then for 2019 for guidance sorry rob rehard vice president chief financial officer yeah so i would say that in 2018 with pretty much a strong demand in the markets labor availability and labor inflation has been and will continue to be an impact on the business however in 2018 i would say we didn t see necessarily any meaningful increase in inflation kind of the normal inflationary pressures that we see in the business going into 2019 one change that we are dealing with it s in our guidance but one change we are dealing with is the doubling of the minimum wage in mexico in the cities along the border so that s been a change that s implement that has been implemented in january is impacting us and anyone else manufacturing in that region and we re looking at a number of actions to mitigate that but that s some additional inflation that we re going to have to deal with in 2019 chris dankert longbow research analyst got it thanks so much and congrats on the results guys mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks chris operator and the next question we have will come from walter liptak of seaport global please go ahead walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks and congratulations on the quarter guys mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks walt walter liptak seaport global analyst wanted to ask about the c i business in asia and just maybe you can refresh us on the percentage of revenue for c i that s asia how much of that is china and then you provide us with any other color just kind of the tone of the market pricing etcetera maybe how it trended during the quarter mark gliebe chief executive officer so i ll start off and then jon can jump in so revenue overall for asia is probably i am going to say 10 to 12 of total revenue and then the c i piece of that is probably three quarters of that 10 to 12 is in the c i in the c i segment so yes it is there is some headwind there in particularly in the china area we are seeing nice growth continued growth in india but china middle east europe are headwinds for us and then the second part of your question walt walter liptak seaport global analyst just how how it s trending i mean is it do they come down and then stabilize what are you hearing from your customers i guess what are you expecting for 2019 jon avampato vice president chief information officer i think walt when we look at our china demand what we saw in the second half of 2018 was a step down in demand if you look at our order rates we had pretty strong orders in the first half we saw a decrease in demand in the second half and it s been stable at that lower level so if you looked at order since that drop in demand it s been pretty stable so we re going to see a difficult comparison in the first half of 19 and then we ll see a little bit of certainly in the orders we ll see a better comparison in the second half because we really haven t seen any further deterioration but there was a step down in demand walter liptak seaport global analyst okay good that helps and then just going back to the capital allocation question and m a with potentially a new ceo coming in you re a little bit more careful about m a and maybe size of the m a or number of deals and then you mentioned there s no buyback that s in your in your guidance i wonder if you could refresh us on how much share repurchase authorization you have left the timeframe remaining on it and buyback versus m a given the upcoming ceo change mark gliebe chief executive officer thanks walt we ll have rob rehard address the buyback first rob rehard vice president chief financial officer yes so what we have about 200 million on our buyback authorized on authorization at this time so that s what was remaining we had we had a new authorization in place in 2018 that 250 million we moved that down to about 200 million at the end of the year jon avampato vice president chief information officer in terms of any m a transactions we ve as you know over the years this organization has companies done a lot of m a and there is a core group of people here that know how to do it so that wouldn t be the reason we wouldn t do m a just because of the ceo transition so we re operating like there s just every other day so hope that answers your question walt operator well thank you sir at this time we ll go ahead and conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference call back over to mr mark gliebe ceo for any closing remarks sir mark

guest post by simon black what i m about to say may sound totally crazy at first but keep reading because i think you ll agree that it s dead on accurate there s a recession coming no that s not some chicken little the sky is falling statement far from it it s just a fact economies and financial markets always go through boom and bust cycles there are good years and lean years up years and down years this is perhaps no different than life itself few people have the perfect day every day sometimes it feels like we re on top of the world and sometimes it feels like the universe is conspiring against us according to the national bureau of economic research in fact the average length of the good period in which the economy expands during this up down cycle is 56 months that s followed by an average 11 months of economic contraction upon which the whole cycle starts again well it s been ten good years now after the worst crisis since the great depression wiped out trillions of dollars of wealth around the world most developed economies hit bottom in march 2009 and then started slowly inching their way forward again so that s technically 119 months of economic expansion which means the world is way overdue for a significant correction even if you ignore economic history there are signs everywhere nearly every major asset class around the world stocks bonds real estate etc is selling near an all time high and being priced at levels that just don t make sense the us stock market s price to earnings ratio for example which is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of a company s profit has rarely been higher other stock market ratios like price to revenue price to book cyclically adjusted price earnings have rarely been higher even warren buffett s preferred metric which measures the value of the entire stock market relative to the size of the economy has only been this high one other time in history just before the dot com bubble burst in 2000 just about any way you slice it the stock market is overvalued it s the same with bonds whose values rise when interest rates are low well interest rates were literally at their lowest levels in 5 000 years of human history for most of the last decade and even though rates have risen a bit in the last 2 3 years there are still trillions of dollars worth of bonds in the world that have negative yields companies whose finances are sinking faster than virginia governor ralph northam s approval ratings are still able to borrow billions of dollars at practically nothing percent even bankrupt governments are able to borrow money at unbelievable terms argentina notably borrowed billions of dollars back in 2017 by issuing a one hundred year bond bear in mind that the country had defaulted several times just in the previous few decades but countless investors with their goldfish memories still lined up and there was far more demand for the bond than argentina s government could accommodate amazingly enough just one year later the government was already having trouble making interest payments and had to request an imf bailout who could have possibly seen that coming over in the land of the free the average checking account now pays just 0 06 interest while the rate of inflation is hovering around 2 this means that anyone who tries to be responsible and save money for the future is worse off after adjusting for inflation not that anyone has any savings anyhow according to federal reserve data the median bank balance in the us is barely 3 000 while a recent survey from bankrate showed that 23 of americans have almost no savings at all meanwhile debt levels continue to rise government debt is at an all time high around the world led by the us government s prodigious 22 trillion debt far larger than the size of the entire us economy corporate debt is at an all time high student debt is at an all time high consumer debt is at an all time high mortgage debt is also at an all time high now totaling 15 3 trillion and that s because property prices have hit another all time high housing affordability meanwhile is at its lowest point in a decade you get the idea just about everything is overheated and the economy is overdue for a big correction this economic correction is inevitable it s only a question of when this year next year this is what concerns me you may remember that the last financial crisis in 2008 hit just two months before the national election in the united states the economy instantly became the only election issue that mattered it s entirely possible that this will happen a big recession and market correction hits just before the 2020 election catapulting a legion of socialists into office bear in mind that an economic crisis is like any other crisis an opportunity for politicians to capitalize on people s fear to pass dangerously ambitious legislation that wouldn t stand a chance under normal circumstances think back to 9 11 people were so panicked and terrified that they didn t notice or care that the government passed orwellian legislation like the usa patriot act well this time around there are already countless socialists clamoring for 70 tax rates wealth taxes etc and if they re swept into office by a major economic crisis they ll have free reign to pass their entire agenda higher taxes nationalized healthcare debilitating business regulations etc this is a very real possibility we re overdue for a recession and the socialist are already waiting in the wings to seize power it s strange to say but i m hoping that a recession starts soon if there s a recession this year instead of next then it would likely be over before it becomes a major election issue but as we used to say in the military hope is not a course of action and that s why i m preparing for what i think will be the greatest redistribution of wealth in modern history it is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site

by pauline hurungudo the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz has given its clearest hint to date that the country is slowly re dollarising after upgrading the real time gross settlement rtgs platform to include the united states dollar usd to facilitate settlement of the usd nostro foreign currency account fca transactions this comes just four months after the central bank ordered commercial banks to separate bond note accounts from those holding foreign currency balances the multiple currency system has remained a janus faced debacle that has perpetuated the double edged sword of a three tier pricing system in the country under the phenomenon called three tier pricing retailers charge customers three different prices for goods and services depending on the brand of dollar being used a paper us dollar price another in plastic money or local us dollar denominated bank deposits transferable by debit card and the last price in terms of relatively paper money called bond notes under three tier pricing those who pay with us dollars get the lowest price while anyone who pays with plastic money faces the highest price in the last few weeks scores of companies have been shutting down due to currency distortions as government insists on maintaining the multiple currency system at a 1 1 us dollar to bond note ratio but last week the central bank relaxed exchange controls by allowing financial institutions to electronically exchange transactions in the us dollar nostro fca accounts we advise that the rtgs platform has been upgraded to include the united states dollar to facilitate settlement of the usd nostro fca transactions rbz financial markets division national payment systems deputy director josephat mutepfa said in a statement the function is now available in the test environment for the testing by participating institutions all participants are urged to send test messages end to end to ensure full cycle of the transaction is completed results of the test should be logged immediately on the attached user acceptance testing form and submitted to the reserve bank on a daily basis until friday 1 february 2019 it is expected that the settlement of usd transactions will commence soon thereafter in the live environment economic analysts said this was a positive move set to promote ease of business although it will eventually officialise a two tier pricing system deliberately or inadvertently what finance minister mthuli ncube has done is to create or perhaps entrench a mechanism for dual pricing in zimbabwe analyst farai mutambanengwe said the moment this system goes live pretty much everyone will have a nostro account and will quote two prices an rtgs price and a usd price depending on how one is to pay this is already happening as we all know but for exporters they were not fully able to exploit this as their funds were mostly stuck in bank accounts going forward however they will now be able to pay other local suppliers in usd obviously at a discount to rtgs price depending on market conditions renowned local economist kipson gundani said because the monetary policy statement is imminent there will likely be the eventual relaxation of the 1 1 ratio in the multicurrency system given that nostro fcas are exempted from the 2 percent tax it s most likely that most people will shun rtgs and go for nostro rtgs that means re dollarisation which i think is not the best way for zimbabwe given all the troubles of a dollarised economy he said referring to the 2percent tax on mobile and card payments and bank transfers above 10 introduced last october but with exceptions for foreign payments and transfer of government funds this is indeed a dual currency economy and official two tier pricing a more distorted economy it s a tricky situation he said carren pindiriri echoed this saying fca accounts can transact using transfers from one fca to the other but rtgs in foreign currency requires backing maybe the central has generated enough resources to support rtgs in foreign currency pindiriri said dailynews
it has been a close run thing for the global economy over the last two months a 17 per cent collapse in chinese non commodity imports in december with a nosedive in electronics and semiconductor trade across asia has been graduating from ominous to potentially dangerous loading mark williams chief asia economist at capital economics said alarm bells have been ringing his proxy measure of chinese gdp growth has dropped to 4 per cent this is an economic slump for china and it has pulled korea japan and parts of europe into a contractionary vortex on some measures industrial production in the eurozone is now deteriorating at its fastest pace since 2009 said capital economics fresh chinese stimulus is in the pipeline beijing s central economic work conference before christmas amounted to policy capitulation by beijing as well signs of stability are emerging for those who squint hard enough says john normand from jp morgan the bank s global manufacturing survey shows that new orders are ticking up again but nothing is yet bankable like it or not mr powell has been forced to err on the side of easy money keeping open the spigot of dollar liquidity for a global system that has racked up us12 trillion of offshore dollar liabilities world debt is 30 percentage points of gdp higher than the pre lehman peak nobody dares put this precarious edifice through a stress test we have got to be very careful there must not be unforced errors said the international monetary fund s top firefighter david lipton mr lipton said in davos that the fed may not be able to repeat the emergency actions that saved the world s financial system on october 2008 specifically it might be constrained from extending swap lines worth up to us1 trillion to fellow central banks this is the vital defence needed stop a chain reaction turning into a global conflagration china s economy remains a primary concern credit bloomberg european and asian banks borrow on the offshore capital markets at maturities as low as three months for worldwide lending in dollars this source of funding can seize up suddenly only the fed has ability to print limitless dollars to plug the gap in such a crisis mr lipton said swaps require a fiscal backstop and therefore the acquiescence of donald trump and us congress would washington agree to an instant bailout of foreign banks in the current climate i wonder whether they will be so willing to extend the swap lines he said former fed chief ben bernanke says the dodd frank act and other measures since 2008 have stripped the fed and us regulators of powers to halt fire sale liquidation in a crisis loading they can no longer rescue individual companies there must be at least five and they must be solvent or lend to non banks or offer blanket guarantees of bank debt and money market funds it took lightning fast action and us1 5 trillion of emergency loans to stop the meltdown in 2008 could the fed again shore up the markets for commercial paper and asset backed securities olivier blanchard from the peterson institute said it required over 850 basis points of rate cuts in the us to fight the great recession directly or synthetically through quantitative easing any such response today is impossible the lesser risk therefore for the fed is to run the economy hot to build up a buffer we have no ability to turn the economy around says martin feldstein president of the us national bureau of economic research when the next recession comes we don t have any strategy to deal with it fiscal deficits are heading for us1 trillion dollars and the debt ratio is already twice as high as a decade ago he said jay powell s hawkish rhetoric in december above all his insistence that qt would continue on autopilot was clearly a mistake david lipton the first deputy managing director of the imf credit bloomberg the question for investors is whether the fed s december error is reversible the fed s shift on qt is a circuit breaker it lifts the future growth rate of the broad m3 money supply through standard quantity theory of money mechanisms something that the new keynesian creditists at the fed have persistently refused to acknowledge fed staff have had a strange blind spot over the flow effects of bond sales they justified qe in the first place as a way to lift asset prices yet implausibly denied that reversing it might have the opposite effect

what is city talk city talk allows marketers to connect directly with our audience by publishing content on cityam com what is the outlook for interest rates in 2019 us concern over the outlook for us interest rates was one of the dominant themes of 2018 especially as the year progressed president trump got involved in the debate tweeting in december that it was incredible that the us federal reserve fed was considering raising interest rates again despite the pressure from the president the fed did raise rates in december as expected to a range of 2 25 2 50 per cent at the same time the fed changed its projections for interest rates in 2019 the us central bank now expects only two further rate rises whereas previously three more were anticipated this is due to lower economic forecasts with the fed revising its 2019 gdp growth forecast down to 2 3 per cent from 2 5 per cent however since that december meeting the fed has grown more cautious schroders chief economist keith wade says it looks increasingly likely that the fed will pause in march the schroders economics team previously forecast two interest rate hikes this year but now expects just one more keith wade explains that better growth should allow one more 25 basis point bps rise in june but thereafter the economy is expected to cool as fiscal stimulus fades consequently we now expect 2 75 per cent to be the peak in 2020 we see us growth slowing further and expect the fed to ease with rate cuts in june and september the table below shows the market implied rate for us interest rates by month in 2019 and suggests the market is not expecting any further us rate rises this is a change from mid 2018 as can be seen from the chart which shows the market s expectations for us rates as of june last year green line compared to the current expectations blue line the forecasts included should not be relied upon are not guaranteed and are provided only as at the date of issue eurozone 1 january 2019 marked 20 years since the introduction of the euro 2019 will also see current european central bank ecb president mario draghi step down with his successor likely to be named after the european parliamentary elections in may in terms of the rate outlook the ecb has said repeatedly that interest rates will remain on hold at least through the summer of 2019 the schroders economics team is forecasting interest rates to rise twice in september and december 2019 which would take the main refinancing rate to 0 5 per cent at the end of the year from 0 0 per cent now and the deposit rate to zero from 0 4 per cent now the main refinancing rate is the interest rate banks pay when they borrow money from the ecb for one week the deposit rate defines the interest banks receive or have to pay in this current era of negative interest rates for depositing money with the ecb overnight the table below shows the market implied rates for the deposit rate as for the us these market implied rates suggest little change to interest rates uk in the uk the outlook for interest rates remains clouded by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding brexit senior european economist and strategist azad zangana says the bank of england boe has consistently stated that its forecast assumes a range of scenarios when incorporating brexit if brexit risks are reduced with an orderly withdrawal then the bank is likely to upgrade its forecasts which would warrant a meaningful interest rate hiking cycle our forecast has the boe raising rates in may 2019 to 1 per cent then another hike at the end of 2019 to 1 25 per cent the uk parliament is now set to vote on the withdrawal agreement if the deal passes then the uk will depart the eu in an orderly fashion with a transition period but if parliament votes against the deal and there is no request by the uk government to delay brexit then the uk could leave the eu on 29 march with no deal and no transition period azad zangana adds the uk s immediate outlook depends on the prime minister being able to sell her deal to parliament and the public failure to do this risks a no deal brexit and a uk recession the table below shows uk rates at 0 91 per cent by year end sixteen basis points higher than the current level this suggests markets think a rate rise is more likely to happen than not but a full rate rise would usually be 25 basis points more clarity on uk rates is likely to emerge as the brexit process progresses read more japan in japan inflation is still far short of the 2 per cent target meaning rate rises are a distant prospect the schroders economics team expects short term japanese interest rates to be kept on hold at 0 1 per cent until late 2020 meanwhile the bank of japan is grappling with the side effects of prolonged monetary policy easing the central bank now owns one half of the japanese government bond market china for china slower global growth and intensifying trade wars could see the central bank ease monetary policy in 2019 the schroders economics team expects the lending rate to fall from 4 35 per cent in 2018 to 4 00 per cent at the end of 2019 emerging markets economist craig botham adds that the reserve requirement ratio is likely to face another 150 basis points in cuts at least from current levels the reserve requirement ratio is a central bank regulation setting the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank cutting the required reserves means more capital is freed up for banks to lend out however there are some factors limiting the chinese central bank s room for manoeuvre botham says we think that monetary policy will be at least partially constrained by fears around excessive currency depreciation historically significant liquidity injections have appeared to be associated with currency weakness
the writer is a cnbc contributor and for eight years served as the network s chief international correspondent current u s china trade negotiations underway this month may yet succeed but the chinese already face a new battle front in washington the world bank david malpass the white house s just announced choice to lead the bank is an outspoken critic of the institution itself and especially of its cozy relationship with the chinese twice already malpass has taken direct aim at the bank s relationship with beijing when testifying in front of congress in his current role as undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs running the bank will give him the ability to implement the reforms to the international lending institution that the trump administration has been seeking malpass 62 worked in the administrations of both ronald reagan and george h w bush advertisement one of those reforms will be to reduce or eliminate world bank lending to china when malpass testified before a house subcommittee on monetary policy in late 2017 he stated that china was the biggest borrower from the bank s lending arm having been granted 2 4 billion in new financing that year for a total exposure of 13 3 billion the loans violated the bank s mandate of lending to countries that are both poor and unable to borrow in the international market two conditions that hardly describe china the loss of a couple of billion dollars per year in aid isn t a lot of money for the people s republic but it would be meaningful to strip china s designation by international institutions as an emerging market it is that very dubious reprieve that gives china special treatment not just at the world bank but also at the world trade organization also of great concern to the chinese is malpass s demand for more transparency when china lends to other countries advertisement china is lending billions by some estimates a trillion dollars to developing countries as part of its belt and road initiative late last year malpass said the loans leave fragile countries with excessive debt and low quality projects share this article share he isn t alone in his criticism around the world there are growing concerns about china s debt trap diplomacy exhibit 1 sri lanka handing over the control of a port after being unable to pay back the loans they took on from china to build the port some critics believe that was china s intent all along closer to home are partially built chinese projects dotting venezuela such as an abandoned rusting bullet train project why should the united states care if a developing country accepts a murky loan with bad terms from china because countries that get in financial trouble due to these nontransparent chinese loans will likely turn to institutions such as the international monetary fund for relief the imf s biggest funding source is the u s taxpayer advertisement for this chain of events look no further than pakistan which is negotiating a financial bailout from the imf after gorging on chinese loans for infrastructure projects of low economic value malpass testified that the very basics of those belt and road loans such as interest rates and terms of maturity are unknown also on the list of u s concerns china does not adhere to legally binding international standards regarding bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions as secretary of state mike pompeo told me in an interview back in july there s no rationale for imf tax dollars and associated with that american dollars that are part of the imf funding for those to go to bail out chinese bondholders or china itself since the bank s outgoing president jim yong kim announced he was stepping down on feb 1 there had been talk that president trump reportedly at the urging of his daughter ivanka might name former pepsi chief executive indra nooyi to lead the bank but with the naming of malpass it is clear the administration sees the world bank as part of its broader campaign against china as a strategic competitor and abuser of international institutions

editor s note mark zandi is chief economist of moody s analytics he was an advisor to john mccain s 2008 presidential campaign and supported hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election the opinions expressed in this commentary are his own president trump frequently touts the strong economy as one of his great achievements and he will likely do so again in his state of the union address tuesday he should take credit while he can sure he inherited an economy moving solidly down the tracks but he is set to leave one that is headed off the rails nearly a year ago trump pushed massive deficit financed tax cuts through the republican congress that temporarily juiced up the economy but they came at a steep cost businesses and wealthy households received a windfall but the treasury had to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from global investors to cut the checks growth now as the stimulus wears off has slowed to where it was prior to the tax cut trump s argument that the corporate tax cuts would incent businesses to invest more and support sustainably stronger long term growth looks more and more like a pipe dream corporations effective tax rate the taxes they pay as a percent of their profits was cut in half to an all time low but has yet to unleash more investment the president also argued that the tax cuts would pay for themselves not even close tax revenues are plunging and the nation s budget deficit is ballooning according to the congressional budget office the nonpartisan government agency that does the bean counting if we don t take a u turn on the president s tax and spending policies our collective finances will end in a train wreck trump s trade war is also corrosive on the economy higher tariffs have cut into corporate profits general motors warned last summer that tariffs on imported cars and parts could force the company to cut jobs in november it announced plans to close four us plants and cut thousands of jobs businesses are nervous unsure of whether the president s next move is to lower the tariffs or raise them that s another reason business investment has flat lined the rest of the global economy is also suffering fallout from the trade war which is blowing back on us just ask apple and other technology companies about their overseas sales yet the president has nothing to show for all the trade drama consider the deal he struck with canada and mexico late last year the united states mexico canada agreement which made nothing more than a few tweaks to the existing north american free trade agreement or last summer s handshake deal with the european union that has to date led to no meaningful change in our trade relationship with the eu trade negotiations with china appear headed to the same end that is after a lot of chest thumping president trump will ultimately agree to a face saving largely inconsequential trade deal with the chinese getting china to play fairly in the global economy and stop its bad behavior over intellectual property rights forced technology transfer market access and cyber espionage will have to wait for another day and another approach immigration reform will surely come up during president trump s address but his immigration policy is economically wrong headed us businesses say their biggest problem is finding qualified workers and with the large baby boom generation set to retire over the next decade this will be a perennial problem our farmers hotel and restaurant owners and transportation and construction companies are struggling to fill a record number of job openings if the president wants to build a border wall between the united states and mexico he will probably need to hire mexicans to build it our nation s comparative economic advantage is that we innovate and we do so in significant part because we have historically welcomed new people and their fresh ideas we need more immigrants not fewer the president s only chance of fulfilling his campaign promise of sustainably stronger economic growth is to open his arms to more immigrants the president s disregard for rules think tariffs and organizations think world trade organization that for generations have powered enormous gains in our economy will end up doing the most economic damage indeed we wrote the rules and built the organizations they worked for us because the rest of the world trusted that we would still follow them even if it wasn t completely convenient for us to do so correction an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that gm pointed to tariffs when it announced layoffs in fact it had separately warned that tariffs could hurt company profits

in 2019 perrysburg ohio february 5 2019 owens illinois inc nyse oi today reported financial results for the full year and fourth quarter ended dec 31 2018 in line with our guidance the company delivered solid financial performance in 2018 demonstrating growing resilience in overcoming currency and inflationary headwinds said andres lopez ceo we continue to progress in our ability to deliver while also investing to support future shareholder value creation throughout 2018 europe s focus on the top line sales mix management and premium products and the benefits of total system cost efforts drove higher profits and strong margin expansion over the course of the year the americas team responded to several unplanned headwinds and the stronger u s dollar by growing sales volume outside the u s and reducing structural costs across the region asia pacific completed its 2018 asset advancement program and exited the year with a strong margin as expected given favorable market trends ascribable growth opportunities and continued structural cost reductions the company expects higher earnings and cash flow generation in 2019 consistent with our investor day commitments said lopez highlights for the full year 2018 the company recorded earnings from continuing operations of 0 89 per share diluted compared with 1 11 per share in 2017 earnings in both periods included items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations in 2018 these items exceeded those recorded in 2017 contributing to the year over year decline in earnings from continuing operations excluding certain items management considers not representative of ongoing operations adjusted earnings were 2 72 per share compared with the prior year of 2 65 per share cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2018 was 793 million compared with 724 million for 2017 adjusted free cash flow 1 for 2018 was 362 million net sales were 6 9 billion which is up slightly compared with 2017 higher prices largely reflecting cost inflation were partially offset by lower volumes and currency translation total glass container shipments decreased nearly 2 percent on a global basis driven by the transfer of production to the company s joint venture with constellation brands ongoing trends in u s beer and discrete events such as the brazil transportation strike and capacity constraints in both the americas and europe the company s joint venture with constellation brands inc continues to perform well again delivering higher sales compared with prior year driven in part by the fourth furnace that ramped up early in 2018 the fifth furnace is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were 277 million the 2 million increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by higher segment operating profit 1 segment operating profit for 2018 was 945 million a slight increase from 2017 higher segment operating profit in europe more than offset the decline in the other regions in november 2018 the company acquired a 49 7 percent interest in empresas comegua s a the leading manufacturer of glass containers for the central american and caribbean markets for approximately 119 million at investor day 2018 the company announced its intention to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders and increase its share repurchase program the first dividend of 0 05 per share will be paid on february 12 2019 to shareholders of record on the close of business on january 22 2019 further over the next three years the company expects to utilize the approximately 550 million in repurchase authority remaining as of year end 2018 in 2019 the company expects to deliver higher earnings from continuing operations with higher segment operating profit partially offset by non operational items earnings from continuing operations and adjusted earnings are expected to be approximately 3 00 per share which compares favorably with results in 2018 cash provided by continuing operating activities is expected to be approximately 740 million whereas adjusted free cash flow for the year 2019 is expected to be approximately 400 million full year 2018 results full year net sales were 6 9 billion an increase of 8 million from prior year prices were 2 percent higher on a global basis mainly due to favorable sales mix and ongoing cost inflation total glass container shipments decreased nearly 2 percent on a global basis driven by the transfer of production to the company s joint venture with constellation brands ongoing trends in u s beer and discrete events and capacity constraints in both the americas and europe the company s joint venture with constellation brands inc continues to perform well again delivering higher sales compared with prior year driven in part by the fourth furnace that ramped up early in 2018 the fifth furnace is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 segment operating profit was 945 million in 2018 compared with 942 million in the prior year in europe segment operating profit was 316 million an improvement of 53 million over the prior year or 20 percent the region benefited from improvements in total system cost resulting in lower operating costs compared to the prior year glass container shipments in 2018 were down less than 1 percent compared with 2017 this decline was offset by the change in sales mix a favorable pricing environment and the effects of foreign currency americas segment operating profit was 585 million a decrease of 29 million compared with 2017 total glass container shipments in the region were down nearly 3 percent in 2018 compared to the prior year with higher shipments to food customers offset by lower shipments to alcoholic beverage customers despite capacity constraints year over year shipments in brazil were also strong in 2018 in the u s solid year over year growth in shipments to food customers in 2018 were more than offset by a decline in shipments to alcoholic beverage customers owing to the ongoing trends in beer shipments and the transfer of beer production to the company s joint venture with constellation brands segment operating profit was impacted by higher operating costs in 2018 compared with prior year driven by cost inflation the brazil transportation strike a now resolved raw material batch disruption at a plant in mexico and higher transportation costs due to freight rate inflation asia pacific reported segment operating profit of 44 million which was 21 million below the prior year glass container shipments in 2018 were down nearly 3 percent compared to 2017 as expected the now completed incremental asset improvement projects in the region drove operating costs higher year over year retained corporate and other costs were 106 million in 2018 compared with 104 million for 2017 planned increased investments in research and development supporting the new magma technology were offset by lower selling and administrative expenses the company continues to actively manage its debt structure to mitigate financial risk lower interest expense and reduce complexity net interest expense was essentially in line with prior year while variable interest rates have been rising in the u s the company benefited from lower pricing under its bank credit agreement and its exposure to variable rates in europe which have been largely stable in 2018 the company entered into a new 1 91 billion senior secured credit facility with a final maturity date of june 2023 at investor day 2018

for the year 2018 the company s comprehensive legal review of its asbestos related liabilities resulted in a 125 million charge due in part to factors such as changes in the law and litigation dynamics in specific jurisdictions as mentioned at investor day 2018 the company is executing on a risk mitigation strategy this is expected to drive average annual cash payments of 150 million for 2019 and 2020 in 2021 the company projects cash payments of 60 to 80 million and a year end total estimated asbestos related accrual of not more than 250 million consistent with overall targets conveyed at investor day 2018 fourth quarter 2018 results net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 1 6 billion down compared to the prior year fourth quarter the decline in sales was driven by

information visit o i com non gaap financial measures the company uses certain non gaap financial measures which are measures of its historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules management believes that its presentation and use of certain non gaap financial measures including adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share segment operating profit segment operating profit margin and adjusted free cash flow provide relevant and useful supplemental financial information which is widely used by analysts and investors as well as by management in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance these non gaap measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measures and should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or be construed as being more important than comparable gaap measures adjusted earnings relates to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations because such items are not reflective of the company s principal business activity which is glass container production adjusted earnings are divided by weighted average shares outstanding diluted to derive adjusted earnings per share segment operating profit relates to earnings from continuing operations before interest expense net and before income taxes and is also exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate cost segment operating profit margin is segment operating profit divided by segment net sales management uses adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin to evaluate its period over period operating performance because it believes this provides a useful supplemental measure of the results of operations of its principal business activity by excluding items that are not reflective of such operations adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin may be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of the company s business as these measures eliminate items that are not reflective of its principal business activity further adjusted free cash flow relates to cash provided by continuing operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment plus asbestos related payments management uses adjusted free cash flow to evaluate its period over period cash generation performance because it believes this provides a useful supplemental measure related to its principal business activity adjusted free cash flow may be useful to investors to assist in understanding the comparability of cash flows generated by the company s principal business activity since a significant majority of the company s asbestos related claims are expected to be received in the next five to seven years adjusted free cash flow may help investors to evaluate the long term cash generation ability of the company s principal business activity as these asbestos related payments decline it should not be inferred that the entire adjusted free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures since the company has mandatory debt service requirements and other non discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure management uses non gaap information principally for internal reporting forecasting budgeting and calculating compensation payments the company routinely posts important information on its website www o i com forward looking statements this document contains

2018 was a year of solid operational execution at simpson we achieved consolidated full year net sales of approximately 1 1 billion an increase of 10 from 997 million in 2017 due to increases in both sales volumes and average unit prices this combined with our focus on cost cutting initiatives resulted in our full year of 2018 operating income of 176 2 million increased 28 compared to the prior year period advertisement advertisement net income increased by 40 to 129 5 million and reproduced strong earnings of 2 78 per diluted share an increase of 43 year over year throughout 2018 we repurchased 111 1 million of our common stock a record for simpson reflecting our continued confidence in the strength and outlook for our business these results represent solid progress toward our key financial targets under the 2020 plan which we announced in the third quarter of 2017 with the goal of maximizing operating efficiencies and driving long term shareholder value today i m pleased to confirm we remain focused on achieving these aggressive targets these include achieving an organic net sales compounded annual growth rate of 8 reducing our total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales to the 26 to 27 range to result in an operating income margin of approximately 21 to 22 doubling our inventory turn rates and improving our return on invested capital for a range of 17 to 18 as part of our 2020 plan announcement we also provided specific benchmark to achieve in fiscal 2018 these included operating expenses as a percent of net sales in the mid 29 range which we adjusted mid year to be the mid 28 range our gross profit margin between 38 to 39 for our concrete business and the european operating income margin of approximately 5 excluding our sap severance and goodwill impairment in relationship to the 2018 goals we achieved the following an operating expense as a percent of net sales of 28 6 an impressive 270 basis point improvement year over year concrete gross margin profit of 37 or slightly below our target this reflects a significant improvement of 240 basis points year over year we remain very pleased with the direction of our new concrete strategy that we began implementing in 2017 with a focus on more profitable products and market advertisement advertisement europe operating income margin of approximately 4 5 excluding one time items this was slightly below our target and we are currently reviewing additional opportunities and levers to improve europe s bottom line in 2019 our team worked hard to execute against these goals and the commitment from all of our employees to achieve our 2020 targets is a testament to the strong company culture we have here at simpson i d like to acknowledge and thank all employees for their hard work and dedication i d now like to take a few minutes to discuss some highlights from our fourth quarter financial results before providing an update on operational initiatives fourth quarter net sales increased 4 year over year to 241 8 million primarily due to increases in our average selling prices sales volumes in the fourth quarter was down on a year over year basis as a result of softer u s housing starts and the timing of project based sales in europe u s housing starts which are a leading indicator for approximately 60 of our business were softer in the fourth quarter versus the comparable period last year including in the western and southern regions of the us where we provide meaningful amount of content into those homes due to stricter building design requirements from wind and earthquake concerns we believe demand may have been impacted by uncertainty in regard to economic factors given the extreme market volatility and the client experience in december we acknowledge there is a hesitation in the market attributed to unpredictable economic conditions labor shortages and the potential for rise in interest rate that said there are many underlying factors to support healthy u s housing starts including strong consumer confidence extremely low unemployment rates and low level of housing stock availability looking ahead we expect demand to remain relatively stable demand in january was strong a further indication that december buying patterns may have been postponed due to the short term uncertainty over the long term we remain cautiously optimistic that the u s housing starts will increase at an annual mid single digit rate over the next few years our fourth quarter gross profit dollars were pressured by a combination of increased battery material and labor costs as well as one time impacts related to inventory reduction initiatives this resulted in a fourth quarter gross profit margin of 40 7 and ultimately impacted our full year gross profit margin of 44 5 versus our projection of between 45 5 to 46 brian will discuss this in more detail shortly advertisement advertisement while our full year gross profit margin came in below our expectation it is important to reiterate that our gross profit margin remains one of the highest in the industry much of this is attributed to our long standing trusted brand reputation which is built through proprietary testing capabilities deep industry relationships and superior customer service now i d like to provide an update on our key operating initiatives which focus on rationalizing our cost structure to drive improved profitability growing our market share and improving our technology and infrastructure to provide best in class service to our customers for years to come in regards to growing our market share the introduction of our mechanical anchor products into the home depot stores continues to progress throughout much of 2018 the roll out occurred at a slower pace than our original expectations due to space constraints at the home depot stores our mechanical anchor products were set in 91 home depot stores in 2018 bringing the total number to 373 home depot locations currently home depot has identified an additional 400 stores that we expect will be set by the end of the second quarter we continue to anticipate the full roll out into all 1 900 stores to be accomplished by the end of 2020 representing a 30 million annualized revenue opportunity once complete in europe the roll out of the complete line of gbo fastener products into the nordic region and france is progressing on plan and we continue to track in line with expectations as it relates to increasing our presence in wood connectors in the nordic area advertisement advertisement now moving to operational updates in an effort to rightsize our product offerings we have developed a three phase sku reduction program phase 1 was completed at the end of 2017 and involved eliminating approximately 10 000 non moving skus from our erp system throughout the course of 2018 we focused on phase 2 of this program which involves the identification and removal of over 2 500 slow moving skus i m pleased to report that this phase was completed at the end of 2018 and we have successfully converted all customers over to other products in our line at the start of 2019 we began focusing on the final phase which involves a further reduction of our skus we believe our newly implemented sap system as well as our learnings from our continued partnership with our external lean consultant will enable us to improve our management of inventory and purchasing practices our goal is an additional reduction of our product offering by approximately 25 by the end of 2020 while we continue to focus on improving our inventory turns we are subject to fluctuating raw material pricing and tariff uncertainties in the marketplace which are areas out of our business that we cannot control as of december 31 2018 our inventory balance was approximately 276 million an increase of 23 million or 9 year over year as a result of increase in steel prices along with duties and tariffs on our finished goods from china in the third quarter of 2018 we built our raw material position in an effort to mitigate the impact of steel price increases and availability currently we believe steel prices will remain stable in the first quarter of 2019 and we will continue to be cautious about our steel inventory advertisement advertisement during 2018 we worked with the management consultants to uncover additional areas to enhance our overall efficiencies based on their findings we had implemented programs to improve our operating expenses and working capital and will incur some success based fees in 2019 based on the benefits that we receive we are pleased with the outcome of this partnership and look forward to realizing these efficiencies from the findings on a go forward basis in 2019 our consultant activity will focus primarily on additional lean initiative our sap implementation continues on track toward our companywide implementation goal for completion in 2021 we remain focused on rolling out sap technology in our remaining u s branches which we expect will take until early 2020 to complete in summary i m very pleased with our 2018 results and operational execution looking ahead we are cautiously optimistic housing starts will remain at a healthy level we are pleased with the solid demand we experienced in january and we are monitoring the more severe weather conditions we are currently experiencing compared to the year ago period which was unusually dry and a warmer winter we remain committed to executing against our 2020 plan and focusing on the areas of our business that we can control to ensure long term sustainable growth enhanced operating leverage and profitability with a goal of continuing to return capital to our valued shareholders through share repurchase and dividends i d now like to turn the call over to brian who will discuss our fourth quarter financials in detail advertisement advertisement brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary thank you karen and good afternoon everyone i m pleased to discuss our fourth quarter financial results with you today our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 241 8 million up 4 compared to 231 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within the north america segment net sales increased 7 year over year to 204 7 million primarily due to increases in average net sales unit prices in europe net sales decreased 9 year over year to 34 9 million europe net sales were impacted by reduced sales volumes in our concrete business as we experienced strong demand for asphalt paving products in 2017 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2018 at the same level europe net sales were also negatively affected by approximately 1 3 million in foreign currency translation primarily related to the weakening of local currencies against the united states dollar wood construction products represented 84 of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 concrete construction products represented 16 of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 advertisement advertisement our fourth quarter consolidated gross profit decreased approximately 3 or 3 5 million to 98 4 million from 101 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a consolidated gross profit margin of 40 7 as karen highlighted the year over year decline was primarily due to increased factory and overhead costs on lower production higher material costs including higher price steel and higher labor costs resulting from tightening labor market condition on a per segment basis our gross profit margin in north america was 42 3 compared to 46 2 in the prior year quarter in europe our fourth quarter gross profit margin was 31 7 compared to 34 in the year ago period our europe gross margins were pressured by a year over decrease in concrete sales which in europe have higher margins than wood from a product perspective our fourth quarter gross profit margin on wood products was 41 3 compared to 43 8 in the prior year quarter and was 31 4 for concrete products compared to 35 9 in the prior year quarter now turning to our fourth quarter costs and operating expenses as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cost structure consolidated research and development and engineering expenses for the fourth quarter declined 19 year over year to 10 2 million primarily due to decreased personnel costs and severance expenses consolidated selling expenses for the quarter decreased 9 year over year to 26 3 million primarily due to decreases in personnel and advertising costs which were partially offset by increases in sales commissions and depreciation expense on a segment basis compared to the prior year quarter selling expenses in north america were flat and in europe they declined by 35 general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter increased 14 year over year to 41 3 million primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees associated with the sap project and management consultants as well as increased it related costs these were partly offset by decreases in severance expense and personnel costs on a segment level general and administrative expenses in north america segment increased by 3 million compared to the prior year quarter in europe g a increased by slightly less than 0 5 million year over year we remain committed to reducing our total operating expense dollars as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 32 down 130 basis points from the prior year quarter our consolidated income from operations for the fourth quarter decreased 7 year over year to 22 7 million compared to 24 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in north america income from operations decreased 14 year over year to 18 9 million in europe loss from operations was 8 8 million compared to a loss of 3 3 million in the prior year period primarily due to a 6 7 million goodwill impairment charge excluding the goodwill impairment europe s loss from operations would have been approximately 2 1 million as a result our operating income margin of 9 on a consolidated basis declined by approximately 110 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 our effective tax rate decreased to 28 7 from 45 3 in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the u s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 our consolidated net income for the fourth quarter was 15 6 million or 0 34 per fully diluted share compared to net income of 13 1 million or 0 27 per fully diluted share in the prior year quarter consolidated net income for the fourth quarter included the impact of 6 5 million after tax gain on the sale of real estate consolidated net income was also impacted by the aforementioned 6 7 million goodwill impairment charge in our europe segment which had no tax benefit now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow at december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents totaled 160 2 million a decrease of 8 3 million compared to december 31 2017 our inventory levels as of december 31 2018 were up by approximately 23 million compared to the same period last year as we inventoried higher priced raw material compared to last year we remained debt free with only a small portion of capital leases amounting to 3 4 million as a result of our strong sales and focus on working capital management we generated approximately 160 million in cash flow from operations during 2018 an increase of nearly 41 million or 34 year over year capital expenditures were approximately 5 4 million for the quarter which included 800 000 of capitalized costs related to the sap project compared to 12 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 capital expenditures were approximately 30 million in line with our expectation we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50 of our cash flow from operations to our valued stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends on an annual basis we paid approximately 39 9 million in cash dividends during 2018 including 10 1 million in the fourth quarter over the past three years we have returned over 90 of our cash flow from operations to stockholders on january 28 2019 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 22 per share the dividend will be payable on april 25 2019 to the company s shareholders of record as of april 4 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 we repurchased 970 093 shares of our common stock at an average price of 62 93 per share for a total of 61 million in total for the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased and received 1 77 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 62 69 per share for a total of 111 1 million we also received a 182 000 shares of common stock as the final delivery of a 50 million share accelerated share repurchase program initiated in december 2017 as of december 31 2018 we had repurchased approximately 234 6 million in shares under our 275 million share repurchase authorization which expired at the end of 2018 in december 2018 our board of directors authorized a new 100 million share repurchase authorization which will remain in effect through the end of 2019 given our confidence in our business and our expectation that the 2020 plan will drive improved operational performance we plan to continue to purchase additional shares of our stock before we turn it over to questions i d like to discuss our 2019 outlook for the full year of 2019 we are initiating guidance as follows we expect our consolidated gross profit margin to be in the 44 5 to 45 5 range given our expectation on housing starts the effective tax rate to be in the range of 25 to 27 including both federal and state income taxes depreciation and amortization expense be in the range of 39 million to 41 million of which 33 million to 35 million is pure depreciation and capital expenditures to be in the range of 30 million to 35 million including approximately 25 of maintenance type capex in summary we made meaningful progress in 2018 and i d like to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication we remain confident in the long term value proposition of our business and look forward to updating our shareholders as we continue to execute against our strategic operational and financial initiatives thank you for your time and attention today we d now like to open up the call for questions operator questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of tim wojs with robert w baird company please proceed with your question timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst good afternoon everybody karen colonias president chief executive officer hi tim brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary hi tim timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst i guess my first question maybe just could you elaborate just a little bit on what you re what you think a stable growth means just should we expect the rate to be kind of stable with q4 levels kind of stable with 2018 levels i m just trying to kind of understand how the volume cadence kind of played out through the quarter and kind of what those volume numbers look like in january more explicitly please karen colonias president chief executive officer yes tim i think we are still thinking that the housing starts are going to be in again low to mid single digits we would again continue to reiterate when you look at our business is very cyclical very common for fourth and first quarter to be lower volume numbers and second and third quarter to be actually our largest numbers so we had a december that was pretty low on a volume standpoint as we ve mentioned we ve seen it come back in january not only from just the price increase but also we have seen organic volume growth in january so little early to tell what the year will look like since we re in the first quarter and that s always a tough one depending on what weather conditions are but we re anticipating again that mid to single digit growth on housing starts timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst okay and would you expect that to maybe be weighted toward more toward the second half kind of q2 i m just trying to think through how you would expect that to kind of play out because it actually may start a little down here in the first quarter karen colonias president chief executive officer yes i mean again just based on weather conditions and what historically we have seen from our growth cycle second and third quarter are always our largest periods of growth timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst okay and then when we think about just kind of gross margins and some of the modest improvement areas you re expecting through the year is there any sort of kind of cadence to kind of keep in mind on a quarterly basis i mean will your production levels be down at all maybe in the first half if you need the right size and sort of inventory or just trying to think of i know the gross margins were a little stronger in the first half of the first three quarters of the year and obviously a little weaker in the fourth quarter so just how should we think about gross margins as we go through the year brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary hi tim it s brian i would expect that as we have greater selling activity in the to support customers for the busier building season we absorb more overhead during those periods so of course second and third quarter typically traditionally are a little bit better and the gross margin all things being equal than first or fourth again from factory absorption perspective we ve noted that it s a tight labor market and we re seeing that impact on our gross margin there particularly in the fourth quarter that was one of the elements there but as we look at 2019 we would expect second and third quarter to be a little bit better than first and fourth again just from a volume perspective timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst okay and then i know you kind of reiterated the sg a target for the 2020 plan do you have anything kind of explicitly that you re targeting for sg a whether it s growth or as a percentage of sales for 2019 at all brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary it s brian again so we would expect sg a that all the elements of those to be approximately 27 5 to 28 5 of net revenues for 2019 timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst okay so just kind of gliding toward that 26 to 27 okay and then just the last question do you have any in the gross margin guidance do you have any benefit from just kind of the moderation that we ve seen in steel incorporated into that range brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary not necessarily i mean the way we re thinking about that is as we mentioned in the third quarter we due to availability we increased our raw materials raw material and we ll need to sell through that so that guidance that we ve given is estimating that it will take us a while to work through current on hand raw material and then of course we ll be back in the market buying more throughout the course of the year i d say it s a little early yet right now to specifically comment on your question there but how we are looking at 2019 and that gross margin range is taking into account now that growth that karen had noted in addition to our current on hand inventories timothy wojs robert w baird co analyst okay okay great i ll hop back in queue good luck on 19 karen colonias president chief executive officer thanks tim brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary thanks tim operator our next question comes from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities please proceed with your question daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst good afternoon karen good afternoon brian thanks for taking the question karen colonias president chief executive officer good afternoon brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary good afternoon daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst wanted to try to drill down a little bit and get a little bit more granularity on gross margin in q4 specifically north america if we look at the roughly 400 basis point decline year over year can you give is there any way to give a little bit more specifics in terms of impact of factory overhead and lower production and just absorption number one number two raw material warehouse costs number three labor if not to the basis point maybe just kind of rank order so we get a little bit better sense of those moving parts brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary sure dan this is brian i would say that the factory and tooling ph as a percent of revenue was the highest so as we think about spend and absorption of that spend so spend was up and so with increased dollars and the volumes being what it was that would have the biggest impact i d say material would be next again as a percent of revenue followed by direct labor and then our shipping and warehouse costs daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst got it very helpful and this maybe piggybacking on the last question but as we think about the guidance do you think it s reasonable to get back toward that lower end of your full year guidance range for q1 or is that more of a ramp as we get into the year given seasonality and maybe some of the weather related softness that you described brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary dan i would say that it a the year amount that we ve the year estimate that we ve put out there we ve not specifically broken out the individual quarters but as i mentioned earlier the first quarter s typically aren t going to be as good as the first quarter wouldn t be as good as q2 or q3 and then again moderating on q4 but we re looking at the annual for that range and haven t put out a q1 gross margin guidance daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst got it and then lastly the revenue drop that we that you experienced in december obviously well documented kind of soft passion in anything housing related but what have you heard from your customers in terms of explanations do you see them pulling back on inventory materially any sense for where they are in terms of the inventory levels any kind of color around that would be great karen colonias president chief executive officer yes dan this is karen tough for us to tell exactly from our customers on an inventory standpoint and as you know we can get products to our customers in 24 to 48 hour timeframe so if they chose to pull back a little bit on inventory they certainly know that we would be able to support them in january and maybe that s a part of what we re seeing but again because we are not engaged in their inventory it s real tough to get very precise on that i think just a lot of the economic uncertainty that we saw especially in the november december timeframe seems like it impacted all the building industry and we were certainly a part of that also daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst got it thanks well i ll jump back in queue if i have any follow ups thank you karen colonias president chief executive officer thanks brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary thanks dan operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of steve chercover with d a davidson please proceed with your question steven chercover d a davidson co analyst thank you and forgive me i was a little distracted on the call but could you give us any geographic locations where the housing activity really fell off in q4 or in december as you said karen colonias president chief executive officer yes steve that s interesting question as you know the housing starts are the numbers are not out because of government shutdown so we still don t have the december housing numbers so that s one thing that doesn t give us a good indication the other thing i would just say from the standpoint of what we re seeing in the weather certainly in the western states we re having a pretty significant winter this year and that definitely started somewhere in the november december timeframe so we don t have anything specific on it and we ll have a little bit better information once that starts numbers come out but it s really hard for us to really delineate anything specific in those regions again we re kind of assuming what appears to be a normal fourth quarter first quarter slowdown steven chercover d a davidson co analyst but to be fair you don t really need the housing statistics from the government to know where you traditionally sell so i mean did you see it in florida did you see it in california karen colonias president chief executive officer yes i mean again as i mentioned we saw what would be our normalized slowdown that we would see in that fourth quarter timeframe and that s really a function of when weather hits brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary yes i would think steve it s brian i would think that we should see some softness in the west housing starts and the south based on internal figures that we have here so really interesting once those come out see how the census bureau start correlate but i would say that should be again a west and south issue steven chercover d a davidson co analyst okay and the 8 organic growth that s embedded in your 2020 plan do you expect to see that this year or did the late 2018 powers ph give you concerns that might not materialize in fy 19 and i recognize you said things it s now back in january karen colonias president chief executive officer yes as we look at our 2020 plan again that s a 8 compound annual growth rate starting in 2016 and continuing through the end of 2020 we are tracking very nicely on that particular metric again as we ve talked about there s other elements that we re working on from that growth standpoint the mechanical anchor line that we re looking to introduce in home depot that s really tied to our housing start number the work that we re doing in europe to rollout our fastener line in western europe and then our connector line in the nordics so we have some elements definitely about 8 cagr that are not associated just with the housing start number steven chercover d a davidson co analyst okay and then finally since i m not invited or i don t intend but there s a big housing show i believe in las vegas every year i think it s coming up and i m just wondering if you have any new initiatives to propel the trust offering that will be more prominent this year than in years past karen colonias president chief executive officer yes so the las vegas show that s international builders show that s coming up in brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary two weeks karen colonias president chief executive officer two weeks i think in los vegas that s not really the show where we showcase our truss software that happens at the component manufacturing show and that one s in october at the builders show again we tend to showcase any new products that we have whether they re be in our fastener line our carbon fiber or connectors but that s not really a emphasis on the truss software that s again that was done in october that was a very successful show that we just had in october with building components showed our product our truss offering our software to significant number of component manufacturers and are getting some good results of those that are interested in converting to our program in the next few months steven chercover d a davidson co analyst okay and i guess final question forgive me love to see the repo i think it s a great message to the to send the shareholders and a good discipline to return significant part of your excess cash has there been any thought given to inserting more nuance into how you actually do it i mean my bet there as your stock might be a bit weak tomorrow is it kind of on autopilot or are you trying to get more dialed in as you come deeper into this initiative after several years brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary steve it s brian so on that i would say that we ve used a couple of mechanisms to do share repurchases we used accelerated share repurchases we ve used 10b5 1 plans of course those need to be initiated during open trading window periods so yes we ll be looking at trying to achieve that 50 return to shareholder goal throughout the year and we ll provide more updates as we get further along the year as it relates to the dividend we ve the board typically looks at well they discussed we discussed capital allocation throughout the year but over the last few years the board as typically increased the annual the quarterly dividend on an annual basis at their april meeting and we ll discuss that along with share repurchase levels as we noted there is 100 million authorization for 2019 and we ll see how that we ll see where those take us throughout the course of the year steven chercover d a davidson co analyst but just to clarify the board does have an intrinsic sense of the enterprise value or the yes i guess the enterprise value that is incorporated into the capital allocation decision brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary correct karen colonias president chief executive officer yes steven chercover d a davidson co analyst okay thank you both brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary thank you steve operator our next question comes from the line of julio romero with sidoti company please proceed with your question julio romero sidoti company llc analyst hey good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions karen colonias president chief executive officer yes brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary hello julio julio romero sidoti company llc analyst so can you talk a little bit more on the european segment and what caused those lower sales volumes i think i might have heard you mention there were elevated sales in the prior year quarter so if you can elaborate on that at all brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary sure so part of our european business our concrete business over there has products carbon fiber products for potentially large jobs so asphalt paving products runways and the like and that s some large jobs in q4 of 2017 that we didn t have the same level in q4 of 18 so not that the entire european businesses this large job based business but there is a bit of that impact in our european concrete business related to larger projects that sales are recognized when those projects are are being conducted so sometimes there is a bit of a timing issue on a comparability julio romero sidoti company llc analyst okay and then just i think we ve spoken about this before but just talk about again how building maybe above code resiliency can be a driver for you guys in the long term and how should we think about maybe best estimate for repair remodel as a percentage of sales karen colonias president chief executive officer sure i think we ve talked about the codes again there s one national code and you re required to design to that as a minimum standard there recently typically will put more content in a structure when it s on the west coast or anywhere along the coastal areas is due to the earthquake or at the high wind requirements the codes are looking at potentially designing to something called resiliency versus life safety and i think it was a really nice example of that when hurricane michael hit mexico beach and i think many people have seen this one house left standing called the san palace that was built to about a 50 higher than standard building code practices basically was able to withstand a category 5 hurricane so a lot of interest about being able to build to resiliency versus like just to life safety what would it cost what would it create when you think about code changed i think that s a change in a positive direction because what you see is entire communities devastated there are no houses there are no schools there are no jobs to come back to so this concept of maybe changing those design standards is an interesting conversation that s occurring and as i ve mentioned when you think about code changes typically they take many many years to enact it is quite interesting that people are starting to talk about this and then they actually have a proof of concept in this house that survived that category 5 hurricane so certainly it would be interesting where we will stay on top of that but that is not a near term code change my guess is 7 to 10 years out before someone would be willing to adopt those code changes julio romero sidoti company llc analyst helpful and just on repair and remodel i mean i think what would kind of be a fair range of what that would be as a percentage of sales karen colonias president chief executive officer yes we are as we ve mentioned in the past tough for us to give a specific number we re certainly working on trying to get a better handle on that and the real reason is again the same products can be used in new construction as well as repair and remodel and they go through the same distribution channel obviously we have some products like our outdoor accents ph that s really a repair remodel type of project so we can track a few products we can track a few types of distributors but we re definitely working on getting a hand around better idea of how much of the business goes to repair and remodel and as we brought the fastener line in i think that s been able to expand that opportunity and repair and remodel so i don t have a specific number for you but definitely we are putting more products that go into decks and fences and house editions garage organizers inaudible all those sorts of things julio romero sidoti company llc analyst okay fair enough appreciate you taking the questions and good luck in 2019 karen colonias president chief executive officer thank you brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary thank you operator our next question is a follow up from daniel moore with cjs securities please proceed with your question daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst thank you again and apologize if this was asked in a different form previously but just karen as it relates to your comments about january as demand being described as strong how does that dovetail with the expectation for kind of that low to mid single digit growth in housing starts for the year in that level more the kind of stable flat what have you seen so far during the quarter karen colonias president chief executive officer yes and again it s always difficult to pick a quarter based on one month but we definitely saw organic growth in january at a fairly decent pace will it continue hard to tell again february 4th or something here but and it s also hard to know on that january was that some filling of warehouses as we mentioned that s real tough for us to see from our distributor standpoint but definitely the january increases not just based on the price increase there is definitely organic growth in that january number daniel moore cjs securities inc analyst perfect appreciate it again thank you karen colonias president chief executive officer okay thanks dan brian magstadt chief financial officer treasurer secretary thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session this concludes today s conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for

gold gld iau has done well recently as the chart below indicates in about four months gold prices have increased by about 120 points from 1200 to 1320 after going nowhere for some time for a while it even seemed like gold would break down to new lows with the stock market setting new highs instead gold rallied and several factors contributed to this first the stock market started selling off in early october as can be seen in the chart below the month of october saw a drop of about 10 percent at its low november saw the stock market seesawing up and down with the spx stuck between the 2600 and 2800 level december followed with a huge drop of almost 20 percent from its most recent high gold as a safe haven naturally benefited from all the stock market volatility second the drop in the stock market seemed to have spooked the federal reserve into changing their initially hawkish standpoint into a more dovish one this did not happen right away but gradually with fed chairman powell becoming more and more dovish with each statement to the public good news for gold because that means less pressure from the fed tightening in addition global demand for gold was decent in 2018 according to the world gold council we have gone from the original expectation of three interest rate hikes in 2019 into a pause until further notice and the fed balance sheet reduction has gone from autopilot into ending it sooner than expected there are even hints of interest rate cuts if so required all this has led quite a number of people to turn bullish when it comes to gold the argument is that the fed easing should cause gold prices to go up however there is reason to be skeptical of this argument the issue is that while the fed easing may be bullish for gold it can also be bullish for stocks the two then come into competition for capital and one could conceivably starve the other the loser in this competition would not only not go up as initially expected but could even drop as all attention shifts elsewhere this could be anything stocks or even cryptocurrencies like bitcoin why gold dropped even though the fed launched quantitative easing with qe3 for example take a look at what happened when the fed announced in september of 2012 qe3 or qe infinity quite a number of people expected gold to rally similar to what had happened before with qe2 yet the reverse happened and gold dropped like a rock stocks on the other hand rallied with the spy going up by 32 percent in 2013 and another 13 percent in 2014 with the end of qe3 late that year the charts below show what happened back then the fed easing with quantitative easing qe and the zero interest rate policy zirp also did not lead to gold going up at least in this instance this time easy monetary policy was accompanied by a much more benign environment including improving economic data which helps stocks but works against gold so there is reason to doubt that the fed easing in 2019 if it happens is bullish for gold as some people seem to think gold like any other asset class needs to have people buying into it in order for prices to increase if there are no buyers or even worse if there are more sellers than buyers then gold prices are not going to increase sentiment is in favor of stocks which are still in a bull market the same cannot be said of gold gold needs more than just the fed easing to truly break out if gold is to truly break out then it will have to be in an environment that is more like the one we saw in 2010 and 2011 with qe2 there wasnâ t just zirp and qe it also included major geopolitical crises in places such as europe and the middle east a bad economy in the u s and gridlock in washington between republicans and democrats culminating in s p downgrading u s debt rating after a fight over the debt ceiling the present environment is not quite as bleak right now although there is the possibility that things will become a lot worse down the road due to several factors for instance crises or wars in places such as north korea and venezuela politics surrounding the raising of the debt ceiling in march a declining stock market due to an escalating trade war a worsening u s economy with potential for a recession and changes to the u s dollar as the global reserve currency in the more distant future a dream scenario for gold would be a repeat of what happened globally between the mid to late seventies of the previous century gold could soon break out or fail to do so for several years gold has been stuck in a trading range with the 1350 to 1370 level acting as the upper bound gold at roughly 1320 still has some room to run but it is already in the upper half of the range and it is likely to encounter resistance a catalyst will be needed if it is to break out just a dovish stance from the fed which is all we have right now is unlikely to do it although it helps to get things going some other factor or event has to happen otherwise gold could just as easily go down as it is to go up due to fed easing similar to what we have seen in the past the most likely scenario assuming none of the previously mentioned factors come into play and things stay the way they are right now is that gold challenges resistance possibly powered by a stock market pullback after a v shaped recovery and then bounces off after the stock market recovers and stays within its current range with all this in mind gold in my opinion should not be bought since the easy money has already been made with the climb from 1200 to 1320 in four months or so existing positions can be kept because there is potential for a breakout driven possibly by a major political fight between democrats and republicans over some issue such as for instance the debt ceiling however the more likely outcome is that the stock market continues to rally with the fed staying on the sidelines and gold is kept in check because of it source wikimedia commons

in a 33 minute speech monday to kick off the 2019 legislative session gov kevin stitt filled in some details on how his administration intends to make oklahoma a national leader in education and business recruitment and improve government accountability stitt used his first state of the state address to call for an additional pay raise for teachers a more modernized state government and greater control over state agency leaders employment what was absent however might be as important as what was included stitt spoke of shoring up the state s rainy day fund in order to prudently use the extra money that last year s tax increases brought in but he didn t call for a rollback of the taxes as some critics feared his call for more money for teachers while appealing to many doesn t address many educators calls for more classroom spending and the realities of criminal justice reform could hit a wall with district attorneys resistance and the fact that the state will likely need new prisons regardless of what the legislature does here are excerpts from the written speech and oklahoma watch reporters annotations gov kevin stitt speaks during his first state of the state address the speech kicked off the 2019 legislative session credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch it is such an honor to be with you today i d like to take a moment to recognize the honored guests with us lieutenant governor matt pinnell statewide elected officials president pro temp greg treat speaker charles mccall speaker pro temp harold wright members of the 57th legislature cabinet members chief justice noma gurich and members of the oklahoma supreme court tribal leaders friends guests my beloved first lady sarah my six children my parents and the most important audience my fellow oklahomans stitt isn t the only new face at the capitol this will also be the first session for pinnell several other statewide officials and a host of new lawmakers with 46 new lawmakers in the 101 seat house and 12 in the 48 seat senate i stand before you today to offer a vision for oklahoma s future that gives purpose and direction for how our new administration will lead the state my vision for oklahoma is very clear and simple to make oklahoma top ten my purpose is to work with you to deliver a turnaround that ensures a better future for all four million oklahomans i believe it is a purpose we all share in this room today before we get into the details of my very first budget i want to discuss how we position oklahoma well for a turnaround by defining the term and the expectations for this vision stitt repeatedly spoke about the need for a turnaround and his goal to make oklahoma a top 10 state on the campaign trail he has also frequently tried to distance himself from fellow republican and former gov mary fallin and her eight years in office instead of hoping to build upon her work stitt offers something of a rebuke of her time in office by speaking of the need for a turnaround and a new way of governing oklahoma s turnaround is when our state stops moving in the direction of decline and begins moving in the direction we want to go to be top ten in the nation to get there it will require three steps first we must bring together people from across the state with various backgrounds skills and talents to serve in critical leadership roles stitt has tapped into private sector expertise to fill many of his top jobs but not all of his appointees are political newcomers michael junk stitt s chief of staff was tulsa s deputy mayor and stitt s choice for secretary of state and education and liaison to the legislature michael rogers was a state representative from broken arrow and chair of the house education committee second we must set measurable goals and put metrics in place so every state employee agency leader member of my administration and each of you in our legislature can be part of one team with one vision third we must hold ourselves responsible for delivering results and reimagine the possibilities i ve said it before oklahoma s challenges are no different than any other state and oklahoma s opportunities i believe are the best in the nation a crowd of representatives officials and others applaud gov kevin stitt during his state of the state address credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch going through this process will put oklahoma on the path to be top ten and if anyone thinks that becoming top ten is just a campaign slogan let me tell you this turnaround is already under way with individuals who are delivering top ten outcomes in their own classrooms communities and industries being top 10 could mean a number of things in education it could mean teacher pay or classroom spending it could mean class sizes or test scores or for that matter the magnitude of a rise in test scores in business recruitment it could mean the size of a closing fund or the success of such an incentive stitt didn t include a boost in classroom spending with his call for a teacher pay raise and has offered few details so far on other aspects of his top 10 ambitions consider donna gradel an environmental teacher in broken arrow public schools two weeks ago she was named one of the top four teachers in the nation donna reimagined the classroom she moved beyond the textbook by taking her classroom outside to partner with the city of broken arrow to clean public water and by taking the classroom to the world by developing a system to provide sustainable food sources to orphans in kenya donna thank you for being here today consider the gathering place usa today named it the number one place in america to visit in 2019 it is an example of public private partnership where 55 acres stretched across the tulsa river front the george kaiser family foundation reimagined a free park that is bringing together all ages races and categories of people to enjoy tulsa consider the oklahoma youth expo community in the early 2000s this youth livestock show was struggling to survive but donors oklahoma families and the legislature came together assessed their resources and reimagined the program today oye is not just the 1 junior livestock show in america it is the largest in the world today oye garners young participants from all 77 counties awards hundreds of thousands of dollars in education scholarships and has shown a 22 million economic impact on oklahoma city these are just a few examples of oklahomans who brought together a team set measurable goals reimagined the possibilities and executed on their vision to deliver top ten results today as i present my first budget i ask you to join me in reimagining today as we consider the state of our state oklahomans are presented with revenue growth of potentially 600 million a 3 6 percent unemployment rate rising wages and a spirit of optimism this is the first time in several years that oklahoma has a surplus instead of facing a budget shortfall at the start of a legislative session but how much money policymakers will have to save or spend won t be known until the board of equalization meets to certify the final revenue figures later this month state budget officials expect a drop in drilling activity due to falling oil prices over the past several weeks and months which could cause the state s surplus to be reduced by 50 million to 150 million this is because of oklahomans who are working hard taking risks opening new businesses and creating jobs the government does not create wealth only the private sector can in my administration every policy decision will promote a healthy economy stitt who created gateway mortgage group and grew it into a national mortgage lender and servicer has spoken repeatedly of the private sector s role in job creation and his experience in employing thousands in saying that a focus on economic health will underpin policy decisions stitt seems to be saying he wouldn t look kindly on tougher regulations when they come at the expense of business growth i want to also recognize president pro temp greg treat and speaker charles mccall who provided committed leadership over the past few years to make hard decisions to demonstrate our state s support of core services that oklahomans and job creators rely on as i promised on the campaign trail i brought them in to our process of reimagining the budget the house senate and governor s office typically work behind the scenes to negotiate the final budget and make sure there is a plan that can pass both chambers and win the governor s blessing this was at times a contentious process when fallin was office but senate president pro tem greg treat r oklahoma city said after stitt s speech that lawmakers are hopeful and that there is a renewed sense of optimism and excitement at the capitol as i outline my administration s priorities this year i want to make it clear as elected officials we will not always agree on the specifics of every policy and that s ok we are each elected for different reasons and because of specific issues gov kevin stitt shakes hands with house minority leader emily virgin d norman after the state of the state address credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch but you will always find my office willing to work with you and to be open minded on policy differences because what unites us in this room is that we are committed to reimagining how we can do state government better and deliver a brighter future for oklahomans first let s reimagine state government our state constitution vests supreme executive power in the office of the governor but too often that executive power has been delegated by statute to boards that are not directly accountable to the citizens of oklahoma state government today is much larger than it was 112 years ago as a result accountability for those in power is spread too thin and at times it seems as of no one is really in charge the health department s crisis in 2017 taught us this lesson and the legislature wisely restructured the agency s board into an advisory role and gave the executive branch the authority to fire and hire a new leader let s not wait for another crisis to start making this necessary reform across our largest agencies the legislature made an emergency appropriation of 30 million last year to the health department a grand jury report and investigative audit later found out that money wasn t needed and the agency had not been honest about its finances the agency hasn t spent the money and stitt wants to take it back to pay for performance audits at nine more agencies under the agency performance and accountability commission and use the rest of the funds for economic development through the governor s quick action closing fund oklahomans want three things accountability transparency and results i know the legislature wants it too both senate and house leadership are committed to addressing the structure of our state s largest agencies so that government is held more accountable to the people by granting the governor hiring authority you will know exactly where the buck stops at my desk stitt wants to be able to appoint directors for the following agencies oklahoma health care authority department of corrections office of juvenile affairs department of mental health and substance abuse services and department of transportation the governor already has the authority to appoint the commissioner at the state health department and the department of human services as well as some executive positions like adjutant general and emergency management although supporters say the governor should have a say who is in charge of state agencies there likely will be resistance among those who feel an appointed board or commission can offer more expertise in these decisions and shield agency heads from political pressure but reform should not stop here we will also seek to remove board members across state government when they have conflicts of interest and we will look to sunset and consolidate boards and commissions where there is overlap and duplication this is common sense reform stitt s budget by agency my budget will prioritize funding to continue performance audits of the top 12 agencies we will fund this effort by immediately recalling the 30 million that was given to the health department after the agency misrepresented their financial standing to the legislature the agency performance and accountability commission a group lawmakers formed in 2017 spent more than 1 3 million to audit the department of corrections district attorneys council department of public safety office of management and enterprise services oklahoma tax commission and office of juvenile affairs stitt wants to expand that work to the oklahoma health care authority department of education department of human services department of transportation state regents for higher education department of mental health and substance abuse services department of health department of career and technology education and the department of veterans affairs the governor s office hasn t said how much it expects the audits will cost we will also reimagine state government so that our customers oklahoma taxpayers are the primary focus this is why i have placed a special emphasis in my administration on the digital transformation of state agencies today i am calling for the legislature to fund a 20 million grant program where agencies can apply to receive funds to bring their services into the 21stcentury and to make government more customer centered and efficient imagine digital driver licenses that are real id compliant imagine titles available electronically imagine one site to obtain occupational licenses and one site to pay taxes it is time to get it done the legislature had balked at real id drivers licenses before authorizing the department of public safety to comply with the act in 2017 however the licenses won t be ready until at least 2020 when system upgrades and security measures are expected to be completed in the meantime oklahoma has been seeking extension and the state faces another deadline in october to bring its license into compliance with the federal law it is time to improve our government s d ranking in digital transparency and for the state government s checkbook to be online up to date and easy to navigate it is time for an online dashboard where you can monitor my administration s progress on performance metrics we will set for delivering state services state superintendent of public instruction joy hofmeister stands and applauds gov kevin stitt during his first state of the state address stitt called for an additional teacher pay raise on top of last year s pay hike credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch turning our attention to education my administration is committed to public education and understands that the large majority of our students attend public schools over the next few years we will move the needle in outcomes we will set high standards we will enact reforms we will invest in the classroom but we must first continue our investment in the teacher because it s not programs curriculum or resources that students will remember the magic happens between the student and the teacher in the classroom we are confronted with a nationwide teacher shortage this is not a problem unique to our state but oklahoma was among the hardest hit with recent revenue growth i ask the legislature to bring our teachers to number one in our region in pay and benefits this amounts to a 1 200 increase per teacher this is less than the oklahoma education association s ask of 3 000 but the state education department s budget request doesn t include a pay raise instead focusing on operational dollars to reduce class sizes i am also calling for the legislature to funds a bonus recruitment program up to 5 million to encourage certified teachers to stay in oklahoma after graduating college to return to the classroom after a hiatus or to move to oklahoma for the first time i applaud representative rhonda baker s collaboration to get this effort underway and i appreciate house minority leader emily virgin and her caucus for their support of a continued pay increases for our teachers house minority leader emily virgin d norman provides a response to gov kevin stitt s first state of the state address credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch we must also standardize the certification test for oklahoma s teachers get rid of the five year renewal fee and reduce unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy on high performing schools and instead shift resources to help schools who need it the most stitt is said to be a fan of moving oklahoma to the praxis which is the exam used by most other states but these reforms and continued investment from the state will not be enough to make oklahoma s education system competitive we must do the hard work of reimagining education consider cecilia robinson woods the superintendent of the millwood school district in oklahoma city after assessing the resources and unique challenges of her district cecilia reimagined ways to recruit and retain talent in her classrooms it was important that teachers were not just skilled in their profession but that they also were passionate leaders who could shape the culture of their schools and district cecilia partnered with teach for america utilized opportunities offered under state law and implemented a new reading program today the millwood school district has seen dramatic positive progress in outcomes the opportunities stitt is referring to here are converting to a charter school which millwood did in 2017 to retain emergency certified teachers who were unable to get certified after two years cecilia thank you for being here today state superintendent joy hofmeister responds to speech we must also look at ways to better stabilize the funding of public education the fact that texas is preparing to pass a teacher pay increase at a cost of 3 7 billion compels us to review and reform our state s funding formula and to take the handcuffs off local communities wanting to compete recruit and retain the very best teachers we must chart a bold course that allows for communities to do more for their students without being penalized with the loss of state support a legislative task force studied the education funding formula last year the funding formula has not been changed since the early 1980s critics say allowing local districts more flexibility on how they spend their money leads to unequal funding and more inequities in educational opportunities state government cannot fix education s funding needs alone we must stand arm in arm with communities cities and counties oklahoma is stronger when we are all working together the process of reforming the formula demands a reimagining of school districts so we can ensure not just equal funding per student but also equal opportunity this will take time to study what other states are doing what is working and what challenges we must address that are unique to oklahoma i am committed to be a continuous learner in this area and a leader in the discussion we must not forget that education should be first and foremost about our students not about systems i will sign into law any legislation that seeks to break down the silos between common education career techs and higher education so that we can better align the education experience for oklahoma s children and prepare them for tomorrow s workforce of machinists computer programmers engineers and more guests pray on the house floor before gov kevin stitt s first state of the state address credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch next let us take a moment to reimagine our state s criminal justice system we are number one in the nation for incarceration to move the needle it will require us to change the way we see the person who is in a cycle of incarceration for non violent crimes stitt has been a vocal supporter of criminal justice reform saying oklahoma should work to bring its incarceration rate closer to those of its peers many years ago i was introduced to melinda who held the titles of daughter mom and fellow oklahoman but to the prison system she was a drug offender when i met her she was looking for hope for a better life for her son and for an opportunity to change course today she has been an employee at gateway for more than 13 years her entry into the workforce was key to remaining sober and to becoming a thriving individual in our society melinda s story of redemption was possible because of a community of people who stepped in walked with her and gave her opportunity melinda you are why i believe in second chances thank you for being here today there can be more stories of redemption like hers it is why my budget requests 1 5 million to women in recovery a public private partnership to help women identify the roots of their addictions and develop life skills and 10 million to the county community safety investment fund a criminal justice reform initiative the people of oklahoma approved with sq 781 but money is not the sole action government must take i am encouraged by legislation in the house to accomplish licensing reform for those with a felony we must give oklahomans re entering society more opportunities to be gainfully employed and we must give employers more discretion on who they can hire fallin issued an executive order in 2016 prohibiting state agencies from asking about applicants criminal histories on job applications we must also remember the people who work hard every day to keep our correctional facilities clean safe and operating they are on the front lines of delivering core government services and as revenue continues to improve i urge us to consider ways we can better improve their work conditions and compensation in my budget we will also use revenue growth to address two critical healthcare programs in oklahoma the graduate medical expense program to train doctors a cost of 62 million and the children s health insurance program a cost of 14 8 million these programs remind us why we must be judicious and thoughtful about seeking federal funds in fiscal year 2020 these two programs alone will cost the state of oklahoma 77 million that the federal government once paid a 6 8 percent increase to the healthcare authority s budget when washington d c wants to end a program we are left holding the bag and covering the cost in late 2017 the state lost its waiver that allowed it to attract extra federal funds under medicaid for medical schools at the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university while medicaid expansion currently stops at a 90 percent federal match we cannot assume that it will remain this high forever the estimated 150 million price tag today for oklahoma to expand medicaid could leave us down the road fronting more than 1 billion when the federal government pulls back on its commitment they ve done it before and they will do it again there have been mixed messages on stitt s openness to medicaid expansion he s been against it on the campaign trail but said he was somewhat open to new ways of attracting more federal money for medicaid at an associated press legislative forum last week however he seemed in the state of the state speech to the slam the door on medicaid expansion in oklahoma medicaid is the fastest growing expense in our state budget and before we commit our state to accepting even more medicaid dollars oklahomans deserve accountability and transparency with our state s management of the healthcare authority oklahoma is the only state in the nation where the governor does not have the authority to provide oversight of this agency we are sticking out like a sore thumb and this must change healthcare is also preventative promoting wellness through education personal responsibility and raising awareness today i am announcing my partnership with the oklahoma city memorial marathon to hold a governor s relay challenge and i invite you to join me i ll be forming my own team to compete in the relay and the team that wins will join me for lunch at the governor s mansion later this year stitt did not mention mental health directly in his address and his budget proposed no funding change for the state mental health department at 337 million he did speak of drug addiction and criminal justice reform his wife sarah stitt has said mental health will be a priority as first lady she reiterated that after the speech let s now move to the economy in order to make our efforts in state government sustainable we must first grow oklahoma we need more taxpayers not more taxes during his gubernatorial campaign stitt became one of the most vocal candidates speaking out against tax increases in addition to signing former u s sen tom coburn s seven point taxpayer platform which calls for limited government and fair taxation stitt also said last year s teacher pay raises could have been passed without increasing taxes in his first budget at least stitt lives up to his talk as his budget doesn t call for tax increases or major revenue raising policies we will reimagine our economy by diversifying our marketplace strengthening our workforce and encouraging oklahomans to start new businesses our rules must be clear our regulations must make sense and our tax code must remain competitive with our neighbors attendees line the house gallery s to hear gov kevin stitt s first state of the state address credit whitney bryen oklahoma watch at the department of commerce i have hired the very best talent in the state to lead this critical agency and they have set measurable goals and are running hard to tell the world oklahoma is open for business oklahoma s quick action closing fund has spent more than 10 million on six projects since 2013 according to the department of commerce this hasn t been a priority to fund as the state faced a succession of budget shortfalls to best equip the agency s mission i ask the legislature to support additional funds for the governor s quick action closing fund since its inception the state has granted 11 million in total awards which attracted high paying jobs with the macy s large distribution center in owasso with boeing s relocation of the aircraft modernization and sustainment business unit and with the commercial metals company in durant and many more stitt wasn t explicit about the use of tax incentives on the campaign trail but his budget book includes a section on the various income tax credits deductions and exemptions in the state s tax code they total about 1 5 billion another 985 million is in sales tax exemptions today the balance of oklahoma s quick action closing fund is 4 3 million by comparison the latest legislative report for the texas enterprise fund indicates the state has awarded 609 million from its quick action closing fund resulting in 94 347 jobs in arkansas their fund has awarded over 120 million resulting in 26 684 jobs you can help me sign on the dotted line for new opportunities to grow oklahoma and demonstrate to the nation that oklahoma is not afraid to compete with our neighbors and that we intend to win as we close our time together let s end by reimagining our state budget i promised oklahomans that we would get to the bottom of every tax dollar and i promised to be transparent and open about the budget process for the first time in recent history the governor s budget provides you with every tax dollar we could find across the 12 largest agencies which are spending 90 percent of the state s total budget it is important we talk in total dollars this was the one consistent request i heard from oklahomans across the campaign trail total state expenditures which include general appropriations apportionments agency service charges and federal grants were 17 3 billion as of last year but state appropriations money that the legislature gets to direct was 7 5 billion of that in this budget packet i have also included agencies current performance goals as we move forward together this year my administration will be working with agencies to hire the best people raise accountability and deliver measurable results my vision for the budget is for it to become a meaningful resource each year to establish a common language for lawmakers and tax payers and create a transparent budget process now as we dig into the numbers instead of across the board increases in fy 20 my budget addresses more than 230 million in obligations and another 151 million in critical needs the obligations stitt is referring to include about 100 million in ad valorem reimbursement to local school districts 62 8 million that the federal government clawed back as part of a dispute over oklahoma s use of the money to help fund graduate medical education about 20 million for teacher flexible benefit allowances 19 3 million for the capitol renovation 14 8 million for the children s health insurance program 7 1 million for debt service obligations and 12 8 million to rebuild the state s medical lab my budget also casts a bold goal for our state s savings account i have said often why i believe the state needs 2 billion in savings when we look at states where the economy depends on the price of oil they place a strong emphasis on saving during the good years one thing we know is true oil prices are going to go up and oil prices are going to go down when energy prices tumble it directly impacts the state s sales tax collection the state s income tax collection the gross production tax and various other revenue streams we must be honest with ourselves and recognize that last year s tax increases made us more dependent on the price of oil we must be good fiscal stewards of this decision by creating more stability through savings stitt seems to allay concerns that he would support rolling back last spring s tax increases at the end of fy 19 our rainy day fund will have approximately 874 million with no additional support from a stabilization fund often seen in oil rich states meanwhile texas has 12 5 billion in total savings to weather another economic downturn north dakota s total savings is more than 5 8 billion the governor s budget staff said they d like to increase the rainy day fund cap to 30 percent of the revenue estimate for the general revenue fund up from 15 percent now that change would require voter approval in a state question this is why i am setting a goal for oklahoma to have 1 billion in our savings by the end of fy 20 to get there we must set aside an additional 250 million from revenue growth stitt s proposal to save the 250 million instead of spending it on immediate needs is expected to be a contentious issue this year although republican leaders applauded this conservative approach house minority leader rep emily virgin d norman said that money could be used to further boost education spending or pay for health corrections and other state needs being conservative with our budget surplus today will protect oklahoma from having to cut core services in the future as i close let us remember the future doesn t just happen we make it happen as public servants our responsibility and purpose are to ensure a better future for all four million oklahomans this will require us to be good listeners continuous learners committed communicators and bold leaders both inside the building and around the state our vision is to make oklahoma top ten join me as we work together we will

australian dollar jumps after rba left cash rate unchanged at 1 50 as widely expected the conclusion of the statement was kept totally unchanged and most importantly rba maintained further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected although this progress is likely to be gradual there are some dovish tweaks in the statement including mentioning of increased risks downgrade of growth and inflation forecasts but for now the statement still suggests the next move is a hike rather than a cut just that it may take longer to happen globally rba said growth remains reasonable but downside risks have increased in particular trade tensions are affecting global trade and some investment decisions headline inflation also moved lower due to fall in oil prices regarding financial markets rba also noted government bond yields have declined in most countries including australia australia s terms of trade are expected to decline over time domestically rba expects australian economy to growth by around 3 in 2019 and a little less in 2020 that s a downward revision from prior expectation of growth at 3 5 in 2019 further than that rba acknowledged weaker than expected growth in q3 and said some downside risks have increased and the main domestic uncertainty remains around the outlook for household spending and the effect of falling housing prices in some cities on inflation rba now expects underlying inflation to hit 2 in 2019 and 2 25 in 2020 headline inflation is also expected to decline in the near term due to petrol prices that s also a downgrade as in previously rba expected inflation to hit 2 25 in 2019 and a bit higher in 2020 full statement below statement by philip lowe governor monetary policy decision at its meeting today the board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1 50 per cent the global economy grew above trend in 2018 although it slowed in the second half of the year unemployment rates in most advanced economies are low the outlook for global growth remains reasonable although downside risks have increased the trade tensions are affecting global trade and some investment decisions growth in the chinese economy has continued to slow with the authorities easing policy while continuing to pay close attention to the risks in the financial sector globally headline inflation rates have moved lower due to the decline in oil prices although core inflation has picked up in a number of economies financial conditions in the advanced economies tightened in late 2018 but remain accommodative equity prices declined and credit spreads increased but these moves have since been partly reversed market participants no longer expect a further tightening of monetary policy in the united states government bond yields have declined in most countries including australia the australian dollar has remained within the narrow range of recent times the terms of trade have increased over the past couple of years but are expected to decline over time the central scenario is for the australian economy to grow by around 3 per cent this year and by a little less in 2020 due to slower growth in exports of resources the growth outlook is being supported by rising business investment and higher levels of spending on public infrastructure as is the case globally some downside risks have increased gdp growth in the september quarter was weaker than expected this was largely due to slow growth in household consumption and income although the consumption data have been volatile and subject to revision over recent quarters growth in household income has been low over recent years but is expected to pick up and support household spending the main domestic uncertainty remains around the outlook for household spending and the effect of falling housing prices in some cities the housing markets in sydney and melbourne are going through a period of adjustment after an earlier large run up in prices conditions have weakened further in both markets and rent inflation remains low credit conditions for some borrowers are tighter than they have been at the same time the demand for credit by investors in the housing market has slowed noticeably as the dynamics of the housing market have changed growth in credit extended to owner occupiers has eased to an annualised pace of 5½ per cent mortgage rates remain low and there is strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality the labour market remains strong with the unemployment rate at 5 per cent a further decline in the unemployment rate to 4¾ per cent is expected over the next couple of years the vacancy rate is high and there are reports of skills shortages in some areas the stronger labour market has led to some pick up in wages growth which is a welcome development the improvement in the labour market should see some further lift in wages growth over time although this is still expected to be a gradual process inflation remains low and stable over 2018 cpi inflation was 1 8 per cent and in underlying terms inflation was 1¾ per cent underlying inflation is expected to pick up over the next couple of years with the pick up likely to be gradual and to take a little longer than earlier expected the central scenario is for underlying inflation to be 2 per cent this year and 2¼ per cent in 2020 headline inflation is expected to decline in the near term because of lower petrol prices the low level of interest rates is continuing to support the australian economy further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected although this progress is likely to be gradual taking account of the available information the board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time

us dollar is likely to get weaker in the coming months may hit 66 to the rupee by june the us china trade war is likely to slow down global economy including us for those buying dollars in exchange of rupees there are other factors at play too if you are looking to buy us dollars either as an investment or for a travel plan in the future wait for a while the greenback is likely to weaken in the coming months that s the call from an icici bank as well as malaysia based maybank appetite for the us dollar is expected to wane from a cyclical perspective as growth in the us economy slows a report from icici bank said as the economic growth slows the market s confidence in a country s currency weakens hurting its value one of the biggest factor for a possible slowdown in us economy is the ongoing trade tussle with china both have levied additional tariffs on goods exported from the other country in december both countries agreed to hold off on new tariffs for 90 days and negotiate peace the deadline for a deal is march 1 there are signs a trade deal could very well happen between the us and china during the 90 day ceasefire period however we believe they can only reach a weak deal the maybank report said however the fall in the value of the dollar may not be much because the trade war between us and china is hurting economies across the world there has been a simultaneous weakening in non us growth relative to expectations the icici bank report said adding that the downtrend in the us dollar has been somewhat more modest than we previously expected for indians there will be other factors too at play the price of crude oil can alone derail all calculations for the world s fastest growing economy india imports nearly 80 of all the crude oil it needs and a spike in prices would mean it has to pay more dollars to get the same amount of oil in the international market this would weaken the rupee the government s handling of finances also affects the exchange rate reckless expense to appease voters in an election year will also the hurt the currency foreign fund flows also determine the demand for a currency if foreigners bring in more dollars to invest in stocks or bonds the currency will appreciate faster for example today february 5 rupee gained for the first time in three days as investors from abroad made a bet of 4 2 billion the net impact of these factors will decide how much stronger the rupee gets against the american currency in the coming weeks here s an estimate from maybank
lieutenant governor fetterman speaker turzai president scarnati leader corman leader costa leader cutler leader dermody members of the general as lieutenant governor fetterman speaker turzai president scarnati leader corman leader costa leader cutler leader dermody members of the general assembly invited guests friends and family especially my wife frances and my fellow pennsylvanians this is my fifth budget address and for the last four years sitting to my left was karen coates a trusted advisor to speaker turzai a friend mother sister daughter and respected member of our community and for the same four years i would look out into the chamber and see flo fabrizio mike o brien and sid kavulich this year they are not with us let us all remember their lasting impact commitment to service and carry forward in their memory three weeks ago i had the honor of taking the oath of office for another term as governor i spoke of a commonwealth on a comeback a pennsylvania on a path to a more functional government a more prosperous economy and a brighter future for our children the people of our commonwealth have proven that despite the challenges we face pennsylvania remains a place worthy of its history a place where people can find good work strong communities and opportunity for their kids and here in harrisburg we ve proven that despite our differences we remain capable of doing what washington just cannot seem able to do tackle big challenges put aside petty partisanship and serve the public interest we must never forget that embedded in pennsylvania s history is the fact that not one but two noble experiments were launched here first there was william penn s holy experiment second the founders launched their own experiment in self government both of these are perpetual experiments when we reaffirm our commitment to these experiments we honor both our history and those founders and we show our constituents that whether they voted for us or not those experiments are in good hands and their government is worthy of their trust now we have a chance to show that good faith once again in proposing and debating this budget we get to the heart of our perpetual experiment in self government we show the founders that we can govern ourselves today i put forth my budget proposal and let me cut to the chase this proposal asks for no new taxes not one dollar not one dime not one penny at the same time this budget proposes to do a number of things aimed at improving the lives of our fellow citizens the people of pennsylvania have made substantial sacrifices in recent years to help our state get up off the mat and despite a budget that asks for no new taxes we now have a chance to continue making some important new investments on their behalf investments in our schools investments to make sure more pennsylvanians of all ages have real choices when it comes to their health care decisions continued investments to reinforce our commitment to the battle against the opioid epidemic that has claimed the lives of so many of our neighbors investments to support our farmers and agricultural producers so they can continue to sustain our rural communities for generations to come in the coming weeks we ll have the chance to discuss debate and negotiate the details and i will ask for your partnership in ensuring that this important work continues and that we maintain our commitment to advancing this experiment in self government my administration has worked hard to make these investments possible striving to run our government not just more ethically but more efficiently so that it is worthy of the public trust and capable of advancing the public interest we ve saved billions of taxpayer dollars and reduced the number of state employees without furloughs all while improving customer service we ve gotten rid of facilities and leases that we don t use or need while consolidating commonwealth operations within the capitol complex we ve made the procurement process smarter and more efficient and we will continue to look for ways to streamline government so we can invest in the things that matter to pennsylvanians while at the same time serving them better today however i want to focus on the most significant element of this budget proposal a comprehensive plan for preparing pennsylvanians to compete and win in our rapidly changing economy a plan to create a new generation of prosperity in our commonwealth by building the strongest workforce in the nation the credit for our economic success has always belonged to the people of pennsylvania the innovators who turned new ideas into new industries the business leaders who built great companies large and small and the working women and men who toiled in fields and mines and factories not to mention research labs and classrooms and cubicles there s a reason pennsylvanians know names like carnegie hershey westinghouse and a reason why we believe so strongly in the power of our work ethic and the importance of individual responsibility that s who we are but in the background government has been there working on our behalf building canals and highways so manufacturers could get their goods to market protecting the integrity of the marketplace to ensure fair competition and helping to unlock the potential offered by our abundant resources in the end however our most important economic resource has always been our people it s always been workers that have propelled our prosperity that s why we ve always made sure to invest in public schools universities and training centers the path to prosperity begins with an educated workforce that s as true today as it s always been but while that principle remains intact a lot about our economy has changed new businesses new industries new technology new competition and with all that we have a need for new skills over the last four years pennsylvania has created more than 12 000 new businesses and more than 239 000 new jobs we ve begun to match and advance beyond our neighbors now it s time for us to really pull ahead today i present a comprehensive plan to help grow our economy by continuing to invest in our workforce this plan calls on contributions from the business community labor unions educators research institutions students parents and adult workers and it increases opportunity for every pennsylvanian at every stage of life from birth to retirement i m proposing a package of policies and investments called the statewide workforce education and accountability program it s the next step we can take together to build on all of the work we ve done over the past four years consider just how far we ve already come we ve made pennsylvania a leader in computer science education by establishing a workforce development initiative that invests in computer science and stem education programs for k 12 students we ve increased the number of career and technical education students earning industry recognized credentials by 34 percent and increased the number of credentials earned by students enrolled in career and technical education programs by 27 percent we ve provided high school students options to demonstrate graduation readiness as alternatives to high stakes standardized testing we ve increased participation to nearly 800 registered apprenticeship programs and almost 17 000 active apprenticeships and we ve assisted nearly 3 000 companies in training more than 145 000 incumbent workers across the commonwealth to help employees develop new skills to thrive in their jobs but we know there is more to do when amazon made its decision not to locate its second headquarters in pennsylvania it cited workforce concerns as a main reason and in western pennsylvania we ve struggled to find pennsylvanians to fill the jobs as welders and pipefitters at the shell cracker plant across the commonwealth we have workers aging out of our workforce and too often the next generation of worker is not there or doesn t have the skills to replace them if we can t strengthen our workforce we will fall behind and we cannot let our government s response to this problem be handcuffed by stale habit we need to continue to break down silos we need to inject our efforts with common purpose and we need to make sure that as leaders we are providing direction and giving teeth to our workforce efforts that s why we are going to do something a little different starting immediately we are going to put together a keystone economic development and workforce command center agency secretaries are going to meet each week with plans in hand and sit together to make sure no workforce effort walks alone or falls through some crack in the state government if the department of community and economic development knows a company that needs 20 welders and the department of labor and industry has a welding program we re going to connect them those connections within state government are valuable and necessary but we also need to hear from businesses and labor not just when they re upset and not just when we tour a facility in a hard hat we need to hear from them constantly we need to know when there is a problem right away so we can fix it if a labor union is having trouble establishing a training program because of antiquated procedures then we need to fix it we need to get those workers trained and into the workforce if a business can t hire a worker because of an out of date or unnecessary rule or regulation we need to know about it so we can take action if medical professionals are concerned about a licensing backlog they need receptive ears in state government we re also not going to try to solve every workforce problem on our own the command center will have a first of its kind employer fund a public private partnership that empowers businesses to address the skills gap from their end and encourages them to share their best ideas and best practices so that we can scale them up and learn from their success after all government doesn t have a monopoly on good ideas for addressing these challenges but it can serve as an incubator for the best ones and a partner for putting them into action the command center is going to be led by the secretaries of the departments of community and economic development labor industry and state three agencies that have the largest impact on pennsylvania s workforce and business development we are also going to bring outside voices in my friends gene barr and rick bloomingdale will also be co chairs they co chaired my middle class task force which helped launch many of the workforce development ideas we implemented last year and that i m proposing to build on in this plan and they ll be joined by tony bartolomeo of team pa and auditor general depasquale who has worked on these issues and will have important recommendations but we need to do more we need policies that start at the very beginning and end with every pennsylvanian receiving an excellent education and the opportunity to land a good job last year i convened a ready to start task force charging it with finding ways to improve the lives of children under three and their families i know that no new parent looks at their baby and sees a spreadsheet but the fact is that preparing our kids for success starts long before they ever enter a classroom or even take their first steps and providing services for children helps to get parents into the workforce and fight poverty that s why this new program includes funding for home visits to support vulnerable pregnant women new mothers and at risk infants and toddlers home visiting programs promote healthy relationships and safe and stable home environments they re proven to work in preventing adverse childhood experiences giving children and their parents the skills they need to reach their full potential and lift families out of poverty and into good jobs you know we already have programs like this working in pennsylvania misericordia university is home to one of only eight programs in the country that helps single mothers who are struggling economically to complete a college degree the program provides counseling housing and other services to help mothers get into the workforce we plan to replicate this innovative job training program all across the commonwealth and this program leverages federal funds to improve our child care system so we can get more kids off of waiting lists and into high quality support systems and help more parents make their way into the workforce pennsylvania s children deserve every opportunity to succeed when they enter our public school system and they deserve to enter a public school system that isn t just adequate but world class restoring 1 billion in funding to our schools was an important first step but now we need to go further we must continue to increase funding for education starting with pre k and culminating at the end of a student s journey but that s not all it s time to lower the age of compulsory attendance to age 6 bringing our commonwealth in line with the vast majority of other states and we should consider going even further with a careful study of the costs and benefits of moving to universal free full day kindergarten for every 5 year old in pennsylvania meanwhile we should increase the minimum dropout age to 18 and partner with school districts to keep our graduation rate rising of course no governor or legislator can do more for a child than a teacher can and my program empowers teachers to do even more through a program called teacherworks that provides them with workplace experience in pennsylvania businesses so they can better understand the needs of employers we ask a lot of our teachers and if we re going to prepare the next generation of pennsylvanians for the jobs of the future we re going to be asking even more of those teachers including more training and more accountability teachers on the other hand they just want safe schools to work in support from administrative staff a fair wage for the important work they do that s not asking a lot but the law governing teacher pay hasn t been updated since the 1980s and so our classroom teachers have been too often getting the short end of the stick i don t think anyone here in harrisburg would say that we shouldn t value the contributions our educators have made over the last 30 years and i don t think anyone would disagree that they have a critical role to play in securing our prosperity over the next 30 and yet our government has failed to address this injustice that ends now my plan increases the pay floor for teachers to 45 000 a year this is a real investment in our future it s an investment the state not local school districts will make and it s included in this budget this is a fully funded mandate we are going to start competing to recruit and retain the very best education professionals not just in well funded suburban school districts but in every community every zip code in our commonwealth this could be a game changer for our schools especially for our communities that are struggling to attract and retain the next generation of educators in fact most districts that cannot afford to pay their teachers more are located in the heart of rural pennsylvania and it is time to make sure we are investing in educators in those areas today to prepare our kids for the competitive world of tomorrow we re also going to do more to recruit students ambitious brilliant creative young women and men who are looking for the next step in their education our commonwealth is blessed with a terrific system of colleges and universities including community colleges we all know that our post secondary institutions are laboratories for innovation but they are also launchpads for job creators and the skilled workers that will fill those jobs that s why my plan creates a new grant program for students who graduate from a pennsylvania community college with an associate s degree or other industry recognized credential and then stay in pennsylvania to start their careers if you re willing to put your newly acquired skills to work here in our commonwealth the least we can do is help you avoid carrying around a crushing burden of student debt and if you re a parent who wants to trade up from a job that pays the bills to a job that can sustain your family my plan includes a parent pathway initiative designed to help you get the education you need to get ahead even while you prepare your own kids for success indeed my workforce program isn t just about the jobs of tomorrow it s about the jobs of today last year we launched pasmart a comprehensive new initiative focusing on stem skills apprenticeships career counseling and public private partnerships no matter how old you are now is a great time to acquire new skills and we want to make that opportunity available to every pennsylvanian as part of the pasmart initiative we just launched a new website pa smart dot gov that consolidates workforce resources and information for pennsylvanians who want to get training and education to enter the workforce or expand their skills it s similar to the business one stop shop we built last year and that we re still improving upon we need comprehensive digital portals for both businesses and workers that gets them all the information they need in one place and breaks down agency barriers this year i m proposing 10 million in new funding for pasmart so we can fill more advanced manufacturing positions help more non traditional students obtain the training they need to compete in the job market and create more jobs at better wages for more pennsylvania workers this program also includes funding to help returning veterans get the training they need to continue their contributions to our commonwealth as members of our workforce and even better that funding is transferable meaning that veterans can use it to help their kids get a college degree or career credential as well it s a gi bill for pennsylvania one more thing we cannot comprehensively address our workforce development system without fixing our criminal justice system tens of thousands of pennsylvanians are shut out of our workforce or underemployed because of mistakes they ve made in their past families are being denied providers employers are being denied skilled workers we ve already passed clean slate legislation making us the first state in the country to do so but we need to go further and make our criminal justice system more equitable and fair while helping people who have made amends enter the workforce indeed even as we work on this budget we also have to improve reentry programs and make it easier for those who have done their time to succeed in the workforce and their daily lives our challenge demands an all hands on deck approach and this budget proposal itself asks pennsylvanians to come together business leaders educators students parents workers to address the challenge of renewing our prosperity for another generation in my inaugural address i asked us to do our best right here in harrisburg to do two things first to ensure that the interests of all pennsylvanians are reflected in the policies we pursue and second to show the world that pennsylvanians know how to make representative democracy work this budget is the embodiment of that noble effort it asks for no new taxes no new burdens on our citizens while at the same time increasing dramatically our investments in the public goods that will make life better for all pennsylvanians this budget recognizes that government should not try to do everything we have a long held faith in our tradition of limited government and individual responsibility but it also recognizes that government should not do nothing either the public goods government invests in should make the lives of our fellow citizens better public goods that give pennsylvanians the skills they need to thrive in our 21st century economy public goods that promote their safety and health public goods that connect them more seamlessly with each other public goods that keep our air and water clean that s what this budget aims to do it makes investments in workforce readiness our early childhood system our schools our universities our community colleges our apprenticeship training programs it makes investments in ensuring that pennsylvanians of all ages have real choices when it comes to their health care decisions and it continues to prioritize the fight against the opioid epidemic that has destroyed the lives of so many of our friends and neighbors but above all else this budget proclaims to the world that right here in pennsylvania we do not indulge in the sterile politics of anger and insult that here we know how to engage in the respectful and honest give and take that must stand at the heart of a functional democracy while the rest of this country and indeed the rest of the world descends into divisive nasty and unproductive bouts of shouting we are showing everyone else how democracy is supposed to work so this is our challenge it s not just about yet another budget it s about our democracy let us show the world along with the rest of our country that right here in pennsylvania we are making this experiment work that we are re dedicating ourselves to this noble experiment in democratic self governance let s show that in the way we tackle the challenge of preparing our commonwealth for a brighter future starting with this budget this and no less than this is our task this is also our privilege may god bless us in this task and may god bless the commonwealth of pennsylvania

than a teacher can and my program empowers teachers to do even more through a program called teacherworks that provides them with workplace experience in pennsylvania businesses so they can better understand the needs of employers we ask a lot of our teachers and if we re going to prepare the next generation of pennsylvanians for the jobs of the future we re going to be asking even more of those teachers including more training and more accountability teachers on the other hand they just want safe schools to work in support from administrative staff a fair wage for the important work they do that s not asking a lot but the law governing teacher pay hasn t been updated since the 1980s and so our classroom teachers have been too often getting the short end of the stick i don t think anyone here in harrisburg would say that we shouldn t value the contributions our educators have made over the last 30 years and i don t think anyone would disagree that they have a critical role to play in securing our prosperity over the next 30 and yet our government has failed to address this injustice that ends now my plan increases the pay floor for teachers to 45 000 a year this is a real investment in our future it s an investment the state not local school districts will make and it s included in this budget this is a fully funded mandate we are going to start competing to recruit and retain the very best education professionals not just in well funded suburban school districts but in every community every zip code in our commonwealth this could be a game changer for our schools especially for our communities that are struggling to attract and retain the next generation of educators in fact most districts that cannot afford to pay their teachers more are located in the heart of rural pennsylvania and it is time to make sure we are investing in educators in those areas today to prepare our kids for the competitive world of tomorrow we re also going to do more to recruit students ambitious brilliant creative young women and men who are looking for the next step in their education our commonwealth is blessed with a terrific system of colleges and universities including community colleges we all know that our post secondary institutions are laboratories for innovation but they are also launch pads for job creators and the skilled workers that will fill those jobs that s why my plan creates a new grant program for students who graduate from a pennsylvania community college with an associate s degree or other industry recognized credential and then stay in pennsylvania to start their careers if you re willing to put your newly acquired skills to work here in our commonwealth the least we can do is help you avoid carrying around a crushing burden of student debt and if you re a parent who wants to trade up from a job that pays the bills to a job that can sustain your family my plan includes a parent pathway initiative designed to help you get the education you need to get ahead even while you prepare your own kids for success indeed my workforce program isn t just about the jobs of tomorrow it s about the jobs of today last year we launched pasmart a comprehensive new initiative focusing on stem skills apprenticeships career counseling and public private partnerships no matter how old you are now is a great time to acquire new skills and we want to make that opportunity available to every pennsylvanian as part of the pasmart initiative we just launched a new website pa smart dot gov that consolidates workforce resources and information for pennsylvanians who want to get training and education to enter the workforce or expand their skills it s similar to the business one stop shop we built last year and that we re still improving upon we need comprehensive digital portals for both businesses and workers that gets them all the information they need in one place and breaks down agency barriers this year i m proposing 10 million in new funding for pasmart so we can fill more advanced manufacturing positions help more non traditional students obtain the training they need to compete in the job market and create more jobs at better wages for more pennsylvania workers this program also includes funding to help returning veterans get the training they need to continue their contributions to our commonwealth as members of our workforce and even better that funding is transferable meaning that veterans can use it to help their kids get a college degree or career credential as well it s a gi bill for pennsylvania one more thing we cannot comprehensively address our workforce development system without fixing our criminal justice system tens of thousands of pennsylvanians are shut out of our workforce or underemployed because of mistakes they ve made in their past families are being denied providers employers are being denied skilled workers we ve already passed clean slate legislation making us the first state in the country to do so but we need to go further and make our criminal justice system more equitable and fair while helping people who have made amends enter the workforce indeed even as we work on this budget we also have to improve re entry programs and make it easier for those who have done their time to succeed in the workforce and their daily lives our challenge demands an all hands on deck approach and this budget proposal itself asks pennsylvanians to come together business leaders educators students parents workers to address the challenge of renewing our prosperity for another generation in my inaugural address i asked us to do our best right here in harrisburg to do two things first to ensure that the interests of all pennsylvanians are reflected in the policies we pursue and second to show the world that pennsylvanians know how to make representative democracy work this budget is the embodiment of that noble effort it asks for no new taxes no new burdens on our citizens while at the same time increasing dramatically our investments in the public goods that will make life better for all pennsylvanians this budget recognizes that government should not try to do everything we have a long held faith in our tradition of limited government and individual responsibility but it also recognizes that government should not do nothing either the public goods government invests in should make the lives of our fellow citizens better public goods that give pennsylvanians the skills they need to thrive in our 21st century economy public goods that promote their safety and health public goods that connect them more seamlessly with each other public goods that keep our air and water clean that s what this budget aims to do it makes investments in workforce readiness our early childhood system our schools our universities our community colleges our apprenticeship training programs it makes investments in ensuring that pennsylvanians of all ages have real choices when it comes to their health care decisions and it continues to prioritize the fight against the opioid epidemic that has destroyed the lives of so many of our friends and neighbors but above all else this budget proclaims to the world that right here in pennsylvania we do not indulge in the sterile politics of anger and insult that here we know how to engage in the respectful and honest give and take that must stand at the heart of a functional democracy while the rest of this country and indeed the rest of the world descends into divisive nasty and unproductive bouts of shouting we are showing everyone else how democracy is supposed to work so this is our challenge it s not just about yet another budget it s about our democracy let us show the world along with the rest of our country that right here in pennsylvania we are making this experiment work that we are re dedicating ourselves to this noble experiment in democratic self governance let s show that in the way we tackle the challenge of preparing our commonwealth for a brighter future starting with this budget this and no less than this is our task this is also our privilege may god bless us in this task and may god bless the commonwealth of pennsylvania thank you
candice bangsund cfa is vice president and portfolio manager global asset allocation at fiera capital corp although equity investors were sides wiped at the end of 2018 in what was an erratic trading environment the good news is that global equity markets have regained some momentum so far this year which has lent support to our view that the profound pullback witnessed in late 2018 was largely overdone late last year global equity markets posted their worst quarterly results since 2011 as investors worried about global trade tensions rising borrowing costs and worrisome signs of slowing global growth already we are seeing some encouraging developments that could see both price to earnings multiples and earnings expectations revert higher over the course of the year namely the worst of the trade tensions may be behind us the united states mexico canada agreement has been signed auto tariffs have been sidelined and the united states has held off on imposing additional tariffs for now what s more china has made some important concessions to the united states specifically pledging to reduce the trade deficit by purchasing more u s agricultural products all of which has indicated some willingness to compromise on trade also there are some tentative signs that continuing accommodation from major central banks and even some increasing of monetary and fiscal support from china could help to stabilize global growth finally while market sentiment remains fragile the preconditions for a recession remain elusive looking ahead global equity markets should remain well supported by the vigorous economic backdrop healthy corporate earnings prospects and reasonable valuations while the pragmatic approach to central bank normalization should allow the economic upswing to continue on uninterrupted helping to counter any geopolitical uncertainties at hand regional strategy leadership rotation under way after an extended period of u s outperformance we expect equity market leadership to rotate toward non u s stock markets in 2019 over the past few years a predominant theme in equity markets has been the glaring outperformance of growth strategies compared with their value counterparts which was most visible in the performance disparity between the united states and its global peers specifically unnerved and growth starved investors propelled toward the high octane sectors of the marketplace such as technology which resulted in a sizable valuation gap between the s p 500 index and the msci all country world index its largest since the depths of the financial crisis however we expect this growth domination to unwind as investors embrace increasingly self sustaining global economic growth and the corresponding rise in interest rates an environment in which value oriented investments typically thrive taken together we expect a rotation toward the underowned and underappreciated value oriented space with important implications for both canadian and emerging market stocks which have been punished despite their sound fundamentals leaving them ripe for a reversal should lingering trade headwinds recede and fundamentals begin to matter again u s equities priced for perfection while u s equities should indeed thrive on a backdrop of buoyant domestic growth and earnings much of the good news is already priced in as a result we expect that upside for the s p 500 is limited compared with its global peers and caution is warranted given relatively expensive valuations at a time when the u s federal reserve is leading the charge on interest rate normalization and where the bar for positive earnings surprises remains high furthermore a moderation in earnings expectations appears inevitable as the boost from fiscal stimulus fades in the back half of 2019 while the potential for political gridlock in washington could also be a source of volatility for u s stocks in the coming year canadian equities value back in favour in 2019 in these later stages of the business cycle the global growth landscape has become increasingly entrenched as a result investors will no longer need to search for growth at any price and instead we expect a rotation toward the underappreciated sectors of the market which is inherently positive for the value oriented s p tsx composite index specifically in the energy space shares of producers should be bolstered by the rebound this year in both western canadian select and west texas intermediate crude prices while our expectation for steeper yield curves should benefit the financial sector furthermore sentiment toward canadian stocks has been plagued by numerous headline risks at hand most notably on the trade front even as earnings expectations remained stable as such steep valuation discounts in the context of a sound fundamental backdrop argues for a reversal in the fortunes for the tsx particularly as lingering headwinds fade emerging market equities compelling risk reward proposition emerging market equities have assumed the brunt of the weakness related to the u s china trade dispute and a strengthening u s dollar while pockets of vulnerability indeed exist across select economies turkey and argentina for example we expect weakness to be contained and unlikely to spread more broadly across the emerging market space importantly many emerging market countries have improved their financial positions since the 1997 crisis the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2013 taper tantrum and as such are better able to tolerate higher u s borrowing costs we believe that investor positioning in emerging market stocks remains too pessimistic in the context of superior growth prospects compared with the developed world reasonably bright earnings momentum and attractive valuations while a less aggressive federal reserve and softer u s dollar conditions should also alleviate some of the pressure on emerging market assets in general

president and chief executive officer thanks makela at the end of 2018 the market drawdown volatility and industrywide outflows dominated attention our aum declined by more than 17 and our stock price declined by more than 30 since december 31st our aum has appreciated 9 to approximately 105 billion due to investment returns including alpha and net inflows in january advertisement advertisement we understand that markets will be volatile and price can become dislocated from fundamentals we have designed our p l and capital structure to maintain our business integrity to periods of volatility and we constantly repeat our long term mantra stability and a long term mindset position our investment teams and business to take advantage of opportunities during periods of dislocation and disruption despite the fourth quarter 2018 was one of our most successful years ever from a financial perspective we generated 828 6 million in revenue we maintained a 36 8 operating margin while continued to reinvest in talent technology and new investment capabilities we generated 2 94 of adjusted eps and we paid or declared a total of 3 39 per share of dividends with respect to 2018 our run rate cash generation yield is approximately 12 and as i will discuss in a minute we have numerous embedded options to drive future growth and capital value we re not trying to be all things to all people and we re not trying to solve for short term periods we don t design our launch strategies to smooth cash flow outcomes we avoid the wrong relationships and we maintain our investment integrity and pricing power we don t guess with our balance sheet investment decisions or capital management policy we simply remain focused on providing the best home for talent to deliver high value added outcomes for clients we aim to be the ultimate investment and client focused firm the ideal home for unique investment talent and a firm that always prioritizes existing clients over sales that requires discipline patience and time we have launched nine investment teams in our history we have merged one team into another team and we recently split one team into two teams each of our teams spending multiple time periods and asset classes has successfully delivered value added outcomes for clients artisan s edge is the combination of our talent and our environment basically all the stuff we repeat over and over about who we are advertisement advertisement we believe artisan partners is the ideal home for passionate and independent thinkers who want to build investment franchises to own the outcomes with as few distractions as possible the priority we place on investments and talent permeates our firm each investment team has complete autonomy over its investment process and decision making each team is built resourced and involved in a way that works best for the team we don t dictate structure people or resources but we do provide full strategic distribution and operational support to implement what works best for each team and maximize time spent investing we thoughtfully manage capacity to protect the investment process and client outcomes our economic model creates transparent long term alignment for our investment teams and our long term patient approach gives teams the time to work through difficult periods and execute over full market cycles the combination of these attributes is powerful and unique through our structure and culture we generate differentiated outcomes for clients cultivate existing talent and teams and attract great new talent in that regard we believe artisan partners has become an even more attractive home for investment talent it s becoming increasingly difficult expensive and time consuming for a great investor to go it alone and start his or her own firm advertisement advertisement on the other end of the spectrum we believe many financial conglomerates are de emphasizing their own high value added investment capabilities in favor of exposure or solution oriented businesses the change in industry landscape creates an additional opportunities for us to partner with great new talent going forward more investment leaders like those who have joined us over the last six years bryan krug lewis kaufman chris smith and most recently rezo kanovich on slide three we show how our talent and model have delivered investment results a hypothetical portfolio of 1 million invested at the inception of each of our 19 current and historical strategies has grown to 72 6 million at the end of 2018 after fees that s 22 8 million or 45 more than the hypothetical benchmark index portfolio net of fees 15 of our 17 current strategies have generated meaningful outperformance relative to their broad based benchmark since inception in addition to performing well relative to the passive benchmarks our strategies have performed well compared to active peers of our 15 strategies with a corresponding lipper fund ratings 10 have inception to date lipper rankings in the top decile of their peer group advertisement advertisement as you can see along the bottom of the page we have grown and diversified our autonomous teams and unique sources of alpha over time today we have more and more diverse sources of alpha than ever before slide four shows the long term track record of each investment team we view the combination of these track records and the talent behind them as giving us numerous embedded options for future growth our growth team had strong performance across all four strategies in 2018 we continue to see healthy flows into the global opportunities strategy and we are excited about the growth potential of the global discovery strategy which combines the punching power of mid cap with the flexibility of the global opportunity set for calendar year 2018 net of fees the growth team strategies added 71 542 653 and 1 353 basis points of outperformance compared to the broad based benchmarks on our global equity team rezo kanovich and its two analysts are established and we have reconfigured the non us small cap growth strategy into non us small mid growth given the team greater degrees of freedom we are seeing strong early interest from clients consultants and intermediaries advertisement advertisement the broader global equity team s non us growth and global equity strategies both performed well on a relative basis in 2018 outperforming their benchmarks by 316 and 650 basis points respectively after fees the global equity strategy has a strong long term track record considerable capacity and has opened across all investment channels we recently reopened the non us growth strategy as well during the fourth quarter international value and global value teams evolved into two separate teams both teams have strong long term track records and compelling brands our emerging markets team has an outstanding three and five year track record relative to the index and peers the team has stable leadership and talent and has consistent philosophy and process in addition hardly a day passes without a press release or news story about demand for strategies that incorporate esg or for strategies managed by women or minorities if artisan emerging markets team checks all those boxes the credit team is approaching its five year mark for the since inception period the high income fund is ranked number 5 of 496 funds in the lipper high yield funds category in both the high income and the credit opportunities strategy the team has considerable flexibility to navigate the maturing credit cycle in a uncertain interest rate environment as it is designed to do the developing world strategy provided meaningful downside protection in the fourth quarter outperforming the emerging markets index by over 350 basis points after fees we expect to see demand for the strategy pickup again from investors seeking a differentiated exposure to emerging markets growth advertisement advertisement thematic team s long and long short strategies both had outstanding performance in 2018 for calendar year 2018 the thematic strategy beat the s p 500 by 1 483 basis points after fees we saw increased flows into the team strategy at end of the year and a trend we believe will continue in 2019 we can t predict when these embedded long term growth options will take off but given the talent and track records we feel very good about the long term prospects turning to slide five in 2018 we had firmwide net outflows of 7 4 billion with 4 9 billion of net outflows in the fourth quarter as investors dialed back risks and harvested tax losses for the year net outflows from our two domestic mid cap strategies and from the non us growth strategy accounted for more than 100 of firmwide net outflows so for the year we saw organic growth of about 1 billion across the rest of our business notwithstanding the headlines there is clearly demand for high value added investing that supported by a longer look back as well over the last five years the two domestic mid cap strategies have accounted for essentially all of our firmwide net outflows with the rest of our strategies having in the aggregate flat flows over the last 10 years the rest of our businesses had about 20 billion of net inflows in the near term we expect outflows from the domestic mid cap strategies and international growth will continue to weigh on overall flows at the same time we expect to see organic growth across most if not all of the rest of our strategy advertisement advertisement flows are important they help us retain talent provide growth opportunities for existing talent and attract new talent the importance of flows though pales in comparison to investment returns and alpha generation the reason we exist our fundamental purpose is to generate and compound wealth for our existing clients and investors we will always prioritize investing over asset raising moreover as high value added investment firm we expect investment returns not flows to drive our long term growth we have always maintained that flows will be lumpy and we don t seek to engineer a smooth short term flows our long term view is shaped by our experience with prospects consultants and clients successful long term outcomes follow firms with stability integrity and performance over the last 10 years our cumulative net flows have been essentially flat nonetheless over that time our aum has grown from 30 6 billion to 96 2 billion at the end of 2018 a compounded annual growth rate of over 12 essentially all of that growth is a product of the investment returns we have generated for clients yes that includes the benefit of broad market returns during the long bull market but it also includes significant alpha that our teams have generated over and above broad market indices after fees just to take a few examples of our largest strategies over the 10 year period the non us growth strategy generated 200 basis points of average annual alpha non us value generated 374 basis points annually us mid cap growth 98 basis points annually global value 224 basis points annually global opportunities 564 basis points annually generating alpha and compounding returns is a powerful growth engine for our clients and investors wealth and for our firm by generating alpha we linked in ph the duration of our client relationships which allows us to maintain our investment first mentality we don t have to prioritize distribution in order to thrive and grow as a firm we need a sufficient asset base to retain grow and attract talent once we have that we expect the bulk of our growth as a firm to come from the outcomes we generate for clients not from new assets as i said earlier flows are important and we rather not experience the level of outflows we have seen in our mid cap strategies the crucial point is that we are not focused on smoothing flows or generating short term organic growth we are focused on providing the best home for talent to deliver high value added outcomes for clients if we deliver for our clients we are confident we will also generate successful long term outcomes for our people and our owners i will now turn it over to c j to discuss our recent financial outcomes charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks eric financial highlights for the quarter and year are presented on slide seven i will focus as i always do my comments on adjusted results which we utilize to evaluate our business results and operations during the fourth quarter sharp global equity market declines drove assets that we manage from 117 billion at the beginning of the quarter to 96 billion at december 31 markets have since rebounded and our aum was up 9 to 105 billion as of the end of january the market declines in the december quarter provided a great example of the transparency and predictability of our financial model december quarter end aum of 96 2 billion was down 17 due to the lower equity markets and 4 9 billion of net client cash outflows during the quarter average aum and revenues were down 10 from the september quarter and our largest expenses which vary directly with revenue were also down in line with revenues fixed operating expenses this quarter included the anticipated onetime onboarding costs for personnel additions related to the non us small mid growth strategy our operating margin was 33 5 driven down from previous quarters mostly because of the sharp declines in revenues adjusted earnings per adjusted share were 0 61 in contrast for the year and despite lower aum in the december quarter average aum grew 5 primarily due to strong markets and modest outflows leading into the last quarter of the year revenues also grew 4 as the related variable expenses fixed costs were up over 2017 by 5 and included the onboarding costs related to the non us small mid cap strategy cost related to the relocation to new office space for two of our investment teams and higher compensation costs related to additional headcount and the january 2018 equity based compensation grant adjusted operating margin was 36 8 compared to 37 6 last year adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per adjusted share increased 24 and 22 respectively reflecting primarily the benefit of tax reform as well as higher revenues assets under management and net client cash flows are on slide eight during the december quarter aum decreased 20 3 billion or 17 compared to 116 6 billion at the end of the previous quarter and was down 17 from assets of 115 5 billion at the end of the same quarter last year the net outflows in the december quarter were driven by net outflows in our non us growth us mid cap growth and non us value strategies net outflows in the quarter were due in large part from tax loss selling and risk of ph client redemptions after several consecutive years of positive returns the sharp reversal of the markets in the fourth quarter provided investors the opportunity to realize losses to offset gains and we experienced significant outflows because of the tax loss selling we anticipate and are beginning to see january inflows from some of those client assets that redeemed in december for tax loss reasons the flow picture in january was an encouraging start to the new year the december quarter also included 850 million of net client cash outflows from distributions from artisan funds that were not reinvested net outflows for the year were 7 4 billion were also driven by outflows in non us growth and our two mid cap strategies turning to revenues on slide nine revenues of 191 5 million in the december quarter were down 10 compared to the september quarter and down 9 compared to the december quarter of last year both inline with declines in average assets under management there was no significant change in the effective fee rate for the quarter given higher levels of aum in the first three quarters of the year revenues for the year were 828 6 million and grew 4 compared to the prior year our weighted average investment management fee remained at 73 basis points in 2018 which included 3 million of performance based fees operating expenses are presented on slide 10 operating expenses for the december 2018 quarter were 127 3 million 3 less than operating expenses in the september 2018 quarter reflecting lower variable incentive compensation and distribution expenses which were partially offset by approximately 5 million of our onboarding costs related to the new team members of the non us small mid cap growth strategy for the year operating expenses were 523 7 million up 27 2 million or 5 from the prior year most of this increase was in compensation and benefits expense which we presented on the next page in addition in 2018 we invested in investment and distribution related technology capabilities and relocated one of our new york investment teams and our now denver based investment team to new office locations consistent with the guidance we provided during our 3q earnings call run rate occupancy expense in 2019 is expected to be approximately 5 million per quarter and we expect we will incur incremental relocation charges in the first quarter of 2019 of approximately 2 million technology costs will continue to average about 10 million a quarter throughout 2019 the technology spend does not occur pro rata over the year as technology project costs can be lumpy the spend reflects an increase in market data costs necessary system upgrades and further development of capabilities to support our investment teams and marketing capabilities further detail on compensation and benefits expenses are presented on slide 11 in the december quarter compensation and benefits costs declined but rose as a percentage of revenues as a result of the the onboarding costs mentioned earlier incentive compensation declined with revenues and as a percentage of revenues remained consistent with the september quarter equity based compensation expense declined as we continue to roll off expenses related to earlier equity awards for the year the largest driver of the change in compensation and benefits expense was higher incentive compensation salary increased due to additional headcount and annual merit increases full year equity based compensation expense increased due to the 2018 equity grant consistent with our historical practice we granted equity awards this quarter which increased shares outstanding by approximately 960 000 shares we expect full year equity based compensation expense to be approximately 42 million in 2019 as higher grant date value awards from five years ago continue to roll off quarterly expense for equity based comp will average approximately 10 5 million but will trend down from 12 million in q1 to 9 million in the fourth quarter seasonal benefits costs which include employer contributions to health and retirement plans and payroll taxes typically increased compensation expense by about 3 million in the first quarter of each year another 1 million of seasonal expense related to non employee director compensation is recorded in the first quarter as well the adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per adjusted share are presented on slide 12 in the december quarter the adjusted operating margin was 33 5 down from 38 5 last quarter and 38 6 for the same quarter of last year onboarding costs accounted for a 2 4 decline in adjusted operating margin adjusted net income per adjusted share was 0 61 and included 0 11 per adjusted share of non cash equity based compensation expense and 0 05 per adjusted share of onboarding expenses we ended the year with an adjusted operating margin of 36 8 less than 1 lower than last year we were able to maintain our margin while making investments in talent technology and infrastructure to further support our business well into the future higher revenues slightly improved operating results and the benefits of tax reform resulted in adjusted net income per adjusted share of 2 94 up from 2 41 or 22 from last year revenues and adjusted earnings per share were the second highest in the firm s history which brings me to our dividend discussion capital management discussion begins on slide 13 our capital management philosophy has been and continues to be payment of a majority if not all of the cash generated from operations in the form of cash dividends including the quarterly and special dividend announced yesterday we will have distributed the majority of the 3 39 of cash generated from operations in 2018 and a pro rata portion of tra related cash savings the 3 39 of dividends paid or declared with respect to the 2018 financial results represents the largest amount of full year dividends we ve made in our history the next side illustrates the transition of our capital management policy to a variable quarterly model the point of this slide is to illustrate that we would have paid the same total amount under the variable dividend policy as our historical fixed dividend policy however under the variable dividend policy cash would have been distributed earlier in the year quarterly dividend just recently declared of 0 56 reflects 80 of the our approximation of the cash generated during the december quarter plus 0 02 of tra related tax benefits from 2018 slide 15 shows a historical look at our dividends transition to a variable quarterly dividend has not changed our intent to distribute the majority of cash we generate it only changes the amount that is paid quarterly to better reflect the operating results of the quarter we expect to follow the same process each january when we consider the payment of a special annual dividend that process involves us assessing the current market environment and business conditions and any needs to retain cash for strategic investment or corporate purposes we expect that the remainder of the cash will continue to be paid as a special annual dividend in february of each year our balance sheet summary is on the last slide our cash position is healthy and leverage remains modest our leverage ratios have improved slightly from last year due to increased levels of earnings looking forward to 2019 beginning aum at 96 billion will be a formidable headwind into 2019 however as a result of positive equity markets and net inflows in the month of january aum is up 9 to 105 billion a good start to 2019 and a welcome turn from the fourth quarter we remain focused on executing our model to provide our talent with the best opportunity to deliver results for our clients that concludes my comments and we look forward to your questions i will now turn the call back to the operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question will come from chris shutler with william blair please go ahead andrew nicholas william blair analyst hi guys good morning this is actually andrew nicholas on for chris eric you made a comment about larger firms shifting toward solutions based investing and it sounds like you view that as a positive for artisan so i m curious are you seeing materially more opportunities today to bring on new talent versus a year ago and what areas are you most interested in eric r colson president and chief executive officer hi andrew it s eric with respect to talent in the marketplace and providing a home for talent that wants to aligned to our structure of investing in a pure sense and in the manner and approach that the individual wants to utilize i believe that the marketplace has given us a better opportunity as i said it s very difficult to start your own firm and go at it alone and it s also more difficult to navigate inside of a large integrated firm define your own space to invest to your philosophy and process given those two trends we believe that it s going to be an uptake ph in opportunity for talent we have seen a variety of individuals over the last year and we just believe our model will provide that home and with regards to the types of strategies again we remain focused on high value added strategies with high degrees of freedom and we re not too specific about are we looking in equity or credit or asset allocation products or are we looking in the illiquid private markets so we re fairly open to strategy andrew nicholas william blair analyst great thanks that s helpful and then looking two mid cap strategies there have been outflows will it be possible to break down their aum by channel and give us a sense if the flow pressure is more specific to one channel versus another i m just trying to understand if there is a level where in those two strategies where you d expect aum to level off or to bottom thanks eric r colson president and chief executive officer sure i can give you the direction in the channel with regards to the exact leveling off number it would be a little bit more difficult but both of those strategies in the early 2000s built up a nice client base and a defined contribution space primarily due to the open architecture that was utilized during that time period and as the shift moved into proprietary closed structures of target date we ve seen the majority of the outflow come from the defined contribution marketplace with regards to exactly where that ll settle at we re unable to give you a specific number until that until we see some settling i think we re probably getting a little closer on the mid cap value and we re experiencing some flows last year in mid cap growth unable to give you an exact number andrew nicholas william blair analyst thanks i appreciate it operator the next question comes from bill katz of citi please go ahead kendall marthaler citi analyst hi good morning this is actually kendall marthaler on for bill katz thanks for taking the question so just given the flow or the aum update would you be able to give a quantity on the flows year to date and also any color on what strategies are driving that rebound eric r colson president and chief executive officer yeah so we re the flow number for january was just just a little over 0 5 billion a lot of that we saw some flows for people that had done some tax loss selling in december and a good portion of flows were international value strategy where we saw a good portion of that tax loss selling in the fourth quarter kendall marthaler citi analyst okay great thanks and then just a quick follow up so given the uptick in the total comp ratio due to the benefits and payroll expense increase and the seasonality expected in 1q how should we be thinking about a more normalized ratio going forward into 19 and 20 eric r colson president and chief executive officer yeah i think our a ratio has been fairly consistent we have on slide 11 you can see the history and so it s generally been running around 48 to 50 so i think that s sort of a good run rate as revenues grow it ticks down a little bit but as you saw in the fourth quarter when revenues declined because of declines in aum it ticks up a little more to the 50 to 51 just the impact of those fixed portions of of the comps costs kendall marthaler citi analyst ok great thank you operator our next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital markets kenneth lee rbc capital market analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just in terms of the when you look across the investment strategy it looks as if you the investment constraints have been been lifted across many of them maybe you could comment on how you think about the additional investment capacity that s available across these strategies and whether what you think about in terms of potential changes in terms of profile of net flows given the reopenings thanks eric r colson president and chief executive officer certainly we ve reopened two strategies recently with regards to the us mid cap growth strategy and non us growth strategy and last year i believe we did the us mid cap value strategy and we have been taking a look at the dynamics of capacity in all three of those cases you ve seen some outflows in the strategies and we ve also seen increased degrees of freedom and so the combination of the markets expanding for us with degrees ph of freedom as well as capacity opening up because of outflows we ve reopened those strategies and believe that we have good opportunity for growth on a go forward basis with them kenneth lee rbc capital market analyst great and then just one quick follow up just in terms of the potential sources of funding for the dividend this year any latest update on potential excess cash on balance sheet that could be available and whether in terms of market volatility how much that could potentially change in terms of either holding onto an additional cash buffer or things of that nature thanks charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we ve had a very consistent balance sheet policy since becoming public and we ve always maintained about 100 million of excess cash on our balance sheet so when you look at our balance sheet everything above 100 million is either available or is either spoken forward through accrued payables or taxes or dividends that we would expect to pay or declare in the future that 100 million of excess we utilize that for seed investments we currently have about 40 million of that 100 million in seed products currently and that s been pretty much the majority of this year and then but that will eventually come back and restore that 100 million of cash and so there really has been no change in the way we think about that kenneth lee rbc capital market analyst okay great thank you operator the next question will be from dan fannon with jefferies please go ahead james steele jefferies analyst hi this is actually james steele filling in dan fannon just curious on the flow trends by channel it looks like the separately managed accounts held up a little bit better then funds in the fourth quarter is that just due to the funds being more susceptible to tax loss harvesting ir is there something more encouraging going on in the accounts business eric r colson president and chief executive officer no i don t think it s anything more than what you suggest i mean we were through the first three quarters of the year flows were quite muted compared to the prior year and as you saw it picked up quite a bit in the fourth quarter and that was we believe both the sort of the risk off as well as the tax loss selling james steele jefferies analyst understood thank you operator the next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead sean colman bank of america analyst hey guys this is actually sean colman ph on for mike just a quick one on flows so despite the net outflows last quarter it looks like gross client inflows were actually very strong and i was hoping you could give us a little more detail on what you think may have driven that charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i think 3q was quite low due to the seasonality that we typically see and we the first and fourth quarters historically are much greater on a gross basis so other than that there really isn t anything that we re aware of on the inflow side sean colman bank of america analyst okay thanks and then one more on the reopening in the funds can you just give us a quick update on which ones or what percent of aum are fully open versus soft closed and hard closed charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer certainly sean on page four of our deck where we have embedded optionality on the far right we list out what s opened and what s partially open there and that will give you a good indication there with regards to partial open being similar to a soft close there sean colman bank of america analyst okay thanks operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session and thus concludes today s call we thank you very much for attending today s presentation at this time you may now disconnect take care duration 42 minutes call participants makela taphorn director investor relations eric r colson president and chief executive officer charles james daley

all figures in us dollars unless otherwise stated a global multi sector capital allocator breadth provides advantage brookfield property partners lp bpy tsx bpy un or bpy and its predecessor entities have for many years capitalized on the fact that the real estate industry is cyclical and that regions or asset classes do not move synchronously therefore a diversified by property type and geography portfolio should demonstrate greater long term stability than one with a specific geographic or property focus moreover bpy s flexibility to shift capital to or from sectors and geographies that are in or out of favour gives it an edge to deliver premium risk weighted returns bpy is a diversified global real estate company that develops owns and operates one of the largest portfolios of office retail multifamily industrial hospitality triple net lease self storage student housing and manufactured housing assets bpy s investment objective is to generate attractive long term returns on equity roe of 12 to 15 with stable cash flows and asset appreciation plus an annual distribution growth of 5 to 8 bpy management seeks to do this by acquiring high quality assets in resilient dynamic markets and pursuing diversification across geographic areas and real estate sectors they continually recycle assets selling stabilized assets at or near peak values and reinvesting the proceeds into higher yielding strategies bpy s portfolio features some of the world s best known commercial properties including brookfield place in toronto canary wharf in london potsdamer platz in berlin and brookfield place built as and still commonly referred to as the world financial center located across west street from the world trade center in the battery park neighborhood of manhattan brookfield place in new york bpy is structured as a bermuda based limited partnership it is the publicly traded real estate arm that is majority owned by toronto based brookfield asset management bam tsx bam or bam brookfield asset management has a reputation as one of the shrewdest global real estate investors bpy debuted on the toronto stock exchange in december of 2013 after it was spun out from the parent company the units trade in new york as well bam owns 53 of bpy which has 42 of its assets in malls and other retail properties 41 in office buildings and 17 in private real estate funds run by bam bpy invests alongside institutional investors in the private funds those private funds have a strong track record with 20 annual historical net returns and an emphasis on buying undervalued assets brookfield has a super high quality real estate portfolio and allows holders to invest alongside a talented management team at a significant discount to net asset value canary wharf in london source google images unlike u s reits bpy provides a quarterly estimate of its net asset value based on international accounting standards using appraisals and cash flow analysis the nav was more than 28 a share on sept 30 the private ownership of bpy s portfolio companies provides the overall business with significant operating flexibility including the ability to undertake projects with a scope scale and time horizon that would not be possible within a smaller organization the private ownership model also provides bpy with greater access to free cash flow and up financing opportunities from which it can source capital to redeploy into other investment activities bpy s 160 billion portfolio includes assets in north and south america europe and asia pacific because its assets are diversified by sector and geography the portfolio s exposure to movements in any single market is reduced minimizing volatility the partnership owns more than 450 million square feet of commercial space and employs some 17 000 people bpy is one of the world s largest real estate operations with broad diversification both geographically and by sector as the saying goes they aren t making any more land and bpy controls a sizeable amount of what exists you now have the chance to invest in a quality asset at a time when the units are on sale brookfield asset management focuses its investment activities in markets with high barriers to entry where the bam team has informational operational or other competitive advantages its local presence combined with the global scale of its operating platforms means that it has unique access to real estate investment opportunities across all major markets and asset classes bpy s strategy of pursuing undervalued properties led to a huge deal last year when in august 2018 it completed a 15 billion takeover of chicago based ggp inc bprap an s p 500 company focused exclusively on owning managing leasing and redeveloping high quality retail properties throughout the united states ggp was the second largest u s mall owner behind simon property group spg brookfield first bought into ggp in 2010 helping the latter emerge from bankruptcy with a 2 5 billion investment that was made in return for approximately 26 of the company hedge fund manager bill ackman s pershing square otcpk pshzf also invested at the time putting up 1 1 billion in exchange for an 11 stake this transaction has transformed bpy into one of the largest commercial real estate companies in the world with an ownership interest in about 90 billion worth of assets the move significantly expands the u s portfolio of bpy and its subsidiaries including a new publicly listed reit that was created as a result of the deal brookfield property reit bpr or bpr bpr is a subsidiary of bpy intended to offer investors economic equivalence to bpy units but in the form of a u s reit security dividends on bpr shares are identical in amount and timing to distributions paid out for bpy units and bpr shares are exchangeable on a 1 1 basis for bpy units or their cash equivalence bpy was also part of a consortium that acquired two retail malls totalling 650 000 square feet in shanghai for us 285 million bpy s share was us 72 million over the coming decades bpy believes that its in house capabilities and expertise across a wide swath of property sectors will allow for the redevelopment reconfiguration and intensification of ggp s retail properties into alternate or mixed use formats at a more rapid pace and at better financial returns than might be possible by ggp as a stand alone company since bpy made its big bet on shopping malls last year investors haven t been impressed the hesitation from investors since then is understandable consumers are increasingly turning to online stores in particular amazon amzn which raises questions about the future of bricks and mortar retailing it didn t help that the united states had too many malls even when online shopping was a novelty chasing high yields can get investors into trouble if they gravitate toward companies whose business models are weak bpy s business model is solid and there are four reasons its contrarian take on malls should pay off making the yield more of a gift than a warning sign first brookfield got a good price for ggp malls are out of favour which the bloomberg reit regional mall index makes clear the seven member basket of real estate investment trusts which includes simon and taubman centers inc tco fell 38 from august 2016 to its low in april amid the failure of sears and toys r us although brookfield ended up sweetening its initial bid for ggp some analysts felt that the final price was still too low second bpy already owned a 34 stake in ggp before making its bid for full ownership and in 2016 brookfield bought rouse properties inc a reit that owned 35 malls in 21 u s states this track record suggests that brookfield isn t experimenting with an unproven contrarian concept here rather it suggests the company s earlier bet on malls is showing signs of paying off third brookfield has solid backing if you are concerned that bpy is a lone contrarian in an environment dominated by mall skeptics here is a comforting fact sophisticated long term institutional investors including the california public employees retirement system calpers cbre group inc cbre and th real estate an affiliate of tiaa together they have assets of us 560 billion have sided with brookfield by taking stakes in select ggp malls fourth the demise of malls is overstated there is no doubt that online retailers are grabbing business from traditional outlets but total online sales are still hovering around 10 which doesn t point to mall extinction as well malls come in various grades many informed observers believe that the top grade the class a malls that underpin brookfield s portfolio are better positioned to survive a further migration toward online shopping especially as the mix of tenants shifts toward businesses such as gyms shared office space and even online merchants that want storefronts according to reis inc reis a company that provides data on commercial real estate u s neighbourhood and community shopping centres are holding the line on vacancy rates at 10 2 and even raised asking rents year over year by 1 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 suggesting that owners can fill empty spaces data shows that high end malls in better locations are thriving while those in weaker areas are seeing declines that are dragging down the average ggp owned high quality retail properties in the u s including several locations on new york city s fifth avenue not a bunch of third tier malls that were getting destroyed by the internet bpy is focused on offering unique experiences at its malls giving customers a reason to go there beyond shopping there are malls that no matter what happens online the real estate is still worth a lot of money and people will go to and there will be things that the landlords do to make that a fun place to be whether it is shopping dining training or other activities malls are evolving but they are not disappearing the deal created one of the largest listed property companies in the world with an ownership interest in almost 100 billion of premier real estate assets globally and annual net operating income of approximately 5 billion bpy has the heft and financial backing to renovate and expand existing malls to meet these new demands you can wait for concrete evidence that it is succeeding but investors who pounce now will most likely get a better price and a bigger dividend yield the bpy units already weighed down by the ggp bid announcement rising interest rates and slowing global economic activity fell to a five year low on christmas eve but with the units down 25 in 2018 and now yielding a hard to ignore 7 35 perhaps it is time to give shopping malls a closer look for income investors the major attraction of the beaten down stock is its attractive yield bpy has a history of raising its distribution every year and there is no reason to believe this will change the strong underlying portfolio ensures the continuity of cash flow bpy stock has underperformed the market over multiple periods the units have been weighed down by a number of factors including rising interest rates the potential impact of britain s exit from brexit and more specifically to bpy concerns that malls are no longer as safe an investment as they once were three year return for bpy on nasdaq orange and bpy un on the tsx blue data by ycharts bpy is structured in much the same way as two of my other recommendations on seeking alpha brookfield infrastructure lp bip tsx bip un and brookfield renewable partners bep tsx bep un all are limited partnerships based in hamilton bermuda all trade on both the toronto and new york stock exchanges each focuses on a specific area of expertise all offer attractive yields all have a history of regular distribution increases in august 2018 the bpy announced plans to commence development of the third and final office tower of the bay adelaide centre in downtown toronto scotiabank has signed a commitment to lease 420 000 square feet approximately 51 of the building for 15 years as the anchor tenant in 2018 the canadian s p capped reit index posted a price gain of 1 and a total return of 6 with the balance coming from distributions the reit index trounced the toronto stock exchange 9 and fared well relative to property stocks in europe 8 the united states 5 and asia 4 the result was on the heels of a total return of 10 in 2017 i am more optimistic about the forward return potential for 2019 with a projected total return of 12 2019 return outlook more optimistic about return potential in the face of slowing growth concerns many property market related indicators remain favourable including low and relatively steady 5 year and 10 year interest rates financing spreads with an upward bias but still within their long term averages capital flows into direct property and generally strong property fundamentals across most asset classes and in most major markets despite the prevalence of macro indicators that suggest economic deceleration property market fundamentals are supportive of listed property stocks decelerating but continuing gdp growth across the us canada and the global economy residual momentum in the system from high consumer confidence and from low declining unemployment longer term interest rates remain very low mortgage spreads remain below their long term average and corporate credit spreads remain reasonable with respect to retail real estate fundamentals on balance unenclosed retail centres continue to post positive same property noi growth and increasing density values underpin the value of retail real estate of the right type and location bpy is currently priced at a 20 discount its net asset value nav it possesses three key internal drivers of value growth lease rate mark to market via contractual steps and spread capture on rolls office occupancy normalization of 1 to 2 percentage points to 94 to 95 developments and redevelopments which should collectively aid in driving annual nav unit growth over the next three to five years on the heels of the sizable ggp acquisition 2019 s capital allocation operating and financing activities will be centered on enhancing balance sheet flexibility and access to liquidity capital recycling improving core occupancy and advancing the development pipeline repurchasing units at a discount to nav growing distributions in line with growth in underlying cash flows monetizing part or whole interests in mall properties in order to repay ggp related acquisition debt key value drivers for nav unit growth over multi year horizon i see three key internal drivers of value growth the capture of lease rate mark to market by way of contractual steps and renewal or re leasing of maturing leases office occupancy normalization to 94 to 95 completion of the core office and mixed use residential rental development pipeline with regard to the latter bpy s development pipeline totals some 6 million square feet at bpy s share with a total estimated cost of approximately 6 billion this development program should drive nav creation of more than 1 billion thus helping to drive nav unit growth over the next three to five years additionally bpy s recent privatization of ggp has weighed on the unit price looking forward this should be resolved and the units valuation should return to the historical norm distributions and buybacks the current quarterly payout is 0 315 per unit 1 26 per year distributions are paid in march june september and december recent history suggests we should expect an increase in the first quarter of 2019 the partnership received approval last august for a normal course issuer bid ncib to buy up to 21 091 764 limited partnership units representing approximately 10 of its public float over the period ending august 19 2019 under the previous bid bpy purchased 733 235 units at a weighted average price of 19 02 funds from operations ffo and distribution profile strong ffo unit growth has pushed the ffo payout ratio down to the low 80s distributions have been growing at about 6 annually for the past three years and this pace should be maintained for the foreseeable future including another distribution increase likely to be announced in february of this year estimates price target and rating bpy aims to generate annual ffo growth of 7 to 9 over the next five years and increase the distribution at a 5 to 8 rate it also aims to realize 500 million in annual gains from its investments in bam led real estate funds these are ambitious goals which are not fully reflected in the unit price bpy has a higher ffo distribution payout ratio of its than do major u s reits which yield an average of 4 the company is valued at about 11x projected ffo of 1 59 per unit a discount to u s reits my primary target valuation metric for bpy is p ffo bpy s ffo per unit was 1 45 in 2017 analysts consensus estimates for ffo unit estimates for 2019 and 2020 are 1 67 and 1 70 respectively my 25 price target represents a 37 premium to bpy s closing price of 18 20 last friday and a ffo multiple of 14 5x and 14 7x for 2019 and 2020 i believe my target valuation reasonably reflects bpy s unique structural elements for example its high quality portfolio of premier properties its unique relationship with bam including the master service agreement between the two companies its high financial leverage which allows bpy to earn a disproportionate amount on its assets and accelerate revenue growth despite the risk potential risks even excellent companies come with risks there is no such thing as a risk free stock in fact there is no such thing as a risk free return most people only associate risk with loss while stuffing money under the mattress will avoid stock market risk it simply exposes that money to other risks such as purchasing power risk or inflation risk in other words the risk of avoiding risk in my article on bce i described it as a widows and orphans stock bpy has a higher risk model than bce but it comes with a higher yield and dividend growth rate which are two of its attractive features reflecting the private equity mindset at bpy the company has much higher leverage than comparable u s reits bpy s debt totals 46 billion versus equity of 28 billion brookfield s ratio of debt to annual cash flow is about 12x double the average of major u s reits that leverage which magnifies returns and increases risk has lately been a negative for the company as investors focus on the health of corporate balance sheets in bpy s case a significant change to long term interest rates would be a material headwind given its financial leverage and the capital intensive nature of its business model rising interest rates have cooled considerably in 2019 rising rates negatively affect property stocks in two ways first these companies are heavily leveraged so when loans come up for renewal the interest rates charged will increase second higher rates for safe government bonds means investors demand improved yields from more risky securities that tends to depress share prices which pushes up yields the longer term risk is a prolonged recession which would have the effect of reducing occupancy rates putting downward pressure on rents and reducing the market value of properties if the downturn were serious enough it could result in a freeze on distributions or even a reduction in the payout specific risks include acquisitions that do not add value or fail to gain the confidence of investors an increase in interest rates and or equity risk premiums foreign exchange rates impacting the value of non us generating investments i enjoy researching and writing articles on quality companies for seeking alpha investing is a hobby of mine as is writing and it is rewarding to be able to productively combine the two hobbies i had a long career in

president and chief executive officer thanks makela at the end of 2018 the market drawdown volatility and industrywide outflows dominated attention our aum declined by more than 17 and our stock price declined by more than 30 since december 31st our aum has appreciated 9 to approximately 105 billion due to investment returns including alpha and net inflows in january we understand that markets will be volatile and price can become dislocated from fundamentals we have designed our p l and capital structure to maintain our business integrity to periods of volatility and we constantly repeat our long term mantra stability and a long term mindset position our investment teams and business to take advantage of opportunities during periods of dislocation and disruption despite the fourth quarter 2018 was one of our most successful years ever from a financial perspective we generated 828 6 million in revenue we maintained a 36 8 operating margin while continued to reinvest in talent technology and new investment capabilities we generated 2 94 of adjusted eps and we paid or declared a total of 3 39 per share of dividends with respect to 2018 our run rate cash generation yield is approximately 12 and as i will discuss in a minute we have numerous embedded options to drive future growth and capital value we re not trying to be all things to all people and we re not trying to solve for short term periods we don t design our launch strategies to smooth cash flow outcomes we avoid the wrong relationships and we maintain our investment integrity and pricing power we don t guess with our balance sheet investment decisions or capital management policy we simply remain focused on providing the best home for talent to deliver high value added outcomes for clients we aim to be the ultimate investment and client focused firm the ideal home for unique investment talent and a firm that always prioritizes existing clients over sales that requires discipline patience and time we have launched nine investment teams in our history we have merged one team into another team and we recently split one team into two teams each of our teams spending multiple time periods and asset classes has successfully delivered value added outcomes for clients artisan s edge is the combination of our talent and our environment basically all the stuff we repeat over and over about who we are we believe artisan partners is the ideal home for passionate and independent thinkers who want to build investment franchises to own the outcomes with as few distractions as possible the priority we place on investments and talent permeates our firm each investment team has complete autonomy over its investment process and decision making each team is built resourced and involved in a way that works best for the team we don t dictate structure people or resources but we do provide full strategic distribution and operational support to implement what works best for each team and maximize time spent investing we thoughtfully manage capacity to protect the investment process and client outcomes our economic model creates transparent long term alignment for our investment teams and our long term patient approach gives teams the time to work through difficult periods and execute over full market cycles the combination of these attributes is powerful and unique through our structure and culture we generate differentiated outcomes for clients cultivate existing talent and teams and attract great new talent in that regard we believe artisan partners has become an even more attractive home for investment talent it s becoming increasingly difficult expensive and time consuming for a great investor to go it alone and start his or her own firm on the other end of the spectrum we believe many financial conglomerates are de emphasizing their own high value added investment capabilities in favor of exposure or solution oriented businesses the change in industry landscape creates an additional opportunities for us to partner with great new talent going forward more investment leaders like those who have joined us over the last six years bryan krug lewis kaufman chris smith and most recently rezo kanovich on slide three we show how our talent and model have delivered investment results a hypothetical portfolio of 1 million invested at the inception of each of our 19 current and historical strategies has grown to 72 6 million at the end of 2018 after fees that s 22 8 million or 45 more than the hypothetical benchmark index portfolio net of fees 15 of our 17 current strategies have generated meaningful outperformance relative to their broad based benchmark since inception in addition to performing well relative to the passive benchmarks our strategies have performed well compared to active peers of our 15 strategies with a corresponding lipper fund ratings 10 have inception to date lipper rankings in the top decile of their peer group as you can see along the bottom of the page we have grown and diversified our autonomous teams and unique sources of alpha over time today we have more and more diverse sources of alpha than ever before slide four shows the long term track record of each investment team we view the combination of these track records and the talent behind them as giving us numerous embedded options for future growth our growth team had strong performance across all four strategies in 2018 we continue to see healthy flows into the global opportunities strategy and we are excited about the growth potential of the global discovery strategy which combines the punching power of mid cap with the flexibility of the global opportunity set for calendar year 2018 net of fees the growth team strategies added 71 542 653 and 1 353 basis points of outperformance compared to the broad based benchmarks on our global equity team rezo kanovich and its two analysts are established and we have reconfigured the non us small cap growth strategy into non us small mid growth given the team greater degrees of freedom we are seeing strong early interest from clients consultants and intermediaries the broader global equity team s non us growth and global equity strategies both performed well on a relative basis in 2018 outperforming their benchmarks by 316 and 650 basis points respectively after fees the global equity strategy has a strong long term track record considerable capacity and has opened across all investment channels we recently reopened the non us growth strategy as well during the fourth quarter international value and global value teams evolved into two separate teams both teams have strong long term track records and compelling brands our emerging markets team has an outstanding three and five year track record relative to the index and peers the team has stable leadership and talent and has consistent philosophy and process in addition hardly a day passes without a press release or news story about demand for strategies that incorporate esg or for strategies managed by women or minorities if artisan emerging markets team checks all those boxes the credit team is approaching its five year mark for the since inception period the high income fund is ranked number 5 of 496 funds in the lipper high yield funds category in both the high income and the credit opportunities strategy the team has considerable flexibility to navigate the maturing credit cycle in a uncertain interest rate environment as it is designed to do the developing world strategy provided meaningful downside protection in the fourth quarter outperforming the emerging markets index by over 350 basis points after fees we expect to see demand for the strategy pickup again from investors seeking a differentiated exposure to emerging markets growth thematic team s long and long short strategies both had outstanding performance in 2018 for calendar year 2018 the thematic strategy beat the s p 500 by 1 483 basis points after fees we saw increased flows into the team strategy at end of the year and a trend we believe will continue in 2019 we can t predict when these embedded long term growth options will take off but given the talent and track records we feel very good about the long term prospects turning to slide five in 2018 we had firmwide net outflows of 7 4 billion with 4 9 billion of net outflows in the fourth quarter as investors dialed back risks and harvested tax losses for the year net outflows from our two domestic mid cap strategies and from the non us growth strategy accounted for more than 100 of firmwide net outflows so for the year we saw organic growth of about 1 billion across the rest of our business notwithstanding the headlines there is clearly demand for high value added investing that supported by a longer look back as well over the last five years the two domestic mid cap strategies have accounted for essentially all of our firmwide net outflows with the rest of our strategies having in the aggregate flat flows over the last 10 years the rest of our businesses had about 20 billion of net inflows in the near term we expect outflows from the domestic mid cap strategies and international growth will continue to weigh on overall flows at the same time we expect to see organic growth across most if not all of the rest of our strategy flows are important they help us retain talent provide growth opportunities for existing talent and attract new talent the importance of flows though pales in comparison to investment returns and alpha generation the reason we exist our fundamental purpose is to generate and compound wealth for our existing clients and investors we will always prioritize investing over asset raising moreover as high value added investment firm we expect investment returns not flows to drive our long term growth we have always maintained that flows will be lumpy and we don t seek to engineer a smooth short term flows our long term view is shaped by our experience with prospects consultants and clients successful long term outcomes follow firms with stability integrity and performance over the last 10 years our cumulative net flows have been essentially flat nonetheless over that time our aum has grown from 30 6 billion to 96 2 billion at the end of 2018 a compounded annual growth rate of over 12 essentially all of that growth is a product of the investment returns we have generated for clients yes that includes the benefit of broad market returns during the long bull market but it also includes significant alpha that our teams have generated over and above broad market indices after fees just to take a few examples of our largest strategies over the 10 year period the non us growth strategy generated 200 basis points of average annual alpha non us value generated 374 basis points annually us mid cap growth 98 basis points annually global value 224 basis points annually global opportunities 564 basis points annually generating alpha and compounding returns is a powerful growth engine for our clients and investors wealth and for our firm by generating alpha we linked in ph the duration of our client relationships which allows us to maintain our investment first mentality we don t have to prioritize distribution in order to thrive and grow as a firm we need a sufficient asset base to retain grow and attract talent once we have that we expect the bulk of our growth as a firm to come from the outcomes we generate for clients not from new assets as i said earlier flows are important and we rather not experience the level of outflows we have seen in our mid cap strategies the crucial point is that we are not focused on smoothing flows or generating short term organic growth we are focused on providing the best home for talent to deliver high value added outcomes for clients if we deliver for our clients we are confident we will also generate successful long term outcomes for our people and our owners i will now turn it over to c j to discuss our recent financial outcomes charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks eric financial highlights for the quarter and year are presented on slide seven i will focus as i always do my comments on adjusted results which we utilize to evaluate our business results and operations during the fourth quarter sharp global equity market declines drove assets that we manage from 117 billion at the beginning of the quarter to 96 billion at december 31 markets have since rebounded and our aum was up 9 to 105 billion as of the end of january the market declines in the december quarter provided a great example of the transparency and predictability of our financial model december quarter end aum of 96 2 billion was down 17 due to the lower equity markets and 4 9 billion of net client cash outflows during the quarter average aum and revenues were down 10 from the september quarter and our largest expenses which vary directly with revenue were also down in line with revenues fixed operating expenses this quarter included the anticipated onetime onboarding costs for personnel additions related to the non us small mid growth strategy our operating margin was 33 5 driven down from previous quarters mostly because of the sharp declines in revenues adjusted earnings per adjusted share were 0 61 in contrast for the year and despite lower aum in the december quarter average aum grew 5 primarily due to strong markets and modest outflows leading into the last quarter of the year revenues also grew 4 as the related variable expenses fixed costs were up over 2017 by 5 and included the onboarding costs related to the non us small mid cap strategy cost related to the relocation to new office space for two of our investment teams and higher compensation costs related to additional headcount and the january 2018 equity based compensation grant adjusted operating margin was 36 8 compared to 37 6 last year adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per adjusted share increased 24 and 22 respectively reflecting primarily the benefit of tax reform as well as higher revenues assets under management and net client cash flows are on slide eight during the december quarter aum decreased 20 3 billion or 17 compared to 116 6 billion at the end of the previous quarter and was down 17 from assets of 115 5 billion at the end of the same quarter last year the net outflows in the december quarter were driven by net outflows in our non us growth us mid cap growth and non us value strategies net outflows in the quarter were due in large part from tax loss selling and risk of ph client redemptions after several consecutive years of positive returns the sharp reversal of the markets in the fourth quarter provided investors the opportunity to realize losses to offset gains and we experienced significant outflows because of the tax loss selling we anticipate and are beginning to see january inflows from some of those client assets that redeemed in december for tax loss reasons the flow picture in january was an encouraging start to the new year the december quarter also included 850 million of net client cash outflows from distributions from artisan funds that were not reinvested net outflows for the year were 7 4 billion were also driven by outflows in non us growth and our two mid cap strategies turning to revenues on slide nine revenues of 191 5 million in the december quarter were down 10 compared to the september quarter and down 9 compared to the december quarter of last year both inline with declines in average assets under management there was no significant change in the effective fee rate for the quarter given higher levels of aum in the first three quarters of the year revenues for the year were 828 6 million and grew 4 compared to the prior year our weighted average investment management fee remained at 73 basis points in 2018 which included 3 million of performance based fees operating expenses are presented on slide 10 operating expenses for the december 2018 quarter were 127 3 million 3 less than operating expenses in the september 2018 quarter reflecting lower variable incentive compensation and distribution expenses which were partially offset by approximately 5 million of our onboarding costs related to the new team members of the non us small mid cap growth strategy for the year operating expenses were 523 7 million up 27 2 million or 5 from the prior year most of this increase was in compensation and benefits expense which we presented on the next page in addition in 2018 we invested in investment and distribution related technology capabilities and relocated one of our new york investment teams and our now denver based investment team to new office locations consistent with the guidance we provided during our 3q earnings call run rate occupancy expense in 2019 is expected to be approximately 5 million per quarter and we expect we will incur incremental relocation charges in the first quarter of 2019 of approximately 2 million technology costs will continue to average about 10 million a quarter throughout 2019 the technology spend does not occur pro rata over the year as technology project costs can be lumpy the spend reflects an increase in market data costs necessary system upgrades and further development of capabilities to support our investment teams and marketing capabilities further detail on compensation and benefits expenses are presented on slide 11 in the december quarter compensation and benefits costs declined but rose as a percentage of revenues as a result of the the onboarding costs mentioned earlier incentive compensation declined with revenues and as a percentage of revenues remained consistent with the september quarter equity based compensation expense declined as we continue to roll off expenses related to earlier equity awards for the year the largest driver of the change in compensation and benefits expense was higher incentive compensation salary increased due to additional headcount and annual merit increases full year equity based compensation expense increased due to the 2018 equity grant consistent with our historical practice we granted equity awards this quarter which increased shares outstanding by approximately 960 000 shares we expect full year equity based compensation expense to be approximately 42 million in 2019 as higher grant date value awards from five years ago continue to roll off quarterly expense for equity based comp will average approximately 10 5 million but will trend down from 12 million in q1 to 9 million in the fourth quarter seasonal benefits costs which include employer contributions to health and retirement plans and payroll taxes typically increased compensation expense by about 3 million in the first quarter of each year another 1 million of seasonal expense related to non employee director compensation is recorded in the first quarter as well the adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per adjusted share are presented on slide 12 in the december quarter the adjusted operating margin was 33 5 down from 38 5 last quarter and 38 6 for the same quarter of last year onboarding costs accounted for a 2 4 decline in adjusted operating margin adjusted net income per adjusted share was 0 61 and included 0 11 per adjusted share of non cash equity based compensation expense and 0 05 per adjusted share of onboarding expenses we ended the year with an adjusted operating margin of 36 8 less than 1 lower than last year we were able to maintain our margin while making investments in talent technology and infrastructure to further support our business well into the future higher revenues slightly improved operating results and the benefits of tax reform resulted in adjusted net income per adjusted share of 2 94 up from 2 41 or 22 from last year revenues and adjusted earnings per share were the second highest in the firm s history which brings me to our dividend discussion capital management discussion begins on slide 13 our capital management philosophy has been and continues to be payment of a majority if not all of the cash generated from operations in the form of cash dividends including the quarterly and special dividend announced yesterday we will have distributed the majority of the 3 39 of cash generated from operations in 2018 and a pro rata portion of tra related cash savings the 3 39 of dividends paid or declared with respect to the 2018 financial results represents the largest amount of full year dividends we ve made in our history the next side illustrates the transition of our capital management policy to a variable quarterly model the point of this slide is to illustrate that we would have paid the same total amount under the variable dividend policy as our historical fixed dividend policy however under the variable dividend policy cash would have been distributed earlier in the year quarterly dividend just recently declared of 0 56 reflects 80 of the our approximation of the cash generated during the december quarter plus 0 02 of tra related tax benefits from 2018 slide 15 shows a historical look at our dividends transition to a variable quarterly dividend has not changed our intent to distribute the majority of cash we generate it only changes the amount that is paid quarterly to better reflect the operating results of the quarter we expect to follow the same process each january when we consider the payment of a special annual dividend that process involves us assessing the current market environment and business conditions and any needs to retain cash for strategic investment or corporate purposes we expect that the remainder of the cash will continue to be paid as a special annual dividend in february of each year our balance sheet summary is on the last slide our cash position is healthy and leverage remains modest our leverage ratios have improved slightly from last year due to increased levels of earnings looking forward to 2019 beginning aum at 96 billion will be a formidable headwind into 2019 however as a result of positive equity markets and net inflows in the month of january aum is up 9 to 105 billion a good start to 2019 and a welcome turn from the fourth quarter we remain focused on executing our model to provide our talent with the best opportunity to deliver results for our clients that concludes my comments and we look forward to your questions i will now turn the call back to the operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question will come from chris shutler with william blair please go ahead andrew nicholas william blair analyst hi guys good morning this is actually andrew nicholas on for chris eric you made a comment about larger firms shifting toward solutions based investing and it sounds like you view that as a positive for artisan so i m curious are you seeing materially more opportunities today to bring on new talent versus a year ago and what areas are you most interested in eric r colson president and chief executive officer hi andrew it s eric with respect to talent in the marketplace and providing a home for talent that wants to aligned to our structure of investing in a pure sense and in the manner and approach that the individual wants to utilize i believe that the marketplace has given us a better opportunity as i said it s very difficult to start your own firm and go at it alone and it s also more difficult to navigate inside of a large integrated firm define your own space to invest to your philosophy and process given those two trends we believe that it s going to be an uptake ph in opportunity for talent we have seen a variety of individuals over the last year and we just believe our model will provide that home and with regards to the types of strategies again we remain focused on high value added strategies with high degrees of freedom and we re not too specific about are we looking in equity or credit or asset allocation products or are we looking in the illiquid private markets so we re fairly open to strategy andrew nicholas william blair analyst great thanks that s helpful and then looking two mid cap strategies there have been outflows will it be possible to break down their aum by channel and give us a sense if the flow pressure is more specific to one channel versus another i m just trying to understand if there is a level where in those two strategies where you d expect aum to level off or to bottom thanks eric r colson president and chief executive officer sure i can give you the direction in the channel with regards to the exact leveling off number it would be a little bit more difficult but both of those strategies in the early 2000s built up a nice client base and a defined contribution space primarily due to the open architecture that was utilized during that time period and as the shift moved into proprietary closed structures of target date we ve seen the majority of the outflow come from the defined contribution marketplace with regards to exactly where that ll settle at we re unable to give you a specific number until that until we see some settling i think we re probably getting a little closer on the mid cap value and we re experiencing some flows last year in mid cap growth unable to give you an exact number andrew nicholas william blair analyst thanks i appreciate it operator the next question comes from bill katz of citi please go ahead kendall marthaler citi analyst hi good morning this is actually kendall marthaler on for bill katz thanks for taking the question so just given the flow or the aum update would you be able to give a quantity on the flows year to date and also any color on what strategies are driving that rebound eric r colson president and chief executive officer yeah so we re the flow number for january was just just a little over 0 5 billion a lot of that we saw some flows for people that had done some tax loss selling in december and a good portion of flows were international value strategy where we saw a good portion of that tax loss selling in the fourth quarter kendall marthaler citi analyst okay great thanks and then just a quick follow up so given the uptick in the total comp ratio due to the benefits and payroll expense increase and the seasonality expected in 1q how should we be thinking about a more normalized ratio going forward into 19 and 20 eric r colson president and chief executive officer yeah i think our a ratio has been fairly consistent we have on slide 11 you can see the history and so it s generally been running around 48 to 50 so i think that s sort of a good run rate as revenues grow it ticks down a little bit but as you saw in the fourth quarter when revenues declined because of declines in aum it ticks up a little more to the 50 to 51 just the impact of those fixed portions of of the comps costs kendall marthaler citi analyst ok great thank you operator our next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital markets kenneth lee rbc capital market analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just in terms of the when you look across the investment strategy it looks as if you the investment constraints have been been lifted across many of them maybe you could comment on how you think about the additional investment capacity that s available across these strategies and whether what you think about in terms of potential changes in terms of profile of net flows given the reopenings thanks eric r colson president and chief executive officer certainly we ve reopened two strategies recently with regards to the us mid cap growth strategy and non us growth strategy and last year i believe we did the us mid cap value strategy and we have been taking a look at the dynamics of capacity in all three of those cases you ve seen some outflows in the strategies and we ve also seen increased degrees of freedom and so the combination of the markets expanding for us with degrees ph of freedom as well as capacity opening up because of outflows we ve reopened those strategies and believe that we have good opportunity for growth on a go forward basis with them kenneth lee rbc capital market analyst great and then just one quick follow up just in terms of the potential sources of funding for the dividend this year any latest update on potential excess cash on balance sheet that could be available and whether in terms of market volatility how much that could potentially change in terms of either holding onto an additional cash buffer or things of that nature thanks charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we ve had a very consistent balance sheet policy since becoming public and we ve always maintained about 100 million of excess cash on our balance sheet so when you look at our balance sheet everything above 100 million is either available or is either spoken forward through accrued payables or taxes or dividends that we would expect to pay or declare in the future that 100 million of excess we utilize that for seed investments we currently have about 40 million of that 100 million in seed products currently and that s been pretty much the majority of this year and then but that will eventually come back and restore that 100 million of cash and so there really has been no change in the way we think about that kenneth lee rbc capital market analyst okay great thank you operator the next question will be from dan fannon with jefferies please go ahead james steele jefferies analyst hi this is actually james steele filling in dan fannon just curious on the flow trends by channel it looks like the separately managed accounts held up a little bit better then funds in the fourth quarter is that just due to the funds being more susceptible to tax loss harvesting ir is there something more encouraging going on in the accounts business eric r colson president and chief executive officer no i don t think it s anything more than what you suggest i mean we were through the first three quarters of the year flows were quite muted compared to the prior year and as you saw it picked up quite a bit in the fourth quarter and that was we believe both the sort of the risk off as well as the tax loss selling james steele jefferies analyst understood thank you operator the next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead sean colman bank of america analyst hey guys this is actually sean colman ph on for mike just a quick one on flows so despite the net outflows last quarter it looks like gross client inflows were actually very strong and i was hoping you could give us a little more detail on what you think may have driven that charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah i think 3q was quite low due to the seasonality that we typically see and we the first and fourth quarters historically are much greater on a gross basis so other than that there really isn t anything that we re aware of on the inflow side sean colman bank of america analyst okay thanks and then one more on the reopening in the funds can you just give us a quick update on which ones or what percent of aum are fully open versus soft closed and hard closed charles james daley executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer certainly sean on page four of our deck where we have embedded optionality on the far right we list out what s opened and what s partially open there and that will give you a good indication there with regards to partial open being similar to a soft close there sean colman bank of america analyst okay thanks operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session and thus concludes today s call we thank you very much for attending today s presentation at this time you may now disconnect take care duration 42 minutes call participants makela taphorn director investor relations eric r colson president and chief executive officer charles james daley
