the strategic objective is to integrate china into the world economy the liberal international solution was trade investment flows and cultural exchanges the rise of nationalism and china s own willingness to flaunt the international rules are defeating the strategy president trump may suggest that china would prefer to negotiate with his main democrat rival 18 months away from the election both pelosi and schumer s supported the hardline on china indicates a rare united national stance there are short run and longer term consequences most immediately volatility in the equities has risen which is associated with falling stock prices a month ago the vix was near 11 5 now now it is near 17 the msci s index for developed country equities fell 0 5 after shedding 2 4 the previous week it is the first back to back weekly decline this year the msci index of emerging market equities lost 3 6 after dropping 4 2 in the prior week it has given back nearly 3 4 of the gains in the first four months of the year bond yields also fell and in derivative markets futures forwards ois investors seemed to be pricing easier monetary policy the implied yield of the january 2020 fed funds futures contract has fallen nearly 18 bp since trump s tweets than announced the end of tariff truce to about 2 02 the current effective average rate which is what the contract settles at is 2 38 this would seem to be consistent with one cut fully discounted and half of a second cut 50 chance too however with the effective funds rate is still above the interest the fed pays on reserves officials may want to take more action they may continue to cut the interest on reserves to push it lower though we still think a new facility to defend the top of the range as the fed does with the lower end is needed the point here if one allows if one assumes the fed is pushing the interest on reserves to the lower end of the target range then the market has nearly priced in a second cut this year investors are pricing in aggressive rate cuts by the reserve bank of australia which are seen beginning in a few weeks the market even appears to be pricing in an ecb rate cut by the end next year but it is not just policy rates it is also inflation expectations part of the falling inflation expectations is the belief that more trade frictions will cause slower growth however part of it may be the consequence of the breakdown in the liberal strategy for making room at the economic table to a giant economy in some ways it is like the uk leaving the eu there are orderly and disorderly ways it can happen china s sheer size and development orientation mean that it will have a powerful impact on the world economy the real threat that china poses and one that it would still present if it were market oriented democracy is similar to what rise of germany and the us did at the turn of the 20th century it is a huge deflationary thrust china s production capacity for a large number of goods far and away exceed its possible demand of course it brings new demand as well but the new supply is more deflationary than the increase in demand is inflationary supplanting the liberal strategy the trump administration is pursuing a containment strategy which is one of china s longstanding fears it campaigns against the belt road initiative and opposes china s import substitution strategy made in china 2025 with its own make america great again it hardwires into nafta 2 0 that canada and mexico cannot enter into trade agreements with china though apparently the us can it has been forcing chinese companies to divest of internet properties like grindr and patientslikeme the us is selling new fighter planes to taiwan which it recognizes as a province of china it demands that china honors its embargos against iran and north korea the number of chinese students coming to the us to study has fallen chinese direct investment in the us has slowed businesses on both sides are being guided to minimize trips and exposures the passage of a hong kong law will allow extradition to china which the us protested because it makes americans in hong kong more formally at the reach of chinese officials than before the tariffs will encourage many businesses to leave china but that does not mean that the us will be the primary beneficiary just like the bitcoin and other cyber currencies have a fork so can the internet the us ban buying huawei products and selling parts to it could have far reaching implications even if european governments don t go along with it it creates opportunities for huawei s competitors in the 5g space like nokia ericsson and cisco there will be us european protocols and chinese protocols more importantly is china will now have powerful incentives to do two things that will foster the fork first china is largely dependent on foreign semiconductors it will cease to be so since the end of the tariff truce the philadelphia semiconductor index sox has fallen nearly 9 after rallying around 50 from the lows of late last year second given the duopoly for mobile operating systems of us companies ois and android it is strategically necessary for china to introduce its own some reports suggest huawei is prepared to do so if android prevents its use the critical battle next week though is in the foreign exchange market chinese officials have in the past drawn a proverbial line in the sand at cny7 0 the lower end of the approved dollar range we thought was cny6 70 though it did fray it a bit earlier this year the dollar rose against the yuan in the three weeks before trump s tweets and has risen in the two weeks since the cny7 0 area held in late 2016 early 2017 and again at the end of last year and the start of this year the same generally holds for the offshore yuan cnh there are numerous policy levers that the pboc can pull to defend its pain threshold affecting the availability of liquidity as well as the price it can also squeeze cnh shorts in hong kong until now it appears that market forces including the broad strength of the dollar is responsible for the yuan s depreciation and the pboc is perceived to be trying to temper the decline if the cny7 0 level does not hold and the dollar rises through it it will be seen as the inability or more likely the unwillingness of china to mount a credible defense it would likely send ripples through the capital markets this would risk a vicious cycle of a weakening currency and falling stocks because this would distract from china s economic objectives we expect officials will defend it in a way that leaves no room for mistaking its desire meanwhile both the us and china reported disappointing april retail sales and industrial output figures in recent days china will provide additional stimulus the us will not minutes from the last fomc meeting will be released at mid week and will likely confirm that the bar for it to move as the market seems to think probably is rather high that said the economy has lost the momentum seen in q1 the atlanta fed tracker sees q2 gdp at 1 2 while the new york fed s model puts it at 1 8 to the extent that the tariffs are understood as a tax us policymakers will try to look through related price increases just like they would if for example the tax on gasoline was raised economists project that the trade war could shave 0 5 0 75 percentage points off us gdp officials and investors will also want to look past boeing s effect on durable goods orders and shipments which will likely be another headwind the main economic data point from japan next week will be the first look at q1 gdp the monthly reports suggest consumption and investment fell in the first part of the year the risk appears to be on the downside of the median forecast in the bloomberg survey for a 0 1 contraction economists have under appreciated the low prices and weaker growth in asia as a whole and japan in particular consider for example that before the weekend japan reported its march tertiary activities service sector index the bloomberg survey found a median forecast for a 0 1 gain instead it fell by 0 4 the dollar rose to a seven day high before the weekend near jpy110 20 this will likely help lift japanese shares at the start of the new week the nikkei dropped about 7 25 from the year s high in late april to the low early last week which was nearly half of the year s gain it is worth mentioning again that although the sovereign yield curve is negative out a decade the yield on japanese stock indices is high the dividend yield of the nikkei is almost 2 2 and the topix yield is 2 50 higher than the yield on us treasuries european corporations also have high dividend yields the german dax yields nearly 3 2 and france s cac returns 3 3 the ftse 250 pays is yielding almost the same as the cac while italy s ftse milan index has a dividend yield of 4 in comparison the us s p 500 yields a little less 2 europe s economy grew faster in q1 than the survey data suggested the survey data may play a bit of catch up the preliminary may pmi will be reported the manufacturing contraction is expected to ease while the service sector continues to recover the next result will likely be an uptick in the composite there is a reasonably good chance that the q2 composite pmi rises for the first quarterly increase three month average since the end of 2017 the european parliament election begins on may 23 and the results are expected on may 26 the center right and center left groupings people s party and socialist democrats are expected to remain the largest parties but could lose their combined majority in the face of right wing populism and nationalist parties often in the eu parliament elections smaller and more extreme national parties are better presented than in their own national elections farage s brexit party is expected to do particularly well but it has no formal representation in the uk parliament may is expected to lead the tory party into another thrashing but it will be the last one the prime minister is now expected to submit her withdrawal bill for the fourth and final time in early june and then step down the jockeying for position for her successor has already begun before the weekend the us announced that in exchange for stronger enforcement it was lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico while some deal had appeared to be in the works treasury secretary mnuchin explicitly denied that he was referring to ending the tariffs perhaps too we did not appreciate the linkage between the deterioration of trade relations with china and need to improve them elsewhere we suspect that the odds of the new nafta bill being enacted has increased from about 20 to 50 the canadian parliament has about a month to approve it before the summer recess and national election the biggest remaining hurdle is us congressional approval steel tariffs that had been double on turkey were cut back to 25 trump indicated there would be a 180 day delay before he decides whether to levy a 25 tariff on auto imports from europe and japan while the market responded favorably what the us is seeking is a voluntary export restriction which while acceptable under gatt and in violation of the wto rules also the us put new tariff 17 5 tariff on 2 bln mexican tomato imports and re started an old anti dumping probe australia s national election results will be known before the market s open on monday the markets may not have a strong reaction the prospect of a rate cut in a few weeks has helped drive the stock market to new highs since 2007 it has also been a weight alongside the china contagion on the currency which has fallen for five consecutive weeks

when i was in my early 20s i thought socialism might be the way to go two things happened one i studied economics which led me to the conclusion that socialism heavy state intervention doesn t lead to the best outcome in terms of living standards for most second i had the benefit of a trip to the ussr before it and the eastern bloc disintegrated it must have been paul mccartney s faux beach boys back in the ussr that got me interested sure the history and scenery were fantastic and i like the fact that i saw it before the wall came down but economically it was a mess and trying to spend excess roubles before we left the ussr was a struggle nothing but off chocolate to spend them on socialism seemed to work a bit better in the deutsche democratic republic but not really and it was a relief to come through checkpoint charlie knowing decent food mcdonald s was waiting so i ended up gravitating to the centre with the view that the best approach is to allow a market economy with the government providing a good safety net education and intervening where there are market failures but a wise man told me when i was young that it s best to start off on the left when you are young otherwise you will end being like attila the hun as you move to the right as you age given the tendency for the young to start off on the left its no surprise to see younger generations favour a bigger role for government in what the economist magazine has dubbed millennial socialism if the millennials and generation z follow the normal pattern they will shift to the right as they age like their forebears so nothing new well maybe but there is a big difference now compared to the 1980s back in the 1980s the political pendulum or technically the median voter was moving to the right so my ageing was in tune with a big picture political cycle now the pendulum is swinging left we first looked at this three years ago see the political pendulum swings to the left oliver s insights june 2016 since then it s become more evident this note looks at what s driving it and what it means for investors political cycles beyond elections just as the weather economies and financial markets go in cycles so it is with politics even beyond standard electoral cycles this has been clearly evident over the last century 1930s 1970s the great depression gave rise to a fear of deflation high unemployment and a scepticism of free markets the political pendulum swung to the left and culminated in the economic disaster of the high tax protectionism growing state intervention and the welfare state of the late 1960s and 1970s that gave rise to stagflation 1980s 2000s stagflation and the failure of heavy government intervention gave rise to popular support for the economic rationalist right of centre policies of the 1980s thatcher reagan and hawke and keating ushered in a period of deregulation freer trade privatisation lower marginal tax rates tougher restrictions on access to welfare measures to reign in budget deficits and other supply side economic reforms designed to boost productivity the middle class didn t support higher taxes on the rich because they aspired to be rich this was all helped along by the collapse of communism and the integration of the old ussr and china into global trade the political pendulum swung to the right and there was talk of the end of history with general agreement that free market democracies were the way to go 2010 but post the global financial crisis gfc it seems the pendulum is swinging to the left again and support for economic rationalist policies seems to be fading if not reversing this reflects a range of factors in particular the feeling that the gfc indicated financial de regulation had gone too far constrained and fragile economic growth in recent years stagnant real wages and incomes for median households high household debt levels preventing individuals from taking on more debt as a way to boost living standards rising levels of inequality and perceptions that it s unfair the perceived failure of the baby boomer generation of political leaders to do much about climate change examples of big business doing the wrong thing a backlash against immigration in some countries and a backlash against globalisation of course it s being aided by a dimming of memories of stagflation of the 1970s and its causes and the failures of socialism as highlighted by the ussr although venezuela provides a current example so government related solutions or socialism seem more attractive allied to this are economic theories like modern monetary theory or rather magic mushroom theory that contends that governments can borrow and spend freely in the current environment of spare capacity globally spurred along by the crazy argument that quantitative easing did not cause hyper inflation and higher interest rates so why should bigger budget deficits of these rising inequality and perceptions of stagnant living standards are the big ones the next chart shows the gini coefficient which is about the best measure of income inequality calculated on incomes after taxes and transfers it ranges from zero or perfect equality to one indicating perfect inequality with one household individual receiving all income the key point is that there has been a general trend higher in inequality during the past 30 years this is particularly evident in the emerging world but also the us uk and australia rising levels of income inequality also appears to have come with increase in wealth inequality rising inequality may have been more bearable or masked in the 1990s and 2000s as nominal income was rising faster and households took on debt to boost their living standards but in recent times this has become harder and so rising inequality is leading to a backlash the political response in this environment often populist politicians have been able to easily tap into voter anger and argue the case for greater public sector involvement in the economy this was evident in support for self declared socialist bernie sanders and donald trump in the us in 2016 although trump s focus on deregulation and tax cuts look like a temporary deviation right it s now even more evident in the democrats with the green new deal that plans to rid the us of carbon emissions and planes and cows in a decade and 2020 democrat presidential aspirants adopting variations of bernie sanders policies with proposals for wealth taxes and a 70 per cent tax rate for income above 10 million which is supported by 59 per cent of americans it s also evident in less us public concern about rising public debt it s been evident in the brexit vote in the uk which represented a backlash against globalisation and the left wing turn in the british labour party under jeremy corbyn in australia we are seeing an intensification of the left right divide not seen since 1970s the alp is far from the economic rationalist policies of hawke and keating policies of higher taxes for the big end of town bringing back the budget repair levy and winding back various tax concessions significantly increased spending on health and education some reregulation of the labour market and talk of raising the minimum wage to become a living wage all suggest a populist focus reflecting a change in voter preferences the same pressures are also evident in some ways in proposed intervention in the energy sector qualifications of course there are various qualifications to this leftward shift first it s most evident in anglo countries because it s here that the swing to the right and economic rationalism was most pronounced in the 1980s and 90s and where inequality is more of an issue europe never fully bought into the supply side revolution of thatcher and reagan and inequality has not risen much in fact france under macron looks to be embarking on its own version of thatcherism with the yellow jacket protests proving nothing more than that macron is actually doing something which should augur well for its long term prospects if macron stays the course second it s arguable that if the democrats are to win the us presidential election next year they have to win the mid west and a socialist presidential candidate may not cut it there third even many on the left are sceptical of ever larger budget deficits eg in australia the alp has been talking of a stronger budgetary position finally there is an argument that a modest move left is necessary to curb the rise in inequality and so save capitalism much as keynesian economics saved it after the great depression but what does it all mean for investors the risk over time is that a more left leaning electorate will mean a tendency towards bigger government bigger budget deficits more regulation higher effective top marginal tax rates less globalisation and tougher rules on immigration in some countries or it may just mean a stalling in economic reforms the risk is that it will act as another constraint on productivity and economic growth and eventually see higher inflation if the supply side of the economy suffers it s worth putting this in context the swing in the political pendulum to the right and the economic rationalist supply side policies of deregulation privatisation smaller government tax cuts low inflation globalisation that followed along with the peace dividend from the collapse of communism and attractively high starting point dividend yields and bond yields created a powerful tail wind that drove strong returns in shares and bonds starting in the early 1980s now the environment is very different starting point investment yields are ultra low for most assets and a reversal of economic rationalist policies in favour re regulation higher taxes and more government risk slowing productivity growth and eventually resulting in higher inflation the key point is that the powerful tailwind from the economic rationalist policies deregulation smaller government and globalisation is now behind us and is contributing along with a range of other factors to a much more constrained return environment for investors our medium term projection for the investment return from a balanced mix of assets have been steadily declining in recent years and is now running around 6 4 per cent pa which is down from over 10 per cent a decade ago in this environment there is a strong case to focus on investment strategies targeting the achievement over time of goals defined in terms of returns investment income or whatever is required and using a flexible approach to do so as opposed to relying solely on set and forget strategies that depend heavily on market based returns there is also a case to look out for assets that may buck the trend of constrained returns as support for economic rationalist policies recede french shares may be worth looking at shane oliver is head of investment strategy and economics and the chief economist of amp capital
when the us this week launched an attack on huawei the chinese telecommunications company by placing it on an export blacklist that could severely damage its business it further raised fears of an enduring confrontation this represents a material escalation in tensions with the chinese government we have truly crossed the rubicon chris krueger an analyst at cowen washington research group said following the huawei announcement the kissinger consensus is dead and china is a strategic rival full stop high pain threshold mr trump s bet is that the american economy with unemployment at half century lows and us gross domestic product expanding at an annualised 3 2 per cent in the first quarter of the year can withstand the pain from the trade war with china the fact that us growth held firm even after past rounds of tariffs sent tremors through financial markets emboldened the president to take a tougher line in the talks with china but unless a deal is reached soon the us economy will bear the brunt of the new and higher tariffs which will act as an extra tax on a wide gamut of products from construction materials to farm equipment and electronics analysts at oxford economics estimate that if a 25 per cent tariff is extended to all of china s exports to the us it could deliver a 0 5 per cent knock to the level of american gdp next year consumers particularly low income americans and the elderly on fixed retirement packages would begin to feel the effects of the trade conflict as tariffs drive up costs lifting inflation advertisement david rowe s cartoon david rowe chase rice the owner of a family run hardware store in manassas has been on the front lines of the china trade war for months and keeping up with higher prices imposed by vendors has been a big challenge it s not a 2 3 per cent hike he says there are 5 10 per cent plus hikes on things you can t absorb that it s definitely something you have to pass along nathan sheets a former top us treasury official who is now chief economist at pgim fixed income says the us has enough momentum to absorb the trade tensions and is in a better place than many other economies fed has limited firepower but he sees significant downside risks one worry shared by many analysts is that a major escalation in the us china stand off could deliver a blow to financial market confidence as well as corporate and consumer optimism while the federal reserve might feel compelled to respond with easier policy if there were a major sell off in markets the central bank has relatively limited monetary firepower at its disposal loading advertisement the bigger concern is the longer term damage the trade wars could cause businesses have already been disrupted as they weigh supply chain shifts out of china raising fears that the two intertwined economies are headed towards a decoupling curtailing competition and closing down overseas markets will only harm the us economy says mary lovely of the peterson institute for international economics he seems to be getting away with it but in the longer run there will be a price to pay she says we will look back and say it slowed down us innovation and us growth jason furman former chairman of barack obama s council of economic advisers says he did not believe the pay off for the us of any future trade deal with china was sufficient to justify mr trump s strategy but he adds anyone counting on a dramatic deterioration in the macroeconomic numbers to bring an end to the us side of this is likely to be disappointed the blow to china would be greater if all of its exports to the us are taxed at 25 per cent in part whereas the us exported us120 billion 175 billion of goods to china last year china is far more reliant on the us shipping us540 billion of goods to the us the hit in 2020 to chinese gdp which has already shown some weakness in recent months would be 1 3 per cent under this scenario says greg daco chief us economist of oxford economics domestic economic activity has lost some momentum which is not promising as the economy girds for a prolonged and intensifying trade war with the us says eswar prasad a professor at cornell university and former head of the international monetary fund s china division china unlikely to cave advertisement but china has room to add further stimulus says matthew goodman senior asian economics adviser of the center for strategic and international studies i would not bet on them either caving or losing more in the event of a broader trade war he adds while china would not welcome the prospect of a prolonged trade war analysts believe the communist party s control over everything from the yuan s dollar exchange rate to the state dominated banking system will help it prevail attitudes are also hardening across the chinese bureaucracy as one semi official social media account used to channel beijing s anger put it after mr trump s latest salvo we do not want a fight but are not afraid of one to safeguard national dignity and our core interests adding insult to injury in the minds of party officials mr trump announced his decision to escalate the trade war on the same weekend that beijing was celebrating the 100th anniversary of the may 4 movement a patriotic student uprising against the decision to award germany s colonies in china to japan at the end of world war i on both tuesday and friday evening this week a leading china central television channel rejigged its line up to broadcast two classic movies about the korean war the 1950s conflict is known in china as the war to resist us aggression and assist korea since the talks hit a brick wall this month mr trump has both tried to belittle the trade war with china calling it a little squabble and dismiss the impact on american consumers advertisement unrest in the republican ranks but his administration has been scrambling to limit the fallout by promising a second multibillion dollar bailout of us farmers hit by retaliatory tariffs from china although many us legislators have embraced mr trump s trade war there is unrest among some of his closest republican allies a fox news poll released this week showed that 45 per cent of americans believe raising tariffs on china will hurt the economy while 34 per cent said it would help but there are not many signs that the us administration is feeling huge pressure to back away in a briefing with reporters this month us trade representative robert lighthizer suggested the status quo in trade between the us and china established since beijing joined the wto in 2001 was far more damaging than anything emanating from the tariffs because of the theft of us intellectual property and rampant subsidies the practices that we are objecting to by china are having a very negative effect on the us economy now and in the future and getting those corrected is just a fundamental objective of this president mr lighthizer said hawks in the trump administration believe that the longer the stand off continues the more it will encourage us companies to stop doing business with china their ultimate goal but back at the manassas walmart many are unconvinced that mr trump s trade war will be healthy for the us economy i can see why we need to push back on china i just don t think what we are doing is the appropriate way to do it says anne dancy a 74 year old retired sales and marketing expert there s no strategic plan it s all whatever trump decides to tweet that particular part of the day that s the plan financial times
two currents are dominating the markets nowadays as always the us china trade war is the main event that s causing a risk on risk off cycle as trump ramps up the tension and then tries to dampen things down a bit will the us or china cave first for the us trump has forces both pushing and pulling on him on the one hand us farmers are suffering as china stops importing us food soybean exports to china have apparently fallen to zero this is not just a short term disaster but a long term disaster too because even once the dispute is over china is never likely to go back to sourcing the same amount from the us on the other hand trump s policy is popular among us companies most of which are privately although not necessarily publicly in favor of being more aggressive with china in fact i remember talking with american companies 20 years ago when i worked in hong kong and they were already fed up and this was before wto accession so while many trump voters don t like it and the markets may be jittery the people who are paying the bills for the republican party support what trump is doing unless and until the stock market really starts plunging i think he ll stick to his guns rather than back down one sign of the us commitment to this fight the commerce department said it would add huawei technologies and affiliates to its so called entity list which will make it more difficult for them to buy parts from the us that s throwing down the gauntlet to china china for its part probably can t go along with the us demands to cut back its trade surplus would require that it cut back on its domestic savings because the current account balance is ultimately caused by a savings investment balance but without a proper social safety net in place for the populace health care pensions that s just not going to happen any time soon and i doubt if they ll be willing to go along with us demands about their management of the currency which has been a mainstay of their economic policy for years furthermore the chinese authorities probably believe that the us administration can t stand the pain that those suffering from the detrimental effects of the tariffs farmers especially will organize themselves to protest while those who benefit from the tariffs are too diffuse a group to lobby effectively in favor of keeping them that s what usually happens in such cases hu xijin the editor in chief of china s global times and apparently a well connected individual summed up this strategy in a tweet in chinese internet many people describe the current china us tussle as the art of the deal v s on protracted war the latter was written by mao zedong in 1938 during china s anti japanese war protracted war is well known among chinese as a strategy to exhaust opponent personally i think this is generally correct about the us but wrong in this case i think when it comes to china trade those who benefit from the confrontation are better organized more powerful and can lobby harder than those who are inconvenienced in particular they can donate more money to republicans so i think trump will stick to his guns this time in other words i expect the us china confrontation to continue and to worsen over the next few months this would imply a higher jpy and chf and lower aud and nzd one risk maybe they manage to reach some face saving agreement when trump and xi meet at next month s g20 meeting in japan advertisement i remain negative on sterling until further notice except of course on the odd day when it could have a technical rebound thanks to profit taking or position closing above european parliament voting intention by the way the results of the polls don t indicate that britain has abandoned its two major parties voters still see the country dominated by the conservatives and labour in the future but for now they re willing to cast a protest vote which means they might be willing to do so in the next general election too that surely must scare a few politicians who will note the support for the brexit party separately there s something strange going on with the gold contract open interest in the comex gold contract rose by around 93 000 contracts in ten days or so in other words the volume of business has increased by about 22 this is one of the fastest increases in open interest ever but the price is up less than 1 furthermore 93 000 contracts 9 3mn ounces but the entire comex vault holds only 7 7mn ounces it looks like the major bullion banks are increasingly shorting the market that would explain why gold and bitcoin have diverged so much recently when they have to cover these short positions gold could rise sharply above gold vs bitcoin upcoming week eu elections fomc ecb minutes preliminary pmis lots of japan data once again there are no major central bank meetings scheduled for the week and surprisingly few major indicators either the big thing during the week will of course be the eu parliamentary elections they ll be held from thursday to sunday the focus will be on britain as mentioned above but the results from other countries are important too the elections will be particularly important for italy where the results could impact the coalition government the relative performance of vice pm salvini s league vice pm dimaio s five star movement and the small eurosceptic brothers of italy party could mean a change in government that is if the league and the brothers of italy together with other small right wing parties do well enough in this election they could form a coalition and call for new domestic elections in the hopes of pushing the five star movement out of power that would be decidedly negative for the euro because salvini has been much less willing to abide by eu rules he recently said he d break the eu s budget deficit rules if necessary to get employment up in germany the elections may tell us how much popularity if any chancellor merkel s center right coalition but even if they lose a lot of their seats the other parties are mostly pro eu too except for the alternative for germany afd they re expected to make some headway but not enough to shake investor confidence fears of italian profligacy as opposed to confidence in german rectitude has caused the italy germany spread to trend wider italian yields moved higher while bund yields fell to within 9 bps of their all time low from mid 2016 the widening italy germany spread is an indication of nervousness about europe and is a negative for the currency above italy vs germany bond spreads the other big thing during the week is going to be fedspeak there are five voting members of the fomc speaking including chair powell and ny fed president williams plus as if to make sure they re going to be heard too four non voting members will be on a panel discussion on thursday plus the minutes of the latest fomc meeting will be released on wednesday we ll learn more about their view on the recent slowdown in inflation which powell attributed in the press conference to transient factors we ll also learn what the committee as a whole thinks about the administration s call for preemptive rate cuts i expect the fedspeak and the minutes will reinforce the idea that the committee remains patient and is in no hurry to cut rates this is contrary to the market s expectation of one rate cut this year and at least one maybe two next year it would therefore probably be positive for the dollar above expected change in fed funds the ecb releases the minutes of its april 10th meeting on thursday the press conference following the meeting was clearly dovish they signaled several possible moves with regards to deposits and loans that could give them leeway for further easing including further cuts in the deposit rate moreover ecb president draghi pointed out for the first time that i can remember that the ecb s inflation aim doesn t imply a ceiling at 2 but rather could exceed that level for some time so long as it returned there over the medium term that implies a bias towards doing more to boost inflation rather than doing less as you can see speculation about a cut in the ecb s deposit rate actually fell slightly after the april ecb meeting but lately has been rising a bit the probability is still estimated to be small only 26 but the idea is definitely there i expect that the minutes of the meeting will corroborate the possibility of a cut in ecb rates which is likely to be negative for the euro above ecb depo rate on thursday we get the preliminary pmis for may for japan the eu and the us nobody pays any attention to the japan pmi though so the focus will be as usual on europe vs the us in particular will germany show any improvement from its appalling position as a global outlier above manufacturing pmis the german and eu wide manufacturing pmis are indeed expected to improve but so too is the us manufacturing pmi in fact the gap between the us and the eu is expected to widen marginally 10 bps that should leave eur usd little affected or perhaps even slightly lower given that the market is pricing in a full rate cut in the us but not in europe this year yet above us manufacturing pmis the only other major us indicators out during the week are existing home sales on tuesday new home sales on thursday and durable goods on friday there are several major economic data being released from japan the first estimate of q1 gdp comes out on monday followed by the trade figures and machinery orders on wednesday and national cpi on friday i think the gdp data is probably the most important the figure is expected to show japan s economy in reverse slightly that could increase the risk that the government decides to delay the hike in the consumption tax currently scheduled for october if that happens then the government is likely to increase its bond issuance instead to make up for the revenue shortfall and the bank of japan would probably buy the extra paper as part of its monetary operations in other words further loosening of monetary policy that would tend to be negative for the yen on the other hand let s say growth was strong enough to allow the government to go ahead with the tax hike no doubt that would mean slower growth in the 2nd half of the fiscal year as it has every other time the government has raised the consumption tax so what would the boj s reaction be to that probably loosen monetary policy if it can net net it seems like a looser monetary policy is likely no matter what that means from a fundamental point of view a weaker yen however we all know that the yen is being swayed more by risk on risk off sentiment nowadays than by the economic fundamentals of japan so probably the impact of this figure will only last a day or two at most then we ll be back to watching stock markets above japan gdp britain will release cpi on wednesday and retail sales on friday plus bank of england gov carney and several of his colleagues from the monetary policy committee will testify in parliament on tuesday about the may inflation report but here too we all know that it really comes down to politics not economics brexit and pm may s slow defenestration will largely determine the trend of the currency over the week
last week it was revealed that china had reduced its us treasury holdings in march for the first time this year i hope this was neither a counterattack by beijing nor suggestions by mainland think tanks because there s a greater chance that china s economy will suffer if it gets rid of american treasuries it is true that if china does dump us treasuries on a large scale it might cause other foreign governments to follow suit in a panic causing us interest rates to rise the dollar to depreciate us housing prices to fall and damaging the us economy however do not underestimate the resilience of the united states foreign investors currently hold around us 6 4 trillion hk 49 9 trillion of us government bonds more than twice as much as in 2008 but between then and now however the proportion of foreign holdings of us treasuries has fallen to 40 percent from 56 percent mainly because the us federal reserve also buys a large amount of us debt so if china really retaliated by selling debt the fed would definitely get involved to stabilize the market more important though is not america s ability to defend itself it is that china simply has no room to abandon its us debt entirely china s huge trade surplus with the united states has given it a large number of us dollars by placing these dollars into the treasury market china effectively manages a floating exchange rate system keeping the yuan limited within a certain trading range against the dollar the advantage of holding us national debt compared to other financial products is that it allows china to do both reserve and exchange rate management in effectively so unless there is a major reform in china s exchange rate system or people don t mind the yuan suddenly witnessing significant volatility us treasury bonds are still an important tool to support the exchange rate of the yuan another important reason is china will find it almost impossible to find other products in place of us debt also china s foreign exchange reserves are us 3 1 trillion the largest in the world this is why the yuan has remained stable if china was to sell us treasuries it would trigger a sell off making us treasury prices fall sharply this in turn will cause china heavy losses and trigger a sharp fall in foreign exchange reserves plus will the yuan be trusted again internationally even if the yuan doesn t plummet while the dollar does us exporters would benefit from a weaker dollar and us consumers would buy fewer chinese goods because of the unfavorable exchange rate and trade tariffs which again ultimately hurts china therefore don t get too excited about china reducing its holdings of us treasury bonds as the march reduction may have been only influenced by the quarter end and other factors at the same time if you look at the performance of the yuan versus the us dollar since the escalation of the trade war you will understand that china s ability to hold its ground in financial markets is actually not as good as that of the united states andrew wong is chairman and ceo of anli securities
we expect lowe to point out that the bank s strategy lower unemployment leading to higher wages supporting both consumer spending and inflation has not played out such that there is scope for lower rates to support the economy mr owyong said in keeping with that expectation nab on friday said it now expects a 25 basis point cut in june versus july and it expects a second 25bps cut in august versus november governor lowe might also take opportunity to remind us that the bank remains committed to its inflation target some commentators have suggested that the reserve bank should lower its 2 3 per cent target or consider alternatives such as targeting nominal income core inflation has been below the 2 3 per cent band for a record period of more than three years now while market measures of inflation expectations are at record lows prompting calls for a rethink on the target at this stage we think the bank will argue that the flexibility of the target means that there is no need for it to be modified where in the past it has argued that if the target was changed the band should actually be higher in order to provide more scope to achieve lower levels of real interest rates in a downturn advertisement ms owyong said assuming a cut in june pending gdp and inflation data will determine the timing of a second cut another weak gdp print would mark three consecutive quarters of

just a couple of months ago commentators were complaining that jair bolsonaro was not doing much with his presidency the brazilian president recovering from a surgery related to the knife wound he sustained during last year s campaign seemed a bit off even though his overhaul of the government was already underway speculations about the incompetence of bolsonaro s team and their inability to see past ideology to push the country forward were common since april though the material basis of these ideological premises has become increasingly obvious the government has gone full steam ahead on matters the bolsonaros and their close political nucleus can agree on which means that everywhere you look you find social rights and public goods under attack it was never about incompetence but about doing away with as much as possible as fast as possible they just needed some time to get adjusted all in for pension reform the bolsonaro government s priority project is of course pension reform reforming the brazilian pension system which is currently designed around a solidarity approach is one of the reasons the capitalist class orchestrated a parliamentary coup against former workers party pt president dilma rousseff elevating her neoliberal vice president michel temer in her place it s also the reason they later promoted bolsonaro s extreme right candidacy even though he had no solid economic credentials his shot at winning depended on taking the pt s historical leader lula out of the picture the judge responsible for that task sergio moro is now bolsonaro s justice minister millions of reais are being invested in convincing the population that pension reform is necessary one argument is that without it the economic crisis will deepen even further this same rationale was provided for the budget ceiling implemented under temer the results of the budget ceiling are most apparent in the crippling disinvestment from health care and public education the government s austerity measures are essential to allocate remaining funds to service the public debt and its high interest rates at the pleasure of the financial market reformers harp on exceptional instances of unfairness in the current pension system to push a wholesale overhaul for example daughters of career military officers sometimes enter into stable relationships but refuse to marry in order to keep their fathers pension this benefit was extinct in 2000 but the already existing pensions are still honored at a cost of over 5 billion reais it s true that the brazilian population is aging but those in favor of pension reform have treated the aging population as a problem rather than challenge the point is to make the discourse as fatalist as possible so that support for the reform grows out of its dire inevitability this ruse distracts the brazilian people from how any pension deficit could be fixed by considering other variables in particular it could be addressed by formal job creation the kind that comes with rights and benefits such jobs are now rarer thanks to temer s anti workers rights reforms over 13 million brazilians are unemployed with many others thrown into informal jobs driving for uber and doing food delivery bolsonaro s focus on approving the pension reform at all costs means never talking about job creation and the potential impoverishment of the brazilian population combining just enough popular support with a minimum number of congressional sponsors is bolsonaro s main challenge at this point his finance minister former chicago boy paulo guedes represents powerful sectors of the financial market confidence in the government is tied to its ability to do the bidding of banks hedge fund managers and private pension and insurance companies the latest polls indicate that six out of ten brazilians agree with the pension reform even higher numbers reject paying more taxes to keep the system afloat the brazilian tax system is extremely regressive and if people believe that the only options are reforming pensions or paying higher taxes they ll be easily manipulated towards reform in the meantime the left has not yet managed to provide a powerful counternarrative to rally the masses against the reform or the bolsonaro government more generally center left and center right politicians have gotten a lot of attention for standing up to bolsonaro and his policies here and there there is a struggle to define who will lead the real opposition against bolsonaro and gather strength for the next election out with public research in with startups the educational system seems to be the bolsonaro government s next target his original extremist educational minister was removed but the new one abraham weintraub is even worse weintraub s outlook combines neoliberal economic orthodoxy with the lowest levels of extreme right ideological nonsense now he s launched a full attack on public universities he began by announcing 30 percent budget cuts to three universities handpicked for promoting too much disruption that is universities with a long history of political mobilization and student movement activity soon after he extended the cuts to all federal universities most of which were already scrambling given the asphyxiating budget ceiling in addition to cutting graduate scholarships the government is planning on diverting resources from sociology and philosophy departments to areas it claims are more useful for the job market president bolsonaro argued that he wanted young people to focus more on learning practical skills and less on learning politics the late educational theorist paulo freire has been targeted by far right pundits for years in order to foster panic about cultural marxism bolsonaro s ring of supporters present such moves as a response to the threat of communism this is the ideological façade crafted carefully by the right s intellectuals to gather support for the dismantling of public education and research in brazil the brazilian educational system is split between the private and public sectors with 75 percent of post secondary students enrolled in the private system public universities dwindling budgets may force them to slash the number of seats available to new students meanwhile the private system will be protected even though it too benefits indirectly from programs important as they are for giving poor youth access to university consisting of public subsidies and government sponsored student loans weintraub s plan to starve public universities is not simply because they are as he claims supposedly filled with young marxists we wish his goal is to change the character of public universities by introducing more public private partnerships plus business incubators and startups on campus the liberal conservative essence of the bolsonaro government means that no single conservative stunt is devoid of a clear opportunity for business elites to act and shape the landscape nothing is accidental there is not a single action put forward by this government that does not reflect capitalist interests for instance bolsonaro s latest decree authorizes parents to let their underage children learn how to shoot firearms without judicial permission he has allowed lawyers and journalists to carry their own firearms and negotiated a bill with chamber of deputies president rodrigo maia dem to authorize rural landowners to carry their firearms around their property this means good business for the firearms manufacturers that flávio bolsonaro the president s senator son is trying to attract to brazil it could also mean that indigenous and landless workers demands for agrarian and land reform are not just ignored but met with deadlier force than usual minister damares is most known as the oddball conservative woman and as a target of leftist memes but she should not be underestimated as a representative of fundamentalist religious leaders damares has sought to reinforce traditional gender roles in a blunt anti feminist campaign this has a direct impact on everything from reproductive rights to the roles played by women in the job market she is feared by indigenous communities due to her missionary work yet she s now in charge of the national indigenous foundation meanwhile the ministry of health has officially removed the concept of obstetric violence from its agenda for being too socialist even though one in four pregnant women report being victim to this kind of medical abuse this is good news for private health care providers which will be able to push inappropriate c sections more easily meanwhile negligence of pregnant women in public hospitals and those hospitals deteriorating infrastructure will be more easily justified so far every measure implemented by the bolsonaro administration fits with a broader agenda of taking social guarantees to pieces in order to position the private sector banking interests and evangelical churches to swoop in once the state fails given that the brazilian army is already able to shoot over eighty bullets at a family s car in rio de janeiro killing the father and it is business as usual the state failed a long time ago the difference is that this government is not the slightest bit interested in building something other than its cultural wars repression and managing the common affairs of the whole of the bourgeoisie
authored by lance roberts via realinvestmentadvice com over the last several weeks we have been discussing the potential for a market correction simply due to divergences in the technical indicators which suggested near term market risk outweighed the reward then the white house reignited the trade war with china to wit the trade war is not a good thing for markets or the economy as recently suggested by the president david rosenberg had an interesting point on this as well on friday tracing through the gdp hit from a tariff war on eps growth and p e multiple compressions from heightened uncertainty the downside impact on the s p 500 would come to 10 i chuckle when i hear economists say that the impact is small meanwhile global trade volumes have contracted 1 1 over the year to february how is that bullish news exactly remember at the beginning of 2018 with tax cuts just passed and earnings growing the market was set back by 5 as an initial tariff of 10 was put into place fast forward to today you have tariffs going to 25 with no supportive legislation in place earnings growth and revenue weakening along with slower economic growth in the meantime the bond market is screaming deflation and yields have clearly not been buying the 3 point multiple expansion from the december 24th lows it was due to that analysis and the trade war that we made the following recommendations last week to our clients and ria pro subscribers try now and get 30 days free continuing from yesterday s discussion on the impact of trade wars on various sectors has us beginning to reposition out of some the areas most susceptible to tariffs yesterday we closed out our position in emerging markets and sold 1 2 of our position in basic materials today on the bounce as laid out yesterday we sold half of our position in xli industrials and xly consumer discretionary and added one half position in xlre real estate which should be defensive with lower interest rates we still maintain a long bias towards equity risk but that exposure is hedged with cash and bonds which remain at elevated levels if you haven t taken any actions at all recently read my previous newsletter for portfolio management guidelines while the market got very oversold previously we noted last weekend a bounce was likely unfortunately that bounce was unable to hold above the 50 dma on friday which negates the break above it earlier in the week importantly the deeply oversold condition was somewhat reversed which now sets the market up for a potential retest of the 200 dma average over the next couple of weeks a failure at that level and we have to start having a different conversation about portfolio allocation models for now the market is working a corrective process which is likely not complete as of yet as we head into the summer months it is likely the markets will experience a retracement of the rally during the first quarter of this year as shown in a chart we use for position management sizing profit taking sells the market has just issued a signal suggesting risk reduction is prudent this doesn t mean sell everything and go to cash there is no law that says you have to be all in the market all the time every good gambler knows how to size their bets relative to the hand they hold this is particularly the case when it certainly appears the bulls are betting on a long shot betting on a long shot last week we discussed in a lot of detail the re escalation of the trade war and the potential impact to earnings in the quarters ahead to wit as a result of escalating trade war concerns the impact in the worst case scenario of an all out trade war for us companies across sectors and us trading partners will be greater than anticipated in a nutshell an across the board tariff of 10 on all us imports and exports would lower 2018 eps for s p 500 companies by 11 and thus completely offset the positive fiscal stimulus from tax reform fast forward to the end of q1 2019 earnings and we find that we were actually a bit optimistic on where things turned out the problem is the 2020 estimates are currently still extremely elevated as the impact of these new tariffs settle in corporate earnings will be reduced the chart below plots our initial expectations of earnings through 2020 given that a 10 tariff took 11 off earnings expectations it is quite likely with a 25 tariff we are once again too optimistic on our outlook over the next couple of months we will be able to refine our view further but the important point is that since roughly 50 of corporate profits are a function of exports trump has just picked a fight he most likely can t win importantly the reigniting of the trade war is coming at a time where economic data remains markedly weak valuations are elevated and credit risk is on the rise the yield curve continues to signal that something has broken but few are paying attention for the bullish narrative the earnings growth story is going to become increasingly difficult to ignore this is particularly the case given that just this past week economic data continues to show weakness as shown in the following chart global economic trade has collapsed to levels not seen since prior to the financial crisis of course since almost 50 of corporate revenue and profits are generated from international activity it is not surprising to see a problem emerging as j brett freeze cfa discussed on friday dissected the key drivers of economic growth capital expenditures the graph shows that when the economy is coming out of recession and optimism is budding capital expenditures as a percentage of the economy are high conversely as optimism wanes and the economic cycle is long in the tooth capital expenditures peak trend sideways and then drop sharply the data in the graph is normalized using six quarter moving averages and standard deviations as reflected on the y axis the 1960s and the current period are unique in that those periods saw a sharp decline in capital expenditures that did not lead to a recession we know the current episode is a result of a resurgence of corporate optimism due to the election of donald trump and importantly the corporate tax cut that incentivized corporate spending with much of the tax cut stimulus behind us the temporary fiscal boost appears to be fading unsurprisingly all of this data aligns with rising recession risks we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us important note the graph above is based on lagging economic indicators which are subject to huge negative revisions in the future therefore high current risk levels should not be readily dismissed as the recession will have started before the data is revised to reveal the actual start date here is my point if you had been living on mars for the last 24 months and just reviewed the data above you would most logically assume the market would be down and probably significantly so that certainly isn t the case as noted above with the markets just a couple of percentage points away from their all time highs so despite the data the resurgence of a trade war with china rising delinquency rates and falling demand for loans and weak outlooks by businesses the bulls are certainly betting on a long shot of an outcome that is currently well outside the current data in that is the case then what are the bulls betting on my friend patrick hill sent me a good note on this issue in watching bloomberg it seems the market is betting on 1 the fed will lower interest rates the fed funds rate forecast shows at least once this year interestingly historically when the fed begins lowering interest rates it has been in response to a recession not a slowdown 2 the trade war will not be as bad as thought as trump and xi will meet at g20 and resolve everything but that may not be the case given china s positioning on friday the us has completely abandoned commercial principles and disregarded law its barbaric behavior against huawei by resorting to administrative power can be viewed as a declaration of war on china in the economic and technological fields it is time that the chinese people throw away their illusions compromise will not lead to us goodwill 3 corporations can continue to churn out revenue growth as china stimulus will help out em countries and us companies can sell to them 4 corporate debt at levels at record highs and leveraged loans at twice the level of subprime debt in 2008 is of no real concern 5 corporate stock buybacks will continue to provide a bid to the market of course what happens when sales continue to fall ned davis research noted their research shows the s p is up 19 over what it would not be without buybacks buybacks have also made up about 80 of the bid to the market 6 there is no concern that tariffs will push price inflation higher despite the fact that tariffs will lift costs on both consumers and businesses 7 the fed will respond to any weakness providing a permanent bid the market in other words at the moment data doesn t matter to the markets it is simply hope based momentum magnified with a crap ton of liquidity yes that is a technical term doug kass recently discussed the issue of the current disconnect very leveraged strategies involving yield enhancement allocations based on risk assessment risk parity and other volatility targeting funds are contributing factors to a new and heightened regime of volatility that has recently intensified and so does the popularity and proliferation of passive etfs and the proliferation of cta extreme momentum based strategies exaggerate short term price moves even blackrock s larry fink has missed this important reason for the market s sharp advance this year there is such a limited discussion of the enormous sums of money that are now being managed by quants and pseudo quant hedge funds algorithmic trading with massive leverage all of which dominates the investing landscape the aforementioned strategies based on momentum and the assessment of asset class risk embraced by many work until they don t and when a trend changes from up to down massively levered products like risk parity are forced to delever and buy back volatility to offset their short vol positions further exacerbating the move lower the problem of course is uncovered when too many are on the same side of the boat a state of stability should not be as trusted as much today as in the past it will likely morph into more frequent episodes of instability a series of minsky moments this is an important point stability eventually breeds instability due to the buildup of complacency the entire bullish bet currently is that despite a growing laundry list to the contrary the markets will continue their advance simply waiting for the data to improve primarily this belief is hinged on the idea the fed will come to the rescue the problem as noted previously the effectiveness of qe and zero interest rates is based on the point at which you apply these measures in 2008 when the fed launched into their accommodative policy emergency strategy to bail out the financial markets the fed s balance sheet was only about 915 billion the fed funds rate was at 4 2 if the market fell into a recession tomorrow the fed would be starting with roughly a 4 trillion balance sheet with interest rates 2 lower than they were in 2009 in other words the ability of the fed to bail out the markets today is much more limited than it was in 2008 but there is more to the story than just the fed s balance sheet and funds rate the entire backdrop is completely reversed the table below compares a variety of financial and economic factors from 2009 to present the critical point here is that qe and rate reductions have the most effect when the economy markets and investors have been blown out deviations from the norm are negatively extended confidence is hugely negative in other words there is nowhere to go but up that is hardly the case currently as prices have become detached from both the economic and fundamental cycles of the market the bulls are clinging to narratives to justify excessive valuations and deviations from the norm we live in an investment world in which much of the silly fairy tale narratives have little to do with the real world a lot is basically made up it is that simple doug kass real money pro so what are we doing now we realize that out clients have to make money when markets are rising but that we also have to manage the risk of loss it s an incredibly tough job and doesn t always work out the way we plan but that is the essence of investing to begin with with the recent market weakness we are holding off adding to our equity long positions until we see where the market finds support we have also cut our holdings in basic materials and emerging markets as tariffs will have the greatest impact on those areas currently there is a cluster of support coalescing at the 200 dma but a failure at the level could see selling intensify as we head into summer the recent developments now shift our focus from risk taking to risk control capital preservation strategies now replace capital growth strategies and cash now becomes a favored asset class for managing uncertainty as a portfolio manager i must manage short term opportunities as well as long term outcomes if i don t i suffer career risk plain and simple however you don t have to if you are truly a long term investor you have to question the risk being undertaken to achieve further returns in the current market environment
just a couple of months ago commentators were complaining that jair bolsonaro was not doing much with his presidency the brazilian president recovering from a surgery related to the knife wound he sustained during last year s campaign seemed a bit off even though his overhaul of the government was already underway speculations about the incompetence of bolsonaro s team and their inability to see past ideology to push the country forward were common since april though the material basis of these ideological premises has become increasingly obvious the government has gone full steam ahead on matters the bolsonaros and their close political nucleus can agree on which means that everywhere you look you find social rights and public goods under attack it was never about incompetence but about doing away with as much as possible as fast as possible they just needed some time to get adjusted all in for pension reform the bolsonaro government s priority project is of course pension reform reforming the brazilian pension system which is currently designed around a solidarity approach is one of the reasons the capitalist class orchestrated a parliamentary coup against former workers party pt president dilma rousseff elevating her neoliberal vice president michel temer in her place it s also the reason they later promoted bolsonaro s extreme right candidacy even though he had no solid economic credentials his shot at winning depended on taking the pt s historical leader lula out of the picture the judge responsible for that task sergio moro is now bolsonaro s justice minister millions of reais are being invested in convincing the population that pension reform is necessary one argument is that without it the economic crisis will deepen even further this same rationale was provided for the budget ceiling implemented under temer the results of the budget ceiling are most apparent in the crippling disinvestment from health care and public education the government s austerity measures are essential to allocate remaining funds to service the public debt and its high interest rates at the pleasure of the financial market reformers harp on exceptional instances of unfairness in the current pension system to push a wholesale overhaul for example daughters of career military officers sometimes enter into stable relationships but refuse to marry in order to keep their fathers pension this benefit was extinct in 2000 but the already existing pensions are still honored at a cost of over 5 billion reais it s true that the brazilian population is aging but those in favor of pension reform have treated the aging population as a problem rather than challenge the point is to make the discourse as fatalist as possible so that support for the reform grows out of its dire inevitability this ruse distracts the brazilian people from how any pension deficit could be fixed by considering other variables in particular it could be addressed by formal job creation the kind that comes with rights and benefits such jobs are now rarer thanks to temer s anti workers rights reforms over 13 million brazilians are unemployed with many others thrown into informal jobs driving for uber and doing food delivery bolsonaro s focus on approving the pension reform at all costs means never talking about job creation and the potential impoverishment of the brazilian population combining just enough popular support with a minimum number of congressional sponsors is bolsonaro s main challenge at this point his finance minister former chicago boy paulo guedes represents powerful sectors of the financial market confidence in the government is tied to its ability to do the bidding of banks hedge fund managers and private pension and insurance companies the latest polls indicate that six out of ten brazilians agree with the pension reform even higher numbers reject paying more taxes to keep the system afloat the brazilian tax system is extremely regressive and if people believe that the only options are reforming pensions or paying higher taxes they ll be easily manipulated towards reform in the meantime the left has not yet managed to provide a powerful counternarrative to rally the masses against the reform or the bolsonaro government more generally center left and center right politicians have gotten a lot of attention for standing up to bolsonaro and his policies here and there there is a struggle to define who will lead the real opposition against bolsonaro and gather strength for the next election out with public research in with startups the educational system seems to be the bolsonaro government s next target his original extremist educational minister was removed but the new one abraham weintraub is even worse weintraub s outlook combines neoliberal economic orthodoxy with the lowest levels of extreme right ideological nonsense now he s launched a full attack on public universities he began by announcing 30 percent budget cuts to three universities handpicked for promoting too much disruption that is universities with a long history of political mobilization and student movement activity soon after he extended the cuts to all federal universities most of which were already scrambling given the asphyxiating budget ceiling in addition to cutting graduate scholarships the government is planning on diverting resources from sociology and philosophy departments to areas it claims are more useful for the job market president bolsonaro argued that he wanted young people to focus more on learning practical skills and less on learning politics the late educational theorist paulo freire has been targeted by far right pundits for years in order to foster panic about cultural marxism bolsonaro s ring of supporters present such moves as a response to the threat of communism this is the ideological façade crafted carefully by the right s intellectuals to gather support for the dismantling of public education and research in brazil the brazilian educational system is split between the private and public sectors with 75 percent of post secondary students enrolled in the private system public universities dwindling budgets may force them to slash the number of seats available to new students meanwhile the private system will be protected even though it too benefits indirectly from programs important as they are for giving poor youth access to university consisting of public subsidies and government sponsored student loans weintraub s plan to starve public universities is not simply because they are as he claims supposedly filled with young marxists we wish his goal is to change the character of public universities by introducing more public private partnerships plus business incubators and startups on campus the liberal conservative essence of the bolsonaro government means that no single conservative stunt is devoid of a clear opportunity for business elites to act and shape the landscape nothing is accidental there is not a single action put forward by this government that does not reflect capitalist interests for instance bolsonaro s latest decree authorizes parents to let their underage children learn how to shoot firearms without judicial permission he has allowed lawyers and journalists to carry their own firearms and negotiated a bill with chamber of deputies president rodrigo maia dem to authorize rural landowners to carry their firearms around their property this means good business for the firearms manufacturers that flávio bolsonaro the president s senator son is trying to attract to brazil it could also mean that indigenous and landless workers demands for agrarian and land reform are not just ignored but met with deadlier force than usual minister damares is most known as the oddball conservative woman and as a target of leftist memes but she should not be underestimated as a representative of fundamentalist religious leaders damares has sought to reinforce traditional gender roles in a blunt anti feminist campaign this has a direct impact on everything from reproductive rights to the roles played by women in the job market she is feared by indigenous communities due to her missionary work yet she s now in charge of the national indigenous foundation meanwhile the ministry of health has officially removed the concept of obstetric violence from its agenda for being too socialist even though one in four pregnant women report being victim to this kind of medical abuse this is good news for private health care providers which will be able to push inappropriate c sections more easily meanwhile negligence of pregnant women in public hospitals and those hospitals deteriorating infrastructure will be more easily justified so far every measure implemented by the bolsonaro administration fits with a broader agenda of taking social guarantees to pieces in order to position the private sector banking interests and evangelical churches to swoop in once the state fails given that the brazilian army is already able to shoot over eighty bullets at a family s car in rio de janeiro killing the father and it is business as usual the state failed a long time ago the difference is that this government is not the slightest bit interested in building something other than its cultural wars repression and managing the common affairs of the whole of the bourgeoisie

london cnn business 1 yuan alert the yuan just hit its lowest level against the dollar since november 2018 that could make the trade war between china and the united states even more complicated one us dollar bought 6 92 yuan on friday the chinese currency has weakened by almost 2 7 this month and is now uncomfortably close to the symbolically important level of 7 to the dollar last breached during the 2008 financial crisis what happens next is important china has a vested interest in stabilizing the currency as does the united states president donald trump has long argued that china devalues its currency to make the country more competitive but beijing is in a tough spot currency depreciation could help china by canceling out the impact of new us tariffs and keeping its exports affordable in america but a big drop in the yuan could spark an outflow of money from china and hurt economic stability at the same time the chinese government may be hesitant to prop up its currency since doing so could open beijing up to further criticism from washington china is caught between a rock and a hard place said miguel chanco senior asia economist at pantheon macroeconomics china may be tempted to use its currency as a weapon against the united states bank of america merrill lynch analysts athanasios vamvakidis and claudio piron said in a note to clients on friday letting the yuan depreciate would be a softer option than targeting us businesses or investments in china they said veteran hedge fund manager mark yusko thinks china could do this without causing its own economy too much pain typically as the yuan weakens china would have to worry about an exodus of money from the country as investors lose confidence and swap yuan for assets in dollars and other currencies yusko argues that s not a problem for beijing which could enforce capital controls that doesn t mean such a strategy is without risks the yuan falling below 7 to the us dollar could trigger further selloffs pushing it still lower chanco said that would likely be unattractive to beijing he added letting the yuan weaken could also boost chinese inflation that s a risk at a time when the economy is already showing signs of weakness with retail sales cooling significantly another big question is whether china chooses to sell us treasuries at a more rapid pace in turn buying yuan and shoring up its value china reduced its holdings of us debt in march to 1 12 trillion in us treasuries the lowest level in almost two years chanco sees dumping us government debt as the nuclear option while yusko thinks china will absolutely speed up sales of treasuries if a resolution isn t reached soon i think it s very likely he said 2 annual meetings amazon s annual shareholder meeting is on wednesday and this

spread the love global markets took an upbeat tone overnight preferring to concentrate on known knowns rather than known unknowns or unknown unknowns following washington s decision to place huawei on a blacklist that could ban them from sourcing vital us technology if enacted the street appears to have temporarily given up trying to predict the fluid situation that is us china trade relations and concentrate on the here and now the here and now on wall street was strong us housing starts and sparkling results from heavyweights walmart nvidia and cisco systems suggesting yet again that despite the international noise the us economy is still moving full steam ahead following rises yesterday in europe and china the s p finished 0 90 higher the nasdaq climbed 1 and the dow jones rose 0 80 european union inflation and the us michigan consumer sentiment are the heavyweight data points due this evening to finish the week they could tell a tale of two halves with the us consumer alive and well while eu inflation continues bumping along the floor here in asia the new zealand dollar nzd continued its weekly fall following uninspiring ppi data this morning we have important data from two trading bellwethers in asia today singapore released its balance of trade at 0830 singapore time sgt while hong kong releases its quarterly gdp growth rate at 1630 sgt the street will be looking for a continued recovery in singapore s non oil exports and a bounce back in hong kong s quarterly gdp growth following a slump of 0 50 previously like australia and new zealand singapore and hong kong have a massive correlation to china growth and the data will be closely watched to gauge the state of play in asian trade poor prints could see a negative overflow to regional markets currencies the us dollar maintained its tight grip on markets overnight following a strong performance by wall street with the dollar index rising 0 27 the australian aud and new zealand dollars nzd continued their

like the governments chance of re election any light at the end of the tunnel being a train coming the other way equities assuming no surprises from singapore data or president trump s twitter account regional markets should follow wall street s lead and begin the day on a positive note the march higher will be tentative at best though with sentiment both incredibly cautious and fragile with the weekend upon us and plenty of unknown unknowns that could occur over the weekend volumes will likely remain light in asia today oil middle east tensions were front and centre overnight as saudi arabia unsurprisingly blamed iran for the recent sabotage on its tankers and oil platforms brent crude rose 1 15 to usd72 70 a barrel and wti climbed 1 65 to usd63 05 a barrel the repricing of geopolitical threats has merit although the likelihood of open hostilities from or against iran remains low in my opinion brent crude has technical resistance in the usd75 00 a barrel area and wti nearby at usd63 50 with quite a lot of politics and supply crunches already built into prices and the spectre of trade wars looming large the geopolitical temperature will probably have to ratchet much higher to

income inequality has risen steadily in the united states since the 1970s reuters john manzella tribune news service i often hear people talk about their difficulties in finding a meaningful job or keeping up with increasing healthcare housing and education costs these concerns along with rising income inequality and a shrinking middle class are provoking anger for many trade and immigration have become convenient villains but that narrative is wrong let me tell you why income inequality which is partly a reflection of the growing gap between lower and higher skilled workers has risen steadily in the united states since the 1970s in fact the economic gap between the rich and poor is higher here than other advanced economies according to the pew research center this has resulted in a shrinking middle class that no longer represents the majority of americans what s gone wrong american free market capitalism has generated the greatest economic growth the world has ever seen but it has not benefited all of us equally but in an effort to improve economic outcomes for all americans it s essential to continually improve our system of free market capitalism not move toward a more socialist like model that empowers left leaning politicians to make decisions that should be made by the market it s just as important not to accept oversimplified solutions to complex problems presented by far right or far left leaning populist leaders unfortunately support for the far right and left is growing and has contributed to greater polarization in the united states this is further dividing americans and making it more difficult for congress to compromise to pass necessary legislation this polarization trend isn t just an american problem a recent report published by the organization for economic co operation and development a global policy forum indicates that over the past 30 years middle class households worldwide have experienced dismal or no income growth this has fueled perceptions that the current socio economic system is unfair and has led to greater support for extreme left and right ideologies and politicians that embrace them but that s not all stated by the pew research center across 27 countries surveyed 51 are dissatisfied with the way their democracy is functioning compared with 45 who are satisfied it s time to take a deep breath and not buy into emotionally appealing solutions from populist leaders who often scapegoat trade and immigration as the causes of america s problems in doing so keep the following points in mind first problems associated with rising income inequality a shrinking middle class and the inability to find meaningful work has much to do with lower and middle skilled jobs being eliminated by automation and the increasing demand for higher skilled workers moving forward 14 of existing jobs could disappear as a result of automation in the next 15 to 20 years plus another 32 are likely to change radically as individual tasks are automated says a recent report by the oecd other organizations say nearly half of existing jobs could vanish mostly affecting lower to middle skilled workers to adapt a well educated labour force should be a top national priority equal to the effort that put a man on the moon importantly students need the ability to pay for technical or university level educations without incurring unreasonable debt and employees of all ages need to engage in life long learning history reveals that after fast emerging technologies destroy jobs more new ones are created although we don t know what the new jobs will be we do know they will require highly skilled workers secondly don t scapegoat trade automation not trade accounted for more than 85 of us job losses in manufacturing from 2000 through 2010 according to the center for business and economic research at ball state university although trade has contributed to some job losses it has provided far greater benefits today nearly half of all us exports are sold to our 20 free trade agreement partners which only represent 6 of world consumers to boost job creating exports to the rest of the world we need more not fewer free trade agreements thirdly immigrants don t steal american jobs they help fill them immigrants help fill vacant american jobs at all skill levels but the worker shortage is getting worse according to korn ferry the us skilled worker deficit could result in 1 75 trillion in lost revenue annually for american companies by 2030 in light of this legal immigration should be expanded not reduced furthermore american colleges and universities attract the best and brightest students the world has to offer however after graduation we send them home to compete against us allowing more foreign graduates to remain here to support our companies or start new ones would benefit our economy immigrants also add to america s population and consumer base germany and japan for example have negative population growth rates this puts downward pressure on their economic prospects the united states has problems but trade and immigration aren t to blame for them americans as well as others around the world need to look past the simplified and often emotionally charged solutions presented by far right and far left leaning populists or our problems will only get worse
equity markets ended last week on a soft note amid reports that plans for fresh us china trade talks had been put on hold the big news over the weekend was the surprise victory for the liberal national coalition in the australian election which will likely see the aud open higher this morning there may be some positive knock on effect to the nzd which closed at its lowest level of the year on friday the victory for scott morrison and his liberal national coalition over the weekend went against predictions from both pollsters and betting markets the latter assigned them a less than 20 chance of winning and is likely give the aud a boost when markets open this morning the opposition labour party had campaigned on change including cutting carbon emissions increasing the minimum wage and ending some tax breaks for housing and equity investors given labour s lead in the polls the aud had likely priced in a reasonable chance of these policies being implemented and with that uncertainty now removed the result is likely to be seen as supportive for markets and the aud at least in the short term the aud ended last week on a soft note down 0 4 against the usd on friday to 0 6870 near its lowest level since 2009 it was the second worst performing currency on the week down almost 2 against the usd while the aud will likely receive a short term uplift from the election result the medium term path of the aud will be largely dependent on the evolution of us china trade negotiations the rba outlook and commodity prices on that note on friday our nab colleagues brought forward their call for the first rba rate cut to june and they expect the minutes to the rba s may meeting and governor lowe s speech tomorrow to pave the way for a rate cut next month currently 80 priced working in the other direction iron ore prices rose above 100 for the first time in five years on supply concerns after vale warned that there was a risk another of its dams could collapse the nzd was down 0 3 on friday and 1 2 on the week to close at 0 6515 its lowest level of the year there have been a few factors at play behind the recent fall in the nzd first there has been a broad based strengthening in the usd with the usd indices approaching year to date highs second growing concerns about the risk of an all out us china trade war has seen the cny weaken towards the psychologically important 7 0 level against the usd usd cny closed last week at 6 92 which in turn has weighed on the nzd and the aud but there may be some positive knock on effect to the nzd from the australian election result when trading opens this morning in terms of friday night s trading session us equity markets closed down by between 0 4 to 1 with markets concerned by a cnbc report that the scheduling of the next round of us china trade talks had been put on hold due to the recent us restrictions placed on huawei sources told cnbc that the scheduling arrangements were in flux semiconductor stocks fared poorly for the second day running with the us commerce department s decision on thursday to place huawei on its so called entity list continuing to reverberate huawei is a major purchaser of us semiconductors and us companies will now need to apply for a special licence to sell equipment to huawei the philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2 on a more positive note trump announced that the us had come to an agreement with canada and mexico to remove tariffs on imports of aluminium and steel the decision removes one of the hurdles to congressional approval of usmca the trade agreement set to replace nafta the canadian dollar outperformed on the news and was the only g10 currency not to fall against the usd on friday analysts were quick to point out that trump s decision to remove steel and aluminium tariffs on canada and mexico as well as his decision to delay auto tariffs by up to six months which would hit the eu and japanese economies creates the impression that he is narrowing his trade focus to china the usd was stronger across the board on friday with the usd indices up by around 0 2 on the day and 0 7 on the week the dxy index finished the week just below 98 close to its highest level since mid 2017 the usd benefited from a much stronger than expected university of michigan consumer confidence index which rose to its highest level in 15 years the elevated level of consumer confidence points to the continued resilience of the us consumer and is another indicator that suggests last week s soft retail sales release should be downplayed additionally the survey s 5 10 year inflation expectations bounced from 2 3 to 2 6 leaving it above the 2 5 average since the start of 2017 this was the preliminary reading of the survey which covers a smaller sample of consumers and these initial readings on inflation expectations can be subsequently revised when the final survey results which cover a larger sample are released early the following month but at face value it suggests that consumers inflation expectations have remained reasonably stable despite the recent fall in us core inflation us treasury bond yields reversed earlier declines after the consumer confidence release to finish unchanged on the day the us 10 year treasury yield closed the week at 2 39 with the market still pricing around 30bps of fed rate cuts by the end of the year the gbp was the worst performing currency on friday 0 6 to 1 2725 and the week 2 1 after confirmation theresa may and jeremy corbyn had decided to end cross party talks on brexit without agreement this was seen as further reducing the chances of may getting her withdrawal agreement bill through parliament in early june which would set the stage for her to step down as prime minister may wrote in the sunday times that a new and improved brexit deal would be presented to parliament but commentators think the chances of it passing are slim the front runners to replace may are hard brexiteers boris johnson is a 2 1 favourite with betting companies and the market may start to get nervous that the new leader will seek to take the uk out of the eu without a deal at the end of october there is also the lingering risk that a new leader may choose to hold new elections in a bid to break the parliamentary impasse over brexit and seek a fresh mandate from the electorate nz rates were little changed on friday but lower on the week the 2 year swap closed at 1 545 its lowest level on record and down 7bps on the week on the domestic data front the nz manufacturing pmi rebounded to 53 last month a level above 50 indicates expansion in the industry although it remains at relatively low levels in the context of the past few years and the underlying detail of the survey wasn t as strong as the headline four of the five subcomponents actually declined on the month in the week ahead there will be focus on the rba board meeting minutes and governor lowe s speech both released tomorrow which our nab colleagues expect to pave the way for a rate cut next month in europe the pmis and german ifo will provide a fresh read on the european growth pulse in the us the fomc minutes are released and there are a raft of fed officials speaking including chair powell tomorrow morning nzt the highlight locally is the release of retail sales on wednesday of course reports on us china trade negotiations will remain a major driver of market sentiment in the week ahead as well get our daily currency email by signing up here bnz markets research is available here

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news election results are dominating our news the australian election result defied the polling earlier in last week and will have some interesting consequences firstly the incumbent centre right won extending its term one important reason was coal mining in queensland pro coal forces hurt the climate sensitive opposition and this huge mine will now almost certainly go into production shipping vast amounts of thermal low quality coal to india secondly the independent magnate who spent 60 mln trying to buy a senate seat lost and thirdly the hard right icon of the liberal party former prime minister tony abbott pointedly lost his seat to an independent candidate and is now out of parliament another infamous candidate fraser anning was also dumped exit polling suggests that a crucial part of the electorate didn t actually make up its mind until they had the voting papers in their hand more of the same is likely in australia this is not a reforming government banks are unlikely to face further sanctions the big june tax cut will happen giving an almost immediate fiscal stimulus eyes will be on the aussie dollar when it opens this week in a few hours and in india exit polls suggest that incumbent right wing nationalist prime minister modi will win a second term in washington the us has lifted tariffs on steel and aluminium products from canada and is expected to do the same for mexico these tariffs were imposed by washington just last month on grounds of national security highlighting the silly gamesmanship behind them and washington is also delaying tariffs on cars which were aimed at allies japan and the eu in a back track that may allow it to concentrate on the failing china trade talks meanwhile china has canceled some large pork orders with the us adding pressure to american farming interests which are already reeling from the loss of some major grain markets the rising us dollar won t be helping them either china will need alternate sources of meat protein china is digging in now saying more trade talks with the americans will only happen if they are meaningful a senior china politburo member has said the trade war could slice as much as 1 from china s growth this year he indicated this was an acceptable price to pay for a long term winning position one us policy that has bi partisan support in washington is its push back on chinese tech and its perceived capacity to be a security issue the recent ban on huawei is the icon example but in europe they don t see the threat in technical terms and are pushing ahead and allowing huawei to win 5g infrastructure contracts there it is a direct snub to washington meanwhile chinese house buyers are bidding up local prices again especially in their main cities they are up as much as 20 in some in a year up 10 to 15 in many others beijing is cooler up just 3 5 but recall there is a clamp on beijing s population and it is being administered to fall the ust 10yr yield was marginally lower on friday to 2 39 but that is 7 bps lower in the week recall it fell 7 bps in the previous week too their 2 10 curve is now at 19 bps but their negative 1 5 curve is at 16 bps so far there has been no assault on the ust yields from china as part of their retaliation the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 64 and down 10 bps over the week the china govt 10yr is down 3 bps in the week to 3 28 while the nz govt 10 yr is down 3 bps this week now at 1 82 gold was down us 10 on friday to us 1 276 oz us oil prices are soft today now just under us 62 50 bbl while the brent benchmark is just under us 72 bbl the kiwi dollar is lower against a rising greenback this morning at 65 5 usc and that it its lowest level since november 2018 on the cross rates we little changed at 95 1 auc although the aussie dollar may firm when it opens this morning on the election result against the euro we are similar at 58 4 euro cents that all makes the twi 5 slightly lower at 70 3 bitcoin is on a roller coaster after falling to us 7 034 it rose to over us 8 300 then back down to us 7 234 and now it is back up to us 7 986 it is a wild market with schizophrenic price signals pure crazy speculation this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here
cnn the american economy is already absorbing a body blow from the deepening us china trade war a real war could be more than the decade long economic expansion can handle investors would be wise to closely monitor the relationship between the united states and iran where tensions have soared after iran suspended parts of the nuclear deal that briefly brought an end to its economic and diplomatic isolation a clash in the middle east while unlikely would send oil prices surging that would deal a major blow to consumer spending the engine of the american economy history shows that oil price spikes not financial panics are the leading cause of recessions in modern america oil shocks have killed more us economic expansions over the last 40 years than any other single cause nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research wrote in a note to clients besides long lines at gas stations the saudi oil embargo of 1973 1974 helped set off a jump in oil prices that crippled the economy the iranian revolution of 1979 also led to a recession in the united states similarly the us economy slipped into a downturn after iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 and again following the us overthrow of iraqi dictator saddam hussein in 2003 historically we ve seen a spike in oil prices precede or coincide with a recession said mike reynolds investment strategy officer at glenmede colas noted that the last three examples occurred late in a protracted us economic cycle much like today s environment america s economic expansion now nine years old is on track to become the longest in history in july 140 oil in 2008 the great recession was caused by an epic housing bubble and overleverage on wall street but the fact that us oil prices skyrocketed above 140 a barrel in summer 2008 contributed to the depth of the downturn shell shocked american drivers struggled to pay 4 a gallon gas prices that was the straw that really broke the camel s back for consumer spending said troy gayeski co chief investment officer at skybridge capital oil shocks are scary because they simultaneously deal a blow to household spending and consumer confidence and higher oil prices can spread to other parts of the economy driving up costs on everything from airfare to trucking that can put pressure on profit margins as well as the federal reserve which is charged with ensuring inflation doesn t get out of hand the 2008 oil shock led the european central bank to raise interest rates that july just months before what would morph into the scariest financial crisis since the great depression they hiked rates at the worst possible time that was a bad call said gayeski it would be highly doubtful that the fed would overreact risks are rising in the middle east the recovery from the great recession has proven resilient overcoming countless scares such as brexit the slowdown in the chinese economy and the european debt crisis now the economy is under pressure from the us china trade war at the same time tensions have soared in the middle east punctuated by allegations from saudi arabia that oil tankers were sabotaged and oil facilities were attacked by armed drones the risks of a middle east military confrontation are rising sharply helima croft global head of commodity strategy at rbc capital markets wrote in a note to clients on wednesday there is growing concern that the region s long simmering cold war may be poised to become a hot one shale to the rescue us oil prices have surged nearly 50 since collapsing to 42 53 a barrel late last year however most of those gains occurred before the standoff over iran prices have held steady in recent days as concerns about the middle east were offset by the trade war a conflict in the middle east may not have as dramatic impact on prices as in the past that s because today the united states is the world s leading oil producer thanks to skyrocketing shale output in west texas the us is much more energy independent than in the past said glenmede s reynolds still it s a global market and shale alone can t make up for production losses in venezuela and iran let alone a potential military conflict in the middle east skybridge s gayeski said he believes the us economy could withstand brent oil prices climbing above 100 to 110 a barrel that s not the end of the world we don t see that as recession causing he said above that level though would be much more problematic

anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing director of the international monetary fund is senior research professor of international economics at the school of advanced international studies johns hopkins university and senior fellow at the center for international development stanford university not content with its trade war against china us president donald trump s administration has also opened bilateral trade negotiations with japan yet whatever trump hopes to achieve with japan it will be far less than what he threw away when he abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp in early 2017 during the 2016 us presidential campaign trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now that he has imposed heavy costs on us farmers consumers and the overall economy through tariffs on chinese imports americans are probably growing quite tired indeed trump s withdrawal from the tpp is the canonical example of his trade policy recklessness signed in 2016 by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries the treaty would have governed around 40 of all trade covered by world trade organisation rules it was a twenty first century agreement that included not just tariff reductions but also provisions to liberalise retail communications entertainment and financial services it would have strengthened labour and environmental standards established a new dispute resolution mechanism and created a framework for managing e commerce cybersecurity intellectual property rights data mobility and more when the us withdrew from the tpp many assumed the agreement was dead but the remaining signatories led by japanese prime minister shinzo abe quickly agreed on a replacement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp which retains around 200 of the tpp s 220 odd provisions the 20 that were left out were those for which the us pushed and can be reinstated should the country wish to join the pact at a later date now that the cptpp has entered into force australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam enjoy preferential access to each other s markets as tariffs are phased out us suppliers in those markets are finding themselves at a growing disadvantage while the japanese tariff on american beef imports has remained at 38 5 the levy on beef from fellow cptpp countries has fallen to 27 5 and eventually will reach just 9 as a result american beef and wheat entering japan or any other cptpp country now face a higher tariff than beef and wheat from australia canada or new zealand still abe has worked hard to maintain good relations with the us taking much political heat at home for it japan was one of the few us trading partners not to retaliate when the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium and while affirming japan s preference for regional and multilateral arrangements abe has nonetheless agreed to bilateral bargaining with the us with a japanese parliamentary election coming this summer bilateral talks aren t likely to go anywhere until later in the year when they do happen japan will benefit from having already entered into a free trade agreement fta with the european union as of this past february more than 90 soon to be 97 of eu exports to japan are duty free and after a brief phase out period the same will apply to 85 of agri food products while wine from the us faces a 15 tariff wine from the eu as well as from cptpp countries such as chile now enters japan duty free as do european cars which are subject to common safety standards not for nothing did abe tout the eu deal as proof of the unshaken political will of japan and the eu to lead the world as the champions of free trade at a time when protectionism has spread for its part the trump administration wants japan to remove barriers to us agricultural and auto exports and reduce its bilateral trade surplus which stood at 58 billion in goods in 2018 but while trump often complains that us goods face trade discrimination in japan he has only himself to blame it is only natural that us exporters would lose market share to their counterparts in europe and the cptpp countries with japan s new ftas in place the us trade deficit with japan is likely to grow even wider so much for trump s art of the deal the supposedly brilliant negotiator has left us exporters at a severe disadvantage in markets spanning the pacific rim and europe worse china is now pushing for a mega fta among 16 countries under the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep negotiations for which are ongoing although many china experts do not expect an agreement to be reached anytime soon here it is worth remembering that the tpp would have excluded china and locked in a us led trade bloc in asia for the long term no deal that the trump administration makes with japan can possibly make up for what the us would have had under the tpp at best the us will salvage the tpp terms concerning japan alone rather than all 11 original signatories though abe has declared his willingness to negotiate bilaterally with trump he cannot possibly grant the us better terms than those given to japan s cptpp partners we ve seen this movie before with each trumpian negotiation the us issues its demands offers little in return and threatens punishment through tariffs if it doesn t get its way like the thief who says your money or your life there is no actual negotiation to speak of by acting like an insecure bully trump has left the us increasingly isolated in the global economy american producers and consumers are already paying the price the only question is how much more winning they are willing to bear dm copyright project syndicate 2019

also owns a couple of exchange traded funds etfs he said all the holdings have appreciated a lot but he doesn t plan to sell any because a he doesn t need the money and b selling would create a sizable tax bill he hates the required minimum distribution that he must take on his tax deferred retirement accounts because they raise his taxes white is fortunate in one respect his father who was an engineer with new york telephone gave him early training in investing and taught him the value of owning shares in good companies it took me until i was 40 gordon eliot white 85 at home in southeastern virginia with his 1948 race car which he restored the long retired reporter still writes he also walks sails travels abroad and chairs a county agency photo by timothy c wright for the washington post in 1952 when i was 19 he gave me a few hundred dollars worth of stock and set me up with a bache co account white said he said his father s stock trades made the family comfortable but never really wealthy he fell in love with newspapers at the age of 7 when his parents took him to see a movie version of the play the front page in 1940 he graduated from cornell university where he worked on the cornell daily sun in 1955 and tackled the first of several newspaper reporting jobs which included a stint at the chicago american a hearst tabloid he arrived in washington in 1958 and spent most of the next four decades here i am one of those people fortunate enough to have been able to spend his career doing what he wanted to do almost as far back as he can remember white said i always thought i d be a reporter until i dropped he has been a mostly conservative investor but he went off the rails for a few years in the 1970s the experiments included investments in gold annuities oil wells not worth the complications of doing the taxes convertible debentures whatever those are junk bonds and pork bellies he even bet on horses white bought a couple thousand dollars worth of gold and then found it was expensive to store and did not earn interest or pay a dividend and you had to pay a transaction fee to buy or sell it i tried all kinds of things some of which were stupid white said i have probably made every investing mistake it is possible to make though with only relatively small amounts some early investments in homes paid off he bought a small house from college pal philip merrill who founded washingtonian magazine he used the rental income to buy another house in alexandria virginia and then another in mclean virginia the money he made from those properties though not huge was the seed money for future investments he won big on the sale of his alexandria home in 1989 the house cost 50 000 in 1972 and sold for 650 000 it is now assessed at 2 5 million the key to white s comfortable life in his ninth decade is his abiding belief in living beneath your means and saving when the 401 k retirement savings accounts started in 1978 white stashed every cent he could in an account he did the same with his individual retirement account i am a big believer in tax deferred retirement accounts i saved what i didn t spend he said and i made sure i didn t spend all that came in any freelancing money like a 100 monthly payment from an amateur radio magazine went to investment accounts for his three children when they graduated from college they had 18 000 each to make a start in life white wrote several books on auto racing that have kept him sharp and engaged the books have covered their expenses with a wee bit to spare he is still on the rolls as the smithsonian s auto race adviser he moved from alexandria to middlesex county in 1996 saving on real estate taxes and housing costs but retirement was not as inexpensive as he thought we travel more white said what we save on work clothing is peanuts food is the same utilities if anything are more we drive more his investment portfolio including ira 401 k and taxable accounts has changed over the years in 1989 he was 40 percent invested in virginia municipal bonds and 55 percent in index funds mutual funds and individual stocks today i am 2 percent cash 56 percent equities and 42 percent munis he said you got to have equities to guard against inflation he calls the municipal bonds my salvation because they pay 4 percent interest and are not taxed he stays away from mutual funds because of fees and taxes the biggest retirement shock was that medicare isn t free i thought i had already paid for medicare over all the years when medicare taxes were being deducted from my wages but when my social security check arrived smaller than i thought they said mr white we deduct your medicare premiums from your check his biggest regret is not putting retirement money in roth iras with a roth you don t get an immediate tax deduction the way you do with a normal ira but you can leave the money in as long as you like and never pay taxes on it again i could have afforded to forgo the tax deduction during my working years in order not to pay ordinary income rates on 50 and more years of appreciation on my investments right now his goal is preserving his capital so he can enjoy his 30 year and counting retirement i plan to be around for another 15 or 20 years of it he said
in 2016 trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now americans are probably growing quite tired washington dc not content with its trade war against china us president donald trump s administration has also opened bilateral trade negotiations with japan yet whatever trump hopes to achieve with japan it will be far less than what he threw away when he abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp in early 2017 during the 2016 us presidential campaign trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now that he has imposed heavy costs on us farmers consumers and the overall economy through tariffs on chinese imports americans are probably growing quite tired indeed trump s withdrawal from the tpp is the canonical example of his trade policy recklessness signed in 2016 by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries the treaty would have governed around 40 percent of all trade covered by world trade organization rules it was a twenty first century agreement that included not just tariff reductions but also provisions to liberalize retail communications entertainment and financial services it would have strengthened labor and environmental standards established a new dispute resolution mechanism and created a framework for managing e commerce cyber security intellectual property rights data mobility and more when the us withdrew from the tpp many assumed the agreement was dead but the remaining signatories led by japanese prime minister shinzo abe quickly agreed on a replacement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp which retains around 200 of the tpp s 220 odd provisions the 20 that were left out were those for which the us pushed and can be reinstated should the country wish to join the pact at a later date now that the cptpp has entered into force australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam enjoy preferential access to each other s markets as tariffs are phased out us suppliers in those markets are finding themselves at a growing disadvantage while the japanese tariff on american beef imports has remained at 38 5 percent the levy on beef from fellow cptpp countries has fallen to 27 5 percent and eventually will reach just nine percent as a result american beef and wheat entering japan or any other cptpp country now face a higher tariff than beef and wheat from australia canada or new zealand still abe has worked hard to maintain good relations with the us taking much political heat at home for it japan was one of the few us trading partners not to retaliate when the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and while affirming japan s preference for regional and multilateral arrangements abe has nonetheless agreed to bilateral bargaining with the us with a japanese parliamentary election coming this summer bilateral talks aren t likely to go anywhere until later in the year when they do happen japan will benefit from having already entered into a free trade agreement fta with the european union as of this past february more than 90 percent soon to be 97 percent of eu exports to japan are duty free and after a brief phase out period the same will apply to 85 percent of agri food products while wine from the us faces a 15 percent tariff wine from the eu as well as from cptpp countries such as chile now enters japan duty free as do european cars which are subject to common safety standards not for nothing did abe tout the eu deal as proof of the unshaken political will of japan and the eu to lead the world as the champions of free trade at a time when protectionism has spread for its part the trump administration wants japan to remove barriers to us agricultural and auto exports and reduce its bilateral trade surplus which stood at 58 billion in goods in 2018 but while trump often complains that us goods face trade discrimination in japan he has only himself to blame it is only natural that us exporters would lose market share to their counterparts in europe and the cptpp countries with japan s new ftas in place the us trade deficit with japan is likely to grow even wider so much for trump s art of the deal the supposedly brilliant negotiator has left us exporters at a severe disadvantage in markets spanning the pacific rim and europe worse china is now pushing for a mega fta among 16 countries under the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep negotiations for which are ongoing although many china experts do not expect an agreement to be reached anytime soon here it is worth remembering that the tpp would have excluded china and locked in a us led trade bloc in asia for the long term no deal that the trump administration makes with japan can possibly make up for what the us would have had under the tpp at best the us will salvage the tpp terms concerning japan alone rather than all 11 original signatories though abe has declared his willingness to negotiate bilaterally with trump he cannot possibly grant the us better terms than those given to japan s cptpp partners we ve seen this movie before with each trumpian negotiation the us issues its demands offers little in return and threatens punishment through tariffs if it doesn t get its way like the thief who says your money or your life there is no actual negotiation to speak of by acting like an insecure bully trump has left the us increasingly isolated in the global economy american producers and consumers are already paying the price the only question is how much more winning they are willing to bear anne o krueger a former

dressed in a smart black pantsuit behind the wheel of her pearl white audi zhao na has come a long way from her roots in rural henan province in central china the 29 year old real estate agent cheerfully admits to having shopaholic ways and a love of louis vuitton and prada handbags typifying a wave of free spending consumers who have had the world s top brands scrambling for a piece of china s 5 trillion plus retail market when i am flush i am happy to part with money said zhao who once splurged around 60 000 yuan 9 000 on a clutch of handbags during a trip to paris in 2017 spending makes me happy but with china s economy slowing zhao s business has hit a wall and her income has plummeted forcing her to shelve that source of happiness she has scrapped the european shopping trips and weaned herself off buying binges at her favorite mall david plaza where giant digital screens flash advertisements for brands like gucci lancome and ermenegildo zegna in the center of zhengzhou henan s capital not being able to spend money as i like makes me feel lousy but i cannot do much about it zhao said reality check an economic slowdown in china after three decades of unbridled growth is being felt especially keenly by consumers like zhao in henan the province with its 100 million people is a key pillar of china s aspirations to transform its economy by boosting domestic spending and raising living standards in the country s interior but according to dozens of interviews with consumers and merchants across henan as well as trade group data people in the province are spending less on everything from cars and household appliances to clothing and cosmetics scaled back consumption by inland urbanites like zhao could have serious repercussions for china s economic growth already imperiled by an escalating trade war with the united states it could also be a reality check for global retailers the italian suit maker ermenegildo zegna the american luxury jeweler tiffany and apple have all warned that consumers across china are paring back spending on wednesday china reported weak growth in retail sales and a drop in spending on clothing for the first time in a decade slowing spending in inland cities such as zhengzhou could dent the ambitions of global retailers that have pinned their hopes on future growth in regions like henan the largest provincial economy beyond china s prosperous coastal regions a province transformed long a dusty provincial capital zhengzhou s transformation in recent years into a metropolis with a glittering skyline and fashionable malls has been staggering the city of 10 million is a key transportation hub on china s belt and road network linked by rail to central asia and europe beyond with high speed connections to beijing and shanghai the taiwan contract manufacturer foxconn has built an enormous iphone factory in the city that employs 230 000 people ambitious young people once typically fled henan to seek better lives elsewhere but zhengzhou now gives them a place to pursue their middle class dreams earning more and being able to afford their own modern homes and an array of consumer goods for zhao the city was a beacon of hope born into a family of farmers in rural henan the youngest of three children zhao dreamed from an early age of escaping her impoverished village she did well in school which allowed her to attend university in zhengzhou where she discovered a talent for sales she joined a property developer working for rich clients sporting designer clothes and fancy handbags soon she was able to taste that lifestyle herself as she began racking up lucrative commissions on sales of top end apartments in zhengdong new area a commercial district where luxury hotels and office towers have sprouted from farmland she became a regular at the high end shops of david plaza and bought a car and two homes letting one of them out on airbnb supplementing the commissions zhao also piled up debt on her half dozen credit cards she says she owes about 200 000 yuan in credit card debt on top of monthly mortgage and car payments totaling 15 000 yuan but as zhengzhou s frenzied property market cooled last year sales plummeted along with her commissions and that put an end to her shopping trips to david plaza zhao is not alone in cutting back consumer confidence in provincial cities such as zhengzhou fell slightly last year after hitting its highest level in at least nine years in 2017 according to nielsen a research firm retail sales growth in zhengzhou fell to single digits last year for the first time in nearly two decades at two malls in zhengzhou s downtown shopping district retailers selling cosmetic brands like kiehl s and clinique said customers were becoming more careful they used to buy a lot and spend their money rather carelessly said li mengru the cosmetic sales manager at the dennis department store who oversees brands including chanel dior and estee lauder now they are becoming choosier as they turn cautious about spending easy money a key driver of consumption in china in recent years has been the explosion of new finance options including peer to peer loans and endless opportunities for acquiring credit cards that put a wealth of consumer goods in reach for people previously unable to afford them chai maofeng a 28 year old beef distributor in xuchang a henan city of about 4 million people opened ten credit card accounts in 2016 to furnish his apartment with a sofa set refrigerator air conditioners and televisions all brand new opening a credit card account was easy banks were happy to lend to you and all you needed was a landline number that suggested you worked in an office said chai but chai said he had to put his freespending ways on hold after the economic slowdown started hurting his business which had also been hit by a sweeping crackdown on polluting industries that pushed up beef prices chai said he had put off plans to buy a second property and a new car this one from the company is actually fine he said referring to the white van his company lets him use worse to come china s economy showed signs of recovery in the first quarter with gross domestic product growing more than expected by analysts but an intensifying trade war with the united states sluggish factory activity and slowing global demand for chinese products suggest the slowdown will continue through 2019 most economists say efforts by beijing to rein in credit and risky debt over the past few years to contain speculative bubbles has also reduced the amount of easy money available for many consumers those factors are likely to keep weighing on consumer spending analysts say beijing has taken steps to prop up spending announcing plans in january for subsidies to boost purchases of cars an industry that saw sales decline last year for the first time in two decades the government has also sought to increase take home pay by reducing the income tax burden for many individuals but government help is unlikely to offset a decline in confidence stemming from slowing income growth and rising household debt analysts say for all that consumers have not stopped spending altogether on a recent afternoon in downtown zhengzhou david plaza was bustling with shoppers checking out the latest lipsticks and sipping lattes in coffee shops but zhao was not among them staring at almost 30 years of mortgage payments ahead of her and the car loans she still needs to repay she said it might be a while before she shops at the mall again with income falling i have to make every penny count zhao said unnecessary luxury spending has to go for now
as part of a high profile tour of china in february saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs has overseen a range of multi billion dollar pledges and memorandums of understanding mous with beijing this partly reflects riyadh s desire to diversify sources for investments and technology following the mass withdrawal of major western business leaders from the future investment initiative in october 2018 after the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi embassy in istanbul yet cooperation with china on renewable energy if successful would realize a significant first step towards saudi arabia s lofty ambitions for solar and wind power these mous follow saudi energy minister khalid al falih s confirmation in january that the kingdom aims to develop 60 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity over the next decade plans that would multiply the gulf council cooperation s solar capacity tenfold however global trade dynamics and the inherent volatility of the solar market may complicate saudi arabia s goals saudi arabia hopes that developing a new industry would help create jobs for saudi nationals the country s policymakers are concerned that massive youth unemployment standing at 35 percent among jobseekers aged 15 24 and with the potential to increase to over 42 percent by 2030 can otherwise become a major source of instability promoting employment particularly in the private sector is a key goal of vision 2030 which seeks to fundamentally reshape the kingdom s economy and society as part of the overhaul vision 2030 furthermore aims to improve the domestic business environment localize domestic military manufacturing and revitalize plans for industrial cities as one of the world s largest fossil fuel consumers saudi arabia hopes to use the grand programs to help expand renewable energy sources to meet domestic demand in summer months saudi arabia burns around 700 000 barrels of oil per day solely for electricity generation particularly for air conditioning and water desalination this counts for around one fifth of saudi arabia s daily total oil consumption after transportation and the petrochemical and refining sector but this share is expected to grow as the population does providing alternative sources of energy for domestic consumption would also free up more oil and gas for export with oil prices between 50 and 70 the 700 000 barrels of oil per day currently used for electricity could be exported for between 13 billion and 18 billion per year with an abundance of both sunlight and land saudi arabia has a geographic advantage in developing solar power generation at scale according to a 2016 report by the international renewable energy agency developing even 1 percent of the suitable area in gulf cooperation council gcc countries could create the capacity to generate 470 gigawatts of photovoltaic power and create over 100 000 jobs within saudi arabia specifically the report estimated this would reduce the use of oil and gas for electrical production by 25 percent introducing renewables at a large scale would allow saudi arabia to free up spare oil production capacity which it has usually kept between 1 5 and 2 million barrels this gives it greater geopolitical leverage to affect oil prices by increasing or decreasing exports furthermore renewable energy investments are critical if the country is to meet the commitments it made in paris as part of the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015 through renewable investments saudi arabia has suggested it could avoid emitting 130 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2030 that is a an ambitious goal given that over the period between 2007 2017 saudi arabia s carbon dioxide emissions increased by an average of 4 7 percent per year from 392 5 million tons in 2007 to 594 7 million tons in 2017 by comparison over the same period france decreased its carbon dioxide emissions by 1 9 percent or 44 million tons of carbon dioxide furthermore situated between the economic bulwarks of europe asia and africa the kingdom is able to serve as an export platform for solar technology from places such as china to other countries in the region seeking to expand their solar capacity for example in may 2018 major chinese photovoltaic manufacturer longi signed an agreement with el seif group a major commercial and industrial trading company in saudi arabia to establish a large scale solar manufacturing infrastructure in the kingdom as part of a broader push to establish itself as a logistics hub saudi arabia has already streamlined its once byzantine trade documentation requirements as part of vision 2030 and established a special economic zone sez near the riyadh airport to serve as a hub for importing assembling and re exporting goods to three continents moreover rather than simply purchasing foreign made components and assembling them in saudi arabia domestic demand for renewable energy could fuel the growth of local manufacturing of solar components riyadh s commitment to such an import substitution policy is evident in vision 2030 which calls for the localization of manufacturing for both renewable energy projects and industrial equipment similarly saudi aramco s in kingdom total value add iktva program launched in december 2015 aims to have all businesses in the kingdom including renewable energy companies rely on saudi suppliers for at least 70 percent of the goods and services they need to operate by 2021 saudi arabia is poised to become a leader in renewables notably it is entering the global solar market late and therefore has a clearer idea about the costs and benefits saudi arabia is able to draw on the experience of other countries and take advantage of falling costs of photovoltaic cells thanks to china s advances on this front furthermore the relative absence of renewables in saudi arabia suggests more room for growth to spur the economy yet the extent to which saudi arabia has a comparative advantage in setting up a new industry such as renewable energy production remains unknown one of the greatest challenges to the country s renewable energy ambitions is the lack the technological expertise trained workforce or manufacturing capabilities to compete on a global scale in addition as long as china is able to produce and export cheap panels to the whole world there is little incentive for chinese firms to relocate their production except where they think they can avoid high tariffs a closer alliance with china could also pit saudi arabia against the trump administration according to the office of the united states trade representative the willingness of chinese firms to move their production facilities out of china to avoid tariffs was the driving force for the most recent bout of penalties in donald trump s trade war with beijing although trump has highlighted washington s close relationship with riyadh the administration has demonstrated a willingness to impose trade protection policies even on its closest political allies for instance in february 2018 the trump administration introduced a 20 percent tariff on washing machines following accusations that south korean manufacturers were flooding the u s market similarly washington has threatened to raise tariffs on european car imports given that the u s tariff of 2 5 percent is noticeably unequal to the european union s 10 percent tariff on u s cars efforts by riyadh to increase its domestic solar power manufacturing industry through cooperation with china risk prompting washington to extend the most recent tariffs to include saudi arabia with geography on its side saudi arabia could engineer a smooth economic pivot toward renewables and maintain its key role in the global energy industry however riyadh has a delicate balancing act to play if it continues relying on china to develop its solar energy sector without becoming collateral damage in the ongoing u s chinese trade war this article is reprinted with permission of sada it can be accessed online here
this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated the american economy is already absorbing a body blow from the deepening us china trade war a real war could be more than the decade long economic expansion can handle investors would be wise to closely monitor the relationship between the united states and iran where tensions have soared after iran suspended parts of the nuclear deal that briefly brought an end to its economic and diplomatic isolation a clash in the middle east while unlikely would send oil prices surging that would deal a major blow to consumer spending the engine of the american economy history shows that oil price spikes not financial panics are the leading cause of recessions in modern america oil shocks have killed more us economic expansions over the last 40 years than any other single cause nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research wrote in a note to clients besides long lines at gas stations the saudi oil embargo of 1973 1974 helped set off a jump in oil prices that crippled the economy the iranian revolution of 1979 also led to a recession in the united states similarly the us economy slipped into a downturn after iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 and again following the us overthrow of iraqi dictator saddam hussein in 2003 historically we ve seen a spike in oil prices precede or coincide with a recession said mike reynolds investment strategy officer at glenmede colas noted that the last three examples occurred late in a protracted us economic cycle much like today s environment america s economic expansion now nine years old is on track to become the longest in history in july 140 oil in 2008 the great recession was caused by an epic housing bubble and overleverage on wall street but the fact that us oil prices skyrocketed above 140 a barrel in summer 2008 contributed to the depth of the downturn shell shocked american drivers struggled to pay 4 a gallon gas prices that was the straw that really broke the camel s back for consumer spending said troy gayeski co chief investment officer at skybridge capital oil shocks are scary because they simultaneously deal a blow to household spending and consumer confidence and higher oil prices can spread to other parts of the economy driving up costs on everything from airfare to trucking that can put pressure on profit margins as well as the federal reserve which is charged with ensuring inflation doesn t get out of hand the 2008 oil shock led the european central bank to raise interest rates that july just months before what would morph into the scariest financial crisis since the great depression they hiked rates at the worst possible time that was a bad call said gayeski it would be highly doubtful that the fed would overreact risks are rising in the middle east the recovery from the great recession has proven resilient overcoming countless scares such as brexit the slowdown in the chinese economy and the european debt crisis now the economy is under pressure from the us china trade war at the same time tensions have soared in the middle east punctuated by allegations from saudi arabia that oil tankers were sabotaged and oil facilities were attacked by armed drones the risks of a middle east military confrontation are rising sharply helima croft global head of commodity strategy at rbc capital markets wrote in a note to clients on wednesday there is growing concern that the region s long simmering cold war may be poised to become a hot one shale to the rescue us oil prices have surged nearly 50 since collapsing to 42 53 a barrel late last year however most of those gains occurred before the standoff over iran prices have held steady in recent days as concerns about the middle east were offset by the trade war a conflict in the middle east may not have as dramatic impact on prices as in the past that s because today the united states is the world s leading oil producer thanks to skyrocketing shale output in west texas the us is much more energy independent than in the past said glenmede s reynolds still it s a global market and shale alone can t make up for production losses in venezuela and iran let alone a potential military conflict in the middle east skybridge s gayeski said he believes the us economy could withstand brent oil prices climbing above 100 to 110 a barrel that s not the end of the world we don t see that as recession causing he said above that level though would be much more problematic 32 427908 53 688046
rio de janeiro atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 percent and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummelled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this jackson told afp this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 percent from 2 2 percent that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 percent according to the latest central bank survey some even saw that estimate as optimistic marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone had to pay back debt at the same time but the risk of a technical recession two straight quarters of contraction was low we are already at the bottom casarin noted we could potentially see a double dip but that would have to be triggered by a domestic crisis such as failure to pass the pension reform bill bolsonaro has done little to help boost optimism among investors or voters the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy there was excessive optimism going on with bolsonaro s victory and now they are just more realistic said casarin it is pretty clear that he is struggling as president to make congress do what he wants one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base it does not bode well for his reforms the economy or the markets there s a longer stretch to be run to revamp the economy thomaz favaro of control risks consultancy told afp i think the risk of further declines is very much real
an honest and accurate analysis of the 2016 election is not just an academic exercise it is very relevant to the current election campaign yet over the past two years russiagate has dominated media and political debate and largely replaced a serious analysis of the factors leading to trump s victory the public has been flooded with the various elements of the story that russia intervened and trump colluded with them the latter accusation was negated by the mueller report but elements of the democratic party and media refuse to move on now it s the lofty but vague accusations of obstruction of justice along with renewed dirt digging to some it is a constitutional crisis but to many it looks like more partisan fighting russiagate has distracted from pressing issues russiagate has distracted attention and energy away from crucial and pressing issues such as income inequality the housing and homeless crisis inadequate healthcare militarized police over priced college education impossible student loans and deteriorating infrastructure the tax structure was changed to benefit wealthy individuals and corporations with little opposition the trump administration has undermined environmental laws civil rights national parks and women s equality while directing ever more money to military contractors working class americans are struggling with rising living costs low wages student debt and racism they constitute the bulk of the military which is spread all over the world sustaining continuing occupations in war zones including afghanistan iraq syria and parts of africa while all this has been going on the democratic establishment and much of the media have been focused on russiagate the mueller report and related issues immediately after the 2016 election in the immediate wake of the 2016 election there was some forthright analysis bernie sanders said what trump did very effectively is tap the angst and the anger and the hurt and pain that millions of working class people are feeling what he said is i donald trump am going to be a champion of the working class i know you are working longer hours for lower wages seeing your jobs going to china can t afford childcare can t afford to send your kids to college i donald trump alone can solve these problems what you have is a guy who utilized the media manipulated the media very well he is an entertainer he is a professional at that but i will tell you that i think there needs to be a profound change in the way the democratic party does business it is not good enough to have a liberal elite i come from the white working class and i am deeply humiliated that the democratic party cannot talk to the people where i came from days after the election the washington post published an op ed titled hillary clinton lost bernie sanders could have won we chose the wrong candidate the author analyzed the results saying donald trump s stunning victory is less surprising when we remember a simple fact hillary clinton is a deeply unpopular politician the writer analyzed why sanders would have prevailed against trump and predicted there will be years of recriminations russiagate replaced recrimination but instead of analysis the media and democrats have emphasized foreign interference there is an element of self interest in this narrative as reported in russian roulette p127 when the clinton team first learned that wikileaks was going to release damaging democratic national party emails in june 2016 they brought in outside consultants to plot a pr strategy for handling the news of the hack the story would advance a narrative that benefited the clinton campaign and the democrats the russians were interfering in the us election presumably to assist trump after losing the election team clinton doubled down on this pr strategy as described in the book shattered p 395 the day after the election campaign managers assembled the communication team to engineer the case that the election wasn t entirely on the up and up they went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public already russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument this narrative has been remarkably effective in supplanting critical review of the election one year after the election the center for american progress cap was founded by john podesta and is closely aligned with the democratic party in november 2017 they produced an analysis titled voter trends in 2016 a final examination interestingly there is not a single reference to russia key conclusions are that it is critical for democrats to attract more support from the white non college educated voting bloc and democrats must go beyond the identity politics versus economic populism debate to create a genuine cross racial cross class coalition it suggests that wall street has the same interests as main street and the working class a progressive team produced a very different analysis titled autopsy the democratic party in crisis they did this because the democratic party s national leadership has shown scant interest in addressing many of the key factors that led to electoral disaster the report analyzes why the party turnout was less than expected and why traditional democratic party supporters are declining it includes recommendations to end the party s undemocratic practices expand voting rights and counter voter suppression the report contains details and specific recommendations lacking in the cap report it includes an overall analysis which says the democratic party should disentangle itself ideologically and financially from wall street the military industrial complex and other corporate interests that put profits ahead of public needs two years after the election in october 2018 the progressive team produced a follow up report titled autopsy one year later it says the democratic party has implemented modest reforms but corporate power continues to dominate the party in a recent phone interview the editor of that report norman solomon said it appears some in the democratic party establishment would rather lose the next election to republicans than give up control of the party what really happened in 2016 beyond the initial critiques and autopsy research there has been little discussion debate or lessons learned about the 2016 election politics has been dominated by russiagate why did so many working class voters switch from obama to trump a major reason is because hillary clinton is associated with wall street and the economic policies of her husband president bill clinton the north american free trade agreement nafta promoted by bill clinton resulted in huge decline in manufacturing jobs in swing states such as michigan ohio and pennsylvania of course this would influence their thinking and votes hillary clinton s support for the trans pacific partnership was another indication of her policies what about the low turnout from the african american community again the lack of enthusiasm is rooted in objective reality hillary clinton is associated with welfare reform promoted by her husband according to this study from the university of michigan as of the beginning of 2011 about 1 46 million u s households with about 2 8 million children were surviving on 2 or less in income per person per day in a given month the prevalence of extreme poverty rose sharply between 1996 and 2011 this growth has been concentrated among those groups that were most affected by the 1996 welfare reform over the past several decades there has been a huge increase in prison incarceration due to increasingly strict punishments and mandatory prison sentences since the poor and working class have been the primary victims of welfare and criminal justice reforms initiated or sustained through the clinton presidency it s understandable why they were not keen on hillary clinton the notion that low turnout was due to african americans being unduly influenced by russian facebook posts is seen as bigoted paternalism by blogger teodrose fikremanian who says the corporate recorders at the ny times would have us believe that the reason african americans did not uniformly vote for hillary clinton and the democrats is because they were too dimwitted to think for themselves and were subsequently manipulated by foreign agents this yellow press drivel is nothing more than propaganda that could have been written by george wallace how clinton became the nominee since the 2016 election there has been little public discussion of the process whereby hillary clinton became the democratic party nominee it s apparent she was pre ordained by the democratic party elite as exposed in the dnc emails there was bias and violations of the party obligations at the highest levels on top of that it should now be clear that the pundits pollsters and election experts were out of touch made poor predictions and decisions bernie sanders would have been a much stronger candidate he would have won the same party loyalists who voted for clinton his message attacking wall street would have resonated with significant sections of the working class and poor who were unenthusiastic to say the least about clinton an indication is that in critical swing states such as wisconsin and michigan bernie sanders beat hillary clinton in the democratic primary race clinton had no response for trump s attacks on multinational trade agreements and his false promises of serving the working class sanders would have had vastly more appeal to working class and minorities his primary campaign showed his huge appeal to youth and third party voters in short it s likely that sanders would have trounced trump where is the accountability for how clinton ended up as the democratic party candidate the relevance of 2016 to 2020 the 2016 election is highly relevant today already we see the same pattern of establishment bias and horse race journalism which focuses on fund raising polls and elite biased electability instead of dealing with real issues who has solutions who has appeal to which groups mainstream media and pundits are already promoting joe biden syndicated columnist ej dionne a democratic establishment favorite is indicative in his article can biden be the helmsman who gets us past the storm dionne speaks of the strength he biden brings and the comfort he creates in the same vein andrew sullivan pushes biden in his article why joe biden might be the best to beat trump sullivan thinks that biden has appeal in the working class because he joked about claims he is too hands on but while biden may be tight with afl cio leadership he is closely associated with highly unpopular neoliberal trade deals which have resulted in manufacturing decline the establishment bias for biden is matched by the bias against democratic party candidates who directly challenge wall street and us foreign policy on wall street that would be bernie sanders on foreign policy that is tulsi gabbard with a military background tulsi gabbard has broad appeal an inclusive message and a uniquely sharp critique of us regime change foreign policy she calls out media pundits like fareed zakaria for goading trump to invade venezuela in contrast with rachel maddow taunting john bolton and mike pompeo to be more aggressive tulsi gabbard has been denouncing trump s collusion with saudi arabia and israel s netanyahu saying it s not in us interests gabbard s anti interventionist anti occupation perspective has significant support from us troops a recent poll indicates that military families want complete withdrawal from afghanistan and syria it seems conservatives have become more anti war than liberals this points to another important yet under discussed lesson from 2016 a factor in trump s victory was that he campaigned as an anti war candidate against the hawkish hillary clinton as pointed out here donald trump won more votes from communities with high military casualties than from similar communities which suffered fewer casualties instead of pointing out that trump has betrayed his anti war campaign promises corporate media and some democratic party outlets seem to be undermining the candidate with the strongest anti war message an article at fairness and accuracy in reporting fair says corporate media target gabbard for her anti interventionism a word they can barely pronounce russiagate has distracted most democrats from analyzing how they lost in 2016 it has given them the dubious belief that it was because of foreign interference they have failed to analyze or take stock of the consequences of dnc bias the preference for wall street over working class concerns and the failure to challenge the military industrial complex and foreign policy based on regime change interventions there needs to be more analysis and lessons learned from the 2016 election to avoid a repeat of that disaster as indicated in the autopsy there needs to be a transparent and fair campaign for nominee based on more than establishment and wall street favoritism there also needs to be consideration of which candidates reach beyond the partisan divide and can energize and advance the interests of the majority of americans rather than the elite the most crucial issues and especially us military and foreign policy need to be seriously debated blaming an outside power is a good way to prevent self analysis and positive change it s gone on far too long
alvin hansen s timing could hardly have been worse in early 1939 almost a decade after the wall street crash and six months before hitler invaded poland he said america s best years were behind it an ageing population fewer migrants and the exhaustion of existing technologies meant there would never be complete recovery from the great depression instead the us was stuck in what hansen called secular stagnation in which secular means persistent or long term the second world war meant the idea of secular stagnation was a five minute wonder demand soared as the us government geared up to fight on two fronts and strong growth persisted for a quarter of a century after the war ended many of the technological innovations of the late 19th and early 20th century the car for example only came into their own in the us post 1945 when family incomes rose and the interstate highway network was built hansen s secular stagnation thesis had something of a revival in the middle years of this decade when it was popularised by the harvard economist larry summers the lesson from the financial crisis of 2008 09 summers said was that underlying growth rates had fallen and that even ultra low interest rates could not deliver full employment what massive amounts of monetary stimulus could do however was encourage excessive speculative activity and hence the risk of another financial meltdown the recovery in the global economy in 2017 and 2018 suggested that summers had chosen the wrong moment to conjure up the ghost of hansen a broad based pick up in growth encouraged the belief that life was at last returning to normal central banks signalled they were preparing to raise interest rates and in some cases actually did so but the recovery started to lose momentum in the middle of 2018 the synchronised upswing turned into a synchronised downswing affecting almost every one of the globally significant economies the imf said 70 of the global economy would see weaker growth in 2019 than in 2018 central banks shelved plans to raise interest rates hansen s name is once again being bandied around with the consultancy oxford economics noting last week we are now in an age where healthy growth can only be achieved when underpinned by strong and sustained external policy support there is certainly enough evidence to ensure that the secular stagnation thesis is taken seriously unemployment in the us has not been lower since 1969 the year of the first moon landing in britain the jobless rate is back to levels of the mid 1970s yet in neither country has there been anything approaching sustained wage inflation indeed the latest set of uk employment data showed the annual rate of earnings growth going down rather than up all central banks have targets of 2 or thereabouts for annual consumer price inflation since 2013 research by llewellyn consulting shows inflation has tended to undershoot these targets on a sustained basis in the us the euro area sweden and canada while in japan the trend set in earlier in both the us and the eurozone the cpi level is almost 5 below where it would have been had inflation targets been hit two episodes of currency depreciation which generates higher inflation through dearer exports meant the uk was the only major country where prices had overshot rather than undershot this is the backdrop to the current weakening of global growth which is being exacerbated by the tit for tat protectionist battle between the us and china trade flows are as weak as they were during the winter of 2008 09 when the global recession was biting hardest recovery a decade ago was prompted by colossal policy stimulus that cannot be repeated there is limited scope for central banks to cut interest rates the impact of donald trump s stimulus package is waning and china is much warier of credit induced growth than it was during the great recession as a result the financial markets now think central banks will be much more cautious about raising rates the ecb the bank of japan and the swedish riksbank are expected to keep their feet hard to the floor while the us federal reserve is now thought more likely to cut rates during 2019 than raise them six months ago the markets were predicting three quarter point increases in the us this year sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk while there seems no immediate prospect of a recession especially after the stronger than expected start to 2019 there has been a definite shift in mood confidence that the us will be in the vanguard of a worldwide increase in interest rates has evaporated instead there is a concern that japan is exporting its low growth low interest rates and bouts of deflation to the rest of the world the eurozone is already well on the way to turning japanese all that said in the past no sooner have the words secular stagnation been uttered than events have occurred to make the idea redundant there are two reasons why hansen may soon return to semi obscurity the first is that the secular stagnation hypothesis rests on the assumption that all the big productivity enhancing innovations have already happened and that s a big call to make developments in artificial intelligence nanotechnology and genomics look set to boost the supply potential of economies the second is that loose monetary policy is not the only way of responding to secular stagnation hansen a disciple of keynes advocated higher state spending to boost demand once interest rates had reached rock bottom levels and it was duly provided by roosevelt and churchill if things turn really nasty what worked in war time will be tried in peace time

rio de janeiro atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 percent and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummelled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this jackson told afp this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 percent from 2 2 percent that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 percent according to the latest central bank survey some even saw that estimate as optimistic marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone had to pay back debt at the same time but the risk of a technical recession two straight quarters of contraction was low we are already at the bottom casarin noted we could potentially see a double dip but that would have to be triggered by a domestic crisis such as failure to pass the pension reform bill bolsonaro has done little to help boost optimism among investors or voters the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy there was excessive optimism going on with bolsonaro s victory and now they are just more realistic said casarin it is pretty clear that he is struggling as president to make congress do what he wants one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base it does not bode well for his reforms the economy or the markets there s a longer stretch to be run to revamp the economy thomaz favaro of control risks consultancy told afp i think the risk of further declines is very much real
chinaâ s rapid development carries huge significance in the modern time and is widely recognized as a miracle by the international community but such achievements have led to harsh voices of some americans who said it was their country that had rebuilt china in the past 25 years such voices go against common sense and are totally wrong by claiming such point some us senior officials exposed only their ignorance itâ s understandable if they know little but itâ s horrible when they pretend to act like that some americans hold that the so called imbalanced trade between china and the us is a result of the chinese manipulation of exchange rate and the us trade deficit with china is wealth sent by the us to china they attribute chinaâ s success to a large extent to the us investment in china such theory ignoring the struggling and hard work of the chinese people in the past decades not only goes against facts but also is illogic the theory that the us helped rebuild china revealed the arrogance and distorted mindset of some americans who believe the us is the savior of the world receiving little support in the us it has been only ridiculed by the international society the us trade deficit with china is caused by the comparative advantages of the two countries and international labor division which has long been recognized by us economists china has always adhered to market rules in foreign trade and worships fair business it is nothing but nonsense to take the deficit as an argument supporting the â us helps rebuild chinaâ theory according to stephen roach yale university senior fellow and former chairman of morgan stanley asia the us ran trade deficits with 102 countries in 2018 based on this figure was the us rebuilding most of the countries in the world any normal people are not likely to have such superiority the bilateral trade between china and the us is absolutely not a one way street via which the us is sending money to china the deficit doesnâ t mean the us is losing money on the contrary the us is gaining tangible profits and cost efficient products is it possible that american businessmen are giving their money to the chinese the answer is obviously negative according to report issued by third party organizations including the deutsche bank the us gained more net profit than china did in bilateral trade china us economic and trade cooperation is based on win win results nobody wants to lose in business especially the americans who are good at seeking profits and stick to the â american firstâ strategy the contribution made by the us investment to chinaâ s economic development is undeniable but it is not correct to say it is the fundamental reason for china to grow into the second largest economy of the world since 1987 when china started keeping statistics on foreign investment the country has accumulatively utilized foreign capital of more than 2 trillion however only 80 billion or 4 06 percent of the total came from the us has the us rebuilt china with 80 billion that does not exist even in dreams itâ s beyond imagination how the americans reached such conclusion if such conclusion was true is it that china is rebuilding the us as the latter is gaining hundreds of billions of us dollars from its investment and service trade in china each year as a matter of fact after the â us helps rebuild chinaâ theory came into being the us website politifact made a report on it and held that the theory was interpreting the china us trade relations in an over simplified way scott lincicome a scholar at the libertarian cato institute said that the theory is correct in only one tiny sense trade with all countries including the united states has been part of a major market reform he said adding that reforms have been much more fundamental any country must depend on itself for development the chinese people understand that the development of their country a huge economy with nearly 1 4 billion people cannot rely on other countries besides there is no country in the world that is able to â rebuildâ china which is understandable to anyone sensible chinaâ s development derives from the efforts made by the chinese people to promote reform and opening up under the leadership of the communist party of china as well as their hardworking spirit it is not righteous for the us to take the credit china is not developing with its doors shut but opening its doors for more win win cooperation with other countries while making its own development the country is also opening wider its market and increasing overseas investment creating opportunities for other countries including the us without the chinese financing of american government debt and corporate investments the us would not have been able to sustain growth in real estate defense and business for so many years said a yale university economics and finance professor who specializes in the chinese economy â in an interlinked globalized world it is really hard to say who is rebuilding whomâ the professor added there is no savior in this world most of the want to be saviors are doing more bark than bite and will end up failing however there are always arrogant people in the world who pose as saviors and their fabricated stories are nothing but jokes instead of making nonsense the us should respect the facts and stop blaming china irresponsibly it should perceive chinaâ s development properly and contribute to the stable development of china us trade relations
what s next for trade talks with china and the u s emerging markets face the middle income trap cecl provides more insurance for the financial system in geometry we re taught that the shortest distance from a to b is a straight line in economics everything is described by a curve and in political science we learn that policymaking can be a long and winding road trade negotiations between china and the united states took a sudden turn last week when the white house announced new tariffs china responded early this week with countermeasures these provocations came as a rude awakening after three months of negotiations that seemed to be on the brink of success while abrupt the reversal of course was not altogether unexpected as we noted several weeks ago trade negotiations are difficult and ratification of agreements can be more so the issues being discussed are complex and they are part of a large complicated economic and strategic relationship between the two countries consensus is still possible but it may take longer to reach the consequences of delay for the global economy could be substantial last week the united states increased tariffs on 200 billion of imported goods from china and threatened to extend the tariffs to an additional 325 billion of products the new measures were prompted by allegations that china had retreated from commitments made during negotiations china has denied this assertion and has retaliated by increasing tariffs on 60 billion in goods imported from the u s a review of how tariffs operate is in order counter to popular belief the target country s government does not pay the tariff it is paid by domestic importers from that country in the short term this prompts importers to do one or a combination of three things ask their chinese supplier for a price concession to offset the tariff pass the cost along to consumers absorb the tariff in their profit margins as a result of these effects the tariff is a kind of tax largely paid by u s consumers and shareholders but american negotiators feel that the current backdrop of strong economic growth and strong markets mean these costs can be absorbed comfortably over the longer term tariffs may cause consumers to shift away from chinese products and u s firms to shift supply chains to reduce reliance on china whereas a 10 tariff may not have been enough to prompt this reorientation a 25 tariff might be this is why economic projections show that the new measures will hit china much harder than the united states the longer that tariffs last the more likely that production will shift out of china american negotiators have been betting that the chinese economy would not be able to withstand an extended trade conflict while china s dependence on exports has fallen during the past five years it still relies on overseas sales to a greater degree than does the united states the increase in tariff rates and the potential for them to spread to a broader community of products will further the discomfort faced by chinese producers and make it more difficult for them to compete in u s markets china s financial condition has become more tenuous during the past decade total debt as a percentage of gross domestic product has doubled in the past decade and credit losses are increasing chinese president xi jinping has recently highlighted the importance of financial stability in 2017 the government took steps to curb credit trading strength for stability and causing growth to moderate that moderation has been extended by uncertainty over trade conditions which has taken a bite out of both production and consumption china has the means to buffer the impact of the trade war and has been using them effectively credit has been eased and the government is spending strategically to sustain economic growth but the impact of the escalation in trade tension has already been reflected in the value of the chinese currency and in the level of chinese equity markets chinese shares have lost 10 of their value over the past month any further deterioration could cause further damage to consumer and business confidence china has been expecting political considerations to lead the u s to conclude an agreement the government believed president trump wanted to make a deal in order to demonstrate progress on his foreign policy program this may have been a miscalculation on two fronts first the white house seems to be scoring political points by taking a hard line and secondly political capital is most valuable when accrued close to election day as the two titans battle it out a series of other countries are caught in the middle emerging asian economies that supply china are seeing orders cut australia which sells china raw materials and takes in its tourists may be at risk for its first recession in 28 years and germany as we covered in a recent note may be facing new hurdles as we ve noted before there are no winners in a trade war at the moment the rhetoric between china and the united states has gotten sharper the provocation now includes u s restrictions on the purchase of huawei telecommunications equipment a blow to one of china s national champions the next key milepost in the process is the g 20 meeting in japan at the end of june presidents trump and xi will both be in attendance they have shared productive conversations during past encounters further and more fruitful discussions could be initiated at that time there is a chinese proverb that at the 90th mile in a 100 mile journey you are only halfway there the last miles on the road to trade peace may be difficult to traverse but things should be fine as long as the destination remains in sight nonetheless the risk has risen of a sustained u turn that would cause deeper and more widespread economic damage trapped globalization has generally been good for countries low income countries at nascent stages of economic development have the most to gain as their entry to global systems reduces extreme poverty and boosts incomes moving from low to middle income status is great progress but many nations fail to continue into the highest income bracket countries in this middle income trap struggle to continue competing internationally for growth the world bank defines the middle income range as an annual income per capita over 996 under 3 895 for the lower middle income nations including india and indonesia and 3 896 to 12 055 for upper middle income nations such as brazil and china that may seem modest by western standards but represents substantial improvement from conditions of 30 years ago growth for developing markets comes in phases urbanization and industrialization occur first and spur high growth thereafter countries often experience prolonged stagnation and struggle to remain competitive an important obstacle is a country s inability to continue the process of moving from low value added to high value added industries capabilities that enhance productivity from low productivity to high productivity activities can be elusive rising income levels increasing urbanization and an expanding services sector tend to diminish the pool of surplus labor possessed by low income countries wages press higher reducing the country s competitive advantage in basic industries this work moves on to lower wage countries to continue upward innovation and private sector investment are critical many countries struggle to generate these ingredients income inequality also hinders countries trying to escape a middle income trap greater distance between winners and losers often leads to a backlash against market oriented reforms and the inflow of capital poland serves as a good example inequality across income groups remained low as the country successfully transitioned from the middle to high income group in less than two decades many countries stall in their economic development according to world bank data only a handful of middle income nations have managed to escape the trap since the 1960s south korea taiwan and israel are notable success stories gaining comparative advantage in the production of sophisticated products and improving the quality of education have been pivotal to south korea s success these nations have also invested in improving governance and avoiding corruption combined these factors have led to improved productivity higher investment and the rise of competitive corporations by contrast countries like brazil and south africa are stuck in the middle income trap in addition to some of the above mentioned causes kleptocracy has also played its part china still has the potential to escape the trap but its industrialization policy has some resemblance to the ones adopted by latin american economies in the postwar era these policies do bear fruit but ultimately leave nations in a pool of debt chinese policymakers have increasingly focused on building a high value exports industry to steer away from the trap but china s move up the value chain in sectors like robotics and artificial intelligence has become a point of contention in the current u s china trade negotiations so the formula for escaping the middle income trap includes improving governance reducing bureaucracy and graft stressing quality education eliminating constraints on economic activity and providing social safety nets together these measures not only boost productivity and private sector participation but also help in reducing income inequality embracing and implementing these strategies will not be easy in many places but they are essential if developing countries want to continue progressing our new friend cecl every loan carries a risk of default lenders must set aside reserves for loan losses but the approach for doing so in the united states is about to change substantially starting next year the financial accounting standards board s fasb current expected credit loss cecl standard will require banks to set aside reserves for expected loan losses over the full life of the loan this contrasts with the current rather simple convention of booking reserves only when a borrower begins to show some likelihood of defaulting fasb is concerned that banks may carry insufficient reserves to endure a sudden change from a strong economy to a credit crisis lenders will now rely on economic forecasts and statistical models of credit losses to predict future loan losses while this application is novel credit risk modeling itself is not new for example the fico score is a way to express a consumer s probability of defaulting on a new loan cecl is designed to provide more insurance against a banking crisis some observers have criticized cecl for being pro cyclical creating a risk of amplifying the severity of downturns models may overcompensate when economic conditions worsen and many banks have changed lending strategies so past losses may not be comparable to future experiences if risk models yield results that show a need for a large immediate increase to loss reserves banks will tighten lending standards just when the economy most needs loans alternative research disputes this concern but the final outcome won t be known until lenders experience a recession the concern driving cecl is legitimate banks were indeed underprepared for the losses experienced in the 2008 global financial crisis leading to government intervention that we never wish to repeat since then banks have been asked to hold more capital and enhance liquidity cecl is intended to expand on this foundation by building reserves against loss during good times all banks are currently working to ensure compliance with cecl if we agree with ben franklin s aphorism that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure the financial services industry will be well fortified against the next crisis
persistent as ever transportation minister rotimi amaechi is pressing ahead with an ambitious national railway construction programme that comes with a hefty 45 billion price tag this is fine since nigeria s current 3 500 kilometres of track is grossly inadequate leaves the economy hobbled and traps the country in under development but the minister and president muhammadu buhari miss the point by their go it alone mindset featuring multiple multibillion dollar contracts and colossal loans for rail and other projects that the government has neither the resources nor the wherewithal to repay there is an urgent need for a rethink to achieve the goal of providing the needed rail infrastructure especially for goods haulage faster and more efficiently everything should be done to attract foreign direct investment and local investors for rail and other major infrastructure projects amaechi s doubts that private capital would be readily available to lay tracks the fundamental part of rail infrastructure is misplaced in a developing country like ours creative pro business policies will lure fdi policy the strong political will and consistency in implementation are the must have ingredients that successive nigerian governments have not been able to muster over the decades amaechi in a recent newspaper interview laid out government s grand ambitions and part of the costs lagos kano is to cost 8 7 billion abuja itakpe warri and its seaport 3 9 billion lagos ibadan 1 6 billion kaduna abuja 1 billion kano kaduna 3 1 billion among others he said we need between 35 billion and 45 billion to do lagos to kano port harcourt to maiduguri lagos to calabar and abuja to warri once you do these you ve covered the country and solved the problem of transportation to a large extent the urgent need for massive railway construction is obvious until the recent extensions of the last few years the last major rail project undertaken in the country was the 640 kilometre kano maiduguri line completed in 1964 that brought the total track stock to 3 505 km it stands at 3 528 km today by international union of railways figures our competitors in the brics club to which we aspire have much more brazil s 29 303 km of tracks carry over 20 per cent of all cargoes within the country india s 121 407 km is the world s fourth largest network carrying over 1 10 billion tonnes of freight annually 8 1 billion passengers and 49 per cent of its routes run on electricity powered engines russia and china have the world s second and third largest networks respectively while south africa s 20 000 km of track is 50 per cent in excess of current demand says the international council on monuments and sites read also ogun community accuses christ embassy of land grabbing the enormity of the investment required means the government should aggressively seek international private capital the world bank has recommended and reported increased private sector investment in rail infrastructure its private participation in infrastructure database revealed that the 39 per cent of private investment in transportation in 2017 was powered by a surge in investments in railways in asia including a 6 8 billion high speed rail project in china another hsr project in indonesia and a 3 1 billion monorail in thailand amaechi however deprecates private capital investment in tracks which he rightly asserted are capital intensive i challenge anyone to show me anywhere in the world where anybody has seen a private investor in the railway s arguing that private capital goes into operations and not tracks this is not the full story yes a majority of tracks worldwide are state owned with private investment heavier in rolling stocks engines coaches and route tracks says the railway technical an online resource are the basic part of the rail infrastructure the fixed guidance system and steering base for the trains but this is because most governments had consistently invested in rail tracks over the years many had sizeable track mileage that was being inefficiently run their problem therefore was more of inefficient management of existing infrastructure than the chronic infrastructure deficit in nigeria privatisations concessions and liberalisation that have gained much traction since the 1980s thrusting private operators to the fore in many countries about 36 per cent of south africa s tracks are not even used according to icoms second and most importantly nigeria offers a unique opportunity for privately built railways for freight as once offered by ge that wanted to build a lagos kano fast rail and by the o odua group for a lagos ibadan rail link public private partnership also offers immense opportunities that this government has inserted into the 25 year rail plan but is not pursuing with the same vigour as it pursues chinese loans private capital helped by state subsidies actually built substantial rail infrastructure in north and south america private capital is also making a difference in europe s rail system while china and india are encouraging private concerns the way to go is to open up by fine tuning and implementing the liberalising rail reform programme drawn up by the nasir el rufai led bureau of public enterprises and swiftly pushing for the repeal of the restrictive railway act of 1955 buhari and amaechi should muster the required political will and open their minds to alternative views and new thinking our situation is dire the government should woo and concession existing rail lines to the best global rail operators it should develop and implement public private partnership approaches to attract private investment and expertise in core capabilities this will provide additional resource mobilisation to the sector in partnership with the states it should mark out national rail routes and offer them to international investors through a targeted bidding for investment in tracks through wholly private or ppp deals within a robust regulatory framework that protects the public and investors alike government going it alone has resulted in abandoned projects project reversals and gross under funding this is wrong adopting new models government can substantially free itself of the financing burden of allocations and loans investors will concentrate on viable routes for freight and passengers to recoup their investments and make profit while the government is now free to invest much lower sums in less profitable hinterland routes to meet the demands of social equity today s template allows politics to take precedence over economics drains the treasury of scarce resources and entraps the country in debt copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may

steyer is a longtime democratic donor afp getty it s a modest conceit for a sitting us senator especially one who is a leading figure in a progressive movement that has surged over the past decade that s not to mention the resume she has built since her seemingly reluctant entrance into national politics in 2010 when she spearheaded the creation the consumer financial protection bureau one of the financial sector s most hated agencies only to be blocked from running the thing by a washington elite fearful of what the former harvard law professor might do with an agency aimed at keeping wall street accountable but standing in that union hall on a recent rainy afternoon in front of all those teachers ms warren had a story to tell that s more than just her policies i had this dream i wanted to be a public school teacher and so like a lot of americans i have a story that kind of twists and turns it doesn t take a straight line she said describing her first love in life teaching support free thinking journalism and attend independent events born in oklahoma city in 1949 the 69 year old senior massachusetts senator said her life was anything but glamorous growing up her middle class parents struggled with medical bills after her father had a heart attack a condition that was only exacerbated when his hours were cut as a salesman they lost the family station wagon they almost lost their home the twisting and turning came next and ms warren has a way of telling the story in short segments pulling the audience with her on the journey that would see her nearly not achieving that dream of being a public school teacher achieving that dream and then losing that dream before finding her way back so here goes my story i got a scholarship to college yay she said raising her fist triumphantly to applause then at 19 we fell in love yay she said with marked less enthusiasm and the audience catches the drift laughing along oh and got married to the first husband ehh she continued riding dangerously close to some understanding boos dropped out of school oh warren speaking in philadelphia associated press ap after the exit from school ms warren the found herself a job answering phones a job she says would have been a good life but not the one she wanted so she eventually enrolled at the university of houston for 450 a semester and later became a special education teacher i loved it and i would probably still be doing it today but back in the day before unions the principal by the time we got to the end of the first year i was visibly pregnant she said and the principal did what principals did in those days they wished you luck showed you the door and hired someone else for the job and there went my dream of course that s not where ms warren s story ends and that wasn t the end of her dream she went on to move to the east coast where she attended law school at rutgers university she practised law after that for 45 minutes before going back to her first love teaching trading kids for adults studying law at harvard university for the next several decades she says she focused on money commercial law corporate finance law economics and bankruptcy before finally finding herself in washington pushing the obama administration to put in place a consumer financial watchdog in an effort that would then propel her against the odds into a us senate seat and now a long shot presidential election campaign elizabeth warren calls for impeachment proceedings sitting far below the front runner in the democratic field joe biden it s easy to see why ms warren tells her story of meandering triumph while the former vice president instantly found himself in first place in the polls with nearly 40 per cent support after announcing his candidature ms warren is pushing third place with less than 10 per cent in most polls sometimes she s in fourth place and there are some 20 other candidates not far behind doing everything they can to stand out hot on her heels sometimes at least for ms warren standing out can be a liability and she s learned that the hard way while she has often tried to focus on her big policy proposals she s also been attacked repeatedly by donald trump and republicans for claiming native american ancestry on an official national law school directory and just last year she fanned those flames further by releasing dna test results that showed she perhaps had distant native american ancestry generations ago a stunt that stirred fury in the cherokee nation who said the senator s claim of connection to the tribe was inappropriate even as she tried to put the whole thing to bed plus even without the native american ancestry fiasco ms warren is always a target for pundits in the biden wing of the democratic party who think the former vice president is a safer bet as he won t rock the boat as much and perhaps won t alienate big money donors in the pharmaceutical industry on wall street and elsewhere who help pay for the billion dollar presidential campaigns that america has come to know as the price of admission to the white house these days trump on elizabeth warren i should have saved the pocahontas thing for another year so facing those attacks it helps to have the alternative narrative she s a midwestern middle class gal who is used to being the underdog she s the hero in waiting who knows more than almost anyone how wealth and power have amassed in america while regular joes get left behind and she s the robin hood in the race planning that first big heist waiting for the best opportunity to pounce there s been one central question that has always been at the heart of my work and that is what s happening to working families in america she said why is america s middle class being hollowed out why is opportunity shrinking in this country why is it that for people who work every bit as hard as those a generation earlier that the road is getting steeper and rockier and for people of colour even steeper and even rockier that s been my work and she has plans for all of that get people into college for free and eliminate student debt for around 95 per cent of americans revitalise american unions make sure americans all get affordable health insurance and actually target the special interests that have created a system that benefits the wealthy and not the middle class the rich will pick up the tab with a 2 per cent tax on wealth above 50m that will pay for much of her plans she says how about for the ultra zillionaires we include in their property tax the diamonds the rembrandts and the yachts ms warren said in philly describing the tax she says is better understood as a property tax for the ultra wealthy right elizabeth warren launches 2020 us presidential bid in her estimation the current system works pretty well for those at the top big financial institutions are doing great just not the workers getting ripped off as they try to make it between paydays big oil companies aren t worried about padding their pocket books while the rest of us are watching in fear as climate change comes bearing down upon us and for the woman who persisted that s enough to pull her from her dream job in the classroom but you know there comes a time when the fight comes to your front door and you see what it s about and you say there s no more standing on the sidelines she said in philadelphia concluding her story and perhaps setting up its next chapter this is our chance to build an america that is an america of our best values this is our chance to build the america in which not just those at the top but everybody gets a real chance to build a life

donald trump continues his everything is great one day and then the next tweet storming robert mueller democrats or don mcgahn he is still continuing to create his own world of facts at his supporter rallies though president trump spoke this past week as if he s unaware that drug prices have gone up and tariffs came before him his boast that the u s never collected a dime on goods from china until he imposed them marked a series of statements misrepresenting how trade works as the two countries escalated their dispute with new and retaliatory taxes on each other s products meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a closer look at his latest set of facts trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china u s versus china economy trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china tariff income trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks monday with hungary s prime minister the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries russia investigation putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said was absolutely fake remarks tuesday before a private meeting with secretary of state mike pompeo in sochi russia the facts putin is wrong about the mueller report in regards to its findings of collusion the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings drug prices trump drug prices have gone down for the first time in 51 years they ve gone down first time in 51 years remarks monday at white house dinner the facts that s an outdated boast trump appeared to be referring to recent decreases in the labor department s consumer price index for prescription drugs but the index was updated friday before trump s latest claim and it showed an increase of 0 3 in april for prescription drug prices when compared with the same month last year the index tracks a set of medications both brand drugs and generics other independent studies point to increasing prices for brand name drugs as well and more overall spending on medications an analysis of brand name drug prices by media outlets showed 2 712 price increases in the first half of january compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year however the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier an analysis by altarum a nonprofit research and consulting firm found that in 2018 spending on prescription drugs was one of the main factors behind a 4 5 increase in u s health spending spending on prescription drugs grew much faster than in 2017 according to the study economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum said he expects drug prices will continue to creep up i would be quite surprised if by july the annual rate doesn t return to a more normal 2 4 growth said hughes cromwick jobs trump we have the most people working today than at any time in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts true but not surprising the record workforce is driven by population growth a more relevant measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still far below record highs according to labor department data 60 6 percent of people in the united states 16 years and older were working in april that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 tax cuts trump we have the biggest tax cut bill in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and president barack obama s renewal of them a decade later

gains also the 50 dma crossed below the 200 dma triggering a death cross the price found support above the 100 dma which forms an organic neckline for a double top the renewed risk off led investors to increase treasury holdings pushing yields to the lowest since early december we have been consistently bullish on treasurys predicting that yields will continue to fall and it has been one of the reasons for our bearish stance on equities despite the rally since if yields would fall below the 200 dma it would signal a continued downtrend an omen for equities especially after the second yield inversion this year one of the most feared leading indicators however notice the falling wedge pattern rates have been developing since august should the 200 dma prove to be a support the price could complete a small double bottom whose neckline confirmed by the 100 dma is at 2 6 also completing a falling bullish wedge the fundamental scenario for this technical development would be the realization that there are several significant differences between the recent yield inversion and historical ones current valuations are not disconnected from prices as they were during the dotcom bubble the ongoing concerns over trade tightening and economic data doesn t paint a picture of irrational exuberance among company managers still it s impossible to know how trade negotiations will

taxes on each other s products meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a look at some recent rhetoric trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks monday with hungary s prime minister the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries russia investigation putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said

collusion the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility

federal reserve bank of dallas president robert kaplan says trade tensions might have a chilling effect on the us and global economy and he s also watching for the potential effects on inflation some end markets may be jeopardized by the us china trade dispute but the bigger thing is logistics and supply chain arrangements kaplan said saturday during a wide ranging discussion at the society for advancing business editing and writing s annual conference in phoenix it s more likely to slow global growth and it s more likely to slow u s growth ultimately but it s also possible some of the threatened tariffs won t be enacted he said president donald trump last week increased duties to 25 from 10 on some 200 billion in chinese products and has threatened to impose tariffs on almost all imports from the world s no 2 economy that would pull in consumer products like mobile phones and toys that so far haven t been affected as well as everything from flashlights to billiard balls inflation impact as for the effects of tariffs on inflation it s too soon to judge you ll have to see the currency reaction and how businesses deal with it said kaplan who doesn t vote on monetary policy this year he noted that the fed will have to examine is this transitory or is this something that will be more persistent kaplan also echoed concerns that technological advances are muting inflation which has been stubbornly below the fed s target we think that s intensifying fueled by the low cost of capital he said the high ratio of corporate debt to u s gdp is a concern said kaplan while manageable for now it could be an amplifier if the economy turns down many leveraged loans aren t on banks balance sheets and we need to be vigilant and watch the non bank financial sector kaplan said the fed has less visibility into the well being of that sector he said daily liquidity kaplan also pointed to the several hundred billion dollars in high yield debt in exchange traded funds and other vehicles with daily liquidity noting that there s a mismatch between the liquidity held and the rights of holders to get high liquidity as to whether trump s criticisms of the fed and jawboning for an interest rate cut have had any impact on decisions around the table the answer is no kaplan said he also talked about the increase in government debt in recent years and that some people are assuming the dollar will always be the world s reserve currency when they dismiss concerns about the issue kaplan said it would be a mistake to assume that will last forever kaplan said people don t need to stop buying treasuries they just need to get down to market weight and the u s is going to spend more for its debt he said lack of workforce growth in the us is also an issue kaplan said particularly if immigration is reduced and the workforce participation rate which was 62 8 as of the april payrolls report could fall to 61 in coming years he said on the regulatory front kaplan said he would be loath to do things that ease up on capital testing for large banks however he said he feels differently about small and medium sized banks which need relief

reverse a 0 2 rise in march in spite of the softer numbers support for the dollar came from a jump in the ny empire state manufacturing index the index rose from 10 10 to 17 80 in may stats through the 2nd half of the week were on a more positive footing april building permit and housing starts were on the rise in april with the weekly initial jobless claims figures also impressing of greater significance however were may s philly fed manufacturing index and consumer sentiment numbers the philly fed manufacturing index jumped from 8 5 to 16 6 in may with the michigan consumer sentiment index surging from 97 2 to 102 4 outside of the numbers primary focus through the week remained on the u s china trade war u s president trump upped the ante late in the week blacklisting huawei in the week the move led to beijing shifting stance on a willingness to resolve the ongoing trade dispute following the tariff hike on chinese goods in the previous week china rolled out tariffs on u s goods last week the move came in spite of trump s warning to beijing not to retaliate in the equity markets the u s majors ended the week in the red again the nasdaq ended the week down 1 27 while the s p500 and dow fell by 0 76 and 0 69 respectively negative sentiment towards trade ultimately weighed with the losses coming in spite of 3 consecutive days in the green mid week out of the uk economic data was on the lighter side throughout the week wage growth and employment numbers released on tuesday weighed on the pound wages grew by just 3 2 in march easing from a 3 5 rise in february story continues claimant counts also weighed rising from 22 600 to 24 700 in april on the positive the unemployment rate fell from 3 9 to 3 8 in march through the april claimant count numbers offset any upbeat sentiment towards march number while the data was on the negative a 2 11 slide in the pound through the week to 1 2724 resulted from political events in the week early on in the week eu election polls showed that farage and the brexit party had knocked both the tories and the labour party off of their perches to front run into next week s eu elections theresa may and jeremy corbyn failed to deliver an agreement by the end of the week leading to more brexit uncertainty to wrap the week up theresa may also had to give an end date to her position as pm to the 1922 committee with farage looking to rock the uk political cradle talk of boris johnson waiting in the wings for the top job didn t do the pound too many favors the slide in the pound provided much needed support to the ftse100 which ended the week up 2 02 the upside in the week came in spite of the escalation in the ongoing u s china trade war out of the eurozone the stats were mixed through the week key stats included german 1st quarter gdp numbers and germany and the eurozone s economic sentiment and eurozone industrial production figures while germany s zew current conditions index improved in may the more influential economic sentiment index slid from 3 1 to 2 1 weighing on the eur adding to the downside was a slide in the eurozone s zew economic sentiment index and fall in industrial production the economic sentiment index fell from 4 5 to 1 6 with industrial production falling by 0 5 in march while a recovery in the german economy was good news it wasn t spectacular with the economy growing by just 0 6 year on year in the 4th quarter the economy had grown by 0 9 of less influence through the week were eurozone 1st quarter gdp and trade data in spite of a widening in the eurozone s trade surplus finalized april inflation figures also had little impact on the eur the eurozone s annual core rate of inflation came in at 1 3 which was well below the ecb target the eur ended the week down 0 67 to 1 1158 the weekly loss dragging the eur into the red for the current month in the equity markets the majors found strong support with the cac ending the week up 2 08 the dax and eurostoxx600 also made gains rising by 1 49 and by 1 16 respectively support came from the u s plan to delay a rollout of tariffs on eu autos for 6 months and the u s majors and a softer eur the upside was capped however with the majors seeing red on friday weighed by the ongoing u s china trade war elsewhere it was a rough week for the aussie and kiwi dollars the aussie dollar slid by 1 91 with the kiwi dollar ending the week down 1 18 for the aussie dollar the stats were skewed to the negative while business confidence saw a slight improvement in april employment and consumer sentiment numbers weighed wages grew by 0 5 in the 1st quarter coming up short of a forecasted 0 6 rise consumer sentiment rose by just 0 6 following a 1 9 increase in april wrapping up a bad week was a 6 300 fall in full employment in april leading to the unemployment rate rising from 5 1 to 5 2 with the rba s focus on labor market conditions the weaker numbers coupled with sentiment towards the u s china trade war did the damage ahead of the federal elections that take place today for the kiwi dollar there were no stats until the end of the week a slide in both producer input and output prices in the 1st quarter weighed at the end of the week adding to the downside was the april business pmi while the actual pmi rose from 51 9 to 53 sub index numbers were less impressive new orders and employment conditions weakened with the u s china trade war thrown in the question will be whether the rbnz will need to cut rates for a 2nd time in the coming months for the loonie the stats were skewed to the

month on month while the consumer price index rose by 0 4 consumer prices had risen by 0 7 in march march manufacturing sales figures failed to give the loonie a boost on thursday sales increased by 2 1 which was far better than a forecasted 1 5 increase while the stats were skewed to the negative news of the u s canada and mexico reaching a deal to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum limited the downside for the loonie on the week the loonie ended the week down 0 31 at c 1 3458 against the greenback for the japanese yen the japanese yen slipped to 110 levels to end the week down 0 12 at 110 08 losses came despite a shift in sentiment towards the u s china trade talks and lack of progress on brexit a jump in the michigan consumer sentiment figure on friday suggests strong support for trump policy which ultimately left the yen in the red out of china stats through the week included april fixed asset investment industrial production and retail sales figures all the numbers were on

by folashade soule and camilla toulmin abidjan in recent years images of young africans attempting to reach europe sometimes through the most daring and desperate routes have become a fixture on global and national news channels cynical politicians in europe and the united states have argued for the sake of winning votes that these largely male immigrants are invading their countries threatening to steal locals jobs or worse nothing could be further from the truth as we were reminded during the 2019 mo ibrahim foundation governance weekend there is in fact no mass exodus from africa at all in 2017 more than 50 percent of the world s migrants originated from just 21 countries the top four were india 6 4 percent mexico 5 percent russia 4 1 percent and china 3 9 percent the african country that accounted for the largest share of migrants egypt ranked 19th africa as a whole accounts for only around 14 percent of global migrant flows most of which are confined to the continent several recent reports by the international organization for migration and the united nations conference on trade and development among others indicate that around 70 percent of sub saharan african migrants remain on the continent mostly within east and west africa 18 5 percent and 16 7 percent respectively almost half 46 percent of all intra regional african migrants are female western countries thus face little risk of a massive wave of african migrants and a substantial number of migrants is not necessarily a bad thing for the african countries that receive most of them as intra african migration fosters economic connections between rural and urban areas and among regional neighbors host countries can reap important economic and social benefits this point is underscored by a 2018 afrobarometer survey of 34 african countries which shows that younger better educated urbanites are more likely to have considered emigrating than their older less educated rural counterparts they are motivated most often by the desire to find a job 43 percent or to escape economic hardship 33 percent tapping these migrants potential and ensuring that intra african migration is a safe orderly and productive process will require african governments with the support of international institutions to create better frameworks for managing migration on the continent beyond collecting and sharing data international institutions can share knowledge and best practices with governments as the migration dialogue in west africa has done african governments should increase their contributions to such initiatives which have so far been funded largely by western donors technology can also help the nonprofit techfugees for example is already working to coordinate the tech industry s response to the refugee challenge spurring the development of solutions for and with displaced people existing projects include migreat which helps refugees navigate the asylum application process and geecycle focused on recycling and donating mobile phones to refugees more fundamentally keeping migrants safe requires governments and media to set the record straight in south africa for example anti immigrant rhetoric has recently fueled xenophobic attacks on malawians and zimbabweans while african migration flows are not as large as some politicians claim they could increase as the effects of climate change such as droughts floods and other natural disasters intensify already climate change is contributing both to extreme events such as cyclones idai and kenneth in mozambique and to chronic emergencies such as increasingly unpredictable weather patterns in the sahel these trends highlight the growing urgency of improving how migration is managed of course migrants home countries also have a role to play migration represents a brain drain within africa given that most young african migrants are educated their departure undermines development in the countries that need it most while fueling growth in host countries by filling labor gaps boosting consumption and expanding the tax base migrants do send back remittances which amount to one of the largest sources of financial flows to developing countries globally but this money is used mainly to supplement consumption for recipient families and pay for school fees rather than to finance productive investments that is why home country governments again with international support should be working to generate the quality jobs needed to entice young africans to stay home in recent years entrepreneurship has been hailed as the solution to africa s jobs problem but spurring entrepreneurial activity will require concerted action from governments for example to address the mismatch between the skills private companies seek and those africa s young people possess governments should invest in education in science technology engineering and math and in improving vocational training moreover governments should work with the private sector to improve the business environment governments should also capitalize on the dynamism of the large informal sector which employs an estimated 75 90 percent of africans formalizing agriculture agro processing and many small scale manufacturing and service enterprises will require governments to provide infrastructure public services and access to credit at the now generation forum in abidjan earlier this month debates among youth delegates made clear that african young people will no longer passively await a better future they are doing everything in their power not just to develop their skills and find quality jobs but also to bring about political change even if it means taking to the streets to challenge their governments as just occurred in algeria and sudan but they cannot do it alone african governments and the international community must do more to support their ambitions and the continent s future this commentary summarizes the debates at an inet cget workshop held during the mo ibrahim governance weekend which brought together panelists from afrobarometer the african development bank u n migration unu inra the african union development agency and representatives from the african private sector folashade soule and camilla toulmin are associates at the institute for new economic thinking s commission for global economic

this article is part of jacobin s green new deal series the rest of the pieces in the se ries can be read here in 2013 when brandon king and others launched cooperation jackson a radical project to bring economic democracy and worker ownership to jackson mississippi they decided to put their funds toward purchasing land instead of paying themselves salaries we were renting just to have a space for meeting that s completely not sustainable said king who spearheads the group s sustainable urban farm cooperative added his colleague sacajawea hall we needed to acquire and also be thinking about land ownership in a collective way i don t think it was ever a question for cooperation jackson the question of land who owns it manages it and accesses it is at the heart of the climate crisis and a major source of wealth and inequality it is also essential for ensuring that our sustainable low carbon future the future envisioned by the green new deal gnd is a just one agriculture contributes 9 percent of us carbon emissions and by one estimate a third of global greenhouse gas emissions largely from livestock refrigeration and chemical fertilizers and pesticides these emissions are a product of the model of industrial monoculture farming which maximizes profits by growing a single crop like soy or corn over vast swaths of land the green new deal is calling for the elimination of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector by investing in sustainable farming and building a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food what we re trying to do is release the investments from the federal government to mobilize those resources across the country new york representative alexandria ocasio cortez explained in february responding to right wing scare mongering about a government takeover in green new deal clothes it could be tennessee valley authority style public programs but it could also be public private partnerships it can work down on a municipal level there could be some potential contracting involved but aoc s statements raise the fraught issues of racism and capitalism at the heart of gnd politics in other words contracts and partnerships with whom in the popular imagination the quintessential us farmer tends to be the hardworking corn fed white family farmer toiling in the fields from sunrise to sundown the reality is much different us farms have rapidly decreased in number and grown in size meaning they are consolidated in fewer hands today many family farms are factory farms only run by private individuals instead of a corporate board of directors while some aging farmers are selling off their farms to neighbors or larger agribusiness firms as urban development encroaches on rural land making it particularly difficult for younger farmers to purchase land the distribution of land in the us is also shaped by legacies of racial hierarchy and violence ninety eight percent of private rural land and 96 percent of private agricultural lands are white owned less than 1 percent of farms are black owned it wasn t always this way in 1910 that number was 14 percent the rapid decline was partially a product of the great migration and mechanization themselves outgrowths of a racist political economy but black farmers were also pushed off their land through discriminatory lending practices and inadequate legal political and financial resources to stave off real estate developers and today in the fields 80 percent of farm workers who pick the fruits and vegetables that appear neatly packaged in our grocery stores identify as hispanic or latino then there s the often overlooked fact that these farmlands were once stolen from indigenous people by the federal government which established us sovereignty in the west by offering free newly privatized land to white settlers through the 1862 homestead act the act cleared the path for corporations to extract resources from the land fur oil minerals lumber and much more and as indigenous water protectors have highlighted the process continues to this day with the army corps and other government agencies offering construction permits to pipeline corporations on indigenous land ultimately the issue of agriculture shares a common basis with battles over fossil fuel pipelines as indigenous historian and activist nick estes puts it in his book our history is the future there is one essential reason why indigenous peoples resist refuse and contest us rule land full disclosure i was the editor of estes s book throughout its history the federal government has allowed private corporations to expropriate public goods such as air and water while shifting the costs and impacts of pollution damaged ecosystems and climate change onto communities that will depend on the land long after the corporations have gone and public lands stolen from indigenous people and entrusted to the government for the benefit of the public have been no exception a 2016 federal study found that a quarter of us carbon emissions were produced by fossil fuel extraction on public lands a trend that has only accelerated under donald trump history thus offers few reasons to believe that government contracts and public private partnerships won t simply perpetuate the inequalities and injustices of our current food system consolidating wealth and economic power among those with deep pockets and washington connections still there is some cause for hope sustainable farmers scattered throughout both urban and rural areas of the us are already deploying permaculture methods of farming that in some cases can even help sequester carbon from the atmosphere on her soul fire farms in albany new york leah penniman cultivates some of her crops on rocky slopes that namibian mounding and kenyan terracing farming techniques have made productive but which industrial agribusiness would have considered unusable some 1 500 miles away in minnesota the indigenous environmental activist winona laduke initiated a project in 1989 to recover reservation lands lost settlers revive old traditions of land stewardship and produce wild rice and other ojibwe foods further west in washington state migrant mexican farmers who organized the familias unidas por la justicia farmworkers union have launched a new farm cooperative cooperativa tierra y libertad to grow organic berries and offer a more secure future for its worker owners there are others too run by brown black and indigenous farmers drawn to sustainable food growing methods both as a cultural inheritance organic farming is a method developed across millennia but first revived in the us by a black farmer dr george washington carver in the early 1900s and as a way to provide cheap healthy food for their communities could these be to borrow aoc s words the resources that the federal government needs to mobilize with investment some elements of such a green new deal might already be found in limited seedling form within existing legislation and government programs the federal farm bill s 2501 program includes special funding through land trusts community colleges tribal governments and nonprofit organizations to help farmers of color acquire own operate and retain farms penniman suggests that farmers be paid via the environmental quality incentives program and conservation reserve program for using methods that conserve the environment and sequester carbon and on the flip side industrial agriculture should be taxed for outsourcing the long term effects of its pollution and ecological destruction onto the public yet these measures leave intact the economic and political structures that favor corporations and the wealthy over sustainable farmers and will continue to be limited by one essential factor land last spring penniman helped convene a gathering of the northeast farmers of color network an informal alliance of about 150 black latinx and asian organic farmers the animating question what are the biggest obstacles for being able to feed and sustain our communities and maintain the businesses that support our families one answer emerged repeatedly access to land long term planning and construction projects are difficult for farmers who rent and this includes investing time and money into implementing and in many cases learning sustainable farming methods as long as people depend on water air food from the earth and natural environmental processes to survive these resources and the land that holds them should not be controlled by a small number of billionaires a just equitable green new deal would acknowledge that land is a major source of wealth and inequality and work towards what activists call land justice the access to land that farmers need to build healthy equitable food systems that provide jobs and keep the food dollar in the community as eric holt giménez the executive director of think tank food first writes it might do this by creating as penniman and the northeast farmers of color have advocated in the past a commission to study reparations and propose a comprehensive redistribution of wealth and land federal programs to buy back land are while limited not entirely without precedent the land buy back program for tribal nations allocated 2 billion in 2009 to repurchase indigenous lands that had been fractionated into small individually owned parcels and returned to reservations and communal tribal ownership under the cobell v salazar settlement and in an interview the historian roxanne dunbar ortiz noted that despite its manifold problems and shortcomings the 1934 indian reorganization act part of the original new deal did include funding to buy back similar lands and restore them to tribes these steps would not reverse the historical processes that deprived black brown and indigenous communities of resources power and dignity for generations the same ongoing processes that drive corporate resource extraction and created the climate crisis but they would be steps toward rectifying historical wrongs and climate chaos spreading heat waves deep freezes droughts floods and fires throughout the continent will only further threaten land access for people long divested of it usaid has stated that land tenure will be instrumental in managing the increased population in migrant receiving communities in other words climate migration even the world bank acknowledges that secure land rights are essential to reduc disaster risk and build climate resilience land rights allow communities to grow their own food build their own housing install their own solar panels and create public places where local markets and social networks can be cultivated resources that when disaster strikes can make the difference between perishing and bouncing back yet at the northeast farmers of color gathering the questions did not stop at the issue of land access when we have access to land what are ways to hold land in common there ve been communities all over the world who before they were impacted by capitalism and globalization were operating in a similar fashion said brandon king of cooperation jackson laying out their vision for an eco village on a block of land they ve acquired near downtown jackson the imagined eco village would be a mixture of new and renovated homes all manufactured by the industrial 3d printing fab lab machines they ve acquired permaculture design and a farm and solar panels for the community the eco village is a way that we can show a different way of life and relating to the land and to each other he said it s those models that we want to affirm

by david lawder and steve scherer washington ottawa reuters the united states struck deals on friday to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from canada and mexico the three governments said removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new north american trade pact the separate agreements which will not impose u s quotas on canadian and mexican metals shipments will also eliminate mexican and canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range of u s products including pork beef and bourbon the united states and canada said their agreement will be implemented by sunday afternoon and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped steel and aluminum from china and other countries from entering the u s market via canada president donald trump had imposed the global section 232 tariffs of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum in march 2018 on national security grounds invoking a 1962 cold war era trade law both canada and mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the united states and challenged the tariffs before the world trade organization this is just pure good news for canadians canadian prime minister justin trudeau told reporters after announcing the deal to workers at stelco holdings inc s steel mill in hamilton ontario stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news while top u s steelmaker nucor fell 3 1 percent and u s steel corp which had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs fell 1 2 percent spokesmen for u s steel and nucor which had advocated for maintaining strong tariff protections could not be reached for comment trade deal vote the metals tariffs were a major irritant for canada and mexico and had caused them to halt progress toward ratification the new u s mexico canada agreement the trilateral trade deal to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement u s lawmakers with constituents suffering from canadian and mexican retaliation including senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley also said they would not consider a usmca vote with the tariffs in place after the deal grassley tweeted thank u mr president for really helping the farmers of iowa w this important step in usmca w lifting metal tariffs realdonaldtrump just proved he can deliver on negotiations china ought to take note start dealing in good faith take pres trump seriously trudeau said canada would now work with the united states on the timing of usmca ratification and said he was optimistic canada would be be able to move forward well in the coming weeks u s vice president mike pence said he would meet with trudeau in ottawa on may 30 to discuss advancing ratification several u s democrats applauded removal of the tariffs but said usmca was not yet ready for their support when it comes to the new agreement house democrats continue to have a number of substantial concerns related to labor environment enforcement and access to affordable medicines provisions those issues still need to be remedied said house ways and means committee chairman richard neal neal added that the deal does not address global steel overcapacity and criticized trump s handling of trade negotiations with china which deteriorated significantly in the last two weeks trump speaking to realtors in washington called the pact a fantastic deal for our country and said congress would hopefully approve the usmca quickly then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will make our economy even more successful than it already is jesus seade mexico s deputy foreign minister for north america said the deal measurably increases the probability the usmca will be approved before the u s congress summer break in august some u s lawmakers say passage would become more difficult after the recess due to budget battles expected in the fall and increased 2020 presidential campaign activity transshipments surges trump s metals tariffs have been largely aimed at keeping excess production from china out of the u s market and the deal includes a new monitoring mechanism aimed at preventing steel and aluminum from china and other countries from being transshipped through canada and mexico to the united states but the u s trade representative s office also said the deal allows it to reimpose tariffs in the event of surges in imports of specific steel products if tariffs are reimposed retaliation would be limited to the steel and aluminum sectors carmakers which have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher u s costs due to the tariffs praised the deal and said it brought usmca passage a big step closer while many automakers already source the vast majority of their steel and aluminum domestically tariffs drive those prices up which decreases investment and harms auto workers and ultimately consumers said the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing most major brands including general motors co toyota motor corp volkswagen ag and others the national pork producers council which says retaliatory tariffs have cost its members 12 per animal or a total of 1 5 billion also expressed relief at the end of a trade dispute that has placed enormous financial strain on american pork producers additional reporting by david shepardson andrea shalal and doina chiacu in

three month low into tuesday the was last seen at ca 1 70477 down 0 2 from the daily open while the perceived probability of a no deal brexit remains relatively low recent developments have added to the odds with cross party talks abandoned little hope for may s withdrawal agreement bill passing the house of commons hurdle and growing expectations of a euro sceptic successor to pm may which would also be seen as increasing the chances of a less benign withdrawal from the eu ing economist james smith wrote the perceived risk of a no deal brexit has probably risen in the past few weeks there s a kind of acceptance that there will be a new prime minister who will probably be a eurosceptic meanwhile the price of oil remained supported into tuesday with the loonie benefiting therefrom and pushing the cross lower looking ahead tuesday is relatively light on the data front with uk industrial order expectations the only notable data point elsewhere bank of england governor carney and colleagues will report on the state of the british economy before the treasury select committee thus far the central bank have retained a hawkish bias but have been unable to tighten policy given substantial brexit uncertainty while the latest commentary from carney indicated hikes could come sooner than markets expect investors have erred on the side of pessimism with the gbp failing to find support wednesday will see some crucial canadian data with the latest retail sales figures due core retail sales rose by 0 4 in february for their first increase since september and we expect this performance to continue into march on the heels of a sharp increase in consumer goods imports and strong labour market data wrote td securities analysts in a note to clients gbp cad update 2 a candian bank holiday didn t stop the loonie gaining on the british pound through monday s session with sterling last seen trading lower versus the cad for a fifth consecutive session at ca 1 71031 a three month low advertisement the latest increases in oil prices come in the wake of the opec decision to maintain cuts on production moving forward alongside a potential crisis in russian oil supplies with a number of western firms refusing to pay for contaminated oil for the sterling markets took a breather from the brexit related pessimism that prompted the gbp to record its worst weekly performance of the year thus far last week with focus instead turning to eu parliamentary elections may 23rd 26th according to the latest polls both the conservative and labour parties are expected to shed votes to the brexit party with a dismal tory result expected to add to the already considerable pressure on pm may to resign despite the recent losses gbp remains the second best performing g10 currency in the year to date after the cad we have previous argued that the optimism built into the pound during the early months of this year can be linked with the consensus view that a brexit deal between the uk and the eu was the most likely outcome wrote rabibank currency analyst jane foley adding in view of the current uncertain political backdrop gbp now looks vulnerable gbp cad update the pound to canadian dollar exchange rates drifted marginally lower as the weekly session commenced with sterling last seen trading at ca 1 71067 hovering just above a three month low posted earlier in the session the week ahead holds some key data releases while the underlying themes of us china trade brexit and european parliamentary elections are expected to remain key market drivers on brexit following the abandonment of cross party talks focus has reverted to may s deal and any changes expected ahead of the early june house of commons vote meanwhile eu parliament elections are expected to yield poor results for the conservative government with the latest polls indicating the brexit party could win 34 of the ballot more than the labour and conservative parties combined and a testament to the uk public s anger over the handling of brexit data wise wednesday s uk cpi release is expected to be the main release for the gbp with consensus estimates calling for 2 2 inflation versus the 1 9 printed previously for the loonie retail sales data on wednesday is expected to reflect an uptick in core sales 0 6 to 0 8 while overall sales volume at the retail level is forecast to print static at 0 8 pound canadian dollar gbp cad exchange rate slips as china prepared to suspend trade talks the start of last week china retaliated against the us despite warnings from president donald trump not to do so china stated that 60 billion worth of us goods would be slapped with tariffs which likely dampened sentiment in the risk sensitive canadian dollar on tuesday the pound slipped against the canadian dollar as data revealed that uk unemployment fell to a fresh 44 year low of 3 8 however further data revealed that workers pay did not rise as high as forecast which could suggest the uk labour market is showing signs it is cooling meanwhile on wednesday data revealed that canadian inflation picked up to 2 exactly at the bank of canada s boc target it is likely this provided the loonie with an upswing of support brexit tensions heightened last week as prime minister theresa may faced further pressure to name a date for her departure on thursday after a meeting between may and the 1922 committee it was revealed the prime minister would outline a timetable for her departure after the next brexit vote in june on friday sterling was weighed down by further disappointing news as after six weeks brexit cross party talks were reportedly dead it was announced that talks were set to end without the brexit deadlock being broken meanwhile chinese state media claimed that beijing was prepared to suspend trade talks with the us if washington continued its tough action against china the death of cross party talks and fragile risk appetite left the pairing muted on friday afternoon will sterling gbp slide on disappointing uk inflation on wednesday the pound gbp could rise against the canadian dollar cad following the release of the uk retail price index if retail prices rise higher than expected in april it could buoy sterling also due for release on wednesday is the uk consumer price index cpi which could dampen sentiment in sterling if inflation fails to meet the bank of england s boe 2 target the pound canadian dollar gbp cad exchange rate could slide will an unexpected rise in retail sales buoy the canadian dollar cad looking ahead to wednesday the canadian dollar cad could rise against the pound gbp following the release of the canadian retail sales if retail sales rise higher than forecast in march the loonie could be provided with an upswing of support meanwhile any further developments in the us china trade dispute could cause movement of the pairing if beijing or washington decides to escalate tensions further and dents risk appetite it could cause the pound canadian dollar gbp cad exchange rate to rise
trade issues pale in importance compared to the need to maintain good economic political and people to people relations between china and the us most of the economic concerns are short term and relatively small but the china us relationship will shape the state of the world for decades i m an american living in china and married to a chinese woman so i have a strong interest in and love for both countries the deterioration in economic relations over the last 10 years or so frightens me let s look at what is important and what s not according to a recent study by the san francisco federal reserve bank imports from china constitute only 1 76 percent of us consumer spending on the other side china s trade with the us amounts to less than 5 percent of its gdp these numbers are not tiny but they are also not large enough to much affect the lives of most people however limited groups of workers and companies are directly affected a principal goal of both governments it to protect lower skilled industrial workers the us administration is trying to restore the kinds of factory jobs that once gave working class people a shot at a middle class lifestyle and china is aiming to protect the jobs of factory workers in its export industries but any protection of those low skilled jobs will have to be short term and transitional in both countries us wages have long been too high to allow industries based primarily on low wages to locate there only the artificial separation of work forces in india china and the former soviet union from western markets allowed those jobs to exist from the 1940s to the 1970s in china incomes and wages have risen sharply so a business based on low wage labor will no longer work there either the only long term solution for both countries is to upgrade to higher value added manufacturing and service jobs the two countries should be focused on how to manage this transition since wwii the us has had a history of allowing developing nations easy access to its markets but then restricted this access when a country became more advanced from 1945 until about 1970 western european countries especially germany had easy access to us markets and the us did not require access to european market european currencies were strongly undervalued from the us point of view this was okay when european producers were small and technologically inferior but by 1970 the europeans had caught up so the nixon administration responded by removing the tie between the dollar and gold effectively devaluing the dollar similarly the japanese enjoyed easy unreciprocated access to us market from the 1950s through the 1970s the japanese yen was strongly undervalued at about 300 hundred yen to the dollar compared to about 100 today but by the 1980s japanese companies had become highly competitive with us companies so the us insisted on a rapid upward revaluation of the yen and imposed quotas on the imports of japanese cars into the us in some ways the current us position in the trade negotiations is similar to those it had earlier with its western allies over the last 20 years the chinese and american economies have become strongly intertwined according to the gravity model of trade countries trade primarily with their near neighbors for example canada and mexico are traditionally major trading partners with the us it is unusual for two such distant nations as the us and china to be each other s leading trading partners part of the transition over the coming decade will be a partial separation of the two economies and a diversification of supply chains america will re emphasize trade within north america and china will increase trade with belt and road economies americans need to realize that china has to upgrade its productivity and its technology this is the only way it can escape the middle income trap over the next 10 years this upgrading is driven primarily by chinese firms competing in china s highly competitive markets senior leaders of tech companies tell me that the chinese tech market is much more competitive than silicon valley is many americans stress the roles of state owned enterprises and government r d or investment subsidies but these factors are small compared to the role of china s competitive entrepreneurial firms there are definitely some influential people in the current and past us administrations who write a lot about stopping the rise of china as a peer competitor in my view this is just silly the world is not the same as it was in 1990 the chinese economy already exceeds the size of the us economy on a purchasing power parity local price adjusted basis and will soon exceed it in terms measured gdp the two countries will always be partly rivals in business and international politics but they don t have to be hostile rivals on tuesday president trump described the trade dispute as a little squabble in the midst of a good relationship in terms of long term economics he is right but winston churchill said history is just one damn thing after another the only really important goal is to be sure that the relationship between china and the us does not become one of those things from a hard headed realist point of view the disputes between the us and china look small and short term compared to the real interests we share in common the author is an

the global financial markets are being held prisoner by rising trade tensions primarily between the united states and china while both countries feel but to differing degrees that they can weather a trade war each is focusing on who will dominate the global economy over the next generation and the key is technology herein lies the essence of the conflict the united states wants to alter the chinese path and the chinese want to control their own destiny no one can change the past where china insisted on ip transfer as a condition to enter their country but the truth is that is not nearly as prevalent today as before let s state some simple truths exports from china are less than 2 4 of u s gdp and less than 3 7 of china s gdp while global trade is less than 3 6 of global gdp don t worry about exports from the u s to china as it is too small to really matter so where s the fuss even the pessimists forecast that an all in trade war with china might reduce u s gdp by the most 0 6 over the course of a year once it begins while reducing china s gdp by 1 2 we think both numbers overstate what will actually occur as supply chains are redirected rapidly we also believe that the forecasted inflationary impact of higher tariffs is overstated too just look at what inflation has been running here since the 10 tariff went into effect last fall below the fed targets if trump implements 25 tariffs on the remaining 300 billion of chinese exports to the u s it most likely won t begin to impact our economy until sometime in the fall and we expect that companies have already begun buying as much as possible already anticipating additional tariffs down the road expect both our trade deficit and inventory accumulation to swell during this period s p earnings could be hit too but here again it is likely to be less than anticipated as only a portion of the higher tariffs is likely to be borne by the u s company itself the super strong dollar may be a bigger penalty to corporate earnings than tariffs listen to walmart s wmt and cisco s csco comments from their earnings call last week about the impact of higher tariffs on their businesses both managements are way ahead of the curve and don t expect higher tariffs to penalize their businesses much if at all of course if managements kept their heads in the sand and did not plan accordingly there definitely could be an earnings hit to their companies as we have said every week our first and most important decision regarding investments is the quality of management and their strategic planning to win regardless of the global competitive environment there will be clear winners and losers from tariffs here is when active money management should excel we made several changes to our portfolios well over a week ago after trump did a 180 on the prospects of an imminent trade deal after the chinese reneged on the so called agreement he immediately imposed higher tariffs on the initial 200 billion of imports and threatened tariffs on the remaining 300 billion by june trade ceasefire had ended and war had begun we acted quickly anticipating how the investors would react selling those companies most impacted by higher tariffs and lower world growth we raised cash to 17 of our portfolios giving us the fire power to buy when others panicked we subsequently added to our technology holdings and domestic companies with huge free cash flows not impacted by tariffs the average dividend yield on our portfolios exceeds the 10 year treasury bond we have continued to outperform the averages while we are definitely concerned about tariffs and the growing conflicts between our countries we are keenly aware that there is action afoot to shift supply chains away from china to other countries in the region with low cost labor and no threat of tariffs but it will take time raising tariffs is a one time penalty to prices inflation and growth and not all of it will fall in 2019 in addition we expect that the fed will most likely lower rates to offset any negative impact to our economy acknowledging that the higher prices from tariffs are a one time event likely to reverse in future quarters as supply chains are shifted and competition increased for example have you noticed that domestic steel prices which spiked after tariffs were enacted have fallen back beneath pre tariff price levels pretty amazing trump is playing the long ball dealing with unfair trade practices that have existed for decades and we are looking over the valley to the benefits to the u s economy from a more level playing field for global trade where ip is protected the key right now is the ability of our economy and also china s to withstand an escalation in the trade conflict and higher tariffs we continue to believe that the u s will be the winner with more to gain and far less to lose from an escalation in hostilities between our nations before we go on and discuss the latest data points it is so important that we acknowledge that trump put off for up to 180 days any auto tariffs against the eu and japan to avoid fighting on too many fronts at the same time and he also lifted steel and aluminum duties on mexico and canada so that the new nafta usmca could be move along in congress and be passed finally trump threw down the gauntlet against china s huawei restricting its ability to access u s technology smart move for many reasons now let s review the key data points that support our contention that the u s and chinese economies will continue to chug along while weakness will persist in the eurozone and japan we expect the consumer to be the driving force behind continued above average growth in the u s for the remainder of the year into 2020 who could argue against the over 2 million new jobs created over the last year over 7 million job opening remain the acceleration in both nominal and real wage gains lower inflation and much lower interest rates no wonder that consumer sentiment jumped to a 15 year high of 102 4 in may with the biggest gain in the expectations index while we were disappointed that retail sales especially autos and industrial output declined slightly in april weather was a big factor housing starts rose 5 7 and permits increased 0 6 the april small business optimism index increased to 103 5 in april stronger than anticipated we continue to believe that second quarter gnp will be around 2 penalized by a larger trade deficit and lower inventories we see an acceleration in the second half benefitting from fed actions since december and lower interest rates feeding through the economy we continue to expect trump to pull out all stops in 2020 such that growth will be better than 2019 could there be an infrastructure bill we need one and it s about time one passed congress we commented last week that china s growth slowed slightly from the first quarter rate as we moved through april industrial production rose 5 4 from a year ago while retail sales increased 7 2 both gains were less than recorded in march capital investments still increased a healthy 6 1 china raised tariffs on 60 billion of u s goods after the u s raised tariffs to 25 on 200 billion of chinese exports it will be interesting to see what china can do once if the u s raises tariffs on the additional 300 billion of chinese exports without shooting itself in the foot we are confident that china will introduce a host of measures to further stimulate growth if needed to maintain growth above 6 3 for the year china is at risk as corporations even based in china move production to other countries to avoid the tariffs while we are confident in the future of china we believe that change needs to take place which may be hard if not impossible for them to swallow we remain very cautious negative on the future prospects of the eurozone and japan without the u s and china clearing the air and making a trade deal we are far more confident that the u s and japan can reach a trade deal than the u s and the eurozone japan is likely to open up to u s agriculture products just like they did removing restrictions on u s beef while it will be very hard for the eurozone to do the same let s wrap this up we believe that we are entering a transition period that if and when a trade war between the u s and china ramps up with tariffs on every item shipped between our nations we are hopeful that president s trump and xi can bridge the gap between our negotiators and make a deal when they meet at the g 20 meeting in japan on june 28 29 until then we expect the rhetoric to be turned up creating added anxiety in the financial markets we expect trump to play the long ball insisting on a move level trade playing field as it helps him with his political base as he enters the 2020 presidential race it is interesting to note that many democrats support his efforts on trade and it appear that many more corporate leaders are leaning that way too after resisting any sort of trade conflict wanting to sustain the status quo instead it is our role to look over the valley factoring in all the near term risks too no one wants to see a trade war but no one believes that the status quo is acceptable longer term too clearly the u s and china are fighting over global economic dominance and neither wants to give in to the other technology is at the forefront of this battle and herein lies the major issue between our countries we believe that near term global growth will suffer as the supply lines are shifted from china elsewhere we are less concerned about any blip in inflation as it will reverse in rather short order on the other hand we expect all monetary bodies to open the faucets more and more providing the necessary fuel to keep the global economy expanding the u s and china are in the best relative position compared to the rest of the world we prefer investing in the u s as we believe that long term inflation will remain muted such that our stock market multiple is too low at even 18 times earnings the fed pundits have it wrong that low inflation is transitory we expect corporate earnings to be more resilient to trade conflicts than generally perceived as corporations are just better managed utilizing technology to reduce costs and boost profitability our portfolios continue to have a common thread we own companies

the speed at which the senate confirmed the re appointment of the central bank of nigeria governor mr godwin emefiele was a display of confidence in the activities of the banking regulatory authority reports obinna chima the senate last thursday passed a vote of confidence on the central bank of nigeria cbn governor mr godwin emefiele given the speed at which his re appointment was confirmed senate president bukola saraki who announced the cbn governor s confirmation congratulated emefiele on his re appointment and wished him a fruitful tenure adding that he use this opportunity to continue to provide support to ensure that the economy of our country continues to improve and address the important area of ensuring microeconomic stability president muhammadu buhari had on may 8 reappointed emefiele for an unprecedented second term and requested the senate s confirmation of the appointment the process that led to emefiele s confirmation commenced last wednesday with emefiele s screening by members of the senate committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions after emefiele s presentation to the committee members praised him for his performance in the last five years and indicated that he would be recommended for confirmation the committee chairman senator rafiu ibrahim said the committee was impressed by emefiele s performance as governor of the central bank senior special assistant to the president on national assembly affairs senator ita enang who presented the cbn governor for screening had commended the senate s speedy response to the request of the president to confirm emefiele enang had said this confirmation will be seen as one of the fastest requests to be considered by the senate the executive is grateful a member of the committee senator fatima raji rasaki in her contribution urged the cbn boss to ensure any time there are funds like the bailout fund the government is properly advised on how to disburse the fund for the benefit of nigerians senator hope uzodinma reminded his colleagues that the screening was for re appointment and not a fresh appointment he noted that in the wisdom of the president the cbn governor passed his examination hence his re appointment for a second term senator shehu sani noted that when things are good everybody will come around but when things are bad everybody will run away the kaduna central senator advised the cbn boss to consolidate the growth of cotton and textile industry especially in kaduna and katsina states reacting to certain attempts to smear the image of the cbn governor senator ibrahim the committee chairman noted that the good work the cbn governor was doing might have attracted distraction to him when you see a good thing some people want to distract it he said at least 17 senators attended the screening more work in his presentation before the senate committee emefiele said the central bank would be hard on the nation s economic saboteurs he added we will push very hard to ensure that those who seek to undermine the policies of nigeria without respecting the laws of this country will be brought to book under any circumstances the cbn governor who appreciated the avalanche of prayers offered for his success by the committee members acknowledged that the road ahead of him was very rough i thank you for praying for me because we need it and i say this because the road ahead is still rough and very tough he said he therefore called on the citizenry to cultivate the habit of respecting government policies and laws i want to appeal to all nigerians that a time comes in the history of a country where you have to learn to respect the policies and laws of a country part of the problem that we have seen in nigeria is lack of respect for the policies of this country nigeria is very good at putting in place policies that are sound and workable but implementation has always been almost zero and it is arising because we see people sabotaging government activities he said speaking on exchange rate emefiele said we do not have multiple exchange rates when you talk of multiple exchange rates you talk about divergence in exchange rate substantially today our rates have converged around n360 to 1 because the investors and exporters will know which is the dominant market for procurement of foreign exchange today it hovers around that rate but what you will find is multiple windows and we don t have any apologies for it he further justified multiple windows of exchange rate saying when you talk about multiple windows the central bank has a responsibility to provide foreign exchange to everybody what we saw that resulted in us creating multiple windows we want to make sure that those who seek to travel who will normally go to our banks to ask for foreign exchange and the banks will turn them away and these people will seek to go to black market to buy foreign exchange we said no we will allocate specific sums of money to banks to allocate to people who want to travel we will allocate specific sums of money to you to allocate to those who are into the small and medium enterprise business and we will allocate funds to you for you to give to those who are in your corporate sectors so you will find multiple windows because the rates at which foreign exchange is traded through all these windows are substantially the same so there are no multiple exchange rates but i will admit there are multiple windows and it is for a good reason he said nigeria s population was expected to peak at 425 million people by year 2050 going by the imf world bank economic outlook according to him the cbn from the monetary policy side has come to realise that using the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme where access to credit is being provided to the masses all over the country will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activity among the rural population we just came back from the imf world bank programme in april and in the world bank s imf s world economic outlook nigeria is positioned as a country whose population will grow and rise to over 425 million people by the year 2050 that will present nigeria as a country with the third largest population in the world after china and india and indeed surpassing the united states of america in population i worry and i do think that we all should worry that a lot of work needs to be done to make sure that we are able to put in place policies that will make life good for this 425 million people when we are the third largest population in the world so we from the central bank of nigeria from the monetary policy side have come to the realisation that using the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme where access to credit is being provided to our masses all over the country that it will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activity amongst our rural population he added continuing he said the results are there to see that as a result of our anchor borrowers programme where we have disbursed over n190 billion to over 1 1 million smallholder farmers cultivating over 1 3 million hectares of land that we need to do more of this as we do this we make finance available at low interest rate we make access to credit easy for our people and in doing this we will be able to create jobs for them and improve the livelihood of our people that is a sole thing that we make and i am very optimistic that this can be achieved furthermore emefiele assured that the monetary policy authority would do everything possible to ensure that they move the country forward aside from the anchor borrowers programme we are also looking at special programmes targeted at wholesale growth of agricultural sector in nigeria aside from rice and other small good crop markets we have started looking at palm oil because we believe that this country has a lot of potentials in palm oil if you think about what this country was in the 50s and 60s nigeria being a country at that time that controlled 40 per cent market share in palm oil industry exporting its palm oil to different parts of the world but because we found crude oil we receded and abandoned it for some of you who are very good in doing calculations go and check today the price of a barrel of palm oil is more than the price of a barrel of crude oil so what happened to our country there are countries when they have the opportunities in agriculture and also have opportunities in the crude sector they didn t let their guards down he added the cbn governor however gave the assurance that the palm oil market would be grown back again after which cocoa in the south west area would be the next area of focus speaking on how the cbn supported the economy when it slipped into recession emefiele said when i resumed work in june 2014 i unveiled a five year vision for the bank and for the country achieving microeconomic stability was my main focus expectations however just as some chief executive officers ceos of financial institutions have hailed the confirmation of emefiele for the second five year term they urged the cbn governor to work towards having much stronger banks in the country the chief executives spoke in separate interviews with thisday the managing director ceo polaris bank limited mr tokunbo abiru described the confirmation of the cbn governor for another term of five years as a positive development for our economy the economic outlook remains positive as this adds fillip to the continuity of current macro economic policies initiated by the cbn governor the positive interventions in the agriculture real sector and foreign exchange stability gives confidence that the economy will continue to grow the bank chief executive added the ceo cowry assets management limited mr johnson chukwu advised emefiele to ensure that the central bank is more decisive in resolving banking crisis to avoid any form of contagion effect in terms of banking supervision and regulation i want to see a situation whereby the central bank is more decisive in resolving banking crisis such that when it becomes imperative that a particular weak institution should be allowed to exit the market i believe the cbn should be decisive but in all we expect to see stronger regulation chukwu explained he added he emefiele has said he was going to focus on stimulating the economy particularly the small and medium scale enterprises smes he should work towards harmonising the exchange rate and push for faster economic growth through monetary stimulus i also expect him to continue to work towards lowering interest rate also the managing director investment banking at united capital plc mr babatunde obaniyi also called for stronger banks i think he emefiele needs to make our banks stronger what we need are stronger banks that can drive the developmental process in the country we expect the cbn to guide the banks to cut down on the bad loans and also make them lend to the real sector banks should do less of trading in treasury bills and focus on supporting critical sectors of the economy obaniyi added according to him with the confirmation of emefiele there would be stability in terms of policy drive and also investors would be able to make projection on basic parameters such as exchange rate and the direction of interest rate but i think the focus for the cbn governor should be how to have an inclusive growth for the economy having paddled us out of recession and the economy is now growing at a modest rate i think we can do better so the strategic thrust should be how to oil the real sector of the economy he said on his part the managing director of kairos capital mr sam chidoka said the confirmation by the senate had removed all the uncertainties in the market and shows continuity one thing the market doesn t like is uncertainty now the market knows who is continuing and we have seen his policies in the last five years and we don t expect major changes going forward so the confirmation is good for the government because we didn t see any issue that could trigger a sell off or exit from the economy all in all we think it is a good deal chidoka added
the european union is widely known as the paragon of free trade but in recent years it has increasingly adopted a curious double standard while adopting free trade within the bloc the eu has been increasingly lobbied by big businesses to protect domestic industries while targeting competitive foreign industries from developing countries one of the most egregious cases where this appears to be happening is in relation to palm oil for biofuels recently classified by the european commission as unsustainable which means it cannot be counted toward eu renewable energy targets in the wake of the announcement two of the world s biggest palm oil producers indonesia and malaysia both multi billion dollar trading partners with the eu condemned the policy and threatened trade retaliation the eu rightly says that palm oil is destroying forests in turn worsening climate change and driving important species like the orangutan to near extinction this is undeniable the question is what to do about it to have the right impact unfortunately the eu has not done enough to rein in its own direct role in such processes for instance the european commission has long known that the biggest driver of deforestation is not palm oil from asia but beef and soy production from latin america from 1998 to 2008 soybean from latin america was responsible for 82 percent of deforestation compared to palm oil imports from malaysia and indonesia accounting for 17 percent of deforestation according to the european commission s own report it is also far from clear that the primary driver of deforestation in those countries is palm oil for instance in indonesia only 11 percent of deforestation could be attributed to palm oil plantations compared to 27 4 percent due to tree plantations for pulp forestry concessions and mining concessions the main problem though is that it is not clear that the eu s palm oil policy can save the climate last year the international union for the conservation of nature issued a landmark report warning that because palm oil uses less land to produce greater oil than soy rapeseed or sunflower the ban will lead to greater land use driving higher rates of deforestation in latin america meanwhile some 42 percent of palm oil in indonesia is grown by smallholder farmers millions of whom will be decimated by the impact of eu policy greenwashing the eu s singling out of palm oil can be traced back to an effort by certain eu lobbies veteran environmentalist sir jonathan porritt former chair of the uk government s sustainable development commission says that the eu s palm oil boycott is a result of the influence of two very powerful lobbies namely trade associations seeking to protect eu based producers of rapeseed oil and sunflower oil regardless of their involvement in massive deforestation and some environmental ngos funded by the eu who have ended up supporting this protectionist agenda in march friends of the earth europe foee issued a report demanding an eu palm oil ban the report was funded by the european commission s life programme this is a longstanding relationship that goes back years in 2017 foee received just under 2 million euros from various agencies of the european commission this raises the question of a conflict of interest how can an ngo provide independent advice to the very body that provides it with critical funding many ngos demanding a full on palm oil boycott have similar financial ties to the eu the european federation for transport and the environment efte which organised a mass petition signed by nearly a million europeans to promote the palm oil ban received over half a million euros from the european commission in 2017 although packaged as a pro environment campaign by efte s own analysis the eu s own biofuels industry which is the chief beneficiary of the campaign is still generating polluting than diesel from fossil fuels rapeseed being 1 2 times worse and soy being twice as bad the protectionist trend the eu s blinkered policy on palm oil is only one high profile case in a much longer trend of protectionism which ultimately hurts consumers by reducing choice and inflating prices there has been a long history of protectionism against southeast asian countries to protect specific producers in eu member states such as the european commission safeguard clause used to protect italian rice from cambodian exporters more recently countries like germany are taking hardline measures against free trade in response to more aggressive competition from the trump administration and china in such cases the eu has moved to favour its own industries at the expense of those of poorer developing countries in 2017 the eu ended its long standing policy on sugar quotas after a negative world trade organisation ruling found that import rules gave unfair advantages to local producers the policy inflated sugar prices by reducing competition with eu free trade partners all over the world but the eu hasn t really ended its protectionist approach we still put large tariffs on non eu member sugar producers this prevents imports from the most competitive sugar producing countries such as brazil and thailand despite them being developing countries the fisheries case the eu s quiet pursuit of protectionism has continued in many other sectors in february for instance the european parliament voted to uphold the sustainable fisheries partnership agreement here once again the idea of sustainability has been used to rubber stamp an agreement that may not be sustainable at all but which benefits the eu s own fishing industry at the expense of that of western saharans under the 4 year deal the eu fishing industry has been granted opportunities in western sahara in exchange for the moroccan government receiving an overall payment of 208 million euros while eu officials have described the agreement as beneficial to both sides a number of meps have raised concerns especially around the legality of morocco s status over western sahara and international law has no authority to grant the eu access there in 2013 greenpeace found that the eu s fishing practices in the sahara are devastating west african fish stocks and undermining the rights of local people all these cases prove that the protectionism is not the answer the danger of the eu s accelerating protectionist tendency is that it feeds into a nationalist mindset that undermines the real foundations of prosperity open markets and free trade to underpin fair competition that gives consumers fair prices and access to better products all too often buzzwords like sustainability are being used to camouflage short sighted trade policies by denying developing nations the chance to lift their populations out of poverty the eu is not just damaging them in true colonial fashion but hurting european consumers who are forced to rely on domestic monopolies even when those monopolies are inefficient costly and far from sustainable
this article is part of jacobin s green new deal series the rest of the pieces in the se ries can be read here in 2013 when brandon king and others launched cooperation jackson a radical project to bring economic democracy and worker ownership to jackson mississippi they decided to put their funds toward purchasing land instead of paying themselves salaries we were renting just to have a space for meeting that s completely not sustainable said king who spearheads the group s sustainable urban farm cooperative added his colleague sacajawea hall we needed to acquire and also be thinking about land ownership in a collective way i don t think it was ever a question for cooperation jackson the question of land who owns it manages it and accesses it is at the heart of the climate crisis and a major source of wealth and inequality it is also essential for ensuring that our sustainable low carbon future the future envisioned by the green new deal gnd is a just one agriculture contributes 9 percent of us carbon emissions and by one estimate a third of global greenhouse gas emissions largely from livestock refrigeration and chemical fertilizers and pesticides these emissions are a product of the model of industrial monoculture farming which maximizes profits by growing a single crop like soy or corn over vast swaths of land the green new deal is calling for the elimination of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector by investing in sustainable farming and building a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food what we re trying to do is release the investments from the federal government to mobilize those resources across the country new york representative alexandria ocasio cortez explained in february responding to right wing scare mongering about a government takeover in green new deal clothes it could be tennessee valley authority style public programs but it could also be public private partnerships it can work down on a municipal level there could be some potential contracting involved but aoc s statements raise the fraught issues of racism and capitalism at the heart of gnd politics in other words contracts and partnerships with whom in the popular imagination the quintessential us farmer tends to be the hardworking corn fed white family farmer toiling in the fields from sunrise to sundown the reality is much different us farms have rapidly decreased in number and grown in size meaning they are consolidated in fewer hands today many family farms are factory farms only run by private individuals instead of a corporate board of directors while some aging farmers are selling off their farms to neighbors or larger agribusiness firms as urban development encroaches on rural land making it particularly difficult for younger farmers to purchase land the distribution of land in the us is also shaped by legacies of racial hierarchy and violence ninety eight percent of private rural land and 96 percent of private agricultural lands are white owned less than 1 percent of farms are black owned it wasn t always this way in 1910 that number was 14 percent the rapid decline was partially a product of the great migration and mechanization themselves outgrowths of a racist political economy but black farmers were also pushed off their land through discriminatory lending practices and inadequate legal political and financial resources to stave off real estate developers and today in the fields 80 percent of farm workers who pick the fruits and vegetables that appear neatly packaged in our grocery stores identify as hispanic or latino then there s the often overlooked fact that these farmlands were once stolen from indigenous people by the federal government which established us sovereignty in the west by offering free newly privatized land to white settlers through the 1862 homestead act the act cleared the path for corporations to extract resources from the land fur oil minerals lumber and much more and as indigenous water protectors have highlighted the process continues to this day with the army corps and other government agencies offering construction permits to pipeline corporations on indigenous land ultimately the issue of agriculture shares a common basis with battles over fossil fuel pipelines as indigenous historian and activist nick estes puts it in his book our history is the future there is one essential reason why indigenous peoples resist refuse and contest us rule land full disclosure i was the editor of estes s book throughout its history the federal government has allowed private corporations to expropriate public goods such as air and water while shifting the costs and impacts of pollution damaged ecosystems and climate change onto communities that will depend on the land long after the corporations have gone and public lands stolen from indigenous people and entrusted to the government for the benefit of the public have been no exception a 2016 federal study found that a quarter of us carbon emissions were produced by fossil fuel extraction on public lands a trend that has only accelerated under donald trump history thus offers few reasons to believe that government contracts and public private partnerships won t simply perpetuate the inequalities and injustices of our current food system consolidating wealth and economic power among those with deep pockets and washington connections still there is some cause for hope sustainable farmers scattered throughout both urban and rural areas of the us are already deploying permaculture methods of farming that in some cases can even help sequester carbon from the atmosphere on her soul fire farms in albany new york leah penniman cultivates some of her crops on rocky slopes that namibian mounding and kenyan terracing farming techniques have made productive but which industrial agribusiness would have considered unusable some 1 500 miles away in minnesota the indigenous environmental activist winona laduke initiated a project in 1989 to recover reservation lands lost settlers revive old traditions of land stewardship and produce wild rice and other ojibwe foods further west in washington state migrant mexican farmers who organized the familias unidas por la justicia farmworkers union have launched a new farm cooperative cooperativa tierra y libertad to grow organic berries and offer a more secure future for its worker owners there are others too run by brown black and indigenous farmers drawn to sustainable food growing methods both as a cultural inheritance organic farming is a method developed across millennia but first revived in the us by a black farmer dr george washington carver in the early 1900s and as a way to provide cheap healthy food for their communities could these be to borrow aoc s words the resources that the federal government needs to mobilize with investment some elements of such a green new deal might already be found in limited seedling form within existing legislation and government programs the federal farm bill s 2501 program includes special funding through land trusts community colleges tribal governments and nonprofit organizations to help farmers of color acquire own operate and retain farms penniman suggests that farmers be paid via the environmental quality incentives program and conservation reserve program for using methods that conserve the environment and sequester carbon and on the flip side industrial agriculture should be taxed for outsourcing the long term effects of its pollution and ecological destruction onto the public yet these measures leave intact the economic and political structures that favor corporations and the wealthy over sustainable farmers and will continue to be limited by one essential factor land last spring penniman helped convene a gathering of the northeast farmers of color network an informal alliance of about 150 black latinx and asian organic farmers the animating question what are the biggest obstacles for being able to feed and sustain our communities and maintain the businesses that support our families one answer emerged repeatedly access to land long term planning and construction projects are difficult for farmers who rent and this includes investing time and money into implementing and in many cases learning sustainable farming methods as long as people depend on water air food from the earth and natural environmental processes to survive these resources and the land that holds them should not be controlled by a small number of billionaires a just equitable green new deal would acknowledge that land is a major source of wealth and inequality and work towards what activists call land justice the access to land that farmers need to build healthy equitable food systems that provide jobs and keep the food dollar in the community as eric holt giménez the executive director of think tank food first writes it might do this by creating as penniman and the northeast farmers of color have advocated in the past a commission to study reparations and propose a comprehensive redistribution of wealth and land federal programs to buy back land are while limited not entirely without precedent the land buy back program for tribal nations allocated 2 billion in 2009 to repurchase indigenous lands that had been fractionated into small individually owned parcels and returned to reservations and communal tribal ownership under the cobell v salazar settlement and in an interview the historian roxanne dunbar ortiz noted that despite its manifold problems and shortcomings the 1934 indian reorganization act part of the original new deal did include funding to buy back similar lands and restore them to tribes these steps would not reverse the historical processes that deprived black brown and indigenous communities of resources power and dignity for generations the same ongoing processes that drive corporate resource extraction and created the climate crisis but they would be steps toward rectifying historical wrongs and climate chaos spreading heat waves deep freezes droughts floods and fires throughout the continent will only further threaten land access for people long divested of it usaid has stated that land tenure will be instrumental in managing the increased population in migrant receiving communities in other words climate migration even the world bank acknowledges that secure land rights are essential to reduc disaster risk and build climate resilience land rights allow communities to grow their own food build their own housing install their own solar panels and create public places where local markets and social networks can be cultivated resources that when disaster strikes can make the difference between perishing and bouncing back yet at the northeast farmers of color gathering the questions did not stop at the issue of land access when we have access to land what are ways to hold land in common there ve been communities all over the world who before they were impacted by capitalism and globalization were operating in a similar fashion said brandon king of cooperation jackson laying out their vision for an eco village on a block of land they ve acquired near downtown jackson the imagined eco village would be a mixture of new and renovated homes all manufactured by the industrial 3d printing fab lab machines they ve acquired permaculture design and a farm and solar panels for the community the eco village is a way that we can show a different way of life and relating to the land and to each other he said it s those models that we want to affirm
last year russians across the country protested against legislation that raised the retirement age from 55 to 60 for women and 60 to 65 for men but president vladimir putin still signed the bill into law in october in response to these pension changes the president went from winning 77 percent of the vote in the march 2018 presidential election to having a 64 percent approval rating now for many in the united states who only notice russia when the old cold war adversary meddles in elections or asserts itself in places like ukraine or syria this commotion over domestic policy came as a surprise fortunately for those who don t follow these issues regularly chris miller an assistant professor of international history at tufts university provides a superb review of russia s economic policies in putinomics power and money in resurgent russia this book helps readers understand why putin addressed pension policies and why citizens protested and it also offers a slightly different perspective from writers who emphasize russian kleptocracy while affirming corruption is problematic miller strives to demonstrate how the country is much more complex as competent technocrats and corrupt oligarchs compete for influence those technocrats according to putinomics prevented the country from collapsing economically and allowed moscow to exert influence globally putin s russia still has numerous challenges today but miller argues the federation should be compared to fellow petrostate venezuela since both were similar in the late 1990s venezuela even had a better credit rating and a higher per capita income when putin came to power by this standard putinomics has been unexpectedly successful in order to understand russia s economic policies and what may happen next miller describes putinomics three pronged strategy that the kremlin hopes will help the government maintain power expand influence abroad and develop the economy strengthen central authority ensuring the kremlin has the power and the money to enforce its writ prevent popular discontent by guaranteeing low unemployment and adequate pensions rely on private business to improve efficiency but only where it does not contradict the previous two strategies after the traumatic 1990s russian leaders and most of the public determined that these priorities made sense in order to maintain stability putinomics concludes that this strategy has ultimately worked even if the country still struggles with corruption and low economic growth indeed if putin hadn t achieved some economic success then it s unlikely either he or his cronies would still retain power today whereas the socialist venezuelan government spent extravagantly during its oil boom putin maintained power through conservative fiscal and monetary policies while avoiding the deficits and inflation that devastated russia before miller explains how instead of directing most new revenue from higher oil prices and increased tax collection to state employee salaries or corruption the kremlin followed technocrats guidance and paid off foreign debt which lessened russia s reliance on other countries moscow also created a stabilization fund which ensured the government had cash whenever oil and gas prices dropped which happened during the great recession and america s shale gas and oil boom such conservative fiscal policies were not universally popular as various politicians demanded higher spending to address russia s problems in healthcare education and investment but the people who would benefit from these programs weren t part of putin s political coalition whereas pensioners were while saving as much as possible the putin regime did use well paid pensions to avoid popular discontent even when investments in healthcare and education would boost long term economic growth better around 93 percent of russian retirees live off their pensions and their costs strain the budget putin has used them as a political tool to remain in power such as after urban voters in places like moscow and st petersburg protested against vote rigging in the 2011 duma elections instead of addressing those protestors concerns putin appealed to his base when he boosted spending on rural industrial workers government employees and pensioners while the strategy worked since he won the 2012 presidential election the increased spending created other enduring fiscal headaches readers should therefore understand last year s pension changes which occurred after putinomics publication as part of the president s ongoing agenda to maintain russia s fiscal stability and prevent devastating crises reminiscent of the 1990s clearly such stability is critical for putin since he spent significant political capital on this legislation miller convincingly argues that putin s economic policies successfully addressed concerns businesses had in the late 1990s yet today other issues like corruption rule of law business regulation education and healthcare are more important and russians have higher expectations than just mere stability so long as putin relies upon his current political coalition miller doubts russia will enact reforms that lead to higher economic growth overall putinomics is an essential book for anyone interested in russia and foreign policy as russia has shown its willingness and ability to thwart american interests in places like ukraine syria and venezuela policymakers should understand why neither the country nor putin s regime has collapsed despite multiple crises from recessions to sanctions in this book miller provides a detailed and convincing account that non specialists can understand and that should enrich western understanding of the country mark

master s degree in international relations at the university of st andrews
by bola a akinterinwa the belt and road initiative bri is the newest global development strategy in international economic relations offered in 2013 by the people s republic of china under the leadership of xi jinping to the world it is the issue of discourse among the great leaders of the world at the moment true it is a development strategy whose time has come and by which several countries are beginning to define their infrastructural and investment needs in this regard not less than 37 thirty seven african countries have acceded to the bri agreement including nigeria the decision of african leaders to be part of the bri agenda was reached at the 2018 beijing summit of the forum on china africa cooperation focac which was established in 2006 but is also serving as one of the implementation mechanisms for the purposes of the bri one main rationale for the decision to be part of the bri is essentially because of the african union s own agenda 2063 it is useful at this juncture to note that the bri is a 36 year global development agenda covering the period from 2013 to 2049 in other words whatever is to be done in terms of provision of infrastructure direct investments and development assistance to any country are to be completed in 2049 by which time the chinese will be celebrating one century of the people s republic of china as well as possible ascendancy to global leadership in the same vein by the year 2063 the african union will also be celebrating one hundred years of the founding of the organisation of african unity created on may 25 1963 but disbanded on july 9 2002 under the last chairman thabo mbeki of south africa and transformed into the african union a large part of the continental development projects contained in agenda 2063 underscore the provision for infrastructure energy and industrialisation deficit trade development it is therefore not surprising that several african leaders took active part in the deliberations of the second belt and road forum a special implementation platform for the bri which took place last 25 27 april 2019 in beijing without any whiff of doubt there is no reason why african leaders should not be actively engaged in the bri for one obvious consideration as noted in chinafrica newsletter vol 4 no 6 may 2019 in respect of overland construction chinese companies through concessional financial support have built addis ababa djibouti railway in ethiopia which is the first electrified railway in africa mombasa nairobi railway in kenya abuja kaduna railway in nigeria and benguela railway in angola and many others including the lagos ibadan kano abuja under construction apart from this the chinese have at the maritime component level constructed the port of bagamoyo in tanzania no 19 berth of port mombasa and the berth of port lamu both in kenya new port of pointe noire in the republic of congo brazaville lekki deep seaport in nigeria kribi deep seaport in cameroon and port of tamatave in madagascar ambassador aminu wali former extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of nigeria to china and former minister of foreign affairs of nigeria has also reminded us that as at the end of 2016 china under the initiative has set up 20 industrial parks in 15 african countries including nigeria with accumulated investments of 5 38 billion us dollars attracting more than 450 enterprises with an accumulated value output of 19 35 billion us dollars that has contributed 1 62 billion us dollars to the revenues of the host countries in taxes and fees these activities have created over 33 000 jobs and brought about industrial clustering in pertinent areas vide his paper at the roundtable thus the bri is essentially about international cooperation in the areas of infrastructure connectivity industrial cooperation and financial integration perhaps more interestingly it has been argued that the bri has not only become a core subject of international relations and studies but also that the central paradigm of cooperation consultation and consensus building of the bri cannot but struggle with the traditional theoretical approach of international studies that focus on conflict management and power politics of the so called realist school it is against this background that one should begin to explain and understand the need for holding an abuja beijing consensus roundtable on thursday may 16 2019 at the executive hall of the international conference centre abuja the roundtable which is the first of its kind was convened by sam nda isaiah founder of the leadership group and chairman of the abuja beijing consensus and co hosted by dr zhou pingjian the extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of the people s republic of china to nigeria the abuja beijing consensus abc is a newly created think tank created to harness the opportunities provided by the nigeria china relationship abc is a private initiative and a bridge builder between the federal republic of nigeria and the people s republic of china among the main functions of the abc are the provision for interested persons within formation about arbitration expertise of the contracts regarding projects between local economic agents and agents from abroad upon their request as well as organisation of training and seminars and master classes for entrepreneurs the roundtable was divided into two main session during which nine papers were presented in the first session five discussion papers were presented in addition to the goodwill messages given by the host and co host sam nda isaiah and dr pingjian four papers were presented in the second session one observation that was made crystal clear in all the papers was the need for active nigerian engagement in the bri for instance ambassador aminu wali has it that nigeria as one of africa s largest emerging markets with a huge potential for further economic expansion should be at the forefront for africa s greater engagement with the belt and road initiative framework to fast track its national development and ensure its place as the continent s foremost economy and investment destination sam nda isaiah put the need for nigeria to be involved in the bri this way the global economic order now points towards three fronts and nations would have to decide which direction to take there is the american frontier led by the united states the european frontier headed by the european union and the china frontier headed of course by china in this regard what is the choice for nigeria the leadership group leader says china is building an intimidating portfolio of friendships around the world based on win win cooperation in infrastructure agriculture health care etc the chinese model of engagement with others appears attractive especially to the developing countries because it does not interfere with the internal affairs of other countries consequently the abc intends to be the engine and catalyst of these win win engagements between nigeria and china taking into consideration that china is by far the largest investor in infrastructure in the world today honourable yusuf buba yakub chairman house committee on nigeria china relations house of representatives spoke more interestingly on why nigeria should take the bri seriously in his words prior to the mou signed in beijing by both countries in september 2018 nigeria had benefited considerably under the 60 billion usd focac fund bri has opened up new spaces for global economic growth produced new platforms for international trade and investment and offered new ways for improving global economic governance additionally honourable yusuf said that contrary to the aspersions of critics bri is solely an effort to promote economic globalisation and improve global governance system while focusing on project execution and moving forward with results oriented implementation is anchored on people oriented policies and seeks to address inequality crisis in developing countries consequently he said as nigeria joins the belt and road forum of nations the prospect of addressing the lingering challenges of poverty and unemployment is about to receive a major boost this is why a think tank like the abc should be encouraged and this is also why our duties as policy makers are to ensure that effective laws are in place to consolidate on the existing relationship of both nations he said mr li jianhui the president of the china general chamber of commerce in nigeria managing director of the cgc nigeria limited and the vice president of the china civil engineering construction corporation nigeria limited ccecc group noted the support received from the embassy of china and the government of nigeria since the establishment in july 2011 of the china general chamber of commerce in nigeria which now has 163 members covering oil and gas infrastructure communication manufacture trade agriculture mining finance and internet segun adeniyi former presidential adviser on media and chairman editorial board of thisday newspapers drew attention to the admonition of mr tony ejinkeonye the business development director africa esilknet network who is on record to have said that in his discussions with the chinese the emphasis has always been on doing business on a win win basis but like every business or nation you don t get what you deserve but rather what you negotiate there is no free lunch anywhere western nations ate our breakfast eastern nations are now eating our lunch nigeria and africa need to ensure that they don t also eat our dinner adeniyi noted that he had reacted to the statement and he believed that there is the need to learn lessons from the chinese experience at least for the purposes of the abc agenda first he noted on the basis of the june 2017 report by the global consulting firm mckinsey on china s financial flows to africa that there is considerable upside for the continent if chinese investment and business activity accelerate this necessarily means that africa will need to dramatically improve their productivity and efficiency to compete or partner effectively with new chinese companies on their turf secondly even though the mckinsey report drew attention to africa s young population as an advantage especially with some estimates showing that 60 of africa s total population is between the ages of 15 and 25 that should be a plus adeniyi observed that the factor of young population cannot be seen as an advantage simply because more than 50 percent of these young people are illiterate and many of them have little or no skills in fact adeniyi has it further that even though those who have some education often exhibit skills irrelevant to the current demand in the labour market there is the need to tackle this critical challenge thirdly and perhaps more importantly he drew attention to the false impression we create for ourselves in terms of riches he said nigeria is by all accounts a poor nation additionally nigeria s growing population is not backed by investment in education and health there is also the factor of national pride that comes with achieving something great in essence adeniyi strongly believes that there is nothing we cannot achieve if we are ready to work together as a team in pursuit of a common goal that is the value china now brings to the world with the bri for mr li with the joint efforts of the two governments enterprises and people there is a bright future for china nigeria cooperation and the revitalisation of nigeria will certainly be realised we are all going higher to a next level and we will make nigeria great again the nigerian eagle is starting to soar may the friendship between china and nigeria last forever many other speakers spoke along better days are still coming for the bri and nigeria china entente for instance while professor e a ahaneku the vice chancellor of nnamdi azikiwe university looked at the role of the chinese in national development from the perspectives of the confucius centre at his university muhammad sulaiman the president of china alumni association of nigeria recounted the sweet inspirations he had as a student in china kelvin yang the deputy managing director of huawei technologies co nigeria limited also told the roundtable about the activities and development impact of his organisation in nigeria and without any gainsaying charles onunaiju the director of the centre for chinese studies who also served as the moderator of the roundtable made it clear that anyone accusing the chinese of stealing technology cannot be a very serious person because technology cannot be stolen it is a common patrimony bola akinterinwa who also was one of the speakers added that even if we admit of the hypothesis of intellectual theft the academic community will still need to explain how a thief has succeeded in becoming the leader he argued that the chinese have simply become great development thinkers great development strategists and quiet pace setters that there are international controversies which are normal it can also be a matter of envy by others it is expected he gave the factors of commitment and discipline as the main dynamics of the chinese success story he recalled the anecdote of former president of liberia sirleaf johnson on how the united states refused to assist liberia in refurbishing one of the buildings in the university of liberia and how the chinese offered to build a completely new building or replica of it in order to suggest that the bri is a direct resultant of self discipline and commitment in terms of foreign policy attitudinal disposition of the chinese and most significantly dr zhou pingjian appeared to have given a good summary of the extent of the importance and unavoidability of the bri in global economic relations the chinese ambassador used the high level of attendance the factor of growing number of world leaders to explain the importance of the bri for instance the 2019 april 25 27 brf meeting with the theme belt and road cooperation shaping a brighter shared future attracted 38 heads of state or government the united nations secretary general as well as the imf managing director in the words of dr zhou over 6000 foreign guests from 150 countries and 92 international organisations participated in the forum it was very fruitful 283 deliverables were achieved business representatives signed project cooperation agreements worth more than usd 64 billion explaining further the success of the second brf the ambassador underscored the factor of quality as he put it high quality was the key word the participants reaffirmed the commitment to promoting high quality development of the belt and road cooperation the bri must be open green and clean follow a high standard people centred and sustainable approach and build synergy among policies rules and standards in recognition of these needs a number of initiatives during the forum such as the debt sustainability framework for the bri participating countries the beijing initiative for the clean silk road the green investment principles for the bri development and the cooperation initiative on silk road of innovation were launched the ambassador said if the second brf could witness the signing of over 100 bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements then there is no need overemphasising the significance of the bri as well as its increasing global acceptability within this global acceptability how can nigeria s national interest be better fostered how should the abc as a think tank go about it some truths and the way forward one bitter truth that is consciously ignored is that nigeria s foreign policy under president muhammadu buhari is never conducted and managed on the basis of strategic calculation not to talk about the protection of the national interest muhammadu buhari as a military head of state was quite better in foreign policy than muhammadu buhari as an elected president without any shadow of doubt nigeria cannot be said to have any well defined foreign policy as at today consequently it cannot but be difficult to envisage where to place the eventual workings of the abc which intends to impact on the policy processes and ensure that nigeria is able to gain from the dividends of membership of the bri project related to this problem is the near bastardisation of the whole ministry of foreign affairs itself people with little or no knowledge of diplomacy are deployed or cross posted from other ministries to the foreign ministry ignoring the simple fact that diplomacy is a special elitist profession business ethics is quite different from diplomatic culture a foreign ministry in any given country of the world is necessarily the central coordinating ministry for all others it therefore imbibes all the cultures of other ministries but imbibing the cultures of others is not a one day training nor is it acquired on the basis of on the job training true on daily basis every second every minute there are happenings in the world requiring the attention of specialists and experts who do know their onions consequently deploying civil or public servants without the prerequisite background in official diplomacy is not and cannot be helpful to fast tracking the bri as a catalyst within the context of nigeria china strategic partnership as well as in obtaining the dividends of the bri the abc will therefore need to quickly evolve an operational methodology or analytical framework for dealing with the challenges in particularly responding to the challenges of the bri in nigeria dr tunde emmanuel a resident fellow at the bolytag centre for international diplomacy and strategic studies bocidass lagos and secretary to the nigeria china friendship association nicaf has it that nigeria has done very little to take ownership of the infrastructural projects and investment of china in nigeria and this is not likely to encourage a win win outcome taking ownership of the bri projects necessarily entails nigeria s increased and adequate contribution to the process of investment a scenario where chinese companies provide all of the expertise and the exim bank of china provides all of the credits and nigeria is unable to provide anything cannot make the future of the bri bright in nigeria this is one challenge that the abc in serving as a catalyst should look into in addition to how to acquire technology as argued further in this regard by dr emmanuel nigeria must learn lessons from the bri the implementation of bri is primarily driven by technology china s strategic calculation is the use of technology as the primary instrument of foreign policy pursuit this is in contrast with the traditional idea that underscores military capability as the primary instrument of foreign policy the bri implementation is a refutation of this notion therefore nigeria needs to develop an indigenous technological capability to take advantage of the technological deliverables of the bri nigeria needs technological capability to effectively receive the deliverables maintain them and improve on them for sustainable economic growth
russia tries to tighten its grip while simultaneously decreasing the resulting budget burden on the other hand belarus is not willing to sacrifice its sovereignty but is acutely aware of its economic dependence on russia to the informed observers the dynamics of belarus relationship with russia are different to the uninformed it is an independent country an outright invasion or annexation is unlikely in the short term but kremlin is mobilising mechanisms for tighter political integration so is belarus the next crimea the short answer is no in april 2017 gri published an article exploring the domestic dynamics pertaining to belarus sovereignty this article re examines the topic with a focus on belarus relationship vis à vis russia these developments will shed a light on russian strategy in its near abroad and consequent prospects for post soviet markets as well as on the eu s and nato s backyard tolerance intensifying propaganda for the majority of belarusians russian is the first language of informational and entertainment sources education and of everyday life this exposes belorusians to pro russian narratives to counter this the security council recently adopted measures to increase information sovereignty russian state sponsored think tanks many with significant influence over foreign policy tend to agree that belarus needs to be protected by russia from western influence a geopolitical outlook by mgimo published in september 2018 suggests that lukashenko was fostering belarusian ethnic nationalism as a result russia should be ready to respond with crimea like measures generating a due amount of outrage the publication was shortly pulled from the institute s website kremlin spokesman peskov denies any intentions to extend control over belarus however state sponsored media research and policy outlets present narratives to the contrary economic and resource dependence russia provides more than half of belarus 20b foreign investment inflows it is the source of more than half of belarusian imports and the destination for nearly half of its exports moreover belarus buys 60 70 of its commodities for oil refining and manufacture from russia as a result even exports directed elsewhere are dependent on the partnership looking back at the past decade no bilateral agreement between belarus and russia seems to be safe from renegotiation adding to the instability of the relationship belarus has also suffered from inflation and financial crisis due to its interdependence with the russian economy the country holds periodic negotiations with the imf but there are no concrete plans for structural reforms required for access to cheap loans further cooperation with european financing bodies would be conditioned by the rule of law moreover the introduction of a customs union within the eurasian economic union continues to face challenges consequently belarus will depend more on bilateral talks with russia for the near future the history belarusian national identity is a complex issue it does not see itself as european in the sense that the three baltic states do and it rejects becoming dependent on atlantic solidarity it falls into the realm of what many russians see as russkiy mir i e russian world as a cultural linguistic and religious brotherhood the levada center survey found that 67 russians view belarus as a domestic affair this is somewhat understandable as that was the reality under the soviet union which many russians still remember vividly in october 2018 president vladimir putin promised his congress continued focus on the compatriots doctrine the claim that russia has legitimate duty to protect the russkiy mir it serves as a legitimising tool to gain domestic support for interventionism in the former soviet republics and just like crimea belarus is an obvious candidate these are some of the similarities which position belarus as the potential next target of any russian expansionist foreign policy however there are also significant differences between belarus and crimea which must be highlighted looking west alexander lukashenko belarus president knows what is at stake the occupation of crimea and the destabilisation of ukraine shine a clarifying light on every policy of cooperation or coercion coming from moscow he recognises belarus dependency on russia but also sets a red line any loss of sovereignty in a documentary about the crimean annexation putin affirms that it was a response to euromaidan ukrainian domestic politics was hostile to russian influence and flirting too courageously with the eu and nato minsk has not really expressed interests in joining the west despite recent calls for increased dialogue simultaneously the domestic atmosphere is not actively anti russian either the society is divided and its own nationalism is a complex issue however many identify with russia linguistically and culturally while the number of westernisers is estimated at about 25 30 furthermore the belarusian orthodox church has denounced the self proclaimed ukrainian autocephaly and minsk has remained neutral on the question of crimea the strategic value crimea has strategic significance because of the kerch strait i e access to the sea of azov and because of significant black sea ports such as sevastopol on the other hand belarus does not have the same value with respect to seaports and access routes belarus serves as a transit country for russian oil pipeline druzhba and natural gas pipeline yamal both supplying europe lukashenko has recently threatened to cut these off however the continued strategic importance of these pipelines is uncertain the value of druzhba has come under scrutiny as eu members halted oil imports over quality concerns secondly the value of yamal will be challenged significantly upon the completion of nord stream 2 and turkstream the domestic value crimea has an extremely symbolic value for russians irrespective of one s views on the referendum a significant part of the crimean population voted in favour of reuniting with russia the same dynamic does not exist in belarus from the russian perspective there is demand for an all encompassing russkiy mir for restored greatness and assertive foreign policy however annexing belarus would not bring putin the same popularity he basked in after 2014 since then the russians have seen their pension age rise and their domestic budget cut additionally there seems to be no end to spending in syria and to sanctions which have had an asphyxiating effect on russian gdp and future growth prospects of major industries risking further sanctions or even an armed conflict would pose too high a risk and not enough of a reward domestically what to watch out for outright invasion or annexation of belarus in the near term is unlikely it is too close to home for the baltic states and poland to tolerate russian expansion additionally annexing a territory i e the crimean peninsula is easier than invading an entire country and overthrowing its government kremlin is however keeping a tight grip through energy prices military cooperation and information distortion prime minister dmitry medvedev has recently conditioned continued economic aid to belarus on tighter integration and full commitment to the union state of russia and belarus founded in 1996 its ambitions are a customs union a single market and a common government the union has been in existence and largely irrelevant for over twenty years a sudden increased russian interest is a cause for suspicion already highlighted by belarusian opposition and while constructivist alarmism does not help complacency is not advised either the ideal scenario for russia is keeping belarus within its sphere of influence and simultaneously lowering the budget burdens that its subsidies pose as seen from the recent tax manoeuvre belarus has the exact opposite goals it wants to retain both its political autonomy and russian economic support clearly neither party can achieve its goals to the fullest next up is georgia whose new president is vocal about its plans to join the eu nato club the situation will be watched closely

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news climate change is going to be expensive no way around it the ravages caused by a warming planet will inflict trillions of dollars in damages on people all around the globe fires powerful storms famine shortages of clean water will exact a toll greater than the cost of all the wars in history there are two ways to deal with what s coming close your eyes and hope the bogeyman decides not to come to your door or open your eyes and embrace the changes in a way that benefits as many people as possible there is no middle ground here no muddling through it s gonna get ugly and all of us will be touched by the changes to come at present the government of the united states is shutting its eyes to climate change the alleged president has ordered that plans for new federal buildings and infrastructure projects not include strategies to cope with rising flood waters too costly he says no executive support for renewable energy can be found anywhere in the upper reaches of this so called administration no job training programs for those whose occupations will be impacted by the coming changes no nothing standing out in the crowd jay inslee is one of 457 democrats currently running for president in 2020 in such a crowded field it s hard to stand out but he has separated himself from the pack with a bold plan that embraces clean energy and a zero carbon economy he says his evergreen economy plan will create 8 million clean tech jobs he also says it will cost 9 trillion gulp that s a really big number at least it appears to be until you realize that the us has squandered 6 trillion on its ill considered military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan since 2001 and those are just the direct costs we know about the follow on from our bloodthirsty path of destruction is double or triple that amount so which would you rather have mountains of shattered bodies with nothing to show for it except a towering national debt or a country with a vibrant economy that is a global leader in addressing climate change the evergreen economy plan is built on the model that has led washington state to become the fastest growing economy in america making historic investments in clean energy research and deployment creating good jobs in 21st century manufacturing building green transportation infrastructure supporting modern job training programs raising wages and protecting workers rights and families according to inslee s website implementing the green new deal inslee s plan builds on the green new deal he tells the guardian you think of the green new deal as saying we should go to the moon but in my plan is how to build the rocket ship they both have their value inslee envisions upgrading buildings replacing water and transit infrastructure eliminating pollution from manufacturing and ramping up spending on clean energy and climate research inslee borrows an opening statement from franklin d roosevelt s new deal which said we are working toward a definite goal which is to prevent the return of conditions which came very close to destroying what we call modern civilization he explains today america faces a new threat to our modern civilization climate change this challenge also presents an unprecedented economic opportunity to lead the world in building a clean energy future inslee says his evergreen economy plan will promote high paying high skilled jobs building a stronger healthier more just inclusive and sustainable future one that features more collective bargaining power for unions new employment opportunities for the workers affected by the contraction of the fossil fuel industry and gender pay equity jobs jobs jobs the jobs issue is huge in federal elections in australia yesterday reactionaries led by scott morrison were re elected in large part because people in queensland want the thousands of jobs promised by the adani coal mine which if built will be one of the largest in the world if a few thousand jobs can influence the outcome of an election in a country that is experiencing record heat and rising sea levels inslee s promise of new job opportunities could resonate with us voters as well inslee s concern for workers includes a call for a reinvigorated labor movement that will make it possible for them to pursue their own interests more aggressively anti union animus is strong in the us thanks to decades of propaganda from the koch brothers and others few workers seem to realize that the anger they feel at the stagnation of wages is due in large measure to their loss of bargaining power with employers reactionaries don t particularly care about workers they violently resent the contributions unions make to progressive political campaigns it s ok for them to get a compliant supreme court to open the floodgates to a tidal wave of corporate cash under the pretext of free speech for corporations but let one dollar flow from union coffers to candidates on the left and it s a full on national emergency the plan here s the meat of inslee s evergreen economy plan igniting america s clean energy economy governor inslee will make historic investments as part of an unprecedented nationwide effort to deploy clean energy in every community in the country this effort includes establishing a rebuild america initiative to upgrade millions of buildings over the next two plus decades a 90 billion green bank for clean energy deployment a next generation rural electrification initiative programs to support energy democracy and community led energy transformation and grants in lieu of tax incentives for clean energy installation collectively this effort will massively increase clean energy deployment create millions of jobs and achieve the goals laid out in governor inslee s 100 clean energy for america plan building sustainable climate smart infrastructure governor inslee s evergreen economy plan makes the largest investment in american infrastructure in generations creating sustainable transportation water affordable housing sustainable communities and smart grid systems governor inslee will double investment in public transit dramatically expand electric car charging infrastructure and launch a clean water for all initiative to close the 82 billion annual funding gap in critical drinking water stormwater and wastewater infrastructure this plan for climate safe infrastructure investment will put americans to work in every community to achieve a state of good repair protect public health and improve resilience to devastating floods droughts fires and storms leading the world in clean manufacturing the evergreen economy plan creates incentives and programs to grow good american jobs and keep u s manufacturing on the cutting edge of the 21st century global economy through governor inslee s plan the federal government will partner with industry to increase efficiency cut costs and waste and deploy new technologies and fuels to reduce climate pollution that includes making major investments in domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and batteries establishing a federal buy clean program to help close the carbon loophole and support domestic industries and workers creating a new advanced energy manufacturing tax credit and utilizing entities such as the export import bank to increase exports of made in america clean energy solutions these initiatives will allow workers and businesses to revitalize america s economic competitiveness in existing manufacturing industries while taking the lead in emerging clean technologies and growth markets investing in innovation scientific research to defeat climate change and fully capture the clean energy opportunity of the 21st century governor inslee s plan also invests in transformative research and development in next generation clean technology and climate solutions and in scientific discovery and stem education governor inslee s plan will increase u s clean energy and climate solutions research investment to 35 billion each year more than 5 times the current funding this investment boost will marshal the resources of the federal government states universities and private sector innovators to confront the climate challenge the plan also supports innovation in the agricultural sector through a new arpa ag effort and a next generation rural clean energy extension service ensuring good jobs with family supporting wages benefits governor inslee puts reinvestment in american workers at the heart of his plan to build an evergreen economy ensuring high paying high skilled jobs building a stronger healthier more just inclusive and sustainable future this plan will reunionize and empower workers in every industry with new tools to collectively bargain challenge racial and gender inequality and close the gap in wealth and prosperity it includes enacting a g i bill for impacted fossil fuel workers and communities repealing the taft hartley act provisions that allow so called right to work laws redoubling commitment to national apprenticeship programs and creating and enforcing protections for gender pay equity praise a plea for help daniel kammen who contributed to the ipcc 6 climate change report has praise for the inslee plan it is not only vital for our environment but it is a recipe for more affordable housing and vibrant communities good paying jobs corporate and municipal accountability and global leadership for the united states inslee has been derisive of joe biden s middle of the road reaction to the green new deal according to ecowatch he told an audience in iowa when we have people in iowa seeking high ground we can t have a middle ground proposal cleantechnica stalwart benjamin nead reminds us that inslee needs just over 10 000 more supporters in order to be included in the upcoming democratic debates even a pledge of 1 will help propel him onto the debate stage where he will be exposed to a larger national audience while we do not officially endorse any political candidates we can say jay inslee stands for many of the same things we believe are central to our mission especially a rapid decarbonization of electrical generation a changeover to electric vehicles as soon as possible and major improvements in building efficiency all politics is local tip o neill famously said thinning ice sheets and stranded polar bears are a concern but fade into the background when it comes to having a decent job inslee

by mary sell alabama daily news alabama lawmakers this year have approved a statewide gas tax increase told sheriffs they can t keep money meant for feeding jail inmates and said they want a shot at the u s supreme court with the nation s most restrictive abortion ban the legislature has two to three weeks remaining in its 2019 session and a lot of legislating is left to do here s a look at some of the major bills that are pending and what might get punted to a special session later this year alabama lottery not a sure thing the alabama house of representatives is expected to vote tuesday on a proposal to allow for paper ticket lotteries such as powerball and mega millions a house committee changed the senate approved version of the bill to send 25 percent of ticket sale revenue to the state education budget the senate wants to send 100 percent to state debt and the general fund which supports non education agencies and departments if approved in the full house tuesday the bill goes back to the senate where sponsor sen greg albritton r atmore said changes could cost several votes that chamber approved the bill without a vote to spare earlier this month i really don t know at this point albritton said friday about whether the house and senate can come to an agreement albritton wouldn t say if he d support the bill in its current version i m going to wait and see what comes out of the house he said if it gets through both chambers alabama voters will have the final say in march 2020 but even house approval isn t a sure thing i think it s certain to say it won t be a slam dunk it ll be close speaker of the house mac mccutcheon r monrovia said thursday meanwhile disputes about the education and general fund budgets aren t limited to the lottery budgets pending both the proposed 2 1 billion general fund and 7 1 billion education budget are increases over last year the general fund includes more money for most agencies and a 2 raise for state employees the education budget boosts funding to many programs and has a 4 raise for k 12 and community college educators but early last week the state s 35 million match for the federal children s health insurance program wasn t in either the house approved general fund or the senate approved education budget both budgets are now in the opposite chamber albritton is the senate general fund committee chairman and lead a meeting where 17 5 million for chip was put in that budget that is on the belief hope and faith that the education trust fund will step up some albritton said about 174 000 alabama children receive health care funded through chip house education budget committee chairman rep bill poole couldn t be reached for comment friday that budget should be in committee wednesday while the general fund budget could be on the senate floor tuesday albritton said the 2020 general fund budget includes an additional 40 million for the alabama department of corrections most of which is to hire additional prison staff but the big fixes for the state s crowded and dangerous prisons aren t happening in this session pushing prisons to a special session a bipartisan group of lawmakers recently asked gov kay ivey to call a prison focused special session later this year to respond to the u s department of justice s april report on the suicides staffing shortages and extreme violence in alabama prisons sen cam ward r alabaster on friday said there isn t enough time remaining in the session to get necessary data including information on possible sentencing reform and prison construction lawmakers for years have kicked around the crowding issue and the possibility of new prisons ward said he s not thrilled about legislators revisiting prison construction because it always leads to disagreements about locations new facilities mean thousands of jobs for an area meanwhile ivey has explored the possibility of leasing new prisons from private companies ward also said rep chris england d tuscaloosa is working on a bill to require more state oversight on how sexual assaults and suicides are reported ivey hasn t committed to a special session but says all options are on the table ward said the remaining priority on prisons for him in this current session is a bill to let the governor appoint members of the alabama board of pardons and parole the bill which has cleared the house and is pending in the senate also sets sentence minimums medical marijuana the alabama senate this month approved legislation to allow medical marijuana for people with certain medical conditions the bill from sen tim melson r florence creates a state commission to regulate the use and sale of medical marijuana as of friday afternoon the bill was not on a committee meeting agenda for the upcoming week in the house there is still a lot of misinformation about the bill members want to make sure they have a chance to read what came out of the senate mccutcheon said he said he isn t sure of his position on the bill stopping asset seizures without convictions sen arthur orr s bill to prohibit law enforcement agencies from seizing the assets of people who haven t been convicted of a crime again met resistance thursday on the senate floor and did not get a vote it could come up again though under alabama s civil asset forfeiture law police can seize property if they have reason to believe it was criminally gained even if there s no conviction law enforcement can keep the property with a civil court order on the senate floor thursday orr said one in four people who have their assets taken are never criminally charged we didn t convict much less charge the person whose property we have he said that s something i think the public ought to know some law enforcement agencies oppose orr s bill i m getting some dings from back home on this sen steve livingston r scottsboro said on the senate floor before the bill was carried over ban on devices while driving stalled another bill that s delayed would ban the use of hand held cell phones and other electronic devices while driving the companion bills from rep k l brown r jacksonville and sen jim mcclendon r springville are modeled after georgia s 2018 law mccutcheon said a substitute bill is in the works some church stand your ground bills pass others pending representatives from several counties including shelby bibb talladega limestone lauderdale colbert and franklin filed county specific constitutional amendments to clarify that churchgoers can use deadly force if threatened the local bills came after a statewide bill wasn t advancing because democrats and some republicans said the state s current stand your ground law covers places of worship so far the lauderdale and franklin county bills have cleared the legislature but because at least one house member voted no the constitutional amendments will be on statewide ballots not county specific ballots several education bills priority for senate leader senate president pro tem del marsh r anniston said his education bills are a priority for him he has a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow voters to decide if the state s board of education should be appointed by the governor rather than elected as members currently are the bill has the support of ivey and cleared the senate unanimously it s now in the house the bill also mandates the new education commission adopt a new course of study standards in lieu of common core waiting for a vote in the senate is marsh s bill to ensure more public dollars can follow students to charter schools the original charter school law sponsored by marsh in 2015 said any local revenues restricted earmarked or committed by statutory provision constitutional provision or board covenant shall be excluded from the funds allocated to a charter school marsh s new bill strikes that language it also deletes the 10 mill cap on local funding per student that could be forwarded to a charter school also the house approved a bill by rep terri collins r decatur to require schools to hold back third grade students who are not reading it now goes to the senate tier iii bills clear house in senate a bill providing better retirement benefits for teachers cleared the house in late april and is awaiting committee action in the senate the tier iii benefits are between the tier i benefits offered prior to 2013 and the lesser tier ii benefits that have been in effect for new teachers since then a fiscal note on the bill says it would increase the total employer contributions by an estimated 16 7 million for the fiscal year 2020 with approximately 9 8 million being paid from the education budget advocates say the more generous benefits could attract new teachers of which the state has a shortage a similar bill for state employees also received house approval and is in the senate equal pay for women the house passed a bill from rep adline clarke d mobile on wednesday that would prohibit employers from paying different wages to employees based on their race or sex the measure passed 98 to 0 and went to the senate the bill says employers can only pay employees differently based on seniority a merit system systems that base earnings on quality or quantity of production or a differential based on any factor other than sex or race employers who violate the law would be required to pay the employee the lost wages and interest the employee would have to make the claim in a civil suit that would have to be brought within a year of the violation alabama and mississippi are the only two states without their own laws on pay discrimination broadband expansion efforts the effort to expand access to high speed broadband internet is one of the hottest issues of the session a coalition of business agriculture education and health care groups are pushing alabama lawmakers to make progress on getting more of rural alabama connected the senate included 30 million in the education trust fund to boost a state grant program that helps subsidize the cost of internet providers running fiber optic lines to less populated areas such areas often lack the potential customer base necessary for internet providers to justify the expense of building the infrastructure that carries the broadband service the state grants aim to offset those costs to make it financially feasible for lines to be run to rural communities earlier this month the house passed house bill 400 sponsored by rep randall shedd r cullman which allows electric utility companies to offer high speed internet to rural communities by way of their existing power networks supporters say it would alleviate the cost of running new fiber lines to rural areas by allowing utilities like alabama power the tennessee valley authority and regional electric cooperatives to piggyback their existing networks with high speed cable lines the bill was briefly debated in the senate thursday but set aside due to disagreements that would lead to a lengthy debate some existing cable and internet providers have problems with losing market share to utilities or the state subsidizing their competition with taxpayer funded grants inland ports orr also has a bill to dedicate some of the revenue from the gas tax increase lawmakers approved in march to publicly owned inland ports and intermodal facilities around the state the proposal would spend up to 10 million a year for 15 years on a new grant program to facilitate and coordinate inland port and transfer facility development improvement maintenance onsite storage moorings and construction the bill passed the senate 30 to 0 earlier this month and is pending in a house committee orr points to the intermodal hubs in south carolina and georgia that have spurred millions of dollars in economic investment in the last decade and moved container traffic including for automotive industry off the interstate and onto trains and rivers the gas tax increase is sending nearly 12 million a year to the port of mobile where it and federal money will pay for improvements to allow access by more and larger ships if that s the case you re looking at a huge increase in river rail and truck traffic orr has said alabama daily news reporters caroline beck and todd stacy contributed to this report

fed s kaplan downbeat on trade dispute watching and waiting the us federal reserve bank of dallas president said the us china trade spat is likely to slow global growth and eventually us growth bloomberg us federal reserve bank of dallas president robert kaplan has said that trade tensions might have a chilling effect on the us and global economy and he is also watching for the potential effects on inflation some end markets might be jeopardized by the us china trade dispute but the bigger thing is logistics and supply chain arrangements kaplan said on saturday during a wide ranging discussion at the society for advancing business editing and writing s annual conference in phoenix it s more likely to slow global growth and it s more likely to slow us growth ultimately but it is also possible some of the threatened tariffs might not be enacted he said us president donald trump last week increased duties to 25 percent from 10 percent on about us 200 billion in chinese products and has threatened to impose tariffs on almost all imports from the world s no 2 economy that would pull in consumer products such as mobile phones and toys that so far have not been affected as well as everything from flashlights to billiard balls as for the effects of tariffs on inflation it is too soon to judge you ll have to see the currency reaction and how businesses deal with it said kaplan who does not vote on monetary policy this year he said that the fed would have to examine is this transitory or is this something that will be more persistent the us china trade dispute is to dominate the world economy headlines this week as trump and chinese president xi jinping 習近平 go toe to toe their clash is casting a pall over the world economy as investors businesses and consumers risk retrenching staff until the outlook is clearer darkening trade war clouds loom over the financial landscape bloomberg economics carl riccadonna yelena shulyatyeva and eliza winger said auto tariffs have been delayed at least for now suggesting that the trump administration is aiming to avoid escalating a multi front trade conflict the ripple effect of the us china trade dispute could trigger imported inflation in the us and lead the fed to raise its key interest rates in the second half of the year taiwan institute of economic research 台灣經濟研究院 president chang chien yi 張建一 said on wednesday on the sidelines of a forum in taipei focusing on the economic outlook in asia higher interest rates in the us would raise the value of the us dollar which would in turn prompt investors to move their funds out of non greenback denominated assets including the new taiwan dollar chang said due to the escalating trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies the asian region and the rest of the world is at risk he added additional reporting by cna
advertisement the us monetarists started all this continued from saturday the us cannot afford to stop importing from china and from other countries its exports can no longer compete in the international market the financialization of the us economy as noam chomsky would put it led to the de industrialization of the us economy the us monetarists started all this they subscribed to the theory that hiking the value of the dollar would be a good means to substitute production they relied on finance capital as some kind of economic magic that can always help them extricate from whatever economic difficulties they are in finance capital was their key word because it worked in china to help finance rapid industrialization that would also work to bring about the same magic in the us one usual observation is that once the third world countries incurred huge and perennial trade deficit up to the 80s most of their exports would be mainly confined to minerals oil and agricultural products they could produce best whatever was left to better improve their economy for their exports representing their foreign exchange earnings was spent to help develop the country the rest dissipated through corruption such was the usual and normal cycle right after wwii the us was the only country that was able to avoid devastation its industrial and agricultural industries continued to decline while the two sectors of the economy can be summed up as the result of development it has considerably been reduced the us commanded nearly 50 percent of the world s total industrial and manufacturing output after war that however has been considerably reduced to 18 percent of the global output with china leading at 20 percent even if we take it that services continue to grow in the us that is attributable to population as growth they are services mostly catering to consumer demands and not related to production or manufacturing which many say can be outsourced like what the us did to outsource labor to china and to other countries in asia and latin america those services that were retained are those which are either extremely necessary requiring high specialized skill and extremely high wages or ordinary labor and skill that cannot be outsourced except for china none of those countries where the us has an outstanding trade deficit and even huge loan also running to trillions of dollar its loan with japan has it ever raised the issue of piracy and intellectual property violation advertisement there is even in trade policy of the us undertones of racism it clearly has not cited the same reason of intellectual property theft and piracy to countries where it has been incurring the same problem of trade deficit maybe singling out china in this issue which frankly has nothing to do with trade imbalance as a form of leverage to exact more concession does not augur well on how the administration intended to solve the problem for sure china knows the answer how the us could resolve the problem of excess importation but prefers to refrain such suggestion for it might directly pierce the core interest to make the issue non negotiable in like manner that china has already outlined core issues it cannot negotiate or bargain away in the negotiating table american economists are one in saying that a devaluation of the dollar partakes of an official admission that the us has become a de industrialized nation and its credit standing would plummet never before seen in the us history credit ratings made by standard poor moody s and fitch would seriously affect us financial companies to keep open their credit standing or even to secure a restructuring of their existing loans the situation may even lead to chaos and civil disturbances because a devaluation of the us dollar could mean an economic depression of great magnitude wall street will not only collapse but that will be pandemonium because it would seem that entire system of financialization of the us economy has finally collapsed like an empty ice cream cone the us knows that of an overvalued currency is the one that has been causing its economy to incur trade deficit it cannot now easily devalue its currency because the cost of wage in the us has been increasing not due to increased production but due to inflation which correspondingly increases the cost of living in the us but the standard living of the people there americans cannot that easily devalue their currency to halt the seemingly unstoppable trade deficit or are some would put it the rapid deindustrialization of america it is ironic for while it hits hard on china over the media on the issue of trade deficit not a word been mentioned that the leading importers of chinese goods are american companies namely wal mart costco and target they rely mostly on consumer products outsourced by us companies to china they could easily be sold in the us market because they are far cheaper those goods produced in europe at least there is still some sense of misguided nationalism of buying us brands though made in china rpkapunan gmail com

not content with its trade war against china us president donald trump s administration has also opened bilateral trade negotiations with japan yet whatever trump hopes to achieve with japan it will be far less than what he threw away when he abandoned the trans pacific partnership tpp in early 2017 during the 2016 us presidential campaign trump promised americans that he would negotiate so many great deals on their behalf that they would get tired of winning now that he has imposed heavy costs on us farmers consumers and the overall economy through tariffs on chinese imports americans are probably growing quite tired indeed trump s withdrawal from the tpp is the canonical example of his trade policy recklessness signed in 2016 by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries the treaty would have governed around 40 of all trade covered by world trade organization rules it was a 21st century agreement that included not just tariff reductions but also provisions to liberalize retail communications entertainment and financial services it would have strengthened labor and environmental standards established a new dispute resolution mechanism and created a framework for managing e commerce cybersecurity intellectual property rights data mobility and more when the us withdrew from the tpp many assumed the agreement was dead but the remaining signatories led by japanese prime minister shinzo abe quickly agreed on a replacement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp which retains around 200 of the tpp s 220 odd provisions the 20 that were left out were those for which the us pushed and can be reinstated should the country wish to join the pact at a later date now that the cptpp in force australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam enjoy preferential access to one another s markets as tariffs are phased out us suppliers in those markets are finding themselves at a growing disadvantage while the japanese tariff on american beef imports has remained at 38 5 the levy on beef from fellow cptpp countries has fallen to 27 5 and eventually will reach just 9 as a result american beef and wheat entering japan or any other cptpp country now face a higher tariff than beef and wheat from australia canada or new zealand still abe has worked hard to maintain good relations with the us taking much political heat at home for it japan was one of the few us trading partners not to retaliate when the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and while affirming japan s preference for regional and multilateral arrangements abe has nonetheless agreed to bilateral bargaining with the us with a japanese parliamentary election coming this summer bilateral talks aren t likely to go anywhere until later in the year when they do happen japan will benefit from having already entered a free trade agreement fta with the european union as of this past february more than 90 soon to be 97 of eu exports to japan are duty free and after a brief phase out period the same will apply to 85 of agri food products while wine from the us faces a 15 tariff wine from the eu as well as from cptpp countries such as chile now enters japan duty free as do european cars which are subject to common safety standards not for nothing did abe tout the eu deal as proof of the unshaken political will of japan and the eu to lead the world as the champions of free trade at a time when protectionism has spread for its part the trump administration wants japan to remove barriers to us agricultural and auto exports and reduce its bilateral trade surplus which stood at us 58 billion in goods in 2018 but while trump often complains that us goods face trade discrimination in japan he has only himself to blame it is only natural that us exporters would lose market share to their counterparts in europe and the cptpp countries with japan s new ftas in place the us trade deficit with japan is likely to grow even wider so much for trump s art of the deal the supposedly brilliant negotiator has left us exporters at a severe disadvantage in markets spanning the pacific rim and europe worse china is now pushing for a mega fta among 16 countries under the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep negotiations for which are ongoing although many china experts do not expect an agreement to be reached any time soon here it is worth remembering that the tpp would have excluded china and locked in a us led trade bloc in asia for the long term no deal that the trump administration makes with japan can possibly make up for what the us would have had under the tpp at best the us will salvage the tpp terms concerning japan alone rather than all 11 original signatories though abe has declared his willingness to negotiate bilaterally with trump he cannot possibly grant the us better terms than those given to japan s cptpp partners we ve seen this movie before with each trumpian negotiation the us issues its demands offers little in return and threatens punishment through tariffs if it doesn t get its way like the thief who says your money or your life there is no actual negotiation to speak of by acting like an insecure bully trump has left the us increasingly isolated in the global economy american producers and consumers are already paying the price the only question is how much more winning they are willing to bear copyright project syndicate 2019 www project syndicate org
it was a stunning and largely unexpected victory even for the victor but as prime minister scott morrison knows probably better than anyone given he was treasurer until late last year this was never going to be an easy time to be handed control of the economy the coalition campaign fought largely on a strategy of sound economic management unofficially kicked off early last month with the federal budget brought forward a month to demonstrate the government s fiscal credentials since then however many of the forecasts even for this financial year which ends in just six weeks are unlikely to be met which places doubt over many of the more optimistic long range projections the domestic economy appears to be slowing rapidly and with australia heavily reliant on raw material exports a large portion of our income and revenue raising potential rests with the health of the global economy even barring an international meltdown tepid global growth is being driven primarily by stimulus particularly from china in much of the developed world interest rates remain barely above zero and the united states has halted its rate hike program here at home the reserve bank actively is considering two rate cuts this year which would take the official cash rate down to 1 per cent at that point the federal government will need to consider stimulus should growth fail to materialise and that will blow projected surpluses and debt reduction out of the water here are some of the expected pressure points jobs unemployment one of the great success stories of the coalition government during the past four years has gone into reverse unemployment rate graph abc news last thursday the jobless rate ticked back to 5 2 per cent for april with the previous month revised up to 5 1 per cent granted a major factor was that more people began looking for work which could suggest some optimism among the workforce in fact the participation rate rose to an all time high of just under 66 per cent mostly that was because of a big lift in the number of women re entering the workforce a trend that has been in play for several years but the reserve bank having all but abandoned its primary goal of boosting inflation to between 2 and 3 per cent is now targeting the jobs numbers given we had the unemployment rate at 4 9 per cent just a few months ago a jump back to well above 5 per cent is concerning but as jp morgan s ben jarman notes that improved participation may make it easier for households to pay the mortgage through what he describes as a difficult housing adjustment housing real estate once the great aussie dream has become a nightmare for anyone who bought a house on the east coast during the past 18 months in western australia prices have been on the skids for the past four years while darwin s market has been in freefall canberra is now the only capital city where values have not dropped home prices april 2019 graph abc news the fear of further falls particularly with the opposition s plans to scale back tax incentives on negative gearing and capital gains clearly played a major role in the election result but the falls are expected to continue just the same given banks are no longer doling out cash and with a large supply of units about to hit eastern state capitals declining real estate values have had a serious impact on household spending as consumers shut their wallets and hunker down none of this has been helped by sluggish wages growth wages another snippet of worrying economic news hit the airwaves last wednesday with wages continuing to be stuck in the slow lane the march quarter showed overall growth of just 2 3 per cent not too far above all time lows given our exorbitant household debt which at 199 per cent of income is close to a world record we need stronger wages growth to get on top of the problem opposition leader bill shorten attempted to make wages a central theme in the election but it is a difficult task to manipulate wages without creating problems around unemployment in the post election wash up one commentator postulated that wages were not a problem primarily because inflation was so low that meant that in real terms workers were doing just fine the only problem with that argument is that you don t really want to achieve real wages growth by having inflation fall off a cliff wage price index by industry graph abc news inflation smack in the middle of the campaign the march quarter inflation figures were delivered to a stunned audience prices didn t move during that three months we had an inflation rate of zero nothing it might sound ok for those saving up to buy something but it generally indicates something horribly awry with the economy when prices aren t moving it points to a lack of demand and an unwillingness to spend should it continue it could hit company profits which then would invest less and begin laying off workers in last month s federal budget the government estimated inflation this financial year would come in at a paltry 1 5 per cent after the most recent result it s dropped to 1 3 per cent growth jobs and growth was the coalition s catchcry for much of the past six years but having notched up a world beating 27 years without a recession the chances of one occurring in the next few years have risen a combination of luck half decent economic management and a big immigration program have kept us buoyant during the past quarter century we even avoided recession during the great global recession a decade ago primarily because of china s massive stimulus program that sent resource prices skyrocketing gross domestic product per capita graph abc news but how long can it continue late last year the economy slowed dramatically expanding at an anaemic 1 per cent per annum during the second half the next reading will be in a few weeks and that too is expected to show a sharp slowdown strip out the impact of migration and we ve gone backwards in fact the government entered this campaign with many economists talking about a per capita recession demonstrated in the graph above in the end though it didn t seem to matter despite the all the economic travails and the odds stacked against him mr morrison somehow brought it home how good is that

early last week new ruptures in united states china trade negotiations caused big falls across global markets including on the asx but was this justified particularly when a number of companies would actually benefit for example from china s stimulus response interestingly among the best performers on the asx that day were a2 milk treasury wine estates and fortescue metals all of which happen to have china as an important customer and more relevantly the asx quickly recovered over the rest of the week in the end these types of events just create sentiment driven noise only when there is a surprise is there any real bearing on markets and this in turn makes it difficult for most investors to take advantage donald trump s election win is a case in point as it turned out trump has implemented quite dramatic pro business reform that has included corporate tax cuts and deregulation and these have clearly helped the us economy mind you never before has the us had a president so obsessed with the fed oil prices and the sharemarket from which he seems to measure a big part of his political success in australian politics a trump like economic focus has been noticeably lacking advertisement in the latest electioneering economic talk was mostly to be avoided with the major political parties promising balanced budgets and neither proposing more than tinkering with corporate tax rates regulation or other productivity measures in the end the fundamental difference between labor and the liberals came down to how to cut up the pie owners versus workers rather than how to grow it the coalition s win was a surprise but as far as the economy and stocks are concerned it matters little the coalition government now faces an economy that looks quite dour perhaps the uncertainty of the election has dampened things and as investors we will be looking out for a temporary post election bump advertisement further out financial markets which by their nature are forward looking mostly indicate things are getting worse for example government bond yields are hitting all time lows with the 10 year now at just 1 64 per cent most assume the rba will come to the rescue specifically with expectations for two rate cuts this year and even suggestions of possible quantitative easing more on point one might ponder why politicians haven t been willing to think bigger especially given cheap rates and relatively low government debt levels unfortunately the history of reform in australia has been that it usually comes only at breaking point the last example of that was under the late bob hawke and since then we have enjoyed 28 years of continuous economic expansion that is a big reason for our current complacency however with things seemingly getting worse the government might be forced to act balancing the budget will not be so commendable then arguably the asx s post gfc highs contradict the signals of bond and other markets there are a number of factors driving the asx now but the important ones are monetary policy the economy and most fundamentally corporate earnings and this is where investors should focus their resources rather than the unpredictability of elections and trade wars julian beaumont is the investment director of bennelong australian equity partners
gbp zar forecast update 3 after seeing out monday s session lower the pound to south african rand exchange rate was lifted into tuesday s session with sterling reaching r18 4 before trimming gains to trade at r18 34320 at last check the move higher came in response to rand weakness following the latest south african reserve bank sarb leading composite business cycle indicator release which registered a 0 4 month on month decline extending the year on year declines for a sixth successive month and reflecting an uncertain outlook for sa firms and activity levels with brexit and monetary policy on the agenda tuesday could see an uptick in volatility for the gbp first up bank of england s carney and other monetary policy committee moc members are due to testify before parliament s treasury select committee on the uk economy outlook and monetary policy carney has stressed the need to hike interest rates just as soon as brexit uncertainty has abated but thus far market pricing doesn t tally with the central banker outlook a reaffirmation of the need to increase interest rates could lend the uk some support elsewhere and likely the overarching issue for the session pm may will meet with her cabinet to discuss brexit options amid low expectations for an early june passing of the withdrawal agreement bill while a series of indicative votes would be seen as putting the direction in the hands of the generally no deal averse house of commons the previous series of votes failed to yield any tangible breakthroughs for the zar it s a quiet session ahead of wednesday s cpi releases and thursday s all important sarb repo rate decision we forecast headline inflation to come in at 4 4 y y in april from 4 5 in march as a result of slowing core inflation despite the large increase in fuel prices in april wrote absa economist peter worthington adding we expect the sarb to keep the repo on hold gbp zar forecast update 2 the british pound to south african rand exchange rate continued to decline as monday s session progressed with sterling last seen trading at r18 28695 down a further 0 33 after last week s substantial declines for the uk politics are likely to set the tone for the week ahead with an abundance of brexit pessimism expected to limit gbp upside while eu parliament elections may 23rd to 26th also pose a source of potential political risk especially if the conservative party receive a thrashing as expected advertisement we forecast headline cpi inflation to ease slightly to 4 4 y y in april from 4 5 in march as base effects from the 1 pp vat increase last april will likely offset higher fuel price inflation said economist peter worthington at absa the highlight of the week however is expected to be the south african reserve bank sarb policy review on thursday while policymakers are expected to leave their key rate unchanged at 6 75 the review will also yield sarb s latest economic forecasts with lower growth and inflation forecasts expected to translate into a weaker rand gbp zar forecast update after bouncing from the r18 1 area late last week the pound to south african rand exchange rates reverted to the downside once more as monday s european session got underway with sterling last seen trading at r18 30844 with the sell off in risk assets taking a pause the rand firmed versus key peers in early monday

governor mark carney and colleagues are expected to testify on the state of the british economy before parliament s treasury committee on tuesday ahead of the latest cpi figures on wednesday with consensus estimates calling for a rise in the headline figure from 1 9 to 2 2 gbp zar forecast the pound gbp remainder under pressure this week falling heavily against the south african rand zar and the majority of its other peers as a turbulent uk political landscape weighed on sentiment after a fairly robust start to the week sterling s retreat was kicked off after the office for national statistics ons published the uk s latest employment figures this saw a surprise fall in the uk s unemployment rate to a new 44 year low of 3 8 undermined by the accompanying earnings figures after wage growth slowed faster than expected in march however the weakness in the pound really intensified around the mid week as the shift uk political landscape began to weaken sentiment the most major development was the announcement that after weeks of pressure from mps theresa may would set out a timetable for her departure as pm once a fourth parliamentary brexit vote is held in early june observers suggested that this could result in the pm stepping down within a matter of weeks with sterling sentiment siding as analysts speculated on what her resignation could mean for brexit jasper lawler at london capital group suggests given the tories sharp losses in the polls and the brexit party s dominance in polling for european elections a hard line brexiteer prime minister is becoming more likely the overriding fear for currency traders is that this means that a hard no deal brexit is back on the table as an option south african rand zar rocked by us china trade war jitters meanwhile the south african rand zar initially got off to a slow start this week with zar relinquishing some of its post elections gains as signs of rising global trade tensions saw investors shun the emerging market currency in favour of safe haven assets it didn t take long for zar to recoup these losses however with the rand able to take advantage of some broad weakness in sterling after donald trump made a series of tweets in which he suggested a us china trade deal was still on the table and would be made then the time is right the rand then hit a three week high against the pound on thursday as local investors shrugged off their trade concerns as they bet on president cyril ramaphosa ability to deliver on economic reforms as he named his new cabinet however zar exchange rates ultimately fell back at the very tail end of the week amidst fears that china could break off trade talks with the us after chinese state media reported beijing was no longer interested in continuing its dialogue with washington gbp zar exchange rate forecast eu elections to soften sterling sentiment even further looking ahead to next week s session the pound south african rand gbp zar exchange rate may extend its losses even further as the focus turns to the eu elections taking place on thursday the elections are seen by many as a proxy for a second brexit referendum something that could hurt sterling as recent polling data suggests the big winner of the day will be the brexit party an outcome that could re energise calls for the uk to leave the eu without a deal ahead of the vote however the pound could find some modest support with the release of the uk s latest cpi figures on tuesday as economists forecast that inflation will have climbing back within the bank of england s boe target range of 2 3 meanwhile the focus for zar investors next week will be on the south african reserve bank s sarb latest policy meeting and while no policy changes are expected from the bank

kansas city star mo may 19 may 19 adventhealth is set to build an 85 bed hospital in a wealthy area of south overland park that already has four full service hospitals within 10 miles last month it announced plans to build yet another one a 200 bed hospital in lenexa just west of the interstate 435 loop also a well to do area adventhealth leaders said they were responding to demand from a growing part of the metro but there s another reason to build on the far edge of the area s wealthiest county by putting your hospitals beyond the outside of the ongoing growth or sprawl within a metro area you have eliminated most of the poor people said james dockins a professor at rockhurst university who studies health care management and while residents of lower income areas must do without he said johnson county patients may actually face higher health care bills because of the medical building boom there the announcements by adventhealth the nonprofit formerly known as shawnee mission health are just the latest expansions in an ongoing rush to claim or hold onto a slice of johnson county where large hospitals micro hospitals and free standing emergency rooms already crowd the map the university of kansas hospital olathe medical center st luke s health system and hca midwest health which owns hospitals throughout the kansas city area have also significantly expanded their operations there in recent years meanwhile large sections of wyandotte and jackson counties remain health care deserts deemed medically underserved by the federal government in other industries it wouldn t necessarily make sense to expand in a part of town that s already saturated while ignoring areas that have little to no competition but it makes sense for hospitals because in general the amount of money they make for a given procedure depends on who is paying adventhealth plans to break ground this fall on its 85 bed hospital at 165th street and antioch road sandwiched between the two wealthiest zip codes in the state of kansas 66224 where the median household income is 156 180 and 66221 where it s 149 461 dockins said that means a lot of working age high earners with private health insurance which pays better than medicare a government program for older americans and much better than medicaid or treating the uninsured patrick sallee the ceo of three vibrant health safety net clinics in wyandotte county said the hospitals are flocking to johnson county to try to capture more of those patients with private insurance rather than expanding in his county where more people who are uninsured or on medicaid would be coming through their doors it s not an equitable health care system he said but it s like that almost all over the country and it s not the hospitals fault i think they re doing what the business structure drives them to do sallee said in general i wish the structure was different the structure incentivizes the behavior and the behavior is to compete like hell for commercial patients that s worsening the inequality of health care access between the haves and have nots in kansas city there are now at least 15 emergency rooms in johnson county including two that are just for kids the same number as jackson and wyandotte counties combined there are 12 emergency rooms in jackson county including one that s just for kids and one that s just for military veterans a county that is larger in both population and square miles there are three in all of wyandotte county which typically ranks as the least healthy county in the metro area it s not all rosy for johnson county either dockins said emergency rooms are the most expensive place to get care and the number of them popping up in the county should raise questions about who s paying for all that health care infrastructure and whether it might be put to more efficient use elsewhere there is one place where the system is different maryland since the 1970s the state has had a unique all payer system in which a central state commission sets prices for all hospital services rather than insurers negotiating individually individual hospitals are paid different amounts to encourage competition but patients don t pay different amounts based on who insures them and the system also tries to account for the amount of uncompensated care each hospital provides to the uninsured bob atlas the president and ceo of the maryland hospital association said it s not perfect but it generally does make it easier for hospitals to operate in poorer areas whether rural or urban by having medicare and medicaid pay essentially the same as commercial payers hospitals are not if you will disadvantaged by being in a community with what we in the field would call a challenging payer mix atlas said some states have dabbled in similar models but the amount of money in the health care industry has changed dramatically since the 1970s and many hospitals now oppose all payer models because they like the freedom to negotiate with smaller groups of payers there s been no buzz about bringing all payer to kansas or missouri which means that at a time when several hospital systems in kansas city are expanding none of them are getting any closer to patients like michael brantley brantley a kansas city kansas artist has been battling sarcoidosis an inflammatory condition that has caused him to at times lose his vision and his ability to move without pain transportation is an issue and at the moment right now i am borrowing my mother s car in order to even get back and forth to doctor appointments brantley said when the star interviewed him last month for another story i lost my car when i was sick and i haven t been able to make enough money to get another car if he has a car brantley can continue driving 20 minutes from his house near the quindaro neighborhood to the university of kansas hospital where he found a doctor who was willing to treat him at discounted rates when he was uninsured if he s forced to take the bus to his chemotherapy treatments the ride is one to two hours each way and requires at least one transfer he has no options closer to home there s nothing around here brantley said the build up within the last five years medical building projects in johnson county have included a 100 million expansion of the university of kansas hospital s indian creek campus at i 435 and nall avenue a half dozen micro hospitals and freestanding emergency rooms opened throughout johnson county by st luke s and hca midwest a 100 million expansion of olathe medical center adventhealth s bluhawk medical clinic in south overland park near where the new hospital will be built a 120 million expansion of hca midwest s overland park regional medical center smaller scale projects like a 36 million adventhealth outpatient clinic at college boulevard and metcalf avenue an 8 million pediatric center at overland park regional and st luke s mission farms primary care and specialty services clinic at i 435 and mission road more expansions still in the works like the adventhealth hospital in overland park and the one proposed for 87th street and renner boulevard in lenexa and a new rehabilitation institute at st luke s south hospital the hospital systems say they re simply trying to bring medical care closer to home we ve been building our physician network in south overland park adventhealth cfo karsten randolph said in a statement announcing the new hospital on 165th street it s important that we bring these providers closer to where their patients live and work and building a new hospital with the latest medical technology will allow them to care for more patients and provide more advanced health care services but brenda sharpe the president and ceo of the reach healthcare foundation said people who live in other parts of the kansas city area would love that sort of convenience too especially low income patients who are more likely to have transportation issues i don t begrudge the hospitals opening new facilities sharpe said i just wish they would open up new clinics too in areas of town that are perpetually underserved the federal government s health resources and services administration decides which areas of the country are designated medically underserved areas the agency defines as having too few primary care providers high infant mortality high poverty or a high elderly population not one square mile of johnson county makes the list but a large swath of kansas city does and so does the northeast corner of wyandotte county around quindaro boulevard for the most part the only medical organizations building in those places are safety net clinics that are subsidized by donations and tax dollars the ymca teamed with truman medical center jackson county s safety net hospital to open a clinic at 3800 linwood blvd last year and southwest family health care is seeking 4 million in donations to expand its operations in quindaro and the rosedale neighborhood of kansas city kansas the hca midwest hospitals which include overland park regional and menorah medical center are for profit enterprises so are three kansas city area hospitals owned by prime healthcare st joseph medical center st mary s medical center in blue springs and providence medical center in kansas city kansas but kansas city s other major health systems are nonprofits or public hospitals that in exchange for tax breaks are legally bound to work for the public good as well as for money sharpe whose organization works to improve health care access in underserved areas said the nonprofit hospitals are doing good work in their communities but some parts of the metro are being left behind johnson county regularly ranks as the healthiest in kansas in the robert wood johnson foundation s annual analysis wyandotte county is always near the bottom jackson county is usually ranked near the middle of missouri s 115 counties while platte and clay counties are near the top many factors create those disparities and experts generally agree that things like poverty and lifestyle weigh heavier than the number of nearby doctors and hospitals but sharpe said it would still make sense for the area s leading medical providers to build where people are least healthy in an ideal world if we were really looking at population health outcomes we d be locating primary care and specialty care resources in communities that have the highest rates of poverty and the lowest rates of access to those services sharpe said instead much of the new building is in overland park which the consumer website wallethub recently ranked no 1 for health care among the 170 largest cities in america new medical facilities would also bring a financial boost to underserved areas that would help with some of the socioeconomic factors contributing to poor health sharpe said the new adventhealth hospital in south johnson county for example is projected to create 200 full time jobs advocates say expanding medicaid would make underserved communities more attractive health care markets medicaid payment rates are low compared to other insurance but still usually a better return on investment than treating uninsured patients kansas and missouri are two of 14 states that have so far declined expansion which is a feature of the affordable care act commonly called obamacare it would extend medicaid coverage to everyone who makes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line or about 35 000 a year for a family of four the federal government picks up 90 percent of the cost in the absence of expansion missouri and kansas have some of the nation s tightest medicaid eligibility restrictions in both states nearly everyone who qualifies is either a child a frail elderly person a pregnant woman or a person with a disability faisal khan the ceo of the samuel u rodgers health center safety net clinics in missouri said that means it s relatively easy to link low income patients with pediatric specialists or prenatal care at area hospitals because medicaid usually covers it but when an uninsured adult who s not pregnant needs an mri or surgery that gets a bit complicated his organization has a partnership with north kansas city hospital for treating residents of clay county and truman medical center has agreed to treat all jackson county residents regardless of their ability to pay in exchange for a taxpayer subsidy the folks at truman really are committed to making this work and they do make every effort to take care of everybody we send over khan said truman also provides an on demand transportation system for some of its patients there s nothing like that for low income people who need hospital care in wyandotte county sallee of vibrant health has an agreement with a company called circulation to get patients to and from its safety net clinics using the ride sharing app lyft but transportation becomes an issue when they need to be referred for hospital care sallee said his clinics patients could benefit from having things like medical imaging or surgical centers closer to home but there s not the resources to make that happen that s despite having the region s largest medical center the university of kansas hospital headquartered at the southeastern edge of the county steven stites the chief medical officer for ku hospital said ku has invested far more in wyandotte county than any other health system from expanding its main campus on rainbow boulevard to renovating an aging federal building downtown into a mental health center to staffing a clinic inside wyandotte high school and helping get vibrant health off the ground but academic medical centers run on thin margins he said and none of those investments would be possible if ku weren t also joining the competition for suburbia when you try to do good work in an underserved area you ve got to balance it against an area that s got mostly insured patients stites said for us on the kansas side that s johnson county ku hospital hasn t gotten any government payments since it moved from state control to a hospital authority model more than 20 years ago although its accompanying medical school still gets state money stites said that means ku has to compete in johnson county like everybody else or risk going the way of bethany medical center which closed in 2001 after more than a century of operation in the heart of kansas city kansas you can t have a strategy of only existing in a relatively poor county stites said because you re not going to be able to keep the doors open unless you have tremendous support from the county or the state a la truman medical center unless someone challenges their tax exempt status though there s nothing legally binding ku or any of the other hospitals to use the money they make treating commercially insured patients to ensure everyone else has access and there is no clear path to medical care for patients who can t afford it like there is in jackson county with truman an organization called wyjo care recruits doctors to donate some of their time to treating uninsured people in wyandotte and johnson counties if the hospitals where they work agree to it sallee said ku and st luke s both step up to treat vibrant health s patients but other advocates for low income residents said they ve talked to people who have been turned away there have been places like ku where if someone needs to have surgery or get something serious done they just won t accept them said molly moffett of the community health council of wyandotte county who pays having lower percentages of uninsured people has helped make johnson county the winner in the medical building boom but dockins the rockhurst professor said all of that buildup costs money and sustaining it year over year takes even more hospitals have to pay for staff electricity janitorial services and other costs even if they re not full and with the exception of times like last year s bad flu season they re not usually full the new adventhealth hospital in overland park will add almost 100 beds to an area that already has hundreds in two full service hospitals about five miles to the north menorah medical center and st luke s south one about 10 miles to the west olathe medical center and one about 10 miles to the northeast st joseph medical center meanwhile government programs and private sector health insurers are slowly trying to move away from the traditional model of paying by the test procedure or night s stay and instead bundle payments to reward providers who keep people out of the hospital why would you build inpatient beds when we see annually ongoing migration toward outpatient services and away from inpatient dockins said it seems to me to be a pretty nonsensical approach to health care strategic planning to be building out all these beds so close to each other but dockins said adventhealth had a compelling reason to expand competitors building around its main campus on 75th street in merriam that hospital formerly called shawnee mission medical center is now bracketed between an hca midwest free standing er 2 5 miles northwest and a st luke s micro hospital about a mile straight east those small facilities don t offer all the services adventhealth does but dockins said they re located on major traffic arteries to divert high value patients who are having emergencies those patients can get stabilized at the small facility then referred to the mother ship hospital like st luke s on the country club plaza or overland park regional for whatever followup tests or procedures they need it s more infrastructure but not more efficiency what this typically leads to is a significant increase in overall costs for a particular population but not necessarily an increase in overall quality of care dockins said in a normal market more competition in a geographic area should drive down prices for consumers but hospital care is not a normal market dockins said people don t shop around during medical emergencies and even when it s not an emergency hospital pricing is so opaque shopping around is nearly impossible the federal government recently required all hospitals that participate in medicare to post price lists on their websites but the lists can be hard to find and they re technical enough that it s hard for non medical people to decode them they also break down some procedures into many separate components each with their own price listing and they don t account for the different prices each insurance company has negotiated we still don t have any clue when we go into any of these hospitals in overland park what the price is going to be dockins said it s totally camouflaged so there s no way the normal market forces can enter play cause nobody has a clue what the bill is going to be until two or three weeks after they leave the hospital so hospital prices are set more by what they need to charge to maintain and expand their operations and what insurance companies will allow there s evidence nationally that insurance companies are allowing higher costs and just passing them on to their customers a study by the healthcare cost and utilization project found that costs for inpatient hospital stays increased by 13 percent adjusted for inflation between 2005 and 2014 meanwhile the average deductible for private health insurance plans rose from 303 to more than 1 200 between 2006 and 2016 according to the kaiser family foundation in short dockins said people in johnson county are subsidizing an inefficient hospital system that is overbuilt in some areas and underbuilt in others the proliferation of emergency rooms freestanding and otherwise in johnson county encourages residents to get care in the most expensive setting possible when brian levinson an overland park resident who works in marketing was bit by a cat last year he went to the emergency room at st luke s south near his house where he was given a tetanus shot and antibiotics several weeks later he got a bill for almost 1 500 with most of it going to pay for the er visit fee not the medicine levinson had private insurance through blue cross and blue shield of kansas city but he had a high deductible so his out of pocket share of the bill was still more than 1 000 until he called a st luke s executive to complain and got the bill whittled down levinson also said that last year he took his son to children s mercy s blue valley urgent care clinic and was unexpectedly charged extra because the clinic used something called provider based billing that allows hospitals to charge facility fees even for care that was provided outside of the hospital itself medicare stopped paying those fees by federal law in 2015 but the children s mercy clinic was grandfathered in certainly i m very appreciative of the access to good health care levinson said i just think the health care providers particularly nonprofit systems that are asking the community for support should be transparent about their costs and should be charging reasonable amounts for the services they provide st luke s and children s mercy didn t respond to requests for comment levinson said he s glad he doesn t live in rural areas where hospitals are closing but with three hospitals already within a few miles of his house he wishes more health systems in johnson county were investing in things like urgent care without extra fees rather than building more ers the federal government used to require states to make hospitals prove a need for a major expansion in a given area to prevent inflated prices due to excess capacity that mandate was repealed in the 1980s leaving it up to the states whether to keep their so called certificate of need laws kansas decided not to which dockins said is one reason the buildup in johnson county continues unabated but khan of the samuel u rodgers health center said such laws alone can t close the disparities missouri still has one he said but it hasn t stopped the same sort of medical building boom in the suburbs of st louis the city where he lived and worked until last year until the health care system changes at a national level he said hospitals will keep ignoring low income neighborhoods to seek out the areas with the most commercially insured patients everybody s sort of trying to feed from the same trough as it were ___ c 2019 the kansas city star kansas city mo visit

menafn daily forex aud usd the australian dollar has sold off rather drastically during trading over the past week as we are now starting to cut into a lot of support that being the case i suspect that we will probably work our way down to the 0 68 handle which is massive support a breakdown below that level will more than likely send this market to the 0 65 handle at this point it s very likely that we could see a bit of a bounce but i believe that it s probably best to leave this market gbp jpy the british pound has fallen rather hard against the japanese yen during the past week reaching towards the 140 level however we have seen a bit of buying pressure in that area so a bounce is very likely if the stock markets can recover that gives us a little bit of the risk on attitude that we may need and beyond that if we can get some type of certainty when it comes to theresa may leaving office we could get a bounce however if we break down below the weekly candle stick then i believe that we go down to the 138 level next great trade opportunities are waiting don t miss it usd jpy the us dollar spent most of the week falling against the japanese yen but right along with the s p 500 did find buyers in more of a risk on attitude in north america the fact that we have formed a hammer is a good sign and it looks very likely that we are going to try to job and fill the gap above near the 111 level if we break down below the 109 level that would be very negative eur usd the euro continues to grind lower and quite frankly i think that short term rallies are going offer nice selling opportunities it s very likely that we could go down to the 1 11 handle possibly even the 1 10 level

domestic gold rate has hit an all time high of rs 72 000 per tola resulting in severe consequences for goldsmiths across pakistan pakistan s rupee has weakened to a record low in an apparent devaluation a few days after the country secured a bailout from the international monetary fund imf that investors speculate includes tough conditions to reform the economy including the rate of the us dollar with the spike in the rate of the us dollar against rupee analysts predict that the gold rate would rise further spot gold fell 0 8 to 1 276 25 per ounce as of 1 46pm at 1746 gmt on friday having dropped to its lowest since may 3 at 1 274 51 earlier in the session the dollar advanced on the back of strong us economic data putting the metal on track for its biggest weekly decline in a month the metal is down 0 7 for the week so far which could be its biggest weekly decline since april 19 us gold futures settled down 0 82 at 1 275 70 an ounce the dollar has strengthened due to relatively strong us economic reports and little relaxation in geo political tensions all these combined have put downward pressure on gold prices said jeff klearman portfolio manager at graniteshares the dollar index gained holding near a two week high against a basket of currencies making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies us consumer sentiment jumped to a 15 year high in early may amid growing confidence over the economy s outlook data showed this weekend spot gold fell 0 8 on thursday its biggest one day percentage decline since mid april as strong economic data from the united states spurred investors towards riskier assets the falls in gold over the past couple of sessions has dented the technical picture for the metal analysts said bullion prices had broken the bearish trend line that had marked the last few months carlo alberto de casa chief analyst with activtrades wrote in a note a clear recovery to the 1 300 level and prices holding above this psychological threshold would confirm the supportive scenario seen in the last two weeks while a fall below 1 280 would be seen as a negative element
in the u s small companies are big according to chris kuehl fma s economic analyst and a founder of armada corporate intelligence 3 749 companies in the u s have more than 500 employees which pales in comparison to the 248 152 firms that employ fewer than 500 people of that latter number 186 114 have fewer than 20 employees if you consider metal fabricators in the u s the vast majority have fewer than 500 employees and frankly fall on the lower end of the scale when it comes to number of employees as a result these small to medium sized entities don t have the luxuries much larger companies enjoy people tend to wear several hats as they strive to get metal parts out the door being a small company makes one vulnerable too gene marks a small business expert told the crowd at the fma annual meeting in nashville march 5 that the average lifespan of a small business is fewer than 10 years the ones that survive may have owners with noticeable traits such as being a people person working long days and demonstrating keen intelligence but one trait really makes a difference according to marks every single one of them is looking ahead he said and it s not a week or a month from now it s farther out they have to it s their job marks added that s why they make the big bucks so owners and managers of metal fabricating companies are faced not only with working to meet the demands of customers needing quality parts delivered yesterday but also keeping their eyes on the horizon looking beyond the upcoming week month and year that s a tall order for anyone much less a small business owner but that may be the reality that awaits today s company leaders it s probably the main reason that fabricators attended the 13th edition of the fabricator s leadership summit at the fma annual meeting expert guidance is required when charting a sea of uncertainty what awaits in 2020 marks shared with the audience what the road to the 2020 election might look like people may think that congress is gridlocked but that perception is not going to stop changes from occurring an infrastructure bill of some type is likely marks said the democrats like the idea of infrastructure spending that can fuel projects in their home districts and president donald trump has been a longtime supporter of infrastructure investment total spending ranges from 200 million to 1 trillion and probably will include a large amount of incentives to encourage private investment in place of direct federal government investment an upgrade in the family leave law has a good chance of becoming reality ivanka trump the president s daughter and adviser has shown particular interest in this issue and could get bipartisan support for it early discussions center around a plan for six weeks of family leave to be available to workers should they need it for family emergencies for example it would be funded through unemployment programs the federal government may move on hiking the minimum wage to between 11 and 12 marks said not only will this have a direct impact on those states with lower minimum wages but such a move also will put pressure on other employers who have employees earning above the minimum wage but expect a bump in pay after seeing their minimum wage earning colleagues getting an increase under the obama administration the department of labor issued a regulation requiring that employers pay overtime to all workers making less than 47 476 per year the business community sued and won a permanent nationwide injunction just before the rule took effect that meant the regulation rolled back to the old standard 23 660 per year marks said that the trump administration would like to see the salary threshold placed at 35 000 the section 232 tariffs obviously take on great importance particularly for those metal fabricators that may have run through material inventories that were purchased prior to when the trade penalties on imported steel went into effect marks predicted that the tariffs would have to be suspended if the united states mexico canada agreement usmca which is supposed to replace the north american free trade agreement is to have any chance of passing congress as for when the next recession might hit marks said one might be coming but it s impossible to know when no one knows he said they didn t know before the last recession and they won t know about the next one in his economic forecast kuehl told the crowd that inflation is starting to become an issue manufacturers can t find the type of workers they need for their more modern work environments which is helping to push salaries and wages higher the national association of manufacturers estimates that the u s has about 3 5 million open manufacturing jobs and it expects 2 million of them to go unfilled because of this kuehl said that the federal funds rate the interest rate that banks charge other banks for lending them money from their reserve balances on an overnight basis will climb to 2 8 percent this year and to 2 9 percent in 2020 the federal reserve is committed to keeping inflation down he said this is unlikely to change in the immediate future as two incoming federal reserve board members are viewed as being more hawkish on inflation than the people they are replacing kuehl added what s next for section 232 tariffs in the 232 tariffs and quotas the mechanism of protection panel discussion phil kooima owner of metal fabricator kooima co rock valley iowa voiced the opinion of several fabricators in the audience we are a consumer of steel and it is my opinion that section 232 s goal was to protect a small number of mills at the expense of the greater fabrication industry he said the united states should import as much low cost steel as possible to make us fabricators more competitive low cost steel is a commodity to us there s no benefit to fabricators to have high priced steel just as there s no benefit to high priced electricity the section 232 tariffs put into effect in the name of addressing a national security threat placed a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum and 25 percent tariff on imported steel from select countries including canada mexico and the european union when the tariffs were enacted in march 2018 domestic prices crept up as well fabricators have been dealing with steel prices in the 650 ton to 700 ton range for hot rolled coil since then piyush sood vice president equity research morgan stanley believed that the tariffs against canada and mexico would go away sooner rather than later because of the desire to have the usmca gain congressional approval the aluminum tariffs in particular shouldn t have a long shelf life because the domestic producers simply can t meet the market needs of u s manufacturers sood said that manufacturers consume 5 6 million tons of aluminum per year but u s producers can generate only about 2 million tons that makes for a significant shortfall in the meantime many companies that rely on imported metals are finding that they aren t getting their request for exclusions addressed by the department of commerce washington d c based trade attorney lewis leibowitz said that as of early march 49 3 percent of the 26 504 requests to be excluded from the steel tariffs were still pending and 70 9 percent of the 5 264 requests to be excluded from the aluminum tariffs were also waiting to be addressed i m still looking for one of the exclusions that has been granted over the objection of the domestic producers leibowitz said referring to the large amount of influence that the domestic steel mills have with the current presidential administration how are fabricators reacting when faced with these challenges fabricators have come to realize that they need to operate as efficiently as possible particularly when it comes to handling material needless to say metal fabricators have reacted in different ways during the ask the fabricators panel discussion rob bohn president nema enclosures manufacturing corp houston said that his company has looked to tighten up their quoting efforts raised prices and actually turned one employee into a full time material handler to ensure that material wasn t sitting on the shop floor waiting to be processed we also changed how much material we buy bohn said so typically i don t bring in metal until 24 to 48 hours before we re going to cut it that way i keep my inventories at a minimum steve heim president of brenco industries ltd delta b c reacted in a different manner the shop purchased probably two months worth of material because it wanted to ensure that it had material to serve its customers being somewhat geographically isolated the company didn t want to be left in a lurch for material heim added that because the steel prices increased in canada too brenco s customers also were dealing with the impact as a result the price increases were accepted without too much grief david puleo director of sheet metal operations rapid manufacturing nashua n h said his company recently went back to its material suppliers to streamline the ordering process instead of buying one sheet of this material two sheets of this material six sheets of this material every other day we set up with our suppliers a minimum order quantity of 10 20 or 30 sheets whatever the size of the blanks are he said whenever we hit our minimum order quantity we get that minimum amount and our racks can always handle those quantities so we were able to speed up their process now when we call they have a skid of material waiting for us whenever we need it puleo added eric borman ceo of progressive metal manufacturing co warren mich said that steel went up as a percentage of cost for his company about 8 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017 as a result in 2019 the fabricator made it a major priority to examine material usage and yields progressive started with the high volume jobs and looked at ways to move to standardized nests where it could maximize sheet utilization because the company has plenty of repetitive orders borman said it has the luxury of cutting parts that may not be used right away but will be used for an upcoming order the push to maximize sheet use even if it results in increased work in process also will be watched closely in 2019 he added how do you create a culture of responsiveness during that same fabricator panel borman responded to a question about what technology he would focus on if he were designing a job shop for the future if i were designing a new shop the first thing i d work on would be the culture and the people he said he then used the example of a visit to trader joe s a high end grocer to illustrate his point on this particular day borman was standing in line and he noticed a person who was stocking the shelves walk over to an open register and announce this register is open that responsiveness is something that he would like to see more of at progressive metal if we could have a company that would act that way that people would dynamically go where they had to be because that s where the problem was and they solved the problem we would be 10 times more successful borman said jake wood the founder of team rubicon and a marine who served in both afghanistan and iraq told the crowd during his presentation take command of leadership that it s up to the leader to create the culture when done right the followers will mimic the leader s behavior wood said he saw this while in iraq during a firefight someone was shot and the squad wood was leading needed to get the injured marine to an extraction point that task was complicated by the need to run across an open field with enemy fire still active during his time with his men they had grown to trust his leadership and they weren t about to question the need to face enemy fire to get their comrade to safety when people feel they love they feel safe when people feel safe it unlocks something incredible when people feel safe they become courageous wood said in october 2009 wood left the military he formed team rubicon in january 2010 after the horrific earthquake that hit port au prince haiti at the time some relief workers were hesitant to enter haiti because of the difficulty getting there after the earthquake wood responded with military veterans and medical personnel and committed to entering the danger zone when others wouldn t as the team crossed over the artibonite river the natural border between the dominican republic and haiti the team of eight volunteers called themselves team rubicon in reference to the rubicon river in rome they wouldn t be turning back wood found his calling after that his group could help people in need while relying on the veterans who had been trained to respond and execute in times of great stress and in challenging conditions without being shot at today the organization has 103 000 volunteers in fact he knew what the organization s vision would be even in those very early days we want to build the best disaster response organization in the world wood said he called that vision integral to building an organization with the right culture he also referred to it as writing the final chapter first again the leader creates the environment where people feel safe to make courageous decisions wood said they then feel empowered to solve problems guided by the organizational vision and best practices learned from leadership they also aren t intimidated to hire people who may be more talented than they are with the right people in place and policies and processes that reinforced the shared values that support the vision a company can scale and feel confident that the culture has a good shot of surviving wood said it can be tough when an organization grows to more than 50 people but preparing a solid foundation of love and trust can make it happen he added for the leader of a small manufacturing company having that type of support is necessary if they are to keep their heads up and look beyond the production schedule for the day it s not easy but an empowered team makes it possible the next edition of the fabricator s leadership summit at the fma annual meeting is scheduled to be held at the hyatt regency hill country resort in san antonio texas march 3 5 2020 for more

health care joco sees hospital building boom while underserved areas of kansas city are ignored adventhealth is set to build an 85 bed hospital in a wealthy area of south overland park that already has four full service hospitals within 10 miles last month it announced plans to build yet another one a 200 bed hospital in lenexa just west of the interstate 435 loop also a well to do area adventhealth leaders said they were responding to demand from a growing part of the metro but there s another reason to build on the far edge of the area s wealthiest county by putting your hospitals beyond the outside of the ongoing growth or sprawl within a metro area you have eliminated most of the poor people said james dockins a professor at rockhurst university who studies health care management and while residents of lower income areas must do without he said johnson county patients may actually face higher health care bills because of the medical building boom there the announcements by adventhealth the nonprofit formerly known as shawnee mission health are just the latest expansions in an ongoing rush to claim or hold onto a slice of johnson county where large hospitals micro hospitals and free standing emergency rooms already crowd the map the university of kansas hospital olathe medical center st luke s health system and hca midwest health which owns hospitals throughout the kansas city area have also significantly expanded their operations there in recent years meanwhile large sections of wyandotte and jackson counties remain health care deserts deemed medically underserved by the federal government in other industries it wouldn t necessarily make sense to expand in a part of town that s already saturated while ignoring areas that have little to no competition but it makes sense for hospitals because in general the amount of money they make for a given procedure depends on who is paying adventhealth plans to break ground this fall on its 85 bed hospital at 165th street and antioch road sandwiched between the two wealthiest zip codes in the state of kansas 66224 where the median household income is 156 180 and 66221 where it s 149 461 dockins said that means a lot of working age high earners with private health insurance which pays better than medicare a government program for older americans and much better than medicaid or treating the uninsured patrick sallee the ceo of three vibrant health safety net clinics in wyandotte county said the hospitals are flocking to johnson county to try to capture more of those patients with private insurance rather than expanding in his county where more people who are uninsured or on medicaid would be coming through their doors it s not an equitable health care system he said but it s like that almost all over the country and it s not the hospitals fault i think they re doing what the business structure drives them to do sallee said in general i wish the structure was different the structure incentivizes the behavior and the behavior is to compete like hell for commercial patients that s worsening the inequality of health care access between the haves and have nots in kansas city there are now at least 15 emergency rooms in johnson county including two that are just for kids the same number as jackson and wyandotte counties combined there are 12 emergency rooms in jackson county including one that s just for kids and one that s just for military veterans a county that is larger in both population and square miles there are three in all of wyandotte county which typically ranks as the least healthy county in the metro area it s not all rosy for johnson county either dockins said emergency rooms are the most expensive place to get care and the number of them popping up in the county should raise questions about who s paying for all that health care infrastructure and whether it might be put to more efficient use elsewhere there is one place where the system is different maryland since the 1970s the state has had a unique all payer system in which a central state commission sets prices for all hospital services rather than insurers negotiating individually individual hospitals are paid different amounts to encourage competition but patients don t pay different amounts based on who insures them and the system also tries to account for the amount of uncompensated care each hospital provides to the uninsured bob atlas the president and ceo of the maryland hospital association said it s not perfect but it generally does make it easier for hospitals to operate in poorer areas whether rural or urban by having medicare and medicaid pay essentially the same as commercial payers hospitals are not if you will disadvantaged by being in a community with what we in the field would call a challenging payer mix atlas said some states have dabbled in similar models but the amount of money in the health care industry has changed dramatically since the 1970s and many hospitals now oppose all payer models because they like the freedom to negotiate with smaller groups of payers there s been no buzz about bringing all payer to kansas or missouri which means that at a time when several hospital systems in kansas city are expanding none of them are getting any closer to patients like michael brantley artist michael brantley of kansas city kansas is a prolific painter despite his illness he sits in front of a portrait he painted of jazz great ella fitzgerald tammy ljungblad tljungblad kcstar com brantley a kansas city kansas artist has been battling sarcoidosis an inflammatory condition that has caused him to at times lose his vision and his ability to move without pain transportation is an issue and at the moment right now i am borrowing my mother s car in order to even get back and forth to doctor appointments brantley said when the star interviewed him last month for another story i lost my car when i was sick and i haven t been able to make enough money to get another car if he has a car brantley can continue driving 20 minutes from his house near the quindaro neighborhood to the university of kansas hospital where he found a doctor who was willing to treat him at discounted rates when he was uninsured if he s forced to take the bus to his chemotherapy treatments the ride is one to two hours each way and requires at least one transfer he has no options closer to home there s nothing around here brantley said the build up within the last five years medical building projects in johnson county have included a 100 million expansion of the university of kansas hospital s indian creek campus at i 435 and nall avenue a half dozen micro hospitals and freestanding emergency rooms opened throughout johnson county by st luke s and hca midwest a 100 million expansion of olathe medical center adventhealth s bluhawk medical clinic in south overland park near where the new hospital will be built a 120 million expansion of hca midwest s overland park regional medical center smaller scale projects like a 36 million adventhealth outpatient clinic at college boulevard and metcalf avenue an 8 million pediatric center at overland park regional and st luke s mission farms primary care and specialty services clinic at i 435 and mission road more expansions still in the works like the adventhealth hospital in overland park and the one proposed for 87th street and renner boulevard in lenexa and a new rehabilitation institute at st luke s south hospital the hospital systems say they re simply trying to bring medical care closer to home we ve been building our physician network in south overland park adventhealth cfo karsten randolph said in a statement announcing the new hospital on 165th street it s important that we bring these providers closer to where their patients live and work and building a new hospital with the latest medical technology will allow them to care for more patients and provide more advanced health care services but brenda sharpe the president and ceo of the reach healthcare foundation said people who live in other parts of the kansas city area would love that sort of convenience too especially low income patients who are more likely to have transportation issues i don t begrudge the hospitals opening new facilities sharpe said i just wish they would open up new clinics too in areas of town that are perpetually underserved the federal government s health resources and services administration decides which areas of the country are designated medically underserved areas the agency defines as having too few primary care providers high infant mortality high poverty or a high elderly population medically underserved areas in kansas city according to the federal health resource services administration health resource services administration not one square mile of johnson county makes the list but a large swath of kansas city does and so does the northeast corner of wyandotte county around quindaro boulevard for the most part the only medical organizations building in those places are safety net clinics that are subsidized by donations and tax dollars the ymca teamed with truman medical center jackson county s safety net hospital to open a clinic at 3800 linwood blvd last year and southwest family health care is seeking 4 million in donations to expand its operations in quindaro and the rosedale neighborhood of kansas city kansas the hca midwest hospitals which include overland park regional and menorah medical center are for profit enterprises so are three kansas city area hospitals owned by prime healthcare st joseph medical center st mary s medical center in blue springs and providence medical center in kansas city kansas but kansas city s other major health systems are nonprofits or public hospitals that in exchange for tax breaks are legally bound to work for the public good as well as for money sharpe whose organization works to improve health care access in underserved areas said the nonprofit hospitals are doing good work in their communities but some parts of the metro are being left behind johnson county regularly ranks as the healthiest in kansas in the robert wood johnson foundation s annual analysis wyandotte county is always near the bottom jackson county is usually ranked near the middle of missouri s 115 counties while platte and clay counties are near the top many factors create those disparities and experts generally agree that things like poverty and lifestyle weigh heavier than the number of nearby doctors and hospitals but sharpe said it would still make sense for the area s leading medical providers to build where people are least healthy in an ideal world if we were really looking at population health outcomes we d be locating primary care and specialty care resources in communities that have the highest rates of poverty and the lowest rates of access to those services sharpe said instead much of the new building is in overland park which the consumer website wallethub recently ranked no 1 for health care among the 170 largest cities in america new medical facilities would also bring a financial boost to underserved areas that would help with some of the socioeconomic factors contributing to poor health sharpe said the new adventhealth hospital in south johnson county for example is projected to create 200 full time jobs advocates say expanding medicaid would make underserved communities more attractive health care markets medicaid payment rates are low compared to other insurance but still usually a better return on investment than treating uninsured patients kansas and missouri are two of 14 states that have so far declined expansion which is a feature of the affordable care act commonly called obamacare it would extend medicaid coverage to everyone who makes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line or about 35 000 a year for a family of four the federal government picks up 90 percent of the cost in the absence of expansion missouri and kansas have some of the nation s tightest medicaid eligibility restrictions in both states nearly everyone who qualifies is either a child a frail elderly person a pregnant woman or a person with a disability faisal khan the ceo of the samuel u rodgers health center safety net clinics in missouri said that means it s relatively easy to link low income patients with pediatric specialists or prenatal care at area hospitals because medicaid usually covers it faisal khan is ceo of samuel u rodgers health center a safety net clinic that provides primary care to kansas city s underserved communities andy marso amarso kcstar com but when an uninsured adult who s not pregnant needs an mri or surgery that gets a bit complicated his organization has a partnership with north kansas city hospital for treating residents of clay county and truman medical center has agreed to treat all jackson county residents regardless of their ability to pay in exchange for a taxpayer subsidy the folks at truman really are committed to making this work and they do make every effort to take care of everybody we send over khan said truman also provides an on demand transportation system for some of its patients there s nothing like that for low income people who need hospital care in wyandotte county sallee of vibrant health has an agreement with a company called circulation to get patients to and from its safety net clinics using the ride sharing app lyft but transportation becomes an issue when they need to be referred for hospital care sallee said his clinics patients could benefit from having things like medical imaging or surgical centers closer to home but there s not the resources to make that happen that s despite having the region s largest medical center the university of kansas hospital headquartered at the southeastern edge of the county steven stites the chief medical officer for ku hospital said ku has invested far more in wyandotte county than any other health system from expanding its main campus on rainbow boulevard to renovating an aging federal building downtown into a mental health center to staffing a clinic inside wyandotte high school and helping get vibrant health off the ground but academic medical centers run on thin margins he said and none of those investments would be possible if ku weren t also joining the competition for suburbia when you try to do good work in an underserved area you ve got to balance it against an area that s got mostly insured patients stites said for us on the kansas side that s johnson county ku hospital hasn t gotten any government payments since it moved from state control to a hospital authority model more than 20 years ago although its accompanying medical school still gets state money stites said that means ku has to compete in johnson county like everybody else or risk going the way of bethany medical center which closed in 2001 after more than a century of operation in the heart of kansas city kansas you can t have a strategy of only existing in a relatively poor county stites said because you re not going to be able to keep the doors open unless you have tremendous support from the county or the state a la truman medical center unless someone challenges their tax exempt status though there s nothing legally binding ku or any of the other hospitals to use the money they make treating commercially insured patients to ensure everyone else has access and there is no clear path to medical care for patients who can t afford it like there is in jackson county with truman an organization called wyjo care recruits doctors to donate some of their time to treating uninsured people in wyandotte and johnson counties if the hospitals where they work agree to it sallee said ku and st luke s both step up to treat vibrant health s patients but other advocates for low income residents said they ve talked to people who have been turned away there have been places like ku where if someone needs to have surgery or get something serious done they just won t accept them said molly moffett of the community health council of wyandotte county who pays having lower percentages of uninsured people has helped make johnson county the winner in the medical building boom but dockins the rockhurst professor said all of that buildup costs money and sustaining it year over year takes even more hospitals have to pay for staff electricity janitorial services and other costs even if they re not full and with the exception of times like last year s bad flu season they re not usually full the new adventhealth hospital in overland park will add almost 100 beds to an area that already has hundreds in two full service hospitals about five miles to the north menorah medical center and st luke s south one about 10 miles to the west olathe medical center and one about 10 miles to the northeast st joseph medical center meanwhile government programs and private sector health insurers are slowly trying to move away from the traditional model of paying by the test procedure or night s stay and instead bundle payments to reward providers who keep people out of the hospital why would you build inpatient beds when we see annually ongoing migration toward outpatient services and away from inpatient dockins said it seems to me to be a pretty nonsensical approach to health care strategic planning to be building out all these beds so close to each other but dockins said adventhealth had a compelling reason to expand competitors building around its main campus on 75th street in merriam that hospital formerly called shawnee mission medical center is now bracketed between an hca midwest free standing er 2 5 miles northwest and a st luke s micro hospital about a mile straight east those small facilities don t offer all the services adventhealth does but dockins said they re located on major traffic arteries to divert high value patients who are having emergencies those patients can get stabilized at the small facility then referred to the mother ship hospital like st luke s on the country club plaza or overland park regional for whatever followup tests or procedures they need it s more infrastructure but not more efficiency what this typically leads to is a significant increase in overall costs for a particular population but not necessarily an increase in overall quality of care dockins said in a normal market more competition in a geographic area should drive down prices for consumers but hospital care is not a normal market dockins said people don t shop around during medical emergencies and even when it s not an emergency hospital pricing is so opaque shopping around is nearly impossible the federal government recently required all hospitals that participate in medicare to post price lists on their websites but the lists can be hard to find and they re technical enough that it s hard for non medical people to decode them they also break down some procedures into many separate components each with their own price listing and they don t account for the different prices each insurance company has negotiated we still don t have any clue when we go into any of these hospitals in overland park what the price is going to be dockins said it s totally camouflaged so there s no way the normal market forces can enter play cause nobody has a clue what the bill is going to be until two or three weeks after they leave the hospital so hospital prices are set more by what they need to charge to maintain and expand their operations and what insurance companies will allow there s evidence nationally that insurance companies are allowing higher costs and just passing them on to their customers a study by the healthcare cost and utilization project found that costs for inpatient hospital stays increased by 13 percent adjusted for inflation between 2005 and 2014 meanwhile the average deductible for private health insurance plans rose from 303 to more than 1 200 between 2006 and 2016 according to the kaiser family foundation in short dockins said people in johnson county are subsidizing an inefficient hospital system that is overbuilt in some areas and underbuilt in others the proliferation of emergency rooms freestanding and otherwise in johnson county encourages residents to get care in the most expensive setting possible when brian levinson an overland park resident who works in marketing was bit by a cat last year he went to the emergency room at st luke s south near his house where he was given a tetanus shot and antibiotics several weeks later he got a bill for almost 1 500 with most of it going to pay for the er visit fee not the medicine levinson had private insurance through blue cross and blue shield of kansas city but he had a high deductible so his out of pocket share of the bill was still more than 1 000 until he called a st luke s executive to complain and got the bill whittled down levinson also said that last year he took his son to children s mercy s blue valley urgent care clinic and was unexpectedly charged extra because the clinic used something called provider based billing that allows hospitals to charge facility fees even for care that was provided outside of the hospital itself medicare stopped paying those fees by federal law in 2015 but the children s mercy clinic was grandfathered in certainly i m very appreciative of the access to good health care levinson said i just think the health care providers particularly nonprofit systems that are asking the community for support should be transparent about their costs and should be charging reasonable amounts for the services they provide st luke s and children s mercy didn t respond to requests for comment levinson said he s glad he doesn t live in rural areas where hospitals are closing but with three hospitals already within a few miles of his house he wishes more health systems in johnson county were investing in things like urgent care without extra fees rather than building more ers the federal government used to require states to make hospitals prove a need for a major expansion in a given area to prevent inflated prices due to excess capacity that mandate was repealed in the 1980s leaving it up to the states whether to keep their so called certificate of need laws kansas decided not to which dockins said is one reason the buildup in johnson county continues unabated but khan of the samuel u rodgers health center said such laws alone can t close the disparities missouri still has one he said but it hasn t stopped the same sort of medical building boom in the suburbs of st louis the city where he lived and worked until last year until the health care system changes at a national level he said hospitals will keep ignoring low income neighborhoods to seek out the areas with the most commercially insured patients everybody s sort of trying to feed from the same trough as it were this story was originally published may 19 2019 5 00

guest garry rayno indepthnh org concord oral arguments on the northern pass transmission project before the supreme court last week was like a dysfunctional family reunion lawyers from all sides shook hands talked and joked as did intervenors and advocates pro and con before the justices took their seats with the exception of the justices most people in the room spent the spring summer fall and into winter of 2017 in the building at the end of donovan street in concord where 70 adjudicative hearings were held before the site evaluation committee there were people from the north country the white mountains the not so far north country as well as the concord area down to deerfield with attorneys representing towns and cities organizations like the society for the protection of new hampshire forests and the counsel for the public as well as eversource billable hours during those hearings must have been astronomical the developer s attorney wilber glahn reiterated what eversource has maintained since the site evaluation committee turned down the project in february 2018 setting in motion a series of requests and responses that brought everyone together at the new hampshire supreme court on wednesday glahn argued the sec should have continued deliberations after finding developers failed to meet the second of four criteria needed to grant a permit and if they had he maintained the benefits of the 1 6 billion 192 mile 1 090 megawatt transmission line to transport hydro quebec electricity to massachusetts would have been obvious and would outweigh all the adverse impacts and glahn argued regulators failed to follow statutes and their own rules in turning down the project while the counsel for the public and lawyers for intervenors opposed to the project argued the sec got it right and the decision should stand the lawyers were repeatedly questioned by the five justices with some questions coming before the attorneys had barely begun their presentations it was a more subdued and cerebral battle than the ones at the end of donovan street and much shorter the lengthy battles between supporters and opponents in quasi courtroom settings over transmission lines have moved from the granite state to the pine tree state where central maine power is embroiled in a pitched dispute with opponents over construction of a 1 billion 145 mile corridor through western maine to bring that same hydro quebec electricity to massachusetts while wednesday at the supreme court may have been like a family reunion it also was a reminder of how much the electric industry has changed since the project was first proposed in 2010 and since the sec turned down the application a little over a year ago when it was proposed importing hydro generated energy was a slam dunk financially due to the soaring costs of natural gas used to generate the majority of new england s electricity states were beginning to set modest renewable energy goals and the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi was still new soon however fracking dropped the price of natural gas significantly along with electric rates and states began increasing their renewable energy goals to combat global warming and lingering air pollution federal subsidies made wind farms tax havens for foreign energy companies and hydro quebec was working on a new project to produce more renewable electricity hoping to sell it to the northeast to quench the region s thirst for clean energy other transmission lines were proposed to bring canadian hydro power south with the 1 200 megawatt clean energy massachusetts contract the prize for the winner along with new hampshire and maine hydro quebec power was the driver behind a tdi new england project running cable under lake champlain connecting to the new england grid in ludlow vermont new england clean power connect has all its needed permits but has yet to begin construction tdi new england is a wholly owned subsidiary of blackstone one of the world s largest financial and investment firms if easy money were to be made importing canadian hydro power construction of new england clean power connect would have begun long ago another line was proposed in existing utility corridors along the connecticut river in vermont through new hampshire and into the boston energy pool backed by national grid and others but has all but disappeared today ironically new england and other northeastern states have upped their goals for renewable and clean power use which you would think would accelerate interest in large scale hydro power from the north while there is still interest in the 2 000 megawatts or more of available hydro quebec electricity there is growing interest in large scale municipal and institutional solar projects and large off shore wind farms lawmakers have made it more economically feasible to generate your own electricity with advances in net metering programs and increasing the amount of self generated electricity someone may use to offset utility power needed when the sun doesn t shine or the wind doesn t blow locally generated electricity or what is called distributed energy is growing in popularity as the hardware prices come down and the payback is shortened micro grids and advances in battery storage continue the push and are the next explosion about to happen in the electric industry the kinks and regulations are being discussed by lawmakers utility commissions utilities and generators and some see a solution in the next few years that will make another significant change in the electric utility industry the push however is not universal some stakeholders like the business and industry association in new hampshire are not convinced the cutting edge technology will not drive up costs for their members but that does not stop the innovators from thinking outside the box envisioning a brave new world of energy generation transmission storage efficiency and usage in the distant past everyone believed every home would have its own little nuclear plant to provide the electricity needed to be self sufficient and charge cars that flew obviously that is not where the electric industry is going today but it is going local the question remains in a place like new england with its often dreary weather with days on end without sun like the last two months and widely varying winds can local generation produce enough electricity to power a home or a community economically the need for a reliable or base source will always be there but will the need for large high voltage transmission lines from northern pass s public inception to last week s oral arguments before the supreme court has been a decade and tens of millions of dollars of expenses for the company is it worth going through that again only eversource and hydro quebec can answer that but thousands of folks along the proposed route want the company to know the answer should be no and they reminded everyone of that as they stood outside the supreme court last week holding their signs distant dome by veteran journalist garry rayno explores a broader perspective on the state house and state
