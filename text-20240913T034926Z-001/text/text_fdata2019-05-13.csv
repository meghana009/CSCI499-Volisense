overview the end of the tariff truce between the us and china has discombobulated investors they had been repeatedly that a deal was close and there had even been talk at the us treasury about where trump and xi should meet to sign the agreement now china was given around a month to capitulate to us demands or face a 25 tariff on their remaining exports to the us the lack of an immediate formal response retaliation by china and indications that talks will resume at some point helped the s p 500 reverse higher ahead of the weekend but a pessimistic reading of events dominates today and equities markets are tumbling again msci asia pacific index lost 3 6 last week and most of the major markets shanghai south korea taiwan and singapore were off over 1 today europe s dow jones stoxx 600 fell around 0 7 in the morning session after its shed 3 4 last week the s p 500 slid 2 2 last week and is off around 1 25 in electronic trading bonds are rallying the us 10 year yield is off five basis points to just above 2 40 the low from the end of march was about 2 33 the benchmark 10 year german bund is off a few basis points minus 6 bp to push its yield below the 10 year jgb italian and greek bonds are exceptions to the push lower in yields the dollar enjoys a firmer bias against most of the world s currencies today the japanese yen and swiss franc are proving most resilient while among the majors the dollar and scandi blocks are the heaviest declines in the turkish lira and south african rand are pacing the emerging market currency decline asia pacific china has not specified its retaliatory measures and most observers seem to still be expecting a formal announcement in near term though we are less convinced on the one hand the us and many outside observers have been critical of china for the apparent lack of the rule of law yet somehow the reluctance of china to change its laws when the trump administration is seeking an executive agreement which is a weak form in the us was the supposed trigger for the collapse it appears china insisted that all trump tariffs are lifted with the agreement and this was not acceptable to the us note that mexico and canada are demanding along similar lines that the steel and aluminum tariffs are lifted before the parliaments approve the new nafta deal the process by which the us can impose a 25 tariff on the remainder of chinese goods takes several weeks details expected later today china was given a month to reach an agreement no new meetings have been announced since the last meeting was in the us lighthizer and mnuchin have been invited to beijing with no specific date reported however as economic adviser kudlow was admitting on television yesterday that indeed american businesses and consumers pay the tariff he also pointed to the g20 meeting at the end of next month in japan as a potential meeting between trump and xi initially the meeting was touted as a venue to sign the agreement and now it may be needed to overcome the deadlock separately some suspect that kudlow s contradiction of trump s claim that china is paying for the tariff is a sign that he may leave the administration this summer meanwhile support for japan s prime minister abe has risen according to the latest polls a nikkei survey put the government s support at 55 up seven percentage points since march a jnn tv poll found a four point gain in the past month to nearly 57 5 however the government s economic plans are less appreciated the nikkei survey found 57 opposed to the sales tax increase planned for october the upper house of the japanese diet faces an election in july and there is some talk that abe may take advantage of the polls and the weak opposition to dissolve the lower house and hold joint elections the government is reluctant to delay the sales tax increase again but if there are to be joint elections a delay is likely australia s elections are on may 18 the latest polls put the opposition labor ahead of the governing liberal national coalition at 51 49 it is statistically a dead heat but the government is widely seen as lagging prime minister morrison s last minute gambit to lower the downpayment needed for first time homebuyers from 20 to 5 may not enough to put the government ahead labor has been out of power for six years and is favored to secure a majority the dollar has been confined to about a quarter of a yen below jpy109 85 there is a 360 mln option at jpy109 65 and an option at jpy110 00 for around 380 mln that will be cut today in the last two sessions the dollar found bids near jpy109 50 similarly it has been blocked near jpy110 10 the australian dollar seems to build a shelf near 0 6965 however it continues to trade heavily a close above 0 7020 would lift the tone the dollar rose about 0 75 against the chinese yuan and closed the local session near cny6 8735 it appears to be the biggest move since last october some observers think chinese officials will depreciate the currency to offset the impact of the tariffs others see mostly normal market forces at work weighing on the yuan in the risk off environment like other em assets a decline in interest rates and an expected hit on the economy we have understood chinese officials to sanction a cny6 70 to cny7 0 range but that was before the escalation of the trade conflict a test may be required to renew official guidance europe the cross party talks between the uk government and the labour party do not appear to amount to very much yet but without a clear alternative the talks are set to continue a comres poll out over the weekend shows almost as many approve of revoking article 50 and remaining in the eu 51 as favor a second referendum 47 approve ar referendum between may s deal and remaining in the eu and 50 approve a second referendum between leave and remain may lost the tory majority in parliament she led the party to a drubbing of historic proportions in the recent local elections the polls suggest the conservative party will suffer in the eu parliament election to a new political party business led by farage the backbenchers are increasingly restive may to expect to meet with the 1922 committee later in the week which wants may to step down shortly political tensions are on the rise in italy there has been such talk before but it was easier to dismiss the league which has acted as the senior member of the coalition is now seeing its support in the polls slip ahead of the eu parliament election later this month moreover one of league leader salvini s allies is caught up in a corruption scandal and salvini himself appears to have been caught in a power grab for shipping in italian waters ostensibly as a way to address the refugee flow encroaching on the mandate of a 5 star minister also the arranging of a private sector bailout of a troubled lender carige bank failed and unless an alternative is found shortly nationalization may be necessary which the league is loath to do there continue to be murmurings that salvini may precipitate a crisis to call for elections join forces with its old ally in berlusconi s forza italia to form a new center right government the euro is trading quietly within the ranges seen before the weekend indeed the euro has been confined to about 10 ticks on either side of 1 1230 there is a billion euro option at 1 12 that expires today only a move above 1 1250 1 1260 is meaningful sterling has also been confined to narrow ranges seen at the end of last week the topside may be reinforced by the gbp600 mln option struck at 1 3040 that expires today north america the us economic calendar is light until the middle of the week when both retail sales and industrial output will be reported as of may 9 the atlanta fed says the q2 gdp is tracking 1 6 a report over the weekend claimed that trump s calls for the fed to cut rates were seen in beijing as a signal that the president is worried about the us economy what may have been misunderstood is that trump has wanted easier monetary policy since almost his first day in office and does not reflect a short term economic assessment canada reported spectacular employment data before the weekend the economy less than a tenth the size of the us added over 100k jobs nearly three quarters of which were full time positions the participation rate increased and unemployment fell the hourly rate for permanent workers unexpectedly accelerated to 2 6 from 2 3 canada reports april cpi figures in the middle of the week it is expected to firm slightly the macro story and a decline in the discount of canadian rates relative to the us should lend support to the canadian dollar however the risk off sentiment seems to be curbing the enthusiasm for the loonie which is the best performer within the dollar bloc mexico s central bank meets thursday and is widely expected to keep the overnight rate at the lofty 8 25 the peso is under pressure the greenback looks poised to challenge last week s highs near mxn19 32 but the more important cap is seen by the end of march high of roughly mxn19 50 disclaimer
by alasdair macleod via mises wire behind the huawei story we must not forget there is a wider financial war being waged by america against china and russia stories about china s banks being short of dollars are incorrect the shortage is of inward capital flows to support the us government s budget deficit by attracting those global portfolio flows instead china s belt and road initiative threatens us government finances so the financial war and associated disinformation can be expected to escalate hong kong is likely to be in the firing line due to its role in providing china with access to international finance hong kong in trouble last week the wall street journal published an article claiming china s banks are running out of dollars clearly this is untrue china s banks can acquire dollars any time they want either by selling other foreign currencies in the market or by selling renminbi to the people s bank they have their dollar position because they choose to have it and furthermore all commercial banks use derivatives which are effectively off balance sheet exposure furthermore with the us running a substantial trade deficit with china dollars are flooding in all the time following the wsj article various other commentators have come up with similar stories how convenient it seems for the us government to see these bearish stories about china just when they need to ramp up inward portfolio flows to finance the budget deficit there is anyway a general antipathy among american investors to the china story so we should not be surprised to see the china bears restating their case one leading china bear at least by reputation for his investment shrewdness is kyle bass of hayman capital management according to zero hedge he has written his first investment letter in three years saying of hong kong today newly emergent economic and political risks threaten hong kong s decades of stability these risks are so large they merit immediate attention on both fronts if only it were so simple it is time to put the alternative case hong kong is important because china uses hong kong and london to avoid being dependent on the us banking system for international finances and that s why the us s deep state want to nail hong kong lop sided analysis bass is correct in pointing out the hong kong property market appears highly geared and that property prices for office residential and retail sectors have rocketed since the 2003 trough to a large extent it has been the inevitable consequence of the currency board link to the us dollar which broadly transfers the fed s inflationary monetary policy to hong kong s more dynamic economy bass s description of the relationship between the banks the way they finance themselves and property collateral is reminiscent of the factors that led to the secondary banking crisis in the uk in late 1973 empirical evidence appears to be firmly on bass s side except that is for a significant difference between events such as the uk s secondary banking crisis and virtually every other property crisis hong kong is a truly international center and the banks role in property transactions is as currency facilitator rather than lender in 2017 hong kong was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment substantially property after the us and china fdi inflows rose by 104bn to total nearly 2 trillion largest investors were china followed by corporate money channeled through offshore centers so yes hong kong banks will be hurt by a property crisis but not as much as bass implies it is foreign and chinese banks that have much of the property as collateral it is not the hong kong banks that have fueled the property boom with domestic credit but foreign money bass fails to mention that a collapse in property prices and the banking system is unlikely to be confined to hong kong central banks have made significant progress in ensuring all banking systems are tied into the same credit cycle unwittingly they have simply guaranteed that the next credit crisis will hit everyone at the same time it won t be just hong kong but the eu japan britain and america everyone will be in difficulty to a greater or lesser extent interestingly the lehman crisis which occurred after hong kong property prices had already doubled from 2003 caused strong inflows to develop driving the hong kong dollar to the top of its peg the situation appears to be similar today with us outward investment at low levels but near record levels of foreign ownership of dollar assets despite hong kong s foreign direct investment standing at 2 trillion the prospect of capital repatriation to hong kong should not be ignored we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us probably the most important claim in bass s letter is over the future of the currency peg operated by the hong kong monetary authority hkma he claims that the aggregate balance which is a line item in the hkma s balance sheet is the equivalent of the us fed s excess reserves and that once depleted the pressure on the currency board will become untenable and the peg will break the aggregate balance on the hkma s balance sheet has declined significantly over the last year from hk 180bn to hk 54 4bn currently the decision about changes in aggregate balances comes from the banks themselves and for this reason they are commonly taken to reflect capital flows into and out of the hong kong dollar this is different from aggregate balances reflecting actual pressures on the peg as suggested by bass the hkma maintains a us dollar coverage of 105 112 5 of base money currently about 110 and has further unallocated dollar reserves if necessary the peg is maintained by the hkma varying its base money not just by managing a base lending rate giving a spread over the fed s fund rate not just by influencing the commercial banks aggregate balances but by addressing the three other components that make up the monetary base these are certificates of indebtedness government notes and coins in circulation and exchange fund bills and notes efbns in practice it is the efbns in conjunction with the aggregate balances that are used to adjust the monetary base and keep the currency secured in the convertibility zone of 7 75 and 7 85 to the us dollar in maintaining the peg the hkma prioritizes maintaining it over managing the money supply there is little doubt this goes against the grain of mainstream western economists who believe inflation good deflation bad over the last year base money in hong kong contracted from hk 1 695bn to hk1 635bn does this worry the hkma not at all how the chinese will act in the circumstances of a new global credit crisis is yet to be seen but we should bear in mind that they are probably less keynesian in their approach to economics and finance than westerners admittedly they have freely used credit expansion to finance economic development but theirs is a mercantilist approach which differs significantly from ours we simply impoverish our factors of production through wealth transfer by monetary inflation we think this can be offset by fueling financial speculation and asset inflation china enhances her production and innovation by generating personal savings wealth is created by and linked more directly to production the objectives and effects of monetary and credit inflation between china s application of it and the way we do things in the west are dissimilar and it is a common mistake to ignore these differences the threat to china s ability to manage its affairs in a credit crisis is significantly less than the threat to western welfare dependent nations whose governments are highly indebted while china s is not china is sure to see the financial and monetary stability of hong kong as being vital to the mainland s interests apart from the bank of china s hong kong subsidiary being the second largest issuer of bank notes the peoples bank itself maintains reserve balances in hong kong dollars which in the circumstances kyle bass believes likely they can increase to support the hkma s management of the currency peg conclusions it is a mistake to think the hong kong property market is as much of a systemic danger as it first appears expectations of a devaluation of the peg appear to be wishful thinking by the bears far more important are the consequences of the cyber and financial war being pursued against china and russia its close ally by the american deep state under president trump it was accelerated by his trade tariff policies which are fundamentally an attack on china s economy china will be a hard nut to crack and the effect of america s trade protectionism has been to trigger a diminution in international trade which is now becoming apparent the negative effects on the american economy appear to be being underestimated the attempt to destroy huawei s 5g global ambitions is both the current and most visible part of an undeclared cyber and financial war trade protectionism was only a step along the way the financial war is now escalating with the global economy facing at least a significant recession almost certain to trigger an overdue credit crisis the chinese have long been on a financial war footing as shown by qiao liang s analysis of how america needs global portfolio flows and what they are prepared to do to attract them western thinking that the chinese and their russian allies are vulnerable to american hegemony has been disproved time and again financial analysts consistently fail to understand the chinese are not muppets china will not be provoked and by standing firm they are sure to protect hong kong and get on with diverting investment flows from a failing us economy into its belt and road initiative this will force a financial crisis on the americans of their own making at least that s how china has always seen it and they see no need for their passive financial war strategy to change
the tribulations playing out under the disintegrating roofs of the poor are a predictable dimension of macri s turn away from left wing populism he vowed to shrink argentina s monumental deficits by diminishing the largess of the state the trouble is that argentines have yet to collect on the other element the president promised the economic revival that was supposed to follow the pain former president cristina fernandez de kirchner whose economic policies further propelled the country into recession photo marcos brindicci macri s supporters heralded his 2015 election as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a country with a well earned reputation for histrionics he would cease the reckless spending that had brought argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts eight times sober minded austerity would win the trust of international financiers bringing investment that would yield jobs and fresh opportunities but as macri seeks re election this year argentines increasingly lament that they are absorbing all strife and no progress even businesses that have benefited from his reforms complain that he has botched the execution leaving the nation to confront the same concoction of misery that has plagued it for decades advertisement the economy is contracting inflation is running above 50 per cent and joblessness is stuck above 9 per cent poverty afflicts a third of the population and the figure is climbing far beyond this country of 44 million people macri s tenure is testing ideas that will shape economic policy in an age of recrimination over widening inequality his presidency was supposed to offer an escape from the wreckage of profligate spending while laying down an alternative path for countries grappling with the worldwide rise of populism now his presidency threatens to become a gateway back to populism as the october election approaches macri is contending with the growing prospect of a challenge from the president he succeeded cristina fernández who faces a series of criminal indictments for corruption buenos aires long held the title of the most cosmopolitan city in south america its economic chaos has led to it losing that title to other contenders such as sao paulo santiago and bogota ente turismo her unbridled spending helped deliver the crisis that macri inherited her return would resonate as a rebuke of his market oriented reforms while potentially yanking argentina back to its accustomed preserve left wing populism in uncomfortable proximity to insolvency advertisement the argentine peso lost half its value against the dollar last year prompting the central bank to lift interest rates to a commerce suffocating level above 60 per cent argentina was forced to secure a us57 billion 81 5 billion rescue from the international monetary fund imf a profound indignity given that the fund is widely despised here for the austerity it imposed in the late 1990s turning an economic downturn into a depression for macri time does not appear to be in abundant supply the spending cuts he delivered hit the populace immediately the promised benefits of his reforms a stable currency tamer inflation fresh investment and jobs could take years to materialize leaving argentines angry and yearning for the past in much of south america left wing governments have taken power in recent decades as an angry corrective to dogmatic prescriptions from washington where the treasury and the imf have focused on the confidence of global investors as the key to development left wing populism has aimed to redistribute the gains from the wealthy to everyone else it has aided the poor while generating its own woes corruption and depression in brazil runaway inflation and financial ruin in argentina in venezuela uninhibited spending has turned the country with the world s largest proven oil reserves into a land where children starve macri sold his administration as an evolved form of governance for these times a crucial dose of market forces tempered by social programs in the most generous reading the medicine has yet to take effect but in the view of beleaguered argentines the country has merely slipped back into the rut that has framed national life for as long as most people can remember advertisement we live patching things up said roberto nicoli 62 who runs a silverware company in the suburbs of buenos aires a region home to almost half the country s population we never fix things i always say whenever we start doing better i will start getting ready for the next crisis cultivating wealth like many argentine farmers roque tropini is inclined to discuss the present by telling stories about the past a century ago argentina was among the wealthiest nations on earth to tropini that status resulted from the backbreaking labor of pioneers like his grandfather who arrived in the state of entre rios from his native italy and turned the land into prosperity one afternoon tropini 69 drives past the brick flour mill that his grandfather erected in 1920 next to what was then a lonely stop on a new railroad he idled in front of the towering church that his grandfather constructed in the town that grew around the mill viale he named it santa ana after the cathedral in his hometown in northern italy he drove out to his fields where golden sunshine illuminated rows of soybeans stretching to the horizon a combine rolled across the land harvesting a crop mostly destined for china advertisement without his family s exertions tropini maintains viale would be a blank spot on the map if only the story ended there he says but history delivered the populists who have run argentina for most of his adult life in the beginning there was juan domingo perón the charismatic army general who was president from 1946 to 1955 and then again from 1973 to 1974 he employed an authoritarian hand and muscular state power to champion the poor he and his wife eva duarte widely known by her nickname evita would dominate political life long after they died inspiring politicians across the ideological spectrum to claim their mantle among the most ardent peronists were néstor kirchner the president from 2003 to 2007 and his wife cristina fernández who took office in 2007 remaining until macri was elected in 2015 their version of peronism what became known as kirchnerism was decidedly left wing disdaining global trade as a malevolent force they expanded cash grants to the poor and imposed taxes on farm exports in a bid to keep argentine food prices low as the country s farmers tell it kirchnerism is just a fancy term for the confiscation of their wealth and the scattering of the spoils to the unproductive masses they point to fernández s 35 per cent tax on soybean exports advertisement we had a saying tropini says for every three trucks that went to the port one was for christina kirchner given all that tropini cheered the arrival of new president macri s administration promised to modernise government while rebuilding argentina s standing among international investors the cosmopolitan english speaking technocrats who filled his government relished their role as the antidote to the destructive forces sweeping the continent we are a country that is fighting to get away from a legacy of populism that has failed marcos peña macri s chief of cabinet ministers says in a recent interview we embrace that idea of showing the region and the world but especially argentines that with a more open society with a more open political system with a more open economy we can do better than with a closed populist statist culture among the first things the new president announced was a gradual reduction in export taxes advertisement you could breathe finally tropini the farmer says he was free of the kirchners yet stuck with nature floods in 2016 wiped out more than half his crops a drought last year wreaked even more havoc this harvest this year he says is a gift from god but if the heavens are now cooperating and if the people running buenos aires represent change tropini is critical of macri s failure to overcome the economic crisis a weaker currency makes argentine soybeans more competitive but it also increases the cost of the diesel fuel tropini needs to run his machinery high interest rates make it impossible for him to buy another combine which would allow him to expand his farm in september faced with a plunge in government revenues macri reinstated some export taxes advertisement that money goes to pay for social programs for people who aren t working tropini grouses it goes to support laziness a lot of people got used to not working during peronism there s been so many years of taking away my production don t take all my profit leave some for me what went wrong why the economy remains moribund is the subject of a debate that could determine whether macri gains additional time or whether argentina veers back to populism economists are emphatic that argentina s problems were so enormous that any administration would have faced grave difficulty fernández had bequeathed an unmitigated shambles a budget deficit roughly 8 per cent of the country s annual economic output according to the government data collection had been haphazard and subject to political manipulation making it difficult merely to divine the extent of the crisis the government had long operated like a benefactor to the masses disdaining budget math as a right wing conspiracy macri was the spreadsheet wielding killjoy who was halting the festivities cognizant that more spending courted hyperinflation advertisement the president was very conscious from the first day that he had to go as quickly as possible says peña the chief of cabinet ministers when you re a broke and broken country you have to build a shock in terms of credibility in the first years of macri s administration the government lifted controls on the value of the peso while relaxing export taxes the masters of international finance delivered a surge of investment the economy expanded by nearly 3 per cent in 2017 and then accelerated in the first months of last year but as investors grew wary of argentina s deficits they fled sending the peso plunging and inflation soaring as the rout continued last year the central bank mounted a futile effort to support the currency selling its stash of dollars to try to halt the peso s descent as the reserves dwindled investors absorbed the spectacle of a government failing to restore order the exodus of money intensified and another potential default loomed leading a chastened macri to accept a rescue from the dreaded imf some people accuse the macri administration of a cowardly pursuit of gradualism cutting spending too slowly in a fruitless effort to avoid enraging the masses argentina sold us100 billion in government bonds during macri s first 2 1 2 years in office exploiting its newfound favour with the international finance set the cash allowed the government to maintain some social programs everybody wants to lend you money so why should you be so cheap says fausto spotorno the chief economist at orlando j ferreres associates a consulting firm in buenos aires they believed they could postpone the crisis and gradually get out of it advertisement among the most consequential errors was the government s decision to include argentina s central bank in a december 2017 announcement that it was raising its inflation target the markets took that as a signal that the government was surrendering its war on inflation while opting for a traditional gambit printing money rather than cutting spending it became clearly a symbol of the idea that we had undermined the independence of the central bank peña the chief of cabinet ministers acknowledges other people accuse macri of failing to set realistic expectations he insisted that he could easily conquer inflation while also reducing subsidies which lifted prices for key commodities like electricity in any event the economy is a mess and business is anxious people are afraid says nicoli owner of the silverware company prinox llc which was started by his grandfather in 1942 the government insists that better days are ahead the spending cuts have dropped the budget deficit to a manageable 3 per cent of annual economic output argentina is again integrated into the global economy we haven t improved but the foundations of the economy and society are much healthier said miguel braun secretary of economic policy at the treasury ministry argentina is in a better place to generate a couple of decades of growth at the silverware factory nicoli scoffs that s only possible through magic and no one believes them he says this is the worst moment and i think it s going to get worse

trading guide for week beginning may 13 2019 resistance may cap upside in sbi sbi 308 05 sbi tumbled over 5 per cent intra week breaking below the key support level of 302 however it clawed back from the low of 292 2 recovering almost all the loss after the fourth quarter results announcement on friday though the weekly candle gives a mixed signal the daily chart is relatively positive a key support is at 302 which can limit the downside resistance is at 313 a strong break above it can take the stock higher to 321 322 a pull back from 322 can trigger a corrective fall to 312 but a strong break above 322 will increase the likelihood of the stock rallying to 330 335 given the weakness in the broader markets such a strong rally looks less probable so the upside is likely to be limited to 322 at the moment on the other hand if sbi fails to breach the immediate resistance level of 313 a fall to 302 or even 297 is possible as such the impact of friday s results will be short lived and the overall negative sentiment in the market could weigh on the stock in that case sbi can fall to 290 and 287 uptrend in itc under threat itc 297 7 itc moved up in the initial part of the week but failed to sustain higher the uptrend that has been in place since late february seems to be under threat a key support is at 295 which is likely to be tested in the near term the stock has to hold above this support in order to keep the sentiment positive a break below 295 can drag the stock initially lower to 288 287 a further break below 287 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards 280 278 such a fall to 280 278 will be a good buying opportunity from a long term perspective investors with a long term perspective can take long positions at 285 and accumulate at 282 and 278 on the other hand if itc manages to sustain above 295 in the coming days a bounce to 302 the crucial 21 day moving average resistance is possible the stock has to surpass this hurdle to bring back the bullish momentum else a pull back to 295 is possible again in that case itc can remain range bound between 295 and 302 for some time infosys can witness a fresh fall infosys 716 05 infosys has crucial supports in the 706 703 region which can be tested in the near term it s ability to sustain above this support zone will decide its next move a bounce from the 706 703 support region will ease the downside pressure it will increase the possibility of the stock moving higher to 730 735 in the short term it will also keep the broader 700 775 sideways range intact infosys has been trading in this range since mid january but if the stock breaks below 703 in the coming days it will come under renewed pressure such a break will take the stock initially lower to 690 685 a further break below 685 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling towards 670 665 on profit booking indicators on the chart favour a decline below 703 and a fall to 670 665 in the coming weeks however the region between 670 and 665 is a crucial long term support which may halt the fall a decisive bounce from the 670 665 support zone could be a good buying opportunity from a long term perspective outlook turns bearish for ril ril 1 250 5 contrary to an expectation of a rise ril tumbled 11 per cent last week morgan stanley a global brokerage firm downgrading the stock seems to have made investors book profits triggering this sharp sell off the uptrend that has been in place since october 2018 has reversed and the outlook has turned bearish though there is some support near the current levels the broader picture is negative so any bounce from the current levels may be short lived and could be restricted to 1 300 1 320 a further fall to 1 200 1 180 is possible in the coming days the region around 1 180 is a strong long term trend support which can halt the fall a bounce from there will be bullish from a long term perspective investors can start buying ril at 1 200 and also accumulate at 1 285 and 1 295 however the possibility of a prolonged sideways move between 1 180 and 1 300 cannot be ruled out after this fall as such the rally to fresh highs thereafter might take time so investors buying around 1 200 will need to be patient and hold the stock for a long period of time down move to extend in tata steel tata steel 487 3 tata steel tumbled 11 per cent last week reports that the company s joint venture with german steel maker thyssenkrupp may not go through was a major trigger for the sell off in the stock last week the resistance at 560 has held well it also keeps intact the downtrend that has been in place since january 2018 a strong resistance is in the 505 510 region which can cap the upside a rally beyond 510 looks unlikely now also an intermediate bounce to this resistance zone is likely to find fresh sellers coming into the market a fall to 455 450 or even 440 is likely in the coming days a further break below 440 will then increase the likelihood of the fall extending to 425 or even 400 traders with a short term perspective can make use of rallies to go short at 498 and 505 stop loss can be placed at 522 for the target of 455 revise the stop loss lower to 490 as soon as the stock moves down to 475 the writer is chief research analyst at kshitij consultancy services
pakistan has secured a multibillion dollar bailout package from the imf in a desperate attempt to get out of a crippling economic situation but the road to strengthen the nation s finances is tough after months of difficult negotiations islamabad and the international monetary fund imf declared on sunday that they had reached an agreement on a fresh bailout package for pakistan if the deal is approved by the imf s management the south asian nation will receive 6 billion 5 34 billion in financial assistance over a period of three years to stave off a balance of payments crisis abdul hafeez shaikh pakistan s de facto finance minister told the state run pakistan television that he hoped it would be his country s last bailout package from the imf read more belt and road forum is the china pakistan economic corridor failing under the deal pakistan would give up central bank control of the currency to adopt a market based exchange rate and take measures to improve the functioning of loss making state owned firms as well as curtail subsidies among other things the world bank and the asian development bank would provide up to 3 billion in additional assistance in pursuance of the imf deal hafeez shaikh said the economy of the majority muslim nation with a population of over 200 million has slid deeper into crisis since imran khan took over as prime minister last year burgeoning fiscal and current account deficits and a dip in revenues from tax collection are at the heart of the crisis pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lackluster growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position ernesto ramirez rigo who led the imf mission to pakistan said in a statement on sunday the authorities recognize the need to address these challenges as well as to tackle the large informality in the economy the low spending in human capital and poverty a challenging environment through the imf bailout package pakistan will resolve its balance of payments crisis there is currently a financing gap of 12 billion and the bailout will help bridge the gap this year as well as in the coming three years minister of state for revenue hammad azhar told dw pakistan has gone to the imf numerous times since 1980 seeking bailouts the country has had a tense relationship with the lender as the conditions attached to the assistance are always unpopular pm imran khan initially appeared reluctant to approach the imf for aid fearing that it would impose tough conditions on government policy instead khan s administration sought billions of dollars in help from friendly countries including saudi arabia china and the united arab emirates to fix the nation s finances but with inflation climbing to over 8 the rupee losing a third of its value over the past year and foreign exchange reserves barely enough to cover two months of imports it was forced to turn to the imf read more the myth of austerity why pm imran khan s populism won t solve pakistan s woes growing discontent analysts have warned that any imf deal would likely come with strict conditions that could restrict pm khan s ability to fulfil his grand promises to build an islamic welfare state as the country is forced to tighten its purse strings the imf deal with the austerity measures it will entail will be a political blow to a pakistani government that had promised to build out a new welfare state michael kugelman a south asia expert at the washington based woodrow wilson center for scholars told dw the imf package will make it quite tough for khan to achieve his economic promises and therefore undercut the populist image that he has sought to showcase to the electorate he added khan came to power last year after promising to improve the country s economy and provide jobs to people image getty images afp a hassan this view is shared by kaiser bengali a renowned economist in pakistan the imf has an agenda to privatize the assets of the country which will lead to massive unemployment said the expert the bailout announcement comes as discontent is already growing over measures khan s government has taken to fend off the crisis including devaluing the rupee by some 30 since january 2018 sending inflation to five year highs khan came to power after winning a simple majority in last year s parliamentary elections on promises to improve the country s economy and provide jobs to people but his critics say his government has so far not been able to honor his commitment to the masses a government report published on friday also noted that pakistan s growth rate is set to hit an eight year low with the country s gdp rate likely to sink to 3 3 t against a projected target of 6 2 read more china pledges aid to pakistan amid financial crisis but some observers say the imf package will be beneficial to end the growing uncertainty and build investor confidence the deal will put an end to uncertainty and improve pakistan s financial situation abid sulehri an economist told dw even though it might have some negative effects in the form of a rise in inflation it will produce positive results in the long run us support when asked why china didn t come to pakistan s rescue minister azhar said china has already been providing funding for pakistan s trade and infrastructure development and we opted for the imf funding so as to introduce structural reforms in the economy the united states which has tremendous influence over the imf warned last year that any potential international bailout for pakistan should not provide funds to pay off chinese lenders make no mistake we will be watching what the imf does us secretary of state mike pompeo said there s no rationale for imf tax dollars and associated with that american dollars that are part of the imf funding for those to go to bail out chinese bondholders or china itself pompeo added it s not yet clear if the bailout agreement reached on sunday enjoys washington s backing pakistan s crisis also comes as the country is facing possible sanctions from the financial action task force an anti money laundering monitor based in paris for failing to rein in terror financing the organization will soon decide whether to add pakistan to a blacklist that would trigger automatic sanctions further weakening its already faltering economy
a customer looks at her iphone in a store of u s tech company apple in beijing on may 10 u s president donald trump s latest tariff hike on chinese goods took effect friday but beijing has already retaliated escalating a trade battle started by the u s president ng han guan ap donald trump voiced the real concerns of many americans when he spoke of the need to bring jobs to communities and to end unfair trade deals by blocking the trans pacific partnership pushing a re negotiation of nafta and increasing tariffs on a range of imports trump has appeared to finally take seriously the needs of unemployed and underemployed workers some unions have been calling for tariffs for years most notably the united steelworkers while obama ran in 2008 on a promise to renegotiate nafta he never did so and in fact became a relentless proponent of expanding free trade so is trump the worker s hero will increased tariffs return jobs to the u s the left has been weak on this issue on the one hand we need to take economic development and job creation seriously workers are suffering even though official unemployment rates are low more and more of the jobs people hold are low wage insecure non union and dead end the left lacks a real program to address the real concerns of those impacted by trade deals we need to better understand the history of tariffs and trade and we need an international vision for economic development what are tariffs most rich countries have used import tariffs as a way to develop their own industries alexander hamilton argued in the late 1700s for using tariffs to develop infant industries until they grew large enough to compete in a global market in general the idea was to allow raw materials in at a lower tax the import tariff on intermediate or finished goods was much higher this allowed manufacturers to import cheap inputs from other countries and then manufacture the items domestically most of the profit in a good comes in the production stage the goal for countries is to be able to move up the economic ladder where they can go from raw material exporters at low profit rates to finished goods exporters at much higher profit rates marx explained this process through the concept of socially necessary labor time or the average amount of labor time needed for a worker to produce a good for exchange there is relatively little labor time needed to harvest a peanut and more labor time needed to manufacture peanut butter for example in the 1400s britain was making money by exporting raw wool but henry vii understood that there were much greater profits for those who converted the raw wool into clothing he took a number of steps including increasing the tax on raw wool exports and then banned the export of unfinished cloth this forced british producers to process the wool and cloth into finished clothing only then did britain lower tariffs when robert walpole came in as british prime minister in 1721 he significantly raised tariffs on manufactured imports such as clothing and metal works and reduced or eliminated import tariffs for primary commodities produced in the colonies including wood tobacco clay and cotton marx explained this process through the concept of socially necessary labor time or the average amount of labor time needed for a worker to produce a good for exchange the united states relied heavily on high import tariffs on a range of goods for many decades according to the economist ha joon chang the u s had some of the highest tariffs in the world from 1816 to 1945 this can of course create strong tensions between different sections of the ruling class for example southern plantation owners wanted low tariffs so that they could easily export raw cotton and import manufactured goods northern manufacturers wanted high tariffs on manufactured imports but tariffs were not the only tool governments used chang points out that every rich country became rich by using a range of government interventions tariffs are just one tool other tools include direct subsidies to firms public investment in infrastructure that allows industries to develop and transport goods public investment in research and development public schools to train workers financial regulations banking systems to generate savings available for investment nationalization of industries and more governments have also used more insidious tools to develop their economies including war colonization industrial espionage and the trade in human beings forced into slave labor many economists from a range of perspectives have argued the world as a whole benefits from free trade the idea that countries should be able to exchange goods and services without tariffs or other disincentives or barriers the free trade school of thought has dominated economics since wwii the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt was established just after wwii as a diplomatic forum where states could meet and agree to reduce tariffs in 1995 the world trade organization wto was formed with a mandate to govern the rules of trade between states with the goal of ensur that trade flows as smoothly predictably and freely as possible alongside the wto countries signed free trade agreements and bilateral or multilateral investment treaties designed to reduce tariffs further and particularly to reduce other barriers to trade the u s signed its first free trade agreement in 1985 with israel and has since signed bilateral or multilateral agreements with 19 other countries the u s now has a highly complex tariff schedule there are three different rates of duty the general rate a special for free trade or generalized system of preference partners and a third rate that applies to cuba and north korea some products are free there is no import tariff fresh plantains for example can come in with no tariff even from cuba or north korea dried plantains however require some processing they have a 1 4 percent tariff for the general rate free for the special rate and 35 percent for our enemy countries chainsaw blades have a 7 2 percent general tariff free for the special rate and 60 percent otherwise meanwhile circular saw blades are free for the general and special rate and 25 percent otherwise all of this highlights the reality that tariffs are greatly influenced by political processes as much as economic ones employer associations powerful corporations members of congress unions and consumers have all lobbied to set tariff rates for each of the tens of thousands of products there is no other way to explain why tariff rates differ for forks versus spoons or for almonds versus pistachios versus pecans versus chestnuts another political consideration is how other countries respond to our tariffs if we raise tariffs on chinese steel china might raise tariffs on our wheat since the end of world war ii most western countries have agreed to keep tariffs low and avoid this sort of scenario in fact tariffs have been so low that free trade agreements haven t lowered them much the difference between say 1 4 percent and zero is trivial this raises the question why has there been so much uproar about free trade agreements since at least the battle of seattle in 1999 the answer is that modern free trade agreements aren t really about tariffs rather they re about loosening restrictions on flows of international investment which makes it easier for western companies to offshore jobs and hide their profits from the tax authorities for more on this see this comic trade agreements have also been about lowering non tariff barriers to trade these include things large sections of the population support such as environmental protections labor laws or licensing restrictions such as against genetically modified seeds many of these protections have been weakened or voided in the name of free trade should we support increased tariffs to save jobs it is impossible to say for sure why trump is pushing for tariffs and some better terms for labor in the new nafta but it is highly unlikely he is concerned with worker rights his appointments for secretary of labor and the supreme court alone are evidence that that he is out to break unions and reduce worker wages and benefits trump s other great campaign promise to workers was to enact large infrastructure programs that would create jobs but that has yet to happen while spending tens of millions on military parades and mar a lago weekends and passing a 1 5 trillion tax cut trump has failed to bring his infrastructure proposal to light instead the trump policy seems designed to redirect real worker frustrations about jobs and wages into anger at other countries and immigrants rather than at corporations trump presents himself as the only politician willing to stand up for the blue collar worker and this is easy to do because so few politicians have actually been champions of the working class action on tariffs and trade deals has won him support among certain voters and even union leaders who have felt long ignored the new nafta language is interesting because it contains a number of advances on labor issues including eliminating some of the controversial protections for investors and a requirement that at least 45 percent of an automobile or 40 percent of auto parts be made by a worker earning at least 16 per hour this seems a clear play to gain support from the united auto workers and rustbelt workers yet even auto industry analysts don t think the proposal is likely to save jobs just ask kristin dziczek from the center for automotive research who said the big upshot is there s nothing in this agreement that looks like lots of jobs are coming to the u s but trump s stance on tariffs and trades appeals to workers who have lost their jobs and are looking for hope anywhere they can it also plays with some of his supporters who are motivated more by nationalism and racism than economic concerns so the fact that tariffs won t bring back many jobs doesn t matter to them and while tariffs are a real problem for some of the capitalist class not all are directly impacted and for all of trump s talk of nafta re negotiation his plans will leave the bigger problems with free trade unregulated cross border money flows and erosion of environmental and labor protections untouched so what s really going on here are a couple of key points that help us evaluate what to think about tariffs first economic development is a complicated subject no one has figured it out and no one has the magic solution tariffs have in fact been a useful tool for economic development and job creation but they are only one tool tariffs on their own can backfire if they are used to protect corrupt or inefficient employers or dying industries they can also backfire if they provoke other countries to impose retaliatory measures as is happening with trump s trade war with china second the package of tools that rich countries used to become rich have mostly been disallowed for developing economies under our trade and investment agreements we do not allow partner countries to use tariffs or subsidies to develop their infant industries we push them to privatize publicly owned businesses we do not allow them to keep our goods or our businesses out imagine what japan s situation would be today if ford and gm had been able to freely sell cars there or open auto plants there toyota mitsubishi and nissan would never have had a chance all the while we continue to use a range of these tools ourselves for example the mexican government was forced to stop subsidizing mexican corn growers under nafta while opening their markets to u s agriculture even though u s food is heavily subsidized subsidies that violate every supposed principle of free trade u s food flooded the mexican market undercutting mexican farmers and driving them off the land bizarrely many wound up moving north to grow food in the united states to be sent back to mexico u s unionists talk of unfair behavior in china dumping fixed currency rates and intellectual property law violations and these are real issues but u s corporations engage in a wide range of unfair activities as well often supported by or protected by the u s government any talk of tariffs should be situated in this context it can be hard to frame demands in an internationalist rather than nationalist framework but in this moment of rising hate groups anti immigrant and nationalist movements it is crucial that the left not be pulled into making alliances around nationalist policy so yes let s reform our economic relations with other countries u s trade and investment policy have been disastrous damaging economies elsewhere exacerbating global inequality and destabilizing the world economy which has rebounded back on us let s talk about trade and economic development policies that allow workers to find living wage jobs in their own home countries it can be hard to frame demands in an internationalist rather than nationalist framework but in this moment of rising hate groups anti immigrant and nationalist movements it is crucial that the left not be pulled into making alliances around nationalist policy third tariffs are not the only economic development tool people may blame outsourcing or unfair trade but in fact there are many policy options available to us to try right now to create good jobs for example one argument for steel tariffs was based on national security but if security is really our concern it is a mistake to leave vital production of things like steel oil medicine and food in the hands of unaccountable private corporations create public entities that can do this there is a wide range of policy options that we could pursue to create jobs and to make bad jobs into better ones these include raise taxes on the rich and corporations use the money to bring back the federal and state jobs cut in recent years re hire people to run our libraries state parks mail service trains and more public investment in education to expand the number of teacher jobs and raise salaries for educators real public investment in rebuilding our bridges and trains and tunnels instituting universal health care would have many benefits including greatly reducing the cost of production for u s manufacturers reform

overview the end of the tariff truce between the us and china has discombobulated investors they had been repeatedly that a deal was close and there had even been talk at the us treasury about where trump and xi should meet to sign the agreement now china was given around a month to capitulate to us demands or face a 25 tariff on their remaining exports to the us the lack of an immediate formal response retaliation by china and indications that talks will resume at some point helped the s p 500 reverse higher ahead of the weekend but a pessimistic reading of events dominates today and equities markets are tumbling again msci asia pacific index lost 3 6 last week and most of the major markets shanghai south korea taiwan and singapore were off over 1 today europe s dow jones stoxx 600 fell around 0 7 in the morning session after its shed 3 4 last week the s p 500 slid 2 2 last week and is off around 1 25 in electronic trading bonds are rallying the us 10 year yield is off five basis points to just above 2 40 the low from the end of march was about 2 33 the benchmark 10 year german bund is off a few basis points minus 6 bp to push its yield below the 10 year jgb italian and greek bonds are exceptions to the push lower in yields the dollar enjoys a firmer bias against most of the world s currencies today the japanese yen and swiss franc are proving most resilient while among the majors the dollar and scandi blocks are the heaviest declines in the turkish lira and south african rand are pacing the emerging market currency decline asia pacific china has not specified its retaliatory measures and most observers seem to still be expecting a formal announcement in near term though we are less convinced on the one hand the us and many outside observers have been critical of china for the apparent lack of the rule of law yet somehow the reluctance of china to change its laws when the trump administration is seeking an executive agreement which is a weak form in the us was the supposed trigger for the collapse it appears china insisted that all trump tariffs are lifted with the agreement and this was not acceptable to the us note that mexico and canada are demanding along similar lines that the steel and aluminum tariffs are lifted before the parliaments approve the new nafta deal the process by which the us can impose a 25 tariff on the remainder of chinese goods takes several weeks details expected later today china was given a month to reach an agreement no new meetings have been announced since the last meeting was in the us lighthizer and mnuchin have been invited to beijing with no specific date reported however as economic adviser kudlow was admitting on television yesterday that indeed american businesses and consumers pay the tariff he also pointed to the g20 meeting at the end of next month in japan as a potential meeting between trump and xi initially the meeting was touted as a venue to sign the agreement and now it may be needed to overcome the deadlock separately some suspect that kudlow s contradiction of trump s claim that china is paying for the tariff is a sign that he may leave the administration this summer meanwhile support for japan s prime minister abe has risen according to the latest polls a nikkei survey put the government s support at 55 up seven percentage points since march a jnn tv poll found a four point gain in the past month to nearly 57 5 however the government s economic plans are less appreciated the nikkei survey found 57 opposed to the sales tax increase planned for october the upper house of the japanese diet faces an election in july and there is some talk that abe may take advantage of the polls and the weak opposition to dissolve the lower house and hold joint elections the government is reluctant to delay the sales tax increase again but if there are to be joint elections a delay is likely australia s elections are on may 18 the latest polls put the opposition labor ahead of the governing liberal national coalition at 51 49 it is statistically a dead heat but the government is widely seen as lagging prime minister morrison s last minute gambit to lower the downpayment needed for first time homebuyers from 20 to 5 may not enough to put the government ahead labor has been out of power for six years and is favored to secure a majority the dollar has been confined to about a quarter of a yen below jpy109 85 there is a 360 mln option at jpy109 65 and an option at jpy110 00 for around 380 mln that will be cut today in the last two sessions the dollar found bids near jpy109 50 similarly it has been blocked near jpy110 10 the australian dollar seems to build a shelf near 0 6965 however it continues to trade heavily a close above 0 7020 would lift the tone the dollar rose about 0 75 against the chinese yuan and closed the local session near cny6 8735 it appears to be the biggest move since last october some observers think chinese officials will depreciate the currency to offset the impact of the tariffs others see mostly normal market forces at work weighing on the yuan in the risk off environment like other em assets a decline in interest rates and an expected hit on the economy we have understood chinese officials to sanction a cny6 70 to cny7 0 range but that was before the escalation of the trade conflict a test may be required to renew official guidance europe the cross party talks between the uk government and the labour party do not appear to amount to very much yet but without a clear alternative the talks are

expect to meet with the 1922 committee later in the week which wants may to step down shortly political tensions are on the rise in italy there has been such talk before but it was easier to dismiss the league which has acted as the senior member of the coalition is now seeing its support in the polls slip ahead of the eu parliament election later this month moreover one of league leader salvini s allies is caught up in a corruption scandal and salvini himself appears to have been caught in a power grab for shipping in italian waters ostensibly as a way to address the refugee flow encroaching on the mandate of a 5 star minister also the arranging of a private sector bailout of a troubled lender carige bank failed and unless an alternative is found shortly nationalization may be necessary which the league is loath to do there continue to be murmurings that salvini may precipitate a crisis to call for elections join forces with its old ally in berlusconi s forza italia to form a new center right government the euro is trading quietly within the ranges seen before the weekend indeed the euro has been confined to about 10 ticks on either side of 1 1230 there is a billion euro

may 9 the atlanta fed says the q2 gdp is tracking 1 6 a report over the weekend claimed that trump s calls for the fed to cut rates were seen in beijing as a signal that the president is worried about

reported spectacular employment data before the weekend the economy less than a tenth the size of the us added over 100k jobs nearly three quarters of which were full time positions the participation

widening trade dispute with the us the fall in the cny exchange rate is the clearest evidence that china is expected to bear most of the cost of tariffs the weaker exchange rate pushes up the cost of chinese imports and reduces the purchasing power of chinese consumers its fall is indicative of lost competitiveness and the potential hit to sales the tariffs impose on companies in china that are exporting to the usa china may be allowing its exchange rate to fall to help provide stimulus to its economy and alleviate the dampening impact of tariffs on its economy the us administration had included the cny in its trade negotiations with china and the fall in cny may be a part of china s retaliation to us tariff increases however a steeply falling cny may unsettle chinese capital markets risk triggering increased capital flight tightening domestic credit conditions and increase the cost of capital for chinese firms with foreign currency debt the fall in cny may do little to halt the

forget all the optimism that briefly reverberated through markets over trade on friday the weekend s events have reshuffled the deck and traders are once again looking toward haven assets fresh tweets from president donald trump and threats of retaliation from china mean investors can expect that the end of week gains triggered by the u s government s characterization of the negotiations as constructive to evaporate quickly as various markets open up again early trading in currency markets monday showed demand for the relative safety of traditional havens such as the japanese yen while the chinese yuan was weaker and trade proxies like the australian and new zealand dollars were weaker at the same time moves were relatively contained amid thin trading in the early asia pacific hours and the real test may come as markets from equities to treasuries get going later in the day in little over a week we have gone from trade news euphoria to total misery stephen innes head of trading at spi asset management in hong kong wrote in a note saturday but by all accounts markets are less about the immediate economic fallout and more about just how much damage has been done to the trade process and whether a compromise can be reached exactly what has been priced into markets from the escalation of trade tensions and what still needs to be priced in is a riddle that investors the world over are urgently trying to solve and frustratingly attempts at answers tend to come in three parts depending on whether this latest escalation manages to trigger a trade agreement in the near term a longer period of back and forth brinkmanship or a full blown trade war for now traders are taking the latest utterances from the two sides as a sign that the standoff will endure at the very least after raising tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods and threatening more on friday trump said saturday it would be wise for china to act now to complete a trade deal with the u s larry kudlow trump s top economic adviser tempered the remarks later saying on fox news that treasury secretary steven mnuchin and trade representative robert lighthizer have been invited back to beijing for more talks the u s is still in a negotiation not a war with china he said still trump s tweets had enough force to prompt china into vowing retaliation and in an article to be published monday in the people s daily the flagship newspaper of china s communist party the chinese said the u s should take full responsibility for the setbacks because it raised tariffs on the country s products according to state television earlier in an interview with chinese media after the talks in washington on friday vice premier liu he said that to reach an agreement the u s must remove all extra tariffs set targets for chinese purchases of goods in line with real demand and ensure that the text of the deal is balanced to ensure the dignity of both nations pricing it in the fx market is pricing trade tensions but not a trade war bank of america economists led by ethan harris wrote in a note last week importantly the markets could view brinkmanship as similar to a trade war in the short run by contrast we think the rates market is already pricing in something like the brinkmanship scenario which could continue for weeks a u s china agreement in the near term naturally would provide the best chance for traders to pick up the scraps of their old playbooks and tape them back together the chance of a prolonged period of tensions though has strategists conjuring up a wide variety of investment ideas credit suisse suggested a trade that benefits if the ishares msci emerging markets etf falls between 4 5 and 8 over the next month ubs global wealth management decided to end its recommendation to overweight emerging market hard currency sovereign bonds the consensus appears to have gravitated toward the idea that prolonged or escalated tensions would extend the past week s trends weakness in emerging market currencies and global equities gains in haven assets such as the japanese yen and u s treasuries and heightened volatility just about everywhere china s yuan thailand s baht and the philippine peso are the most at risk in a trade war according to a bloomberg intelligence model forward looking currency markets are reacting to the prospect of china s trade surplus falling and chinese corporates with 840 billion of onshore foreign exchange loans pre emptively buying dollars mansoor mohi uddin the singapore based senior macro strategist at natwest markets said by email sunday similar behavior last year caused the exchange rate to rise from 6 25 to 6 95 against the u s currency the onshore yuan closed friday at 6 82 per dollar markets in hong kong are closed for a holiday monday before the trump tweets heard around the world a central thesis in markets was that a trade deal and economic stimulus in china would boost riskier assets at the expense of havens causing treasury yields to rise in the second half of the year jim caron fixed income portfolio manager at morgan stanley investment management in new york said in an interview now the thesis is that based on what we re seeing right now it seems as though china has backed out of a deal and why that s significant is that this isn t just something that can be fixed by a tweet he just can t untweet that caron said i d argue that we have to believe that the surprises in the market are going to be more toward the downside than the upside managing risk he s not the only one bracing for more risk aversion investors need to be ready for the trade war to get worse before it gets better risking further weakness in stocks that were already vulnerable after strong gains to start the year shane oliver head of investment strategy and chief economist at amp capital wrote in a note miller tabak co equity strategist matt maley sounded a similar note of caution and said that a 10 drop in the s p 500 index from its recent high would not be out of the question so far the gauge has fallen less than 3 from its record high close at the end of april the stock market was already ripe for a pull back maley wrote to clients now that it s getting some negative news materially negative news it s even more ripe for a larger decline therefore we believe investors should not be trying to figure out whether the market will decline or not they should be trying to figure out how much it will fall meanwhile although u s china scenario analyses dominated the past week the focus could quickly shift janelle woodward head of fixed income at bmo global asset management has an eye on the next potential target for tariffs european automakers the trump administration was expected to make a decision on the findings of a probe into the national security risks of european auto imports by may 18 we think there are a lot of options as far as extension or asking for a new investigation but this does seem

briefing highlights trade wars wound economy china retaliates hitting u s goods onex strikes deal to buy westjet stocks loonie oil at a glance what to expect in housing report what else to watch for this week required reading the potential toll trade wars are wounding canada s economy already hit on some fronts canada will also be collateral damage in the escalating u s china trade battle put it all together as bank of montreal senior economist sal guatieri did and you can peg the toll on canada mr guatieri calculated existing and potential harm by looking at previous trade actions such as duties on steel and aluminum the indirect impact on canada from the effects of the china spat on the u s economy and further threatened measures such as those on autos this comes after u s president donald trump raised the tariff level on certain chinese goods on friday and threatened to hit other products prompting beijing to vow retaliation china responded today saying it would slap tariffs on us 60 billion of american imports china announced it will raise tariffs on some u s imports on june 1 and that it may stop buying u s agricultural goods and reduce boeing orders said derek holt bank of nova scotia s head of capital markets economics this came after trump tweeted a warning this morning that china should not retaliate will only get worse mr holt added therefore watch for the potential for further escalation of tit for tat tariffs in essence china s stance invalidates the argument that because china imports less from the u s than vice versa its potential to retaliate is coming from a weaker position china is invoking the threat of a total blockade of key u s goods straight to the heartland of trump s agricultural base without going into all of his math mr guatieri said the cost to the u s economy of various trade actions could be about 1 per cent in lost output he then took the impact of that and the earlier hit from the steel and aluminum levies to calculate the cost to canada the estimated 1 per cent slowing in u s gdp due to current duties and possible further protectionist moves could translate into 0 5 per cent less canadian output based on the estimated impact of a change in u s growth on canada mr guatieri said lower commodity prices won t help he added in his report including earlier tariffs on steel aluminum and retaliatory actions could cost the economy another 0 3 per cent putting the potential hit from a global trade war at around 0 8 per cent or 150 000 jobs for canada remember too that canada has been caught in the crossfire over

weak print falling out of the annual calculation will also have helped nudge the inflation rate higher said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes it s possible that the global increase in

preferred equity reducing our overall leverage to 36 we also continued to make progress with our expense saving initiatives that we anticipate being ahead of our stated targets before discussing nre s performance in detail i d like to make a few remarks regarding the macroeconomic environment and the european commercial real estate market european economy continued to grow during the first quarter of 2019 albeit at a slower rate gross domestic product grew by 0 4 and 0 5 in the eurozone and the european union respectively in april 2019 the international monetary fund provides the 2019 gdp forecast down to 1 3 for the eurozone and 1 6 for the eu citing weaker consumer and business confidence and softening investments most notably in italy however the european central bank appears willing to intervene to the extent required to sustain economic expansion in the region including through the safeguarding and favorable financing conditions consequently in april 2019 in response to weakening economic indicators the ecb stated its intention to maintain interest rates at 0 through 2019 and then announced a new round of targeted long term loans to eurozone banks as of march eurozone inflation stood at 1 4 which is in line with the european commission s latest 2019 projection that the low term to medium term target of 2 unemployment continues to decline reaching 7 7 in march down from 8 5 a year earlier and the lowest level recorded in the eurozone since september 2008 uk economic growth remains to 0 3 ph in the three months to february 2019 in line with the previous rolling period ongoing uncertainty regarding the outcome of brexit negotiations continued to weigh on sentiment and investment the imf revised its gdp forecasts for the uk down by 0 3 to 1 2 for 2019 inflation has fallen from its peak of 3 1 in november 2017 to 1 9 in february 2019 easing the pressure on the bank of england to further increase interest rates at a potentially vulnerable time for the uk economy however the bank of england governor warned that future interest rate increases could be more frequent than current market expectations if there is an adequate resolution to the brexit impasse and economic growth and inflation continue to rise european commercial real estate investment volume stood at eur54 billion in the first quarter of 2019 22 below the same period in 2018 office remains the most sought after asset class representing approximately 38 of transaction volume prime property yields in some asset classes and markets soften slightly but remained at or close to historically low levels reflecting a significant premium to sovereign yields european office take up grew 7 year over year in the first quarter of 2019 highlighting the continued strength in the european occupier market the same tenant demands coupled with a subdued new supply pipeline continues to supply downward pressure on historically low vacancy rates which decreased by 10 basis points to 6 in the first quarter the lowest level since 2002 and fuel rental growth which stood at 5 1 well above the 10 year average of 2 1 ph driven primarily by limited supply of available stock german real estate investment reached eur14 billion in the first quarter 30 below the same period last year office first quarter of 2018 recorded the second highest transaction volume for more than a decade office remained the most sought after asset class representing approximately 40 of the total transaction volume vacancy across the top six german cities fell by further 10 basis points to 3 6 during the first quarter fueling growth in prime rents which increased by 2 ltv transaction volumes stood at gbp11 billion in the first quarter 16 below the same period last year central london office investment volume fell to gbp1 5 billion a 35 decline compared to the same period last year driven primarily by continued uncertainties surrounding brexit take up in central london slowed in the

volume was eur4 billion in the first quarter and 4 below the same period last year with office representing 50 of total transaction volume the paris occupational market remains robust with a vacancy rate of 1 6 turning the discussion back to nre i m pleased to report another positive quarter in which we continued to make significant progress of our stated operational initiatives as of march 31st 2019 our 193 000 square meter portfolio comprised of 15 properties with the blue chip and other high quality tenants in key cities across europe the portfolio was 84 occupied and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6 2 years our portfolio our office portfolio comprised of 12 properties generated approximately 93 of our net operating income was 97 occupied on a pro forma basis with the remaining average lease term around 5 9 years our overall portfolio is valued at 1 2 billion based on the year end 2018 independent valuation by cushman wakefield during the first quarter we completed the sale of uhlandstrasse in frankfurt for 40 million 65 above our allocated purchase price including capex we also completed the sale of our two retail assets in germany werl and kirchheide together these three assets released approximately 23 million of net equity to nre after repayment of financing and transaction costs and crystallizing an approximate 14 irr for stockholders over the

operating performance on an fx adjusted basis and excluding the held for sale industrial assets ph in paris rental income increased by 100 000 or 0 9 reflecting indexation uplifts offset by a partial vacancy in two assets one in paris and one in hamburg which is now fully leased same store quarter over quarter noi decreased by 200 000 or 1 5 due to the timing of certain non recoverable repairs and maintenance expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2019 specifically in two assets the ic hotel in berlin and our office property in cologne same store year over year rental income decreased by 100 000 or 0 7 year over year rental income included indexation uplifts offset by the previously mentioned vacancies and the execution of certain value enhancing leases including a nine year lease extension with bnp at boulevard macdonald and a ten year lease extension with baker tilly at valentinskamp same store year over year noi decreased by 260 000 or 1 8 driven by the previously mentioned non recoverable repairs and maintenance expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2019 for the first quarter of 2019 nre reported cash available for distribution or cad of 7 4 million or 0 15 per share a decline over last quarter predominantly due to the sales of trianon during the first quarter of 2019 we continued to make progress with our initiatives to reduce direct corporate expenses i m pleased to say that in addition to the 3 million of savings in other expenses and g a expenses in 2018 we remain on track to achieve an additional 2 million to 3 million of expense savings in 2019 which is ahead of the overall target of 5 million on a run rate basis after deducting mortgage debt and adjusting for cash and other balance sheet working capital items epra nav based on the year end 2018 independent valuation by cushman wakefield adjusted for currency movements was 20 48 per share as of march 31st 2019 which was down from the prior quarter largely due to the decline in the europe as of march 31 2019 nre s overall leverage was 39 down from 53 a year earlier and our weighted average debt maturity was approximately 4 5 years in april we repaid the 81 million of seb preferred debt financing further reducing leverage to 36 as of april 24th we had 433 million of corporate liquidity including 70 million of availability under our credit facility and 363 million of unrestricted cash

record as of the close of business on may 13 overall we are pleased with the company s financial and operational performance in 2019 and look forward to updating you further in the quarters ahead operator please open up the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question comes from the line of bryan maher bryan you are now unmuted you can go ahead with your question bryan maher b riley fbr analyst yes good morning guys question and it s kind of like a two part related question as it relates to the strategic review process and can you give us any parts of the kind of how far along you are i mean it s been going on since november in your mind is it something that we re getting close to conclusion on it has one or two more quarters to go and the second part of that is you re sitting on over 360 million of cash which weighs on your ability to generate cad and thus the dividends pushing up against earnings and how should we think about the dividend as we continue through this process if that cash is not redeployed mahbod nia chief executive officer and president bryan it s mahbod here thank you for the question we re in the midst of a process that is very live and an ongoing so i think it would be inappropriate for us if we provide any comment on that at this stage so apologies that we won t be able to comment on that but the board the src remains very focused and engaged and working with our advisors and as soon as that process is drawing to a conclusion we ll provide an update to the market with regards to the cash we are in a holding pattern we re waiting for the conclusions of the strategic review so for now we are sitting on that cash obviously you re right you ll see cad for the quarter over 0 15 which is in line with the dividend we are utilizing that cash or holding that cash as efficiently as we possibly can for the time being and there s no intention really to at this stage adjust the dividend in any way until we have further until the process is completed bryan maher b riley fbr analyst okay and let s just to play devil s advocate here let s just say that nothing happens with a strategic review and you continue on due course so can you give us a little bit more color on what s going on in supply and demand metrics in your key markets and if there s been any real changes to the bid ask spreads between assets which would slow your ability to redeploy the cash should you end up going that route mahbod nia chief executive officer and president yeah again i m not going to speculate on the direction of the outcome of the process but if you re asking where do we see opportunities generally across europe from an investment standpoint i think it probably won t surprise you that in the uk particularly we re starting to see some interesting opportunities arise given the uncertainty around brexit is certainly impacting sentiment if not yet the fundamentals and so some of the capital that would typically be directed toward the uk has been more patient and waiting for resolution and that means that there are increasingly interesting opportunities that we re seeing here so of all three markets i would say that s the one that looks the most interesting today bryan maher b riley fbr analyst okay thank you mahbod nia chief executive officer and president thanks bryan operator operator instructions there is no there is one more question coming through and there are no further questions coming through sorry we ll hand over to mahbod nia mahbod nia chief executive officer and

2018 independent valuation by cushman wakefield adjusted for currency movements was 20 48 per share as of march 31st 2019 which was down from the prior quarter largely due to the decline in the europe

operator please open up the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question comes from the line of bryan maher bryan you are now unmuted you can go ahead with your question bryan maher b riley fbr analyst yes good morning guys question and it s kind of like a two part related question as it relates to the strategic review process and can you give us any parts of the kind of how far along you are i mean it s been going on since november in your mind is it something that we re getting close to conclusion on it has one or two more quarters to go and the second part of that is you re sitting on over 360 million of cash which weighs on your ability to generate cad and thus the dividends pushing up against earnings and how should we think about the dividend as we continue through this process if that cash is not redeployed mahbod nia chief executive officer and president bryan it s mahbod here thank you for the question we re in the midst of a process that is very live and an ongoing so i think it would be inappropriate for us if we provide any comment on that at this stage so apologies that we won t be able to comment on that but the board the src remains very focused and engaged and working with our advisors and as soon as that process is drawing to a conclusion we ll provide an update to the market with regards to the cash we are in a holding pattern we re waiting for the conclusions of the strategic review so for now we are sitting on that cash obviously you re right you ll see cad for the quarter over 0 15 which is in line with the dividend we are utilizing that cash or holding that cash as efficiently as we possibly can for the time being and there s no intention really to at this stage adjust the dividend in any way until we have further until the process is completed bryan maher b riley fbr analyst okay and let s just to play devil s advocate here let s just say that nothing happens with a strategic review and you continue on due course so can you give us a little bit more color on what s going on in supply and demand metrics in your key markets and if there s been any real changes to the bid ask spreads between assets which would slow your ability to redeploy the cash should you end up going that route mahbod nia chief executive officer and president yeah again i m not going to speculate on the direction of the outcome of the process but if you re asking where do we see opportunities generally across europe from an investment standpoint i think it probably won t surprise you that in the uk particularly we re starting to see some interesting opportunities arise given the uncertainty around brexit is certainly impacting sentiment if not yet the fundamentals and so some of the capital that would typically be directed toward the uk has been more patient and waiting for resolution and that means that there are increasingly interesting opportunities that we re seeing here so of all three markets i would say that s the one that looks the most interesting today bryan maher b riley fbr analyst okay thank you mahbod nia chief executive officer and president thanks bryan operator operator instructions there is no there is one more question coming through and there are no further questions coming through sorry we ll hand over to mahbod nia mahbod nia chief executive officer and

economy continued to grow during the first quarter of 2019 albeit at a slower rate gross domestic product grew by 0 4 and 0 5 in the eurozone and the european union respectively in april 2019 the international monetary fund provides the 2019 gdp forecast down to 1 3 for the eurozone and 1 6 for the eu citing weaker consumer and business confidence and softening investments most notably in italy however the european central bank appears willing to intervene to the extent required to sustain economic expansion in the region including through the safeguarding and favorable financing conditions consequently in april 2019 in response to weakening economic indicators the ecb stated its intention to maintain interest rates at 0 through 2019 and then announced a new round of targeted long term loans to eurozone banks as of march eurozone inflation stood at 1 4 which is in line with the european commission s latest 2019 projection that the low term to medium term target of 2 unemployment continues to decline reaching 7 7 in march down from 8 5 a year earlier and the lowest level recorded in the eurozone since september 2008 uk economic growth remains to 0 3 ph in the three months to february 2019 in line with the previous rolling period ongoing uncertainty regarding the outcome of brexit negotiations continued to weigh on sentiment and investment the imf revised its gdp forecasts for the uk down by 0 3 to 1 2 for 2019 inflation has fallen from its peak of 3 1 in november 2017 to 1 9 in february 2019 easing the pressure on the bank of england to further increase interest rates at a potentially vulnerable time for the uk economy however the bank of england governor warned that future interest rate increases could be more frequent than current market expectations if there is an adequate resolution to the brexit impasse and economic growth and inflation continue to rise european commercial real estate investment volume stood at eur54 billion in the

2020 stornoway has taken the decision to temporarily suspend open pit mining operations at renard 65 this decision will enable the idling of part of the surface equipment fleet realizing operating cost savings and delaying capital expenditures all affected surface equipment operators were trained to transition to underground operations or will occupy other open positions during the quarter 582 613 tonnes of ore were processed with 444 562 carats recovered at an attributable grade of 76 cpht the processed ore was derived from underground production at the renard 2 kimberlite 89 open pit production from the renard 65 kimberlite 6 and underground development ore from the renard 3 kimberlite 5 plant availability in the first quarter was lower than expected and the plant operated below its design rate in january 5 520 tpd and target rate in february 6 715 tpd mechanical issues primarily at the front end of the process plant and primarily due to the very cold weather experienced in the first quarter were the significant drivers of the process plant underperformance processing rates improved in march 7 209 tpd above the target processing rate of 7 000 tpd demonstrating improvements in plant reliability the average processing rate was 7 734 tpd in april 10 above the target rate the highest average rate for a single month ever achieved at renard management is confident that the plant will continue to surpass the budgeted average daily rate in the coming months carats recovered decreased 8 quarter over quarter due to the lower tonnes processed and a slight decline in grade that had been anticipated in the mining sequence diamond sales two tender sales were completed in the first quarter for a total of 429 506 carats sold during the quarter revenue recognized was derived from 361 404 run of mine5 carats and 68 102 supplemental5 carats that were sold for gross proceeds2 of 47 3 million at an average price of us 83 per carat 110 per carat3 the carats sold increased by 38 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to higher recovered grades average pricing increased by 8 from the previous quarter due to the higher quality of goods and mix sold capital projects capital expenditures1 in the first quarter were 17 0 million expenditures were primarily related to the development of the next underground mining horizon in the renard 2 ore body 450 470m level the development of the first underground mining horizon in the renard 3 ore body 290m level and the development of the underground access ramp 1 411 meters of lateral development were achieved in the quarter the development of the 450 470m mining horizon in renard 2 is progressing in line with schedule and the initiation of underground production in the renard 3 ore body took place in late april over two months in advance of the target of the beginning of the third quarter renard mineral resource development stornoway s exploration plans for 2019 are focused on resource upside at the renard mine including the renard 3 and renard 4 kimberlites with a view to convert certain mineral resources6 to mineral reserves and to accelerate the inclusion of both ore bodies in

after a brief detour conventional wisdom is back with full force for shaping policies and programmes to tackle the external sector cyclic crisis but the challenge for the country s new and revitalised economic team is to absorb changing realities and ensure robust outcomes given ground realities the prime minister s search for alternative options proved futile as many had predicted from the very outset access to imf bailout was inevitable to pull the economy out of the woods the empowered advisor on finance dr hafeez shaikh hopes to strike a reasonable programme with the imf to get stable predictable and sustainable macroeconomic stability he will be required to walk the talk in a complex situation embedded with baffling problems luckily for him shaikh s stipulation coincides with a statement by a senior us official that pakistan is not only saying the right things but it had taken some right steps we support the civilian government and nascent democratic system america is the imf s largest shareholder shaikh s team is being strengthened with like minded technocrats that have exposure to problems facing the debt addicted economy such as ours that will help him both in negotiating a deal with the imf and in implementing a stability and austerity programme the fund would also feel comfortable working with such a team dr hafeez shaikh hopes to strike a reasonable deal with the imf to get stable predictable and sustainable macroeconomic stability dr reza baqar has resigned from the imf to take over as state bank governor he will be sitting on the other side of the fence and working under domestic pressures as a fund official he helped countries design debt and fiscal policies retired world bank officials hired by asian development bank are now placed in the ministry of finance says dr ashfaque hasan khan an eminent tax expert and senior partner of ag ferguson shabbar zaidi has been named the federal board of revenue fbr chairman but his induction has been opposed by the inland revenue officers association the association contends that the appointment of any person from the private sector is illegal as declared by the islamabad high court in the case of mr arshad ali hakeem the government however intends to go ahead with the notification of its decision mr zaidi considers building trust between the state and the taxpayer as the foremost challenge he listed measures that could lead to voluntary tax compliance in its pakistan revenue mobilisation project report the world bank has suggested that the pti government reforms should include security of tenure for the fbr chairman for a fixed mandate this time the country went to the imf with a somewhat different approach to its own fallout the pti leadership kept on changing its public stance while its government was carrying out the imf s prior preconditions for a bailout that sparked a great public debate as seldom seen before on issues such as privatisation job creation interest rate hikes devaluation tax amnesty power and gas tariffs petroleum prices and the ensuing inflation the well articulated views featuring in the debate were related to concerns of common citizens rent seeking and extractive practices centralisation at the cost of fiscal federalism and high inflation eating into the vitals of the industrial economy the underlying message was a call for culture change or change management in ways that crises could be resolved in his article published by this newspaper some time ago sakib shirani had pointed out that the imf adjustment programme is not embedded in the broad strategy of economic development that engages a wider range of stakeholders in society perhaps this missing crucial factor has been responsible for pakistan exiting most of the 22 earlier programmes half way through under immense domestic pressure in the introduction to the book pakistan at the crossroads domestic dynamics and external pressures scholar christophe jaffrelot looks at pakistan s ability to navigate into the interface of domestic and external dynamics he notes that countries of the same league are less dependent on outside support and less porous to foreign influence than pakistan the lobbying by those who will be losers has been intensified on may day labour unions rejected the imf s reported agenda including privatisation that has been virtually held up for the past 13 years hafeez shaikh says efforts to improve fiscal and macroeconomic sectors are doomed to fail if public sector enterprises continue to haemorrhage the economy public sector corporations continue to dominate key areas of the economy even though they do not perform he wants these bleeding enterprises to be privatised though at a very late stage the government s decision to include the provinces in the talks with the imf was a welcome move especially since the decision allows the federating units to present their points of view to the imf regarding the integration and harmonisation of sales tax on services at the federal level according to former senate chairman raza rabbani the central governmesnt has agreed with the imf to withdraw collection of sales tax on services from the provinces within one year this responsibility will be entrusted to a proposed centralised single tax agency the provinces are unlikely to surrender their constitutional jurisdiction both sindh and punjab are not against harmonisation of the sales tax collection but differ from the methodology proposed by the imf punjab s finance minister hashim jawan bakht agrees on the need for the harmonisation of tax regimes for the ease of doing business but argues that this can be done without all these taxes clubbed under one source without a well thought out home grown socially

the australian dollar is eyeing trump s twitter and jobs data as rba bides its time image adobe stock aud slides into new week amid litany of risks and headwinds u s china trade war weighs but jobs data is also a risk to aud jobs disappointment could yield rba rate cut as soon as june the australian dollar slipped into the new week close to the bottom of the g10 basket on monday with one eye on the latest wage and employment figures due out in the coming days and the other on a reserve bank of australia rba that left the antipodean currency s detractors empty handed on friday australia s dollar weakened monday amid high levels of concern in the market about the trajectory of u s and chinese trade relations which have turned for the worse ever since president donald trump decided last week to raise the tariff rate levied on some 200 bn of goods exported to america each year from 10 to 25 i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky have a democrat win in which case they would continue to rip off the usa for 500 billion a year donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 11 2019 china has said it will retaliate and financial markets are now bracing to see exactly what shape that response will take although some investors are still clinging to hopes that a severe escalation of the trade conflict can be avoided given presidents trump and xi jingping are set to meet on the sidelines of the june g20 summit in osaka this matters for the australian dollar given how the currency is underwritten to a substantial extent by a gigantic commodity trade with china which might suffer indirectly if the conflict between the world s two largest economies gets out of hand such a thing would be certain to damage the outlook for global economic growth hitting commodity prices in the process and reducing the value of australia s export trade china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in 2020 they love ripping off america donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 12 2019 the us treasury may release its twice yearly report on the currency practices of us trading partners this week day unknown says kim mundy a strategist at commonwealth bank of australia with market participants focused on us china trade tensions any emphasis on china in the treasury report may inject some volatility in markets hurting cnh and aud above australian dollar performance on monday relative to its g10 rivals president trump said last week that he s set the ball rolling on a process that could ultimately result in another 325 bn of china s annual exports to u s being subjected to a blanket tariff of 25 although a formal notification of this is yet to be made by the u s trade representative if the second and larger basket of goods becomes subject to tariffs then the u s will have imposed levies on all of china s annual exports to the u s although those tariff rates could still be increased at a later date as a means of placing additional pressure on the chinese government it s property not cold war that s seen as truly existential by all aussie politicians the same is also true for the rba of course yet the local press are now asking if the cold war might give the reserve bank cover to admit how utterly wrong they have been on everything else and cut i wouldn t put it past them and i wouldn t be long aud either says michael every a strategist at rabobank the u s china trade conflict will remain an influential factor for the australian dollar analysts say but most important in the days ahead is the looming release of the first quarter wage price index on wednesday and thursday s jobs and unemployment numbers which will cover the month of april consensus is looking for a 0 6 increase in the average wage packet during the first quarter to push the annualised rate of australian pay growth up from 2 3 to 2 4 although this will still be far below the 3 level that rba have suggested is necessary to ensure inflation of 2 or more over the long term given the rba s recent communications downside surprises to the australian labour market data this week will raise pricing for a rate cut as soon as june and push aud lower aud can drop more than 1 us cent if the australian labour data disappoints warns cba s mundy above aud usd rate shown at daily intervals the australian dollar received a boost friday when the may monetary policy statement from the reserve bank of australia failed to validate earlier bets by the market that an rba interest rate cut could come as soon as june new zealand s central bank which faces almost as many challenges as the rba took the plunge last week and cut its own cash rate to a new record low of 1 5 which has now brought it into line with australia s rate that led markets to become more bullish in their bets that the rba will follow suit imminently but that idea was challenged rather than validated by friday s statement on monetary policy the rba reiterated friday that future interest rate policy will be dictated by developments in the labour market the rba said friday that an unemployment rate even lower than the current 5 will be necessary in order to get the wage growth that is required in order to inflation to pick up and then hold sustainably within the 2 to 3 target band our au economists argue markets will be very sensitive to downside surprises but we are unlikely to see enough at this stage to tip the rba s hand for june says elsa lignos head of fx strategy at rbc capital markets above pound to australian dollar rate shown at daily intervals pricing in the interest rate derivative market implied on monday an rba cash rate of 1 34 on june 04 and 1 24 on august 06 this means markets are confident a rate cut will have arrived by the time all is said and done at the rba in august but that they re less convinced that one will come before then economic data particularly that focused on the labour market will drive those implied probabilities up and down ahead of the forthcoming meetings and the australian dollar can be expected to fluctuate in line with the evolving outlook both commonwealth bank and westpac two of australia s largest banking firms say the aud usd rate is likely to trade with a downward bias this week but that the exchange rate should fluctuate between 0 70 and 0 72 over three month horizon it was quoted at 0 6970 monday westpac forecasts the pound to australian dollar rate will rise and remain close to the 1 87 level until the end of june it was quoted at 1 8658 monday our base case of gbp usd roughly range bound in the low 1 30s and aud usd slipping back to around 0 70 implies aud gbp returns to the 0 5325 50 area gbp aud to 1 8700 50 by end june says sean callow a strategist at westpac in a recent note to clients
can the us achieve its strategic goals with its campaign of maximum pressure on tehran after 17 days of continuous negotiations marked by sleepless nights standoffs and shouts the world breathed a sigh of relief on july 14 2015 when iran the united states and five other powers announced a pact to curb tehran s nuclear programme the announcement prompted scenes of joy on the streets of tehran with young iranians dancing to celebrate the promise of an end to years of punishing sanctions iran called the deal a major step forward while the us hailed it a step towards a more hopeful and safer world just four years later the landmark accord is in danger of unravelling iran s economy is in crisis and there are fears that hawks in washington are trying to provoke a military confrontation between the us and iran how did we get here and what s next why did the us pull out and impose sanctions on iran on may 8 2018 us president donald trump withdrew from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa negotiated by his predecessor calling it one sided horrible and defective to its core trump said the jcpoa which offered iran sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme did not do enough to curb iran s ballistic missiles programme or address its support for armed groups in the middle east his administration then launched a maximum pressure campaign and reinstated all us sanctions against iran a move us officials said would force tehran to rein in its regional activities halt its missiles project and return to the negotiating table to discuss a new agreement last week washington upped the ante announcing it was deploying warships and bombers to the middle east it cited unspecified threats from tehran for the move what sanctions did us impose on iran in august last year the trump administration slapped sanctions on the purchase or acquisition of us dollar bank notes by iran iran s trade in gold and precious metals transactions using the iranian rial transactions with iran in graphite aluminum steel coal and industrial software transactions related to the issuance of iranian sovereign debt sale to iran of cars and car parts imports to the us of iranian luxury goods such as carpets and caviar sale to iran of commercial passenger aircraft in november washington stepped up the pressure imposing sanctions on iran s oil exports and energy sector financial institutions conducting transactions with the central bank of iran port operators shipping and ship building sectors provision of insurance and financial messaging services to iran and a year after exiting the nuclear deal the us imposed fresh sanctions on iran s metal sector it also revoked sanctions waivers that allowed russia and european countries to conduct civilian nuclear cooperation with iran moreover to date the trump administration has registered more than 900 individuals entities vessels and aircraft on a sanctions list that includes 50 iranian banks and their subsidiaries 200 persons and vessels in iran s shipping and energy sectors as well as iran s national airline and more than 65 of its aircraft how have the sanctions affected iran s economy soon after the us s pull out and threat of sanctions against countries and companies doing business with tehran more than 100 foreign companies ceased doing business with iran and major buyers of iranian crude including india and japan have said they will stop oil imports the us squeeze on iran s economy has caused a financial crisis resulting in mass protests across the country the iranian rial lost more than 60 percent of its value against the dollar last year while inflation is predicted to reach 40 percent this year the economy which shrank by 3 9 percent last year could plummet by another six percent the international monetary fund said that estimate preceded the latest round of us sanctions on iranian oil iranian oil exports fell from 2 5 million barrels per day to 1 million bpd this year the fresh sanctions aim to cut that figure down to zero how has iran reacted following the us s pull out iran said it would continue to comply with the nuclear deal and urged the agreement s remaining signatories the united kingdom france germany russia and china to deliver on the promised economic benefits 190508204815694 but on wednesday iran s president hassan rouhani said tehran would scale back compliance with some of its commitments under the deal and threatened to resume high level uranium enrichment in 60 days if the pact s remaining parties failed to protect iran s oil and banking industries from us sanctions in a speech on saturday he called for unity saying iran was facing unprecedented pressure his government also pledged to mobilise all resources to sell iranian oil in the grey market other iranian officials meanwhile have rejected trump s invitation for talks is the us achieving its aims the new york based eurasia group said the us s pressure campaign has proven successful in a tactical sense as it has halved iranian oil exports and deprived the government of crucial foreign currency however while the fall in revenues could reduce iran s aid to lebanon s hezbollah and militias in iraq and syria sanctions have not moved the us much closer to its ultimate goal either iran s capitulation over its nuclear programme and regional actions or the regime s collapse said the eurasia group others agree the international crisis group icg in a report last november said there was little to no link between iran s economic well being and its regional policies in fact iran intervened in the conflicts in syria yemen and iraq while it was under global sanctions while the economic hardship did trigger protests with protesters rallying against corruption and mismanagement demonstrations so far have not been big enough to threaten iran s government analysts said ali vaez director of the iran project at the icg said iran s counterstrategy would be to resist and survive rather than trying to achieve the unattainable goal of iran s surrender they should act to prevent another costly us war of choice he wrote in the atlantic magazine this would require stepping back from maximalist demands and using sanctions as scalpel not a chainsaw how has europe responded the three european union signatory nations as well as russia and china oppose the us s withdrawal the eu has rejected iran s 60 day ultimatum and appealed against escalatory steps it also said it would pursue the setting up of instex a new trade channel to bypass us sanctions ellie geranmayeh a senior fellow at the european council for foreign relations said both sides should move quickly to launch the system and european leaders should consider efforts to provide iran with some economic relief that includes allowing transactions in the humanitarian sector to take place and allowing iran to repatriate some of its own money sitting in european bank accounts which have reportedly been blocked due to us pressure if europe treats this matter with the urgency it requires there could be creative paths for political brinkmanship that de escalate the current scenario she wrote what about china and russia china iran s biggest oil customer is a major factor in the effectiveness of any sanctions regime on iran said kenneth katzman a specialist in middle eastern affairs in a report for the us congressional research service china formally protested us sanctions on iranian oil but media reports say beijing appears to have reduced its oil imports from iran since the us moves the reuters news agency citing unnamed sources said on friday that chinese companies were erring on the side of caution unless they received a government mandate to keep ordering oil from iran russia meanwhile blamed the us for iran s decision to roll back its commitments under the nuclear deal in december 2018 iran signed a free trade deal with the russia led eurasian economic union a move katzman said suggested a russian intent not to abide by reimposed us sanctions on iran

volverá a la ideología de bolívar translate los revolucionarios no toman caca cola no se trata solamente de un capricho sino de una sana actitud en todos los sentidos desde la solidaridad con el pueblo colombiano donde la empresa caca cola ha cometido los más grandes abusos contra sus trabajadores incluyendo el presunto secuestro y asesinato de los dirigentes del sindicato hasta la proteccion de la salud de nuestros hijos enviciados por ese jarabe de cola y azucar que les produce obesidad prematura pensemos tambien los revolucionarios que ese dinero que gastamos en los refrescos es utilizado por esas empresas para financiar el terrorismo en nuestro país es cierto no se trata solo de la caca cola sino tambien de la cerveza de los cigarrillos y todos esos articulos innecesarios y mas que eso dañinos para nuestra salud podriamos incluso pensar en un dia de parada para cada uno de ellos es cuestion de irnos organizando pero para empezar que tal si dejamos de comprar caca cola y sus similares cuando lo extraordinario se vuelve cotidiano discurso del acto de grado en barinas en 12 de febrero del 2005 queridos graduandos más que un discurso quiero dirigirles algunas palabras que escribí anoche después de visitar en las clínicas a los estudiantes heridos a consecuencia de los enfrentamientos con la policía de hace apenas dos días me ha tocado por razones del destino ser la persona que les otorgue el titulo que bien merecieron con sus estudios y me siento sumamente orgulloso de serlo me consta que la universidad de los llanos occidentales ezequiel zamora a pesar de lo dicho por los enemigos de esta universidad es una universidad de primera no tendremos la mejor planta física en los salones hace calor en el comedor hace calor pero no es en lo material que las cosas deben valorarse el mayor capital es el ser humano y en eso nuestra unellez lo digo con conocimiento de causa esta sobrada los llaneros venezolanos son nobles valientes de coraje en la unellez hacen vida en este momento aproximadamente 67000 personas el 97 de ellas son estudiantes jóvenes que como ustedes hasta el día de hoy buscan ese titulo que constata los años de dedicación y de estudio los jóvenes son el río de la vida ustedes graduados deben ser los capitanes de esos barcos que naveguen por el río de la vida nuestra patria atraviesa momentos muy difíciles porque decidió dejar de ser esa matrona de edad vetusta y complaciente para ser joven rebelde y altanera nuestra imagen ya no es la de una acaudalada ricachona mayamera en nuestro rostro brilla ahora la sonrisa del che guevara con su diente delantero torcido su pelo largo y su boina con la estrella entender esto a mí me ha tomado prácticamente toda la vida tengo 53 años y ya perdí mi oportunidad de derramar sangre joven a causa de un ideal ustedes son jóvenes están en la flor de la vida no cometan por favor el error de renunciar a su instinto de rebelión el che guevara fue ministro de a economía en cuba los billetes y las monedas se adornaban con su rostro nada de eso le importó primero fue a angola donde pasó un penoso año de combate después se fue a bolivia donde encontró la muerte el che era el último que comía el que cargaba la mochila mas pesada siempre se sacrificaba por los demás en un estoicismo que mas parecía fervor religioso que ideología marxista si quieren un modelo de vida ahí lo tienen dije hace unos momentos que el 97 de la población de la unellez es estudiante se imaginan ustedes la universidad que podríamos tener si todos los estudiantes tuvieran la abnegación la combatividad del che los momentos que se avecinan van a requerir de una gran unidad del pueblo venezolano la alternativa de continuar siendo libres o regresar a la pobreza se nos planteará en los próximos días de forma enmascarada o quizás peor desenmascarada vestida con uniforme de soldado del imperio por nuestra parte podemos esperar lo mejor la macroeconomía no podría ir mejor la justicia social ha mejorado notablemente las misiones ocupan un papel muy importante en el pago de dicha justicia social aquí en barinas ya hemos cumplido con dos de las misiones la misión robinsón y la misión sucre no hay analfabetismo y no hay exclusión en la educación superior en estas tierras de zamora pero ay malhaya son precisamente estos éxitos los que nos hacen más antipáticos al imperio para ellos somos inclusive un mal ejemplo que se esta contagiando al resto del continente y cuidado sino al resto del mundo nunca venceremos al imperio estará siempre ahí acechando por lo menos hasta que el mismo no se autodestruya porque sépanlo señores el neoliberalismo es caníbal cuando le ataque el hambre se devorará a si mismo ustedes queridos graduandos a partir de hoy pasan a conformar la elite profesional que debe sostener este país en los próximos cuarenta o cincuenta años años decisivos para el logro de nuestra libertad y del rescate de nuestra soberanía no se dejen comprar no se dejen corromper no se dejen gritar no se dejen pisar que nadie les diga qué comer o qué vestirse o qué leer sean siempre auténticos rebeldes contestatarios pero eso si profundamente patriotas dignos de ser hijos de

que dañen los tubos de pvc los productos endulzantes ligth tienen una vida media muy corta por ejemplo el aspartamo después de tres semanas mojado pasa a tener gusto de trapo viejo sucio para evitar eso se agregan una infinidad de otros productos químicos uno para alargar la vida del aspartamo otro para neutralizar el color otro para mantener el tercer químico en suspensión porque sino el fondo de la gaseosa quedaría oscuro otro para evitar la cristalización del aspartamo otro para realzar el sabor dar mas intensidad al acido cítrico o fosforito que perdería su sabor por el efecto de los cuatro productos químicos iniciales y así sucesivamente un consejo final después de toda mi experiencia con la producción de bebidas embasadas puedo afirmar sin dudar un segundo la mejor bebida es el agua como también los jugos exprimidos de naranja o limón nada más cero azúcar y cero sal publicado por loretahur margarina o mantequilla la margarina fue producida originalmente para engordar a los pavos cuandolo que hizo en realidad fue matarlos las personas que habían puesto el dinero para la investigación quisieronrecobrarlo así que empezaron a pensar en una forma de hacerlo tenían una sustancia blanca que no tenía ningún atractivo como comestible así que le añadieron el color amarillo para vendérselo a lagente en lugar de la mantequilla qué tal ésa ahora han sacado algunos nuevos sabores para vender más alos incautos como usted y yo conoce usted la diferencia entre la margarina y la mantequilla siga leyendo hasta el final porque se pone bastante interesante comparación entre mantequilla y margarina 1 ambas tienen la misma cantidad de calorías 2 la mantequilla es ligeramente más alta en grasas saturadas 8 gramos comparada con los 5 gramos que tiene la margarina 3 comer margarina en vez de mantequilla puede aumentar en 53 el riesgo deenfermedades coronarias en las mujeres de acuerdo con un estudiomédico reciente de la universidad de harvard 4 comer mantequilla aumenta la absorción de gran cantidad de nutrientesque se encuentran en otros alimentos 5 la mantequilla provee beneficios nutricionales propios mientras lamargarina tiene sólo los que le hayan sido añadidos al fabricarla 6 la mantequilla sabe mucho mejor que la margarina y mejora el sabor deotros alimentos 7 la mantequilla ha existido durante siglos mientras que la margarinatiene menos de 100 años ahora sobre la margarina 1 es muy alta en ácidos grasos trans sí ésos que recién ahora loscientíficos descubrieron que son malísimos y los gobiernoscomenzaron a prohibirlos 2 triple riesgo de enfermedades coronarias 3 aumenta el colesterol total y el ldl el colesterol malo y disminuye elhdl el colesterol bueno 4 aumenta en cinco veces el riesgo de cáncer 5 disminuye la calidad de la leche materna 6 disminuye la reacción inmunológica del organismo 7 disminuye la reacción a la insulina y he aquí el factor más inquietante aquí está la parte más interesante a la margarina le falta una molécula para ser plástico sólo este hecho es suficiente para evitar el uso de la margarina de porvida y de cualquier otra cosa que sea hidrogenada esto significaque se le añade hidrógeno lo cual cambia la estructura molecular de lassubstancias usted puede ensayar lo siguiente compre un poco de margarina y déjela en el garaje o en un sitio sombreado dentro de unos días notará dos cosas no habrá moscas ni siquiera esos molestos bichos se le acercarán esto yale debe decir a usted algo no se pudre ni huele mal o diferente porque no tiene valor nutritivo nadacrece en ella ni siquiera los diminutos microorganismos puedencrecer en ella por qué porque es casi plástico no a la guerra si a la paz misterios de la ciencia los costos de la guerra medicos y capitalismo capitalismo medicos 2

president trump next year takes shape the party has a clear current front runner democrats also have a swarm of other candidates all trying to gain in polls and lock in enough individual donors to make it to a debate stage in miami on june 26 or 27 under democratic national committee rules for those scraping the bottom of the polling and donor barrels the hourglass is running low candidates now have a month until june 12 to qualify through polling prerequisites for invitations to the first debate according to fivethirtyeight 18 candidates have qualified for the debates while others sit on

met the polling threshold but not the donor metrics aired her grievances about what she views as the arbitrary donor rules created by the dnc cnn in a race where candidates can ill afford a major setback missing the debate stage would qualify as one in other words the race is on as for the front runner former vice president joe biden is showing off a more disciplined version of himself in his third presidential bid according to amie parnes at an event in las vegas last week biden declined to respond in his typical fashion when a supporter yelled that he could hug and kiss me anytime instead he laughed before pivoting back to his stump speech showing off a more restrained candidate his supporters believe could go a long way toward securing the party s nomination next year polling

fashion sen amy klobuchar d minn made one of the first trips by a presidential candidate to puerto rico which has been in the news lately amid the fight for disaster aid and what democrats see as trump s dismissal of the territory and its recovery from devastating hurricanes some candidates are taking aim at biden particularly over combating climate change after an adviser for biden described a pending policy proposal as a push to seek a middle ground progressives in the race weighed in sanders and washington gov jay inslee d both criticized the former vice president while rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y a leading progressive voice in congress said a middle ground plan is a dealbreaker the new york times jonathan allen as biden predicts a shorter race rivals dig in for long fight another area where democrats have tried to carve out space is the economy which trump is sure to claim as his own given the 3 6 percent unemployment rate and rising wages however as max greenwood reports democrats have avoided giving trump credit for a strong economy instead they salute former president obama and the policies he shepherded after the great recession the presidential race is

resort of sochi where he ll meet with putin and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov on tuesday morgan chalfant reports that arms control is at the top of pompeo s list with putin but the roster is long the hill trump spoke with putin by phone for 90 minutes earlier this month and brought up what he called a russian hoax referring to the two year investigation by special counsel robert mueller the new york times schumer in a statement on sunday encouraged the secretary to warn the russian leader that any attempt to interfere in u s elections will not be tolerated citing mueller s findings and indictments brought against russians tied to moscow s 2016 election interference schumer advised the administration without specifics to convey to putin that any action to interfere in our elections will be met with an immediate and robust response china and trade escaping the tariffs war waged between the trump administration and china appeared as murky over the weekend as it was when trade negotiations broke up on friday in washington chinese vice premier liu he told state media that beijing s negotiators did not retreat from any preliminary commitments to the trump administration adding that u s trade tariffs would need to be lifted as a threshold in future discussions both governments said negotiators expect talks to resume but no date has been set the united states is prepared for china to retaliate in the wake of trump s decision to escalate tariffs on 200 billion in imported chinese goods to 25 percent as punishment for what the president described as beijing s backtracking on commitments u s negotiators insist china made during negotiations the hill white house economic adviser larry kudlow said trump is likely to meet with chinese president xi jinping at the g20 summit to be held next month in japan reuters we want to be as sure as we can be we don t think the chinese have come far enough kudlow said on fox news sunday the problem is two weeks ago in china there was backtracking by the chinese we can t forget this this is a huge deal with the broadest scope and scale the two countries have ever had before he added but we have to get through a lot of issues for many years china trade it was unfair one of the sticking points right now is we would like these corrections in an agreement which is codified by law in china the hill the president took to twitter over the weekend to defend his decision to impose high tariffs on chinese goods which raise prices for u s consumers trump suggested for the first time that the federal government may offer another round of taxpayer funded subsidies to u s farmers who complain of significant losses as china s imports of american wheat and soybeans plummet an earlier program offered the u s agriculture sector up to 12 billion in temporary relief but some farmers complain they have not received federal subsidies for which they applied on saturday trump again suggested that a trade deal with china had eluded his administration because beijing wants to wait until after the 2020 election to see who will occupy the oval office i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky have a democrat win in which case they would continue to rip off the usa for 500 billion a year trump wrote the only problem is that they know i am going to win best economy employment numbers in u s history much more and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs the president continued in that vein on sunday arguing the united states is right where we need to be with china the hill

dan ikenson director of the cato institute s herbert a stiefel center for trade policy studies a think tank that favors free trade he has imposed duties on 250 billion worth of chinese goods and another 70 billion with the aluminum tariffs and other tariffs ikenson added i think there were some serious miscalculations done by president trump and lighthizer and we re going to be in far worse

president donald trump s decision to renew his trade war with china will hurt us consumers but the ultimate impact depends on how far he takes the fight economists say photo tom brenner ny times president donald trump s chief economic adviser said on monday that american consumers would bear some pain from the escalating trade war with china contradicting trump s claim that his tariffs are a multibillion dollar mostly one way payment by china to the us treasury the comments from larry kudlow the director of the national economic council came after the 11th round of trade negotiations broke off without a deal prompting trump to raise tariffs on us 200 billion worth of chinese products and begin a process to impose levies on nearly every product china exports to the united states in fact both sides will pay kudlow said on fox news sunday both sides will suffer on this kudlow s acknowledgement of economic pain while widely shared by economists contradicted the president s view that trade wars are easy to win and that the burden falls disproportionately on america s trading partners both kudlow and the president say that a protracted trade war will ultimately be in the united states financial interest kudlow said that any pain would be worth the price if it forced china to treat us companies more fairly you ve got to do what you got to do kudlow said we have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the united states this is worthwhile doing negotiations between the countries broke down last week after administration officials accused the chinese of backtracking on several key provisions of a proposed deal including changes to chinese law administration officials insist the talks have been constructive and say they will continue possibly including a meeting next month between trump and president xi jinping of china at the group of 20 summit meeting next month in osaka japan but trump has muddied that message with tweets suggesting he would be happy to leave tariffs in place indefinitely trump s confidence in the strength of the us economy is fueling his decision to escalate the trade fight but it is an economic gamble one that could inflict lasting damage depending on how far trump is willing to take his battle and what it produces in the end in a tweet on monday trump said the united states was right where we want to be with china adding that the us will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china we will then spend match or better the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers agriculture which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world great maga donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 12 2019 economists differ on how much the trade war will crimp economic growth but most agree that the cost of tariffs is passed on to businesses or consumers in the form of higher prices on everything including lighting fixtures and art supplies among the items covered by the administration s latest increase in tariffs to 25 per cent computers toilet paper dog collars christmas tree lights and mattress supports the new tariff will not knock the us economy into recession forecasters say but it will hurt economic growth and could do so drastically if trump follows through with his plan to place the tariff on all imports from china the united states imported us 540 billion worth of goods from china in 2018 according to government statistics trump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the chinese chad bown an expert on trade at the peterson institute for international economics said last week and american businesses and consumers stand to pay the price tariffs enacted last year reduced the inflation adjusted income of us consumers by us 4 4 billion each month by november according to one study that loss which arose both from the tariff and from more expensive or foregone imports breaks out to about us 419 per household over a year the latest round of increases will push the per household cost above us 800 said david weinstein a columbia university economist and a co author on the research trump and his advisers insist his approach will ultimately pay off for the us economy either by prodding china to open its markets and treat american firms more fairly or by encouraging companies to shift manufacturing to the us to avoid tariffs but the decision to prolong the trade war could upend economic projections that showed robust hiring growth and investment this year in part because of fading concerns about a protracted trade fight and it could defy steady predictions by administration economists that trump s trade policy will help increase growth in 2019 to 3 2 per cent well above what most other forecasters expect larry kudlow trump s chief economic adviser speaks to reporters outside the white house photo sarah silbiger the new york times there is absolutely no question that these tariffs if imposed and sustained increase the probability of a recession rob martin a former federal reserve section chief who is now an executive director at ubs said of a potential escalation it makes you more vulnerable martin and his colleagues estimate that trump s latest increase could shave 0 25 to 0 35 percentage points off gross domestic product over six months if the remainder of china s products get hit with a 25 per cent tariff it could shave up to another full percentage point from gdp if we move into that next tranche of tariffs we re in 100 per cent uncharted territory martin said the products in that category are about two thirds consumer goods and for many which could include toys bicycles and iphones it could be hard to find quick substitutes but a prolonged trade war could inflict damage on china s economy economic growth in china slowed in the second half of last year in part because tariffs hurt business confidence since then the chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state run banks into service extending credit officials said last month that the economy grew 6 4 per cent in the first quarter of the year matching the pace from the previous quarter but trump is clearly banking on a protracted fight to shift the economic calculus warning china in a tweet that a deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term while trump is confident in his approach his decision to add new trade barriers with china in the form of higher tariffs has confounded analysts and some business groups that have otherwise praised his handling of the economy analysts at the tax foundation a washington think tank that forecast a large increase to economic growth from the tax cuts trump signed in 2017 now say that the tariffs the president has put in place or threatened and the effects of chinese retaliatory tariffs on american exporters would more than cancel out all the economic benefits of the tax law the tariffs if allowed to continue will mute the economic benefits of tax reform said nicole m kaeding a tax foundation economist particularly for low and middle income consumers who will be stuck paying higher prices economists argue about many things but the impact of tariffs on the economy is not debated they are harmful many of those groups say growth would be even stronger this year if trump had reached a deal with china and averted a prolonged government shutdown they blame trump s fundamental misunderstanding of tariffs which he believes are lifting the economy for driving the country into a danger zone analysts at goldman sachs said in a research note that further escalation of the trade war could reduce growth by nearly half a percentage point this year and that if trade tensions sparked a major sell off in the equity market the growth impact could worsen considerably stocks swooned last week but had begun to rebound by friday financial conditions have tightened but remain well below levels seen late last year so far us markets don t express a lot of concern i think everybody expects a deal said roberto perli an economist at cornerstone macro the risk is that time passes nothing happens and the market realises maybe we were too optimistic trump has expressed satisfaction with big beautiful tariffs that he said were producing billions of dollars for america i am very happy with over us 100 billion a year in tariffs filling us coffers great for us not good for china trump said on twitter last week of the us 419 per household cost of last year s tariffs most of the hit us 286 came from the levy itself because the us government collected that money it was able to redistribute it including through a us 12 billion program of farm subsidies but that could change as the trade war persists it s pretty likely that the tariff revenue is going to fall weinstein of columbia university said as firms find themselves unable to shoulder the higher rates and stop importing from china we re going to see a lot of supply chains shifting around that means chinese companies will also lose out as businesses buy more american made goods or continue turning to other low cost producers outside china like vietnam and malaysia trump s shift on tariffs appears to have surprised fed officials who had been expecting the trade dispute to calm down this month fed chairman jerome h powell told reporters at a news conference that risks to growth from trade policy had moderated somewhat citing reports of progress in the trade talks between the united states and china it is unlikely that powell and his colleagues will react quickly to the higher tariffs and renewed trade war the fed will most likely judge any inflation that comes from trade policy as temporary and may want to see economic growth weakening before acting on it through a rate cut or other measures the fed is unlikely to act immediately in part because it is unclear whether this drama will end in a deal an all out trade war or something in between said krishna guha head of the global policy and central bank strategy team at advisory firm evercore isi if the central bank does react it is more likely that it would cut rates to offset the economic pain raphael bostic the president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta said at a national association for business economics conference last week that the tariff increase could prompt a rate cut if higher costs cause consumers to pull back depending on the severity of the response guha concurred saying that the fed would not hesitate to react if there were signs of a real risk to economic growth instead they will most likely cut rates on insurance grounds in particular given weak inflation

outlook there is nothing out there in the financial environment that is dollar unfavorable there are plenty of political things that don t favor the dollar but not financial things that is the universal consensus the dollar is the top safe haven and while some other havens may also benefit the dollar can t lose let s just note that by the time an opinion outlook is universal it s wrong we continue to get projections of all the terrible outcomes of the trade war with china just one from the wsj reports direct foreign investment from china already fell to 5 billion last year a seven year low from 29 billion in 2017 according to a report wednesday by rhodium group that is because china clamped down on capital outflows and more of the u s became off limits the firm estimates 2 5 billion in chinese acquisitions were abandoned because of concerns raised by the committee on foreign investment in the u s a secretive treasury led panel that vets foreign investment for security risks then there are all the estimates of the cost to households 600 800 per year each when tariffs on about 25 of the 6000 items start hitting that includes 11 3 billion in furniture 9 2 billion in auto parts and 6 6 billion in luggage nyt you can see the full list of 11 609 items in lurid detail at inside a ton of inflation data from friday is this chart from goldman via the daily shot consumer prices are indeed going up because of tariffs no kidding sherlock but another factor is real average hourly wages outpacing the cpi too a last gasp hope lies in trump meeting xi at g20 in june where the two authoritarians could decide to make a deal regardless of details over the weekend the wsj reports the official people s daily newspaper said the text of any trade agreement must be balanced and expressed in a way that is acceptable to the chinese people and does not undermine the country s sovereignty and dignity trump understands pride it s not clear he understands dignity not to downplay the awful outcomes of the trade war many of which are still unknown but in the us the loss of jobs related to exports to china is about 300 000 easily digested the farm sector is going to get subsidies and we americans are dedicated devoted consumers nothing is going to stop us shopping this is not to be snide about materialism but rather to express faith in american resilience seafood imported from china gets too expensive substitute from japan and thailand maybe even the more fashionable seaweed that one may seem a little silly and of course there are plenty of things for which there is simply no substitute but on the whole the sky is not falling well not yet we have about a month to go before the sky falls the us adds everything to the tariff list and china retaliates anz bank says there s a 60 chance that china and us won t reach a deal according to bloomberg the bank of singapore feels the same way we are increasingly skeptical that any meaningful agreement or even progress will be made in the near future bonds have not really priced in the complete collapse of u s sino trade talks another bloomberg report from an asia hand also predicts no resolution any time soon today trump again accused china of reneging which china denies stalemate china had demanded the us remove the 10 tariffs or no deal and the us never put that on the table now of course the size has gone up from 10 to 25 trump wrote today i say openly to president xi all of my many friends in china that china will be hurt very badly if you don t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave china for other countries you had a great deal almost completed you backed out trump also tweeted china should not retaliate will only get worse it s not clear whether trump s tweets reach the public in china where censors work overtime to keep out whatever news they don t like this surely qualifies for its part china is pretending the usis the one that reneged going back on its word to remove the tariffs normally we don t believe lyin donnie but all the reports we saw leading up to the debacle said the 10 tariffs were not up for discussion the us was always going to keep them that means it s not really a breakdown in communication it does seem as though the failure is china s fault it was never going to change the laws as the us demanded according to bloomberg today we get details on how the us is going to raise the tariff to 25 on all the remaining imports from china about 300 billion we still await china s retaliation to shift gears the us economy and the mood of both businesses and consumers relies more on where the fed is going than on the trade story we have at least three fed speakers today we are impressed by an article in the newsletter wolfstreet by wolf richter that a twist in policy is on its way instead of rates lower to the point of qe we could be getting rate pegging which is what japan is doing fed gov brainard may have let the cat out of the bag heralding a shift in how to handle a crisis let s say short term rates go to zero unlike other central banks the fed refuses to contemplate zero so it could announce a target for slightly longer dated interest rates such as one year rates and it would buy just enough securities with those maturities to bring the one year yield down to the target range and if more stimulus is needed it might target two year rates she said under this policy the federal reserve would stand ready to use its balance sheet to hit the targeted interest rate but unlike the asset purchases that were undertaken in the recent recession there would be no specific commitments with regard to purchases of treasury securities the fed would announce that it wants the one year yield to be at 1 for example and if the fed is credible in its announcement it might not have to buy many securities to get the one year yield to target pegging is what the fed did during wwii the interest rate peg became effective in july 1942 and lasted through june 1947 the reserve banks reduced their discount rate to 1 percent and created a preferential rate of one half percent for loans secured by short term government obligations substantially below the 3 to 7 percent that had been common during the 1920s a few years ago former fed chairman bernanke illustrated how a peg works suppose that the overnight interest rate were at zero and the two year treasury rate were at 2 percent the fed could announce that it intends to hold the two year rate at one percent or less and enforce this ceiling by standing ready to buy any treasury security maturing up to two years at a price that corresponds to a return of one percent since the price of a bond is inversely related to its yield the fed would effectively be offering to pay more than the initial market value think of it as price support for two year government debt an appealing feature is that once the paper matures the fed has an automatic exit and the balance sheet is unchanged wolf notes this rate peg approach to qe would not be designed to inflate asset prices unlike classic qe which was specifically designed to inflate all asset prices in order to create the wealth effect instead a rate peg of this type is designed to make borrowing cheaper along certain parts of the yield curve while minimizing the amount of securities the fed would have to buy to do this and with the automatic exit feature it would not cause the lingering issues classic qe is now causing wall street hype artists and assorted qe mongers that have been calling for qe for months would be deeply disappointed with this rate peg approach instead of proper tried and true qe this has the smell and feel of authenticity we are going to be see sawing back and forth between china

gold prices turned around and could move higher following the announcement of china s tariffs on u s goods this move makes sense because not only did treasury yields fall further along with the stock market but the u s dollar weakened like i said before gold is not a favorite safe haven asset but foreign demand for it will increase if the u s dollar weakens gold prices moved higher on monday after struggling earlier in the session despite a drop in u s treasury yields and renewed shedding of higher risk assets traders attributed the early weakness to u s china trade tensions which are pressuring the chinese yuan making gold bullion expensive for buyers in the world s largest consumer china some analysts are calling gold a safe haven asset but this hasn t been the case lately the safe havens at this time are the u s dollar the japanese yen the swiss franc and u s treasurys so don t expect a miraculous rally in gold unless for some reason the dollar weakens along with u s treasury yields and the stock market early indications are that the miraculous event may be the announcement new tariffs against the u s from china at 12 40 gmt june comex gold is trading 1290 50 up 3 10 or 0 26 geopolitical events the main event that traders are watching is the breakdown in negotiations between the united states and china and the possible escalation of the more than yearlong trade dispute between the economic powerhouses advertisement advertisement just a short while ago china announced it is raising tariffs on 60 billion of u s goods to 25 starting on june 1 this is in retaliation to president trump s decision to boost levies on 200 billion worth of china made goods to 25 as of last friday in the middle east saudi arabia said on monday that two saudi oil tankers were among vessels targeted by a sabotage attack of the coast of the united arab emirates condemning it as an attempt to undermine the security of global crude supplies according to cnbc the uae said on sunday that four commercial vessels were attacked near fujairah one of the world s largest bunkering hubs the port lies near the strait of hormuz one of the world s most important oil export waterways it also said that iran s foreign ministry called the incidents worrisome and dreadful and asked for an investigation into the matter daily forecast gold prices turned around and could move higher following the announcement of china s tariffs on u s goods this move makes sense because not only did treasury yields fall further along with the stock market but the u s dollar weakened like i said before gold is not a favorite safe haven asset but foreign demand for it will increase if the u s dollar weakens advertisement advertisement the dollar may have weakened because investors may have begun pricing in a possible u s recession if this were to occur then the fed would be forced to cut interest rates if rates are cut then the dollar will become a less desirable asset a weaker dollar will lead to increased demand for dollar denominated gold and prices will go up that s all you need to know don t focus on geopolitical events watch how they affect the u s dollar story continues this article was originally posted on fx empire more from fxempire

decades those hopes are now replaced by concerns that the trade war could crimp what is otherwise a mostly healthy economy analysts have warned that failed trade talks and the deterioration in relations will put a dent in the u s and china s economic prospects the larger issue with the tariffs isn t the specific amounts of tariffs at any given time but the uncertainty that s surrounding

the international monetary fund imf from 1973 to 1978 all while enlarging the fund s role as a lender and manager of the global economy has died aged 97 dr witteveen pronounced vit uh vane was a longtime practitioner and leader of universal sufism a religious philosophy rooted in islam and was known by fellow sufis as murshid karimbakhsh witteveen his death was announced by the international sufi movement which is headquartered in the netherlands dour and ascetic with a reputation as a soft spoken consensus builder witteveen arrived at the imf during a period in which some economists questioned its very existence the fund had been established in large part to manage the world s system of fixed currency exchange rates but that financial order collapsed after the united states floated the dollar in 1971 and the imf seemed to become an organisation without a mission in the aftermath of the 1973 arab israeli war oil prices exploded eventually quadrupling exacerbating a period of global recession and inflation dubbed stagflation for the first time since the great depression each of the world s major economies was in a recession at the same time as managing director of the imf witteveen helped quiet the waters engineering an 8bn relief measure in which oil producing nations recycled revenue to poorer countries in the form of imf loans used to buy oil address payment imbalances and prop up world trade countries were instructed to adopt belt tightening adjustment measures in exchange for the loans enough is enough says imf as spending spree revives us economy show

enough is enough says imf as spending spree revives us economy 543929 bin ap what witteveen did was bring back to being relevant in a world in which poor countries that didn t export oil were extremely vulnerable said harold james a financial historian at princeton university he reoriented the fund from thinking about a world in which there were fixed exchange rates and where the bigger countries needed policing to a world in which capital is moving and creating instability witteveen negotiated the loan packages himself drawing on his political experience in the netherlands a member of the socially liberal pro business people s party for freedom and democracy he was elected to both houses of his country s legislature served two stints as minister of finance and was deputy prime minister from 1967 to 1971 under piet de jong describing his dutch political career the observer once called him a velvet fist in an iron glove at the imf witteveen stood firm against the nixon and ford administrations which urged him to denounce opec after some members of the organisation of oil producing states issued an embargo against nations that supported israel during the 1973 arab israeli war that aside witteveen was generally credited with repairing the relationship between the us and the imf where his predecessor pierre paul schweitzer had battled with the nixon administration over floating the dollar witteveen compromising between nations that favoured fixed rate and floating currency exchanges negotiated an arrangement in which the fund could exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of its member countries recommended imf slashes global growth forecast and warns on trade war in 1976 he signed off on a then record 3 9bn emergency loan to britain when the pound had lost much of its value and inflation had risen above 25 per cent the bailout helped stabilise the country s finances and was part of a wave of loan packages that dramatically increased the fund s role as an international lender according to the new york times member countries were borrowing less than 1bn from the fund in 1973 when witteveen took office four years later borrowing topped 7bn in his final year as managing director witteveen collected 10bn from the fund s wealthy members to create a new loan programme dubbed the witteveen facility for needy countries upon his retirement the economist magazine likened the imf to a phoenix saying it had risen from the ashes of fixed exchange rates and quadrupled oil prices with its claim intact to be the overseer of those parts of the world s monetary system that the world allows it to oversee over the next five years under mr jacques de larosiere the imf s path will be strewn with familiar rocks the magazine continued referring to witteveen s successor mr witteveen has done much to chart the best routes round them hendrikus johannes witteveen was born in the town of zeist in central netherlands on 12 june 1921 his father was an urban planner and his grandfather was a socialist senator what witteveen did was bring back to being relevant in a world in which poor countries that didn t export oil were extremely vulnerable harold james financial historian at princeton university witteveen studied at the netherlands school of economics now erasmus university rotterdam under jan tinbergen who was later awarded the first nobel prize in economics he received a doctorate in 1947 and worked as a government economist and a professor at his alma mater launching his political career when he entered the senate in 1958 although many of witteveen s supporters assumed he would run for a second term as imf managing director he chose instead to retire citing personal reasons that included the illness of one of his children he went on to become the first chair of the group of thirty a washington based nonprofit organisation that researches international economic and monetary affairs and also served on the boards of companies including royal dutch petroleum and the asset management firm robeco witteveen s wife liesbeth de vries feijens an oncology professor died in 2006 they had four children including willem witteveen a dutch politician who died in 2014 aboard malaysia airlines flight 17 the plane was shot down over eastern ukraine amid conflict between the government in kiev and russian backed separatists a dutch inquiry later concluded the aircraft was downed by a missile that came from the russian military witteveen was co president of the international sufi movement a sufi organisation that espouses universal harmony the sort of peaceful coexistence of nations and people witteveen sought through his work at the imf often even at the height of his career he seemed more interested in discussing the mysteries of the human soul than the intricacies of global finance western man has directed himself too much toward the external he said according to a 1973 profile in the times too many fear the internal life the mystical world is the most beautiful experience it is a pure gift of god johannes witteveen economist and imf chief born 12 june 1921 died 23 april 2019

eliminated also both sides have different opinions on the volume of additional purchase of us goods from china as noted by a commentary by state news agency xinhua any purchases should be in line with reality the biggest issue though is likely on the text regarding law changes regarding core issues like ip theft which china sees as intrusion of sovereignty liu said that every nation has its dignity so the text ought to be balanced the people s daily china s propaganda media echoed on monday it said that at no time will china forfeit the country s respect and no one should expect china to swallow

president recep tayyip erdogan s mishandling of his country s currency crisis heightens substantially the probability that turkey will soon default on its external debt that could jeopardise the rest of the emerging market economies prospects as well european banks particularly in spain with high turkish debt exposure behind argentina turkey has the dubious distinction of having the world s second worst performing currency after plunging by 30 in 2018 since the start of this year the currency has lost a further 14 in value and shows no signs of stabilising at the heart of the swooning turkish lira has been the loss of domestic and foreign investor confidence in the government s ability and willingness to correct the large economic imbalances built up by years of overly easy monetary and fiscal policies it has hardly helped investor confidence that inflation has been allowed to rise to 20 or four times the central bank of the republic of turkey s official inflation target nor has it helped that erdogan has leant heavily on the central bank to refrain from raising interest rates to stem the currency s slide and to curb inflation there are many other ways in which the president seems to have gone out of his way to undermine confidence in the currency these include getting rid of competent economic officials in favour of yes men like the appointment of his son in law as minister of finance to run the economy they also have included his success in overturning the istanbul local election and his further souring relations with the us by his close co operation with russia on defence issues turkey has an exceedingly high level of short term external debt and its corporate sector has borrowed excessively in dollar terms it is estimated that over the next year the country must make 180bn in external debt service payments this comes at a time when its international reserves have already dwindled to around three months of import payment it is also estimated that its corporate sector has borrowed 300bn in dollar terms with a servicing burden becoming more onerous as the lira falls and the economy contracts erdogan is showing no signs of urgency in addressing the currency crisis he is in fact adding to political uncertainty by forcing a rerun of the istanbul local election this risks having the currency succumb to another round of its vicious cycle a weakening currency could very well lead to corporate bankruptcies that further erode investor confidence and deepen currency weakness that could add to political instability which would be yet another factor contributing to currency weakness and to a draining of investor confidence erdogan must soon recognise that once lost investor confidence is difficult to restore that might induce him to do something radical like call in the international monetary fund or fire his finance minister this would show that he has become serious about breaking the downward economic spiral in which the country finds itself otherwise the rest of the emerging market economies and the spanish banking system should brace themselves for economic shock waves coming from a turkish debt default desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney
20 years of mixing asean old and new when asean doubled the number of its member nations to 10 in 1999 doomsayers at the time believed the grouping would not survive this was because the expansion happened so quickly while new members were ill prepared to join the capitalist economies granted the prevailing regional environment asean leaders were quick to welcome myanmar and the indochinese countries cambodia vietnam and laos clmv despite their deep rooted shortcomings back in the leaders minds leaving them out would further widen the five decade wedge between them at the time two frequently asked questions were could the clmv group integrate with the older asean members would asean 10 survive at all with such a huge gap among its member states in development and vast differences in their political cultures two decades later the answers are quite clear these new members are moving toward full integration in three key development pillars economically politically and security wise as well as in socio cultural terms after various political twists and turns from 1997 1999 cambodia was the last indochinese country to join asean in 1999 exactly two decades ago realising the founding fathers dream of one southeast asia with all members under the same roof in fact the 10 member asean group was originally mapped out in 1997 when asean leaders were ready to embrace laos myanmar and cambodia at the same time after vietnam s admission in 1995 laos asked for a two year delay to prepare much to the chagrin of cambodian prime minister hun sen asean delayed cambodia s membership due to concerns related to the grouping s political culture and best practices asean s enlargement came during a time when the external landscape was no longer dominated by ideological struggles between superpowers a new configuration of major powers began to emerge a decade after the fall of the berlin wall created a regional economic and political landscape that allowed friends and foes to join hands and chase joint development and cooperation it was an interesting time as the bloc s expansion gave asean more bargaining power which outweighed the negative repercussions depending on the new members ability to adapt when the jakarta based asean secretariat started to use the popular acronym clmv in 1994 it was an easier way to collectively address the new underdeveloped members however it now sounds a bit anachronistic as the economies of the newer asean members have been pushing up the grouping s overall economic growth and performance in recent years the clmv grouping that puts those four nations in the second tier of asean members is no longer a good fit their integration into the regional bloc has advanced by leaps and bounds truth be told in private these new asean members now insist their countries should be addressed in full and not by the abbreviations employed previously they would like to be perceived as equal partners vietnam has proven beyond any doubt that since joining asean in 1995 it has assimilated well into asean s structure and processes with its 24 years experience as a member state hanoi is now leading the grouping that it once battled by strengthening asean s cohesiveness and speeding up its decision making processes hanoi inspires other new members to emulate its model as the incoming asean chair next year along with its holding a non permanent seat on the un security council 2020 2021 it is demonstrating the country s ambition and diplomatic vision vietnam s proactive asean policy has already put the country in the front row of ties with the west during its first decade in asean vietnam was busy adjusting to the asean way which it quickly got accustomed to and then excelled in these days some jakarta based asean diplomats even talk about the vietnamese way in asean indications emerged in 2010 during vietnam s first chairmanship of asean that hanoi was able to chart the grouping s future ties with dialogue partners on key regional issues including the south china sea disputes vietnam has since pushed asean to be bolder in engaging with external powers an approach that sometimes proved inconvenient for more conservative asean leaders as for economic integration vietnam has become one of most open economies in asean since it undertook economic reforms in 1984 vietnam has signed 17 free trade agreements even though its economic development model is still not classified as a market economy as such its membership in the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership among 10 liberal capitalist economies has given the country a boost in terms of high end free trade agreements vietnam is now aiming high and wants to be a middle income country by the end of 2040 the other new asean members are also integrating well with asean although they struggle with technical areas of integration mainly trade facilitation and harmonising sets of rules and procedures for cambodia laos and myanmar their recent efforts have focused on attracting much needed foreign investment and expanding exports for the time being trade privileges from the united states and the european union have given a boost to the newer asean members economic growth and development these in turn translate into positive impacts on political and social reforms domestically of late threats to withdraw both america s and the eu s preferential trade treatment of cambodia and myanmar due to their violations of human rights have raised concern in 2017 cambodia laos were identified as young tiger economies with an average of 7 5 8 gdp growth according to forecasts by the world bank and the asian development bank cambodia a former war torn country with 16 million people has reaped huge economic windfalls from its membership in asean despite criticism of the current government s governance and its gagging of media freedom cambodia s economic growth figures continue to move up providing added confidence to foreign investors looking for stability cambodia now has one of the most open financial markets in asean as a landlocked country laos has proven itself a special member of asean against all odds laos has transformed itself into a land bridge between two asian giants china and india through regional and global connectivity plans that involve the country of more than 7 million people of late it new leadership team under prime minister thongloun sisoulith has focused on diversifying its reliance on hydroelectric power exports to neighbouring countries mainly thailand at the moment laos is serving as a catalyst for a hub of international linkages criss crossing southeast asia vientiane hopes that by 2030 it will be able to graduate from the list of the world s least developed countries myanmar s integration with asean has been not been easy it joined in 1997 and took over a decade to take full advantage of this by serving as the 2014 chair its transition to political and economic openness starting in 2011 has yielded positive outcomes for the formerly isolated country in southeast asia it has since become a centre of global attraction for foreign investment and tourism due to the internal political quagmire marked by the ongoing rakhine crisis and the difficult peace and national reconciliation process myanmar has had to cope with sporadic violence and clashes with ethnic armies internal insecurity has zapped the country s economic power without a proper resolution its full integration with asean will be delayed beyond 2025 at 52 asean is lucky its members have been implementing key action plans without jeopardising the association s principle of non interference and respect for its consensus based decision making without

the global consequences of u s executive power or how carl schmitt took over the 21st century white house since the nixon era the lure of executive power has increased in the white house after decades of global integration misguided policy decisions legitimized in the name of national security can derail economic prospects in america and worldwide the doctrines share a dark history the first administration to make explicit reference to the unitary executive was the reagan administration typically the practice has evolved since the 1970s when president nixon decoupled u s dollar from the bretton woods gold standard and trade deficits began to rise the terrorist attacks of 9 11 allowed the george w bush administration to make the unitary executive theory a common feature of signing statements particularly in the execution of national security decisions which divided the capitol hill and were opposed by most americans in the case of trump the need for inflated unitary executive power arose with the mueller investigation which restricted the president s strategic maneuverability to operate with the republican congress in 2017 18 but permitted actions that required only executive power typically in tax and trade policy in this view efforts at a u s sino trade compromise may prove more challenging than anticipated as evidenced by the extended truce talks even a trade compromise may prove unlikely to deter subsequent bilateral technology wars which have been heralded by u s actions in the case of huawei and longstanding efforts to sustain american primacy in 5g technologies as u s production capacity has been offshored since the 1980s such efforts rely on national security considerations if the trade war is less about trade than about u s effort at economic and strategic primacy no concession may prove enough to the trump white house which may be more likely to re define the status quo on the basis of a national emergency that would explain recent flirting with 25 tariffs and the renewed trade war with china by the trump administration executive power and the state of exception what looms behind the trump white house in the 21st century is a tradition of conservative thought relying on the unitary executive theory in american constitutional law which deems that the president possesses the power to control the entire executive branch its precursors go back to the darkest 20th century as the controversial german jurist carl schmitt saw it in the interwar third reich legal order ultimately rests upon the decisions of the sovereign who only can meet the needs of an exceptional time and transcend legal order so that order can then be reestablished sovereign is he who decides on the exception in the post weimar germany such ideas contributed to the eclipse of liberal democracy following september 11 2001 similar arguments renewed neoconservative interest in schmitt and the state of exception in this world the status quo is in a permanent state of exception as enemies adversaries others and strangers will unite us against them in this view the u s response to 9 11 was not unusual because liberal wars are exceptional rather it was a manifestation of ever more violent types of war within the very attempt to fight wars which would end war as such similarly it is politically expedient to legitimize a trade war and other political battles in the name of national security which allows the sovereign to redefine a new order on the basis of a state of exception subsequently a new national security strategy redefines friends as enemies and us as victims who are thus justified to seek justice from our adversaries them the logic of the state of exception leaves open the question how the white house could establish such a trade war as a sovereign when such trade wars have not been supported by most trump constituencies and have been opposed by much of the congress and by most americans the lure of imperial presidency historically the idea of the imperial presidency in america is hardly new as historian arthur m schlesinger jr demonstrated in the nixon era the weight of messianic globalism was indeed proving too much for the american constitution in fact the policy of indiscriminate global intervention far from strengthening american security seemed rather to weaken it by involving the united states in remote costly and mysterious wars ostensibly moderate administrations including president obama s have not been exception to the rule as evidenced by multiple decisions to use force without congressional approval during obama s first term in office america expanded its military presence in afghanistan and increased drone missile strikes across pakistan yemen and somalia the administration also deployed the military to combat piracy in the indian ocean engaged in a sustained bombing operation in libya and deployed u s special forces in central africa in these cases president obama decided to use force without congressional approval in the course of the past half a century and a series of asset bubbles a slate of new foreign interventions the iraq war debacle and the 22 trillion u s sovereign debt imperial presidency has become a target of broader criticism but why has it proven grown even harder to challenge certainly one critical force has been campaign finance and the increasing role of big money in american politics in particular the supreme court s 5 4 decision in citizens united v federal election commission which struck down a federal prohibition on independent corporate campaign expenditures paved the way for corporate power to override democratic power in the white house at the same time the ultra rich have begun to play more active part in politics with serious consequences for american democracy as many american political scientists have warned in the new status quo neither 20th century american empire nor 21st century third reich is needed for majestic policy mistakes imperial presidency will do indeed even the sovereign s executive power may suffice emergency powers in time of peace the uses of executive power are likely to go far beyond the current rivalry for artificial intelligence ai as evidenced by president trump s efforts to re define re negotiate or reject major u s trade deals on the basis of national security by the same token foreign investment reviews will be overshadowed by national security considerations as postwar multilateralism has been replaced with unilateralism the white house sees itself in international strategic competition with other great powers particularly russia and china yet old allies including europe and japan are not excluded since u s constitution ensures the president a relatively broad scope of emergency powers that may be exercised in the event of crisis exigency or emergency circumstances other than natural disasters war or near war situations it matters how the white house chooses to apply its definition of a state of exception under the current wide definition it is prudent to expect escalated international trade disputes between the u s and other members of the world trade organization wto even against the wto citing diffuse national security reasons the white house defends its tariffs under the gatt article xxi the so called national security exception there is a big difference between the repercussions of such executive decisions in the postwar era and the early 21st century in the past policy mistakes could penalize u s economy
